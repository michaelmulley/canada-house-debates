</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B>   Mr. Speaker, I 
have the honour to present the first report of the Standing 
Committee on Procedure and House Affairs regarding the membership 
and the associate membership of the committees of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the House gives its consent, I would move concurrence in 
the first report without debate.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I am simply asking the 
House if it gives its consent to the motion presented by the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Government House Leader.  I 
will ask once again.  Is there unanimous consent for the motion 
put forward by the parliamentary secretary? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee:</B>  Mr. Speaker, if you would check the 
record, when I proposed the motion for the disposition of this 
matter without debate the House gave its consent and then I 
proposed it.  If there was no concurrence, then that is another 
issue, but I did propose it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  We had a two step process.  First, I 
asked the House if it gave its consent for the motion to be put 
forward and the House agreed.  Second, I asked if the House 
gave its consent for the motion and that was denied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will hear further motions if there are any. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have an additional motion. 
I ask for unanimous consent to propose the following motion for 
disposition without debate.  If the House gives its consent I 
would move that the following members be added to the list of 
associate members of the Standing Committee on Procedure and 
House Affairs, and a list of some dozens of members is appended. 
I will not read the list. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Does the hon. parliamentary secretary 
have the unanimous consent of the House to move the motion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>BILL C-2—TIME ALLOCATION 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK15"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I rise on a question of privilege arising from the 
motion brought forward by the government House leader in relation 
to Bill C-2.  The government brought forward that notice of 
motion yesterday and we have now dealt with it in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the second parliament in a row where the very first bill 
introduced by the government has been time allocated.  A 
restriction on debate has already been brought forward by the 
minister in a very inappropriate way.  I would like to explain 
what I think should happen in the follow up to this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The use of closure and time allocation under this government has 
reached, I would argue, a disturbing and critical point of 
frequency.  In the last parliament Bill C-2, the CPP legislation, 
the very first bill debated by parliament, was time allocated 
after only a few hours of debate. In this parliament the very 
first bill, the pro forma Bill C-2, again has been time allocated 
after a few hours of debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the same government, the same minister, and I would argue 
the same misuse of authority by using time allocation in this 
extremely unorthodox way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On October 8, 1997, the hon. member for Winnipeg—Transcona 
raised a question of privilege regarding the closing off of 
debate on Bill C-2 in the last parliament.  The member argued 
that our right to adequately debate was increasingly being 
violated by the government's rush to judge how much time was 
needed to debate a particular piece of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Beauchesne's sixth edition, citation 3, outlines some elements 
of the Constitution Act and our system of government which I 
believe are relevant to this very point.  It states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>More tentative are such traditional features as respect for the 
rights of the minority, which precludes a Government from using 
to excess the extensive powers that it has to limit debate or to 
proceed in what the public and the Opposition might interpret as 
unorthodox ways. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Going back to the argument presented on October 8, 1997, by the 
member for Winnipeg—Transcona, he suggested that the Chair 
intervene on behalf of the collective rights of parliamentarians 
to ensure that the traditional features as outlined in the 
citation I just read are upheld. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the Speaker ruled not to intervene at that time, I would 
argue that since then and since we are embarking on the 69th 
record time allocation motion by the government, the moment has 
arrived to declare the measures imposed by the government today 
as excessive and unorthodox as described by citation 3 of 
Beauchesne's. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The case has been made that the Chair possesses no discretionary 
authority to refuse to put a motion of time allocation.  I do not 
agree with this claim.  I will prove, I believe, that the Speaker 
does possess the authority to refuse to accept this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On May 2, 2000, during a discussion of the rule of time 
allocation with the Standing Committee on Procedure and House 
Affairs, the then Clerk of the House of Commons, Robert Marleau, 
responded to a question regarding the Speaker's authority to 
protect the minority in the manner described earlier.  The Clerk 
said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—it exists intrinsically in the role of the Speakership all the 
time—where there could be the tyranny of either side.  It could 
be the tyranny of the majority or the tyranny of the minority. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At a subsequent meeting on May 4, 2000, the Clerk suggested that 
with time allocation the Speaker is less likely to intervene. 
There is a reference to this on page 570 of the <I>House of 
Commons Procedure and Practice</I>.  However, the Clerk stopped 
short of suggesting that the Speaker would never intervene.  He 
used as an extreme example that if the government time allocated 
every bill at every stage the Speaker might intervene, quite 
properly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My interpretation of what the Clerk has said is that there 
exists a limit to what a majority government can do with respect 
to time allocation.  The interpretation is supported by the 
citation I mentioned earlier from Beauchesne's, which states that 
a government is precluded from using to excess the extensive 
powers it has to limit debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Clerk used the extreme example in his response because he 
knows it is not up to the Clerk to establish the limit to this 
unorthodox behaviour.  We know, for example, that the 68 times 
the government has used time allocation apparently was not too 
many times.  How many is enough? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday the government House leader gave notice of his 
intention to move the 69th motion, and now we have a new 
parliament and a new Speaker.  I would argue we are at an 
epiphanal moment here for this new parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest to the Speaker that 69 motions moved 
within seven years for the sole purpose of muzzling the 
opposition on controversial legislation is excessive.  It is 
unorthodox and it should not be tolerated.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On page 369 of Marleau and Montpetit there is a reference to an 
intervention by the Speaker on a time allocation related tactic 
used by the government.  It describes how Speaker Fraser ruled on 
the government tactic of skipping over routine proceedings in 
order to go to orders of the day.  As we are all aware, that 
tactic, if it had been allowed, would secure for the government 
the opportunity to move time allocation at will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While Speaker Fraser had ruled such a motion in order on April 
13, 1987, page 369 references another ruling where the Speaker 
ruled out of order a similar motion only a few months before.  In 
other words, Speaker Fraser used his judgment on each and every 
situation and ruled accordingly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, an activity that might be completely in order 
today would be completely out of order in another set of 
circumstances.  The Speaker has to use his or her judgment in the 
chair to rule these motions appropriate, out of order, 
unorthodox, or in excess.  It is within the power of the Speaker 
to make that ruling and I would appeal again to the Speaker today 
on that basis.   As Speaker Fraser demonstrated, a Speaker can 
intervene and should intervene when a government abuses its power 
and the rules of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rule governing time allocation can be found in Standing 
Order 78.  Standing Order 78 provides for more than one day of 
allocated debate if the government never exercises this option, 
even on time allocation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government, by only allocating the minimum amount of time to 
debate each stage of a controversial bill, prevents the 
opposition from doing its job in the House of Commons.  It 
prevents the opposition from enlisting public support for its 
point of view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The right of an opposition to raise the profile of an issue in 
debate is one of the indispensable principles that make up 
parliamentary law and parliamentary procedure.  These principles 
are described in Beauchesne's sixth edition: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To protect a minority and restrain the improvidence or tyranny of 
a majority; to secure the transaction of public business in an 
orderly manner; to enable every Member to express opinions within 
limits necessary to preserve decorum and prevent an unnecessary 
waste of time; to give abundant opportunity for the consideration 
of every measure, and to prevent any legislative action being 
taken upon sudden impulse. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliament is fundamentally about debate.  It is also about the 
right to dissent in a civilized manner.  Genuine political 
opposition is a necessary attribute of democracy, of tolerance 
and of trust in the ability of citizens to resolve differences by 
peaceful means.  That is why we come here to debate issues.  The 
existence and the tolerance of an opposing point of view are 
essential to the functioning of parliament and to the functioning 
of a modern democracy.  Speaker Fraser put it this way: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is essential to our democratic system that controversial 
issues should be debated at reasonable length so that every 
reasonable opportunity shall be available to hear the arguments, 
pro and con, and that reasonable delaying tactics should be 
permissible to enable opponents of a measure to enlist public 
support for their point of view. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Right Hon. John Diefenbaker, in an address to the Empire 
Club in Toronto in 1949, had this to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If parliament is to be preserved as a living institution, His 
Majesty's Loyal Opposition must fearlessly perform its functions. 
The reading of history proves that freedom always dies when 
criticism ends. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1967 a distinguished parliamentarian, the late Stanley 
Knowles, added this comment to the debate: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I submit, therefore, that you do not have full political 
democracy let alone the economic as well as political democracy 
unless you include a full and unquestioned recognition of the 
rights and functions of the opposition to the government of the 
day.  Only in this way can you protect the rights of minorities. 
Only in this way can you make sure that the force of public 
opinion will be brought to bear on the legislative process. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the reasons an opposition exists is to some day replace 
the government.  The opposition should conduct itself in 
parliament, so as to persuade the people of the country that it could 
be an improvement on the government of the day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our system of government works best when there is a change of 
government at reasonable intervals.  However, if the government 
continues to silence the opposition at every turn, the opposition 
will never be able to use parliamentary debate to persuade the 
people of Canada.  While the rights of the opposition are 
immediately and most visibly at stake here in this debate, 
ultimately the threat is to democratic rights and freedoms 
generally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to make a couple of suggestions to the Chair. 
First, perhaps it is time for the Chair to seriously consider the 
amount of authority and the amount of discretion that is 
available to him while he sits in that important position.  The 
next time a motion to cut off debate is introduced prematurely in 
the House, I would argue it is time for the Speaker to look the 
other way, to not recognize the government House leader, and to 
say it is inappropriate, too early, not right, to stop the debate 
so early in this parliament.

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope you consider that as an option, Mr. Speaker.  If it does 
not happen soon, early in this parliament, we will get set in a 
pattern, as we have already seen, where the very first bill is 
time allocated and where we are restricted in debate on the 
opposition's side.  Again we are unable to do our jobs in 
proposing alternate forms of government to the people of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My second suggestion is that the government should seriously 
consider reforming the House in a meaningful way.  The Prime 
Minister should stop referring to members as voting machines, as 
stone statues doing his bidding in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would argue from this point forward that maybe the best you 
could do for the opposition, Mr. Speaker, is to delay the moving 
of a motion on time allocation, at least to use your discretion 
to delay it for another day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every time the government House leader brings in a motion of 
time allocation, he brings in the minimum amount of debate. He 
closes off debate after one day.  He could give more.  He could 
give two.  He could give three days and limit debate. He could 
allow for an ample discussion.  However he uses the minimum 
amount of debate every time to stifle the opposition and stifle 
debate in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appeal to you in your position in the chair, Mr. Speaker, that 
you have the authority and the support of the House to use your 
discretion to give democracy a greater chance in the House. I 
would urge you to do it from this point forward. 
<P><A NAME="LINK16"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I wish that the Leader of the 
Opposition would listen attentively to what I am about to say.  I 
cannot refer to the presence or absence of anyone, but I really 
hope he listens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am responding to what has been said by the opposition House 
leader.  I know that those who do not want the bill to pass and 
have so indicated wish for me to dispense with what I have to 
say.  Perhaps this is a way of getting themselves out of the 
embarrassing situation in which they have placed themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  Let us put closure on his speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  I think I have just heard the answer to 
what I have alleged and it is definitely in the affirmative.  It 
sounded a lot like a plea of guilt over there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today the opposition is saying that there is a question of 
privilege.  Of course there is no such issue before the House. 
This would be at best a point of order if it were valid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Chair is asked today to rule on the so-called “unorthodox 
behaviour of the government in having used time allocation at 
second reading of a bill on the third day that it is being 
debated in the House of Commons”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Need I remind the House that in the U.K. House, for instance, 
every bill is time allocated to one day by definition at second 
reading, time allocated to around an hour at third reading, and 
now under the new parliamentary reform in the U.K. every bill 
will be time allocated in committee under what is called 
programming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If using time allocation is unorthodox then I say a number of 
parliaments must be unorthodox.  I will give an example of 
another parliament, more particularly the legislative assembly of 
the province of Alberta. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This issue has occurred pursuant to our standing orders.  This 
procedure exists in our standing orders and has existed for some 
time.  Yesterday I gave notice of my intention to move this 
motion today.  Not once was it challenged at the time that the 
notice was provided to the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today the motion was moved, and only after the motion was voted 
on, only after the point became moot, did the hon. member 
actually raise it as an issue.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  So what. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  The hon. member across argues so what, 
so what if the rules are being bypassed this way.  I would like 
to tell the House about the precedence of time allocation.  I ask 
all colleagues to listen attentively to the issue of Bill 19, the 
school amendment act in the province of Alberta where closure was 
used at second reading, at committee and at third reading.  Do 
you know which House leader was doing this, Mr. Speaker? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about the seniors benefit act in the province of Alberta 
where closure was used at second reading and at committee?  This 
procedure has to be correct.  Do you know who used it, Mr. 
Speaker? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about the much despised bill 11 of the province of Alberta? 
Do you know who time allocated that bill at every stage, Mr. 
Speaker?  You would be right in guessing that it is the same 
person, the person who is the leader of the party that is now 
raising this issue in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the province of Alberta closure was used at every stage to 
close down kindergarten in that province.  Do you know who the 
house leader was who used that procedure, Mr. Speaker? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All these things have one element in common.  The person who is 
the Leader of the Opposition today in this House moved those 
motions in 100% of the occasions.  Surely the person across must 
have been democratically minded when he did all that.  Heaven 
forbid that he was anything else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are three things I bring to the attention of the House. 
First, proper notice was given of the use of time allocation. 
Second, it was the third day of debate at second reading on the 
issue.  Third, those today who are saying that time allocation 
should not be used should put a giant mirror in front of 
themselves. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK17"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
add my voice to that of my colleague from the Canadian Alliance. 
I am concerned that the arguments put forth by the government 
House leader relate to behaviours exhibited in the Alberta 
legislature, not here in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debate must be put back in its proper perspective. Let us 
look at what is going on here in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me simply remind the government House leader that, before 
throwing stones in the neighbour's backyard, he should look at 
the figures for the sessions during which he has been in charge 
of the business of this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member is right on target when he stresses the 
importance of the bill before us, in this second day of debate. 
We have had one day of debate, one hour yesterday, in the 
afternoon, and this morning the government is moving time 
allocation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, the first argument to the effect that this is the third day 
of debate is completely inaccurate. In fact, there has been one 
day of debate, one hour at the end of the day yesterday and 
today the decision has been made to move time allocation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is totally unacceptable, because the bill before us more or 
less seeks to restore and review the employment insurance 
program which, in recent years, has aroused very strong 
criticism from people in all regions of Quebec and Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, this bill follows a government commitment dating back 
to the last election campaign. People have a right to know that 
what triggered an extremely important debate in Quebec and a 
commitment by the Prime Minister and most of his big guns in 
Quebec is now being debated in the House of Commons for a few 
hours, because of a gag order.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we are being asked, after a few hours of debate, to put an 
end to the discussions.  The government is in such a rush to get 
its hand officially on the $30 billion belonging to the 
taxpayers— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> That's the real reason. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier:</B> —the government is in such a rush to 
legalize the holdup of the employment insurance fund— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> That's the real problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier:</B> —the government is in such a rush to follow 
up on the commitments it made half-heartedly during the campaign 
that it wants to stop talking about them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In certain cases, those promises have had the effect of 
misleading people in need of employment insurance.  They were 
led to believe that the government would be open to bringing in 
changes to put an end to unfair treatment.  The government 
claimed to be concerned about the unemployed and those with 
major social problems caused by government funding cuts.  This 
is what people were promised during the campaign.  Today, after 
one day of debate—could we say one day plus one hour—the 
government wants to end the discussion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of all of Canada, and particularly the people of 
Quebec, to whom these commitments were made, have a right to 
know that today the government wants to muzzle the members of 
the House of Commons, prevent them from discussing these vital 
matters, prevent them from raising here the many cases in their 
ridings reported to them daily over the past few years by people 
who are suffering because of the government's appetite and 
never-ending desire to pocket money that belongs to someone else. 
That is reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would remind hon. members, and I support my Canadian Alliance 
colleague on this, that the Liberal government has changed, but 
changed for the worse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would point out that, between 1968 and 1972, under the Trudeau 
government—and these figures are meant for you, Mr. Speaker, and 
I hope they will guide you in your ruling—during the 28th 
parliament, the ratio of time allocation motions to the number 
of sitting days was 0.3%. This means that, at the time, for 0.3% 
of sitting days, debate was held under a time allocation motion 
imposed by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last parliament, for 7.7% of sitting days, there was a 
threat to cut off debate, which was held under a time allocation 
motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the sessions under Mr. Trudeau, between 1968 and 1972 and 
between 1974 and 1979, time allocation was imposed in the case 
of 0.9% of the bills introduced, that is 4%.  That is the 
percentage.  In other words, time allocation, as we are facing 
now, was invoked in the case of 4% of the bills introduced under 
the Trudeau government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last parliament, under this government, the figure was 
not 0.9% or 4%.  Of all the bills tabled in this House, 21.6% 
were passed under time allocation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Shameful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier:</B> When my colleague speaks of a threat to 
democracy, when debate on 21% of the bills introduced in this 
House end in time allocation, we are entitled to ask where the 
government is headed with this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ratio of time allocation to bills receiving royal assent was 
1.3% under Trudeau, 6.3% in his third mandate, 16% under the 
Conservative Prime Minister and 11% under Trudeau-Turner at the 
time. 
How many times was time allocation invoked under the Liberals in 
the last session?  We are not talking about 1%, 3% or 6% but 
30%.  Thirty per cent of bills passed by this House were subject 
to time allocation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seriously, how can citizens be expected to respect the work we 
do in the House?  How can they be expected to respect members 
who are fresh from an election campaign and have promised to 
review a bill which has such a negative impact on Quebecers and 
Canadians?

<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can they be expected to take seriously a government that 
promised right and left that it would sort out the employment 
insurance issue and that said it had not done so before the 
election because the Bloc Quebecois had blocked the bill, when 
in fact it was introduced just before the end of the session? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can members of the public be expected to respect a 
government that allows only one day of debate so that it can 
officially get its hands on $30 billion belonging to them?  How 
can we be expected to respect a parliament in which 30% of the 
bills passed were subject to time allocation?  How can we talk 
about democracy when the primary objective of the government 
opposite is to prevent members on this side of the House from 
expressing their views on something as fundamental as employment 
insurance? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I too ask the Chair to keep a critical eye on the government's 
behaviour in the future. It is too late now, because, once 
again, we have just voted.  The government brought in a time 
allocation motion.  We will no longer be able to debate 
employment insurance in the House because after one day the 
government has decided that it has heard enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a disgrace. I am asking the Chair to try to 
remind the government that it is engaged in an extremely 
dangerous exercise, which consists in gradually eliminating what 
is left of the democratic process in parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is not only arrogant because of its strong 
majority, it also no longer tolerates, in a debate like this 
one, the diverging views expressed by the opposition. Electronic 
voting will soon be introduced in the House. Perhaps the whips 
will rise to vote on behalf of members of parliament. We will 
become mere pawns in this place and we will no longer be allowed 
to talk or to vote. We will no longer be able to remind the 
government that it made promises to people and that it is not 
fulfilling them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to tell the government House leader that Quebecers will 
remember that, during the election campaign, the government 
promised to tone down the provisions of the Employment Insurance 
Act. Quebecers will remember that the House leader and his 
government took steps to ensure that the real issues would not be 
debated and solved, and that they have given official sanction 
to their holdup of the employment insurance fund. This is 
unacceptable.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I thought I might assist the Chair by reflecting on some of the 
arguments that have been made so far. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is said that politics makes strange bedfellows.  This is no 
less true of procedural arguments when we find the Alliance House 
leader citing myself, the Bloc House leader citing Pierre 
Trudeau, and finally, even more interestingly, the government 
House leader citing the Leader of the Opposition and seeking 
refuge in the actions of the Leader of the Opposition when he was 
in the Alberta legislature for what the government is doing 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is certainly the strangest of the arguments that we have 
heard, because it may well be the case that the Leader of the 
Opposition had an affinity for closure when he was in the Alberta 
legislature.  When it comes to closure one could say of almost 
all governments that we have all sinned and fallen short of the 
glory of God when it comes to time allocation and closure, 
particularly those who have had the experience of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, two wrongs do not make a right and a hundred wrongs do 
not make a right.  Every introduction of time allocation and 
closure has to be judged on its merits 
That is what we are asking the Chair to do.  There is time 
allocation that comes after lengthy debate and there is time 
allocation that comes after insignificant or insufficient debate. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1125"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT8"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that what we have developed in this parliament, which 
I think is grounds for the frustration we find here today, is a 
tradition of introducing time allocation after insufficient 
debate.  Major measures are introduced in the House but the 
government is very impatient.  It would have been unthinkable at 
one time, as the House leader for the Bloc pointed out, for 
something as significant as this to be time allocated after only 
a day or two of debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Debate is not something to be avoided in this place.  Some may 
have noticed that we have on the wall out there in the NDP part 
of the lobby a quote by the former dean of this House, the member 
for Winnipeg North Centre, Stanley Knowles, who said on December 
10, 1968, probably in a debate about procedural reform or on a 
point of order: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Debate is not a sin, a mistake, an error or something to be put 
up with in parliament.  Debate is the essence of parliament. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the opposition asks is that when we deem it appropriate, we 
be allowed to debate things for a sufficient period of time. What 
we are asking for in this parliament is certainly not a pattern 
of obstruction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the Chair that yesterday a bill of 900 pages in length 
passed this House in one day of debate and went to committee, 
just as the government asked.  So this is not a pattern of the 
opposition saying that the government cannot do its business, 
that we will tie up the house of Commons and nothing is going to 
happen.  That is not what we are talking about here.  We are 
talking about one bill, a very significant bill having to do with 
changes in employment insurance, and various opposition parties 
are saying that they want to debate it a little while longer, 
that they have some concerns they want to put on the table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When another bill, a significant piece of legislation in 
anyone's judgment, Bill C-8, the financial services sector 
legislation or whatever it is called, which is, as I said, 900 
pages long, is debated in this House for one day and sent to 
committee, there is no pattern of obstruction there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe, as I have argued before, that the Chair does have and 
should exercise the power to restrain governments that are time 
allocation happy, shall we say, and this is certainly a 
government that falls into that category. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It makes it all the more ironic that the government House leader 
should cite what happens in Westminster.  Westminster is an 
entirely different situation, but if the government wants to talk 
about Westminster, then let us talk about the power that the 
Speaker has at Westminster when it comes to time allocation.  We 
only got one side of the story from the government House leader. 
I do not think we should get too much into citing Westminster. 
We have our own traditions in this place, but I think we can 
learn from Westminster in the same way that we can learn from 
other parliaments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have our own traditions here.  We had a tradition in the 
House that where there was a desire for lengthy debate on a 
particular bill, that kind of debate was permitted.  That 
tradition has been allowed to erode over several parliaments. 
This government takes it for granted that it has the right to 
exercise its perceived right to bring in time allocation after 
only a day or two of debate and it does not expect to even 
receive any trouble for doing so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, Mr. Speaker, you do have something to consider here. 
Unfortunately, I think the point is well taken that you cannot do 
anything about time allocation on this particular bill because 
the point of privilege was introduced after the vote.  Perhaps it 
should have been introduced before so that you would have had the 
opportunity to rule on this particular time allocation, because 
you really cannot rule on time allocation in general.  You do 
have to rule on time allocation specifically.  This will, I 
think, make it difficult for the Chair in this particular 
circumstance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I have every confidence that we will be here again. 
Perhaps we will be here before a vote is taken or at the moment 
at which a motion for time allocation is introduced, which would 
give the Chair more opportunity to say, depending on the 
circumstances, that it is a motion he is not going to hear at 
that particular time because he does not believe the House has 
been given sufficient time for debate on that particular matter.

<A HREF="#LINKT9"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, it does not surprise me that the government does not 
want to have a great deal of debate on this.  Maybe it does not 
want Canadians to know in any great detail, thanks to the 
speeches by opposition members, just what is in the bill and what 
is not in the bill.  Maybe it is embarrassed by the fact that it 
has been literally robbing the unemployed for years and years to 
pay for its surplus.  It has been on the backs of the unemployed 
and at the expense of the benefits that once would have gone to 
unemployed people that the government has achieved its so-called 
fiscal successes.  Perhaps that is something that it would rather 
not talk about.  In that context, we fully understand the guilt 
that has driven the government to this procedural extreme. 
<P><A NAME="LINK19"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, having listened to all of the participants in this 
particular question of privilege, there is much wisdom in what 
has been said on this side of the House, the opposition side of 
the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The greatest irony of all is that the government House leader 
made many if not all of the same submissions when he was a member 
of the opposition.  I want to refer to a document that was made 
public on January 19, 1993.  It reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians, including those who are elected to serve in 
Parliament, expect the House of Commons not merely to discuss 
openly the problems of the nation, but also to advance solutions. 
They expect the Commons to explore Canada's problems rationally 
and to establish policies for resolving them.  These expectations 
are not being met. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The document further states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result, debate on controversial legislation is usually 
characterized by negativism, unnecessary repetitiveness and even 
destructive oratorical pyrotechnics.  This is the inevitable 
result of depriving Members of the meaningful role for which they 
were elected. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The final quote reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At present, reports to the House and debates are at the whim of 
the Government leading to a lack of coherence and public 
involvement in the discussion of these important issues. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This document, which bears on its cover, the distinguished name 
of the government House leader, was entitled “Reviving 
Parliamentary Democracy:  The Liberal Plan for House of Commons 
and Electoral Reform”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The words of the government House leader have completely 
reversed his position of not so many years ago.  Obviously there 
was a time in his life when he had greater respect for democracy 
and for this institution, which Canadians are looking to at this 
critical time to become relevant, an institution that would allow 
all members of parliament to take part in meaningful debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To suggest that the bill that is now before the House is not 
important enough to extend by a few hours the debate that is to 
take place, is ludicrous.  It is insulting to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation, which the government now diminishes by 
bringing in time allocation, was important enough to dangle in 
front of the electorate just prior to the election call.  Let the 
record show that the bill, had it been so important then, could 
have passed through the House of Commons before the election. 
There was significant support for that legislation.  There still 
is support for the legislation with some possible changes that 
might take place at committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The excessive use of time allocation, which members on the 
opposition side find tremendously offensive, is again something 
that the government House leader used to rail against while in 
opposition.  He has gone to great lengths to point out what other 
members and, in particular, the Alliance leader did while he was 
a house leader in the provincial legislature.  It struck me that 
he was almost jealous that the Alliance House leader had taken 
the use of time allocation to a new level that he has not yet 
achieved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Using time allocation 69 times obviously indicates that the 
government House leader is a bit trigger happy.  He has done this 
at the earliest possible opportunity on this important 
legislation.   My colleague from Winnipeg—Transcona said that 
100 wrongs do not make a right but certainly 69 wrongs do not 
make a right. 
We should look at each and every case on its merits and on its 
individual aspects when it comes to the legislation itself.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would urge you, Mr. Speaker, to take the following question 
into consideration in your learned deliberations of the issue. 
What is the rush in this particular instance?  What is the 
presiding urgency of getting this issue through the House at 
breakneck speed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl:</B>  They don't have a committee to send it 
to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  The opposition House leader makes a very 
valid point.  The committee, which would receive this particular 
bill, has not even been comprised.  It is absolutely perverse 
that we would rush the bill through so that it would be held in 
abeyance.  It would be nebulously floating out there somewhere in 
never-never land waiting for the committee to be comprised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we have to look at all the factual circumstances here. 
The government House leader has jumped the gun.  He has brought 
in time allocation, and I will not use a vulgar analogy about why 
dogs do certain things to themselves, but he is doing it simply 
because he can.  It makes one wonder if in fact the time that he 
spent in opposition has left him with some deep psychological 
sense of insecurity or maybe he spent a lot of time hanging 
around in a gym locker when he was a kid because he is bullying 
the House of Commons.  That is what is happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In simple terms, the government House leader is taking advantage 
of the rules because he can.  There is no need whatsoever for the 
government House leader to bring in time allocation on this bill 
and in many other instances where he has exercised that 
discretion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I do not want to prolong this.  I understand that 
you will consider the arguments that have been presented.  I 
believe that it was quoted by the Bloc House leader that 30% of 
the bills that we have seen passed over the past seven years have 
been time allocated.  I would suggest that the percentage is an 
outrageous proportion when one considers that the importance of 
these bills are discussed in this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The role of each and every individual in the Chamber is to have 
an opportunity to stand up and debate legislation.  If we want 
Canadians to have faith in this institution and in the relevance 
of parliament, we must be able to debate intelligently and to 
make suggestions, not just to take a wrecking ball approach but 
to put forward thoughtful suggestions and thoughtful input into 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a pre-emptive strike by the government to bring in time 
allocation on the bill when there is ample time to discuss it. 
There is obviously no urgency for the government to have the bill 
passed through the House in this instance. 
<P><A NAME="LINK20"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I have listened attentively, as 
all of you have, to this question of privilege raised by the 
member for Fraser Valley, and subsequently followed by the 
government House leader, the hon. member for Roberval, the member 
for Winnipeg—Transcona, and finally the member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough.  I know you would all recognize 
that in each instance those members who spoke were all House 
leaders of our respective five political parties in this 37th 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the issue has been made quite clear through the 
interventions of the various points of view, the arguments and 
the suggestions put forward to the Chair for deliberation.  I 
would suggest that unless members have some new element to bring 
to the attention of the House, I would like to take this 
matter under advisement at this time.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the reason this issue was 
brought up today was that we were caught in a catch 22 in the 
last parliament.  We asked to raise the issue of time allocation 
when the government had given notice of motion to bring it 
forward.  The Chair ruled that we could not raise it at that time 
because the government had not followed through on its intention. 
In other words, we were told to wait until the motion was 
introduced and voted on and then we could deal with it.  However, 
once it had been voted on, the House had expressed its opinion 
and therefore the Chair could not rule on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason the issue has been raised today in this manner is so 
the Speaker will be able to get his head around it for the next 
time.  I know this was ruled on today, but you can understand the 
dilemma that we in the opposition end up in.  A motion is put 
forward by the government but we are not allowed to speculate on 
anticipated actions of the government, therefore the Chair will 
not receive concerns about time allocation because the government 
has not moved it.  Once it has moved it, it is too late. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, this issue is for the next time.  This whole 
discussion today is about asking the Speaker to use his 
discretion for the next time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The Chair has tried to demonstrate 
some patience and some generosity with regard to the 
interventions.  I do recognize the seriousness of this question 
of privilege.  The fact that we are so early into this new 
parliament, and for all the reasons and those mentioned 
previously, I will take this matter under advisement. 
<P><A NAME="LINK21"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I just want to say that freedom of speech is a very 
important thing in the House and debate on serious issues such as 
this should not be cut off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I totally disagree with the government House leader who said 
that this is not a point of privilege.  We are not just talking 
about freedom of speech, we are talking about the freedom to 
speak, and there is a big difference.  Not only is the freedom to 
speak very important in this House, but it is something that was 
fought for and won at great cost over hundreds of years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have talked about the Westminster precedents.  It was over 
there that these battles were fought and won for the right to 
speak.  This debate should not be cut off.  The government should 
listen to every member of this House who wants to speak to a 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had closure today, and we all know the debate has been 
around that, but the closure has meant the denial of the right to 
speak.  When we lose that we might as well all just go right back 
home because it means nothing if we cannot speak in this House 
where our privileges are protected, and they are protected by 
you, Mr. Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, you are not the chairman of the House, you are the 
Speaker of the House, which means that you speak for the members 
as they argue against the government.  I am sure you are aware of 
the historical record of how the Speaker had to fight to speak 
on behalf of the ordinary members and stand up against the 
government.  It may have been the crown and the monarch in days 
gone past, but now we have the government sitting right in the 
House.  It is your job to stand up for the members against the 
government.  We may have government members sitting in the House 
but it is the government that tried to deny members the right to 
speak.  That cannot be denied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make one final point.  We had this debate about a year 
ago.  It was last March I believe when the government was 
consistently moving to orders of the day in order to bypass 
routine proceedings.  I believe our House leader referred to that 
point when Speaker Fraser ruled that we could not move to orders 
of the day.  Last year when we challenged the government's right, 
it withdrew the motion to move to orders of the day.

the House, that you have an obligation to stand on our behalf and 
say that we have a right to speak and the government has a right 
and an obligation to listen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  As I stated earlier, the question of 
privilege before the House is a very serious matter.  I have 
ruled that I will take this matter under advisement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there are other points of order the Chair will receive them, 
but the question of privilege is under advisement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon Benoit:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
In his presentation the Conservative House leader read from a 
document which had been prepared by the government House leader 
back in 1993.  I would ask that document be tabled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  That document could be tabled by 
consent.  Is there consent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>EMPLOYMENT INSURANCE ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK23">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from February 12 consideration of the motion 
that Bill C-2, an act to amend the Employment Insurance Act and 
the Employment Insurance (Fishing) Regulations, be read the 
second time and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK24"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I will continue my remarks from yesterday evening. 
It is important that all Canadians acknowledge and realize that 
this system pertains nationwide.  It is not limited or directed 
to any one region of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problems that exist in the system currently could very much 
be improved if the government took the time to listen to seasonal 
workers and to its own employees who handle EI problems in places 
such as the maritimes.  They have suggested on more than one 
occasion that one method of improving the system and improving 
the method of determining EI benefits over a pay period would be 
to have it scrapped and replaced with a system of declaring hours 
worked on a weekly basis.  If people do not work during a certain 
week they do not declare the particular week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is obvious that the EI system has major inadequacies that are 
placing Canadians who need help into tremendous debt.  I have 
written personally to the current minister and the previous 
minister on a number of occasions, and I have not had the 
pleasure of a response, sadly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of undeclared earnings, I wrote the HRDC minister 
over two years ago but have not received a response.  Even then 
public concern over the inequity was growing.  I have 
subsequently written again and the minister has not responded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Conservative Party is generally supportive of Bill C-2, but 
our support is conditional on the bill going before the committee 
so there will be further analysis and hopefully the opportunity 
to put forward amendments and changes, if necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are supportive to the extent that the bill will remove the 
existing intensity clause and will be committed to fixing the 
so-called repeater's rule which made it virtually impossible for 
a woman to receive employment insurance if she left a job to have 
a second child.  However the Conservative Party does not support 
the government's refusal to deal with artificially high EI 
premium rates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would welcome the opportunity at committee to enact some of 
the changes we proposed and put forward during the recent federal 
election.  Those included support for the continuation of an 
independent employment insurance commission and its role in 
recommending sustainable EI premiums. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current legislation would give cabinet the power to set 
premiums for 2002 and 2003, which actually gives the government a 
further year to study the premium setting.  This was the case 
with the previous Bill C-44. 
The thought of having this provision removed from the independent 
body and handed to the cabinet and the finance minister is 
unacceptable.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other groups, such as the Canadian Restaurant and Foodservices 
Association, have spoken out against the move.  The Conservative 
Party supports the CRFA and its opposition to the Liberals' 
approach, which is seen as very paternalistic and a manoeuvre 
that would create more problems than it would address. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also committed as a party to the investigation, with the 
employment insurance commission, of a proposal that would move 
toward the establishment of an individual EI account and an EI 
rebate program that would enable workers to roll a portion of 
their EI contributions into an RRSP upon retirement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no reason why EI rates are so high.  At the end of last 
year the EI account had a cumulative surplus of over $35 billion. 
The $2.25 employee premium rate will drive the cumulative EI 
surplus above the $40 billion mark by the end of 2001. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The recent auditor general's report blasts the government for 
the way in which it has handled the account.  The auditor general 
rightly points out that the EI surplus is well over twice the 
maximum amount that the chief actuary of HRDC considers 
sufficient as a reserve for the account.  This is because of the 
unnecessarily high premiums that the government refuses to 
significantly reduce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As seasonal workers in Atlantic Canada and across the nation 
suffer from the Liberal cash grab, it becomes very frustrating 
for a member of parliament who represents an area with many 
seasonal workers and high unemployment, such as Guysborough. 
There is great frustration among those workers and employers when 
premiums should and could be reduced to the $1.90 mark from the 
current level of $2.25. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is ample opportunity for the government to correct the 
inadequacies in the bill.  We look forward to the opportunity at 
committee to bring forward amendments that would improve the 
legislation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK25"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to enter the debate on employment insurance 
revisions.  Before I do that, I want to make a few comments about 
the unconscionable action of the government in invoking time 
allocation today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It used to be that governments invoked closure, which basically 
said that the House did not adjourn until the debate collapsed. 
Those were days when the House would sit right through the night 
and debate continuously until there were no members left to 
speak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Time allocation is even worse than that because it does not even 
allow members to stay until midnight or two or four in the 
morning to speak.  It says that at 6.15 p.m. today we are done. I 
think it is unconscionable of the government to say that we may 
not even express our views after a certain point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very fortunate that I am designated now to give a 10 minute 
speech, so I am able to express my views.  What about all the 
other members who want to speak on behalf of their constituents 
on this very important bill?  They literally are not allowed to 
do so because of the government's action in passing the motion a 
few minutes ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, it is very sad that all the members on that side 
automatically vote for a bill such as this one, when on this side 
we would very happily vote against time allocation or closure. 
However, on that side a sudden transformation seems to take 
place.  They somehow deposit their brains at the door and become 
stone statues.  They no longer use their own heads.  They just do 
as they are told. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know a certain degree of respectability is required in 
parliament.  We sometimes need to submit to each other.  A 
husband and wife do not get along unless they do that.  We have a 
certain degree of that in the House.  However, it has to be wrong 
when members blindly follow orders with which they do not agree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very surprised that Liberal members do not have the 
fortitude to stand on their own and say what they will do.  We 
will probably see the same thing tonight when members will all 
vote against their own election platform of 1993.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliament is being eroded.  I am beginning to think that 
perhaps my colleague from the previous parliament, Lee Morrison, 
had it right when he said that this place really was a waste of 
time because of all the restrictions and controls put on it by 
the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I regret that Canadians did not see through this and that 
Ontarians, because of all the misinformation, were once again 
persuaded to elect Liberal candidates instead of voting for what 
is right: a parliament that actually works on behalf of 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to actually use my time I will say a few things about 
Bill C-2, the amendments to the Employment Insurance Act.  A 
number of issues are very important to Canadians, and one of the 
most important is that the rules should be the same for everyone 
across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know one can say that in areas of high employment it is tough 
to get a job, and that EI benefits in such areas should therefore 
be increased or extended.  That is a reality.  However, right now 
there is a problem of greater magnitude on the prairies with 
respect to farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we lose our job we lose our income.  Without income we 
cannot provide for our families.  We have great sympathy for 
people who lose their jobs or who are in seasonal work.  However, 
there are also farmers in seasonal work who have now lost their 
income because of the inaction of this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Input costs for farmers exceed what they are able to get for the 
sale of their products.  Consequently their incomes have gone to 
zero or negative.  Is there any help from the government for 
farmers?  Not that we can see.  Big, heady announcements have 
been made but nothing has been delivered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we get are farmers having to pay their accountants $500 or 
$600 to do the bookwork to determine whether they are eligible. 
When farmers do submit their applications they get back $5 or $10 
because that is all they qualify for, and a bill from their 
accountant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is absolutely absurd that the government cannot solve a 
problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government recently gave out $1.3 billion in energy rebate 
cheques to Canadians, 90% of whom probably did not pay heating 
bills.  The government says that the rebate was meant to 
compensate Canadians with high heating costs.  However, the 
government has totally mismanaged it.  It is really a $1.3 
billion boondoggle in the sense that the rebates went to people 
completely off the target.  The government totally missed the 
mark. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Employment Insurance Act also has a problem in reaching its 
target.  Frankly, if someone loses his or her job it does not 
matter whether 10 or 100 of his or her neighbours have lost their 
job.  It is a very personal thing.  The person is saying that he 
or she has lost his or her job and income.  It should not matter 
whether they live in Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Prince 
Edward Island, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick or Newfoundland, if 
people pay into EI and lose their job they should receive 
benefits until they get another job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We use the word insurance, so let us talk about insurance.  What 
if my house burned down and my insurance company said that 
because not too many houses burned down in my area this year it 
would not pay me?  Insurance companies do not base their 
decisions on that.  If there is an area where a lot of houses are 
being destroyed by fire they will probably look at it and see 
what they can do in the area of prevention.  This is another area 
in which the government has totally dropped the ball. 
To get people off unemployment they have to have jobs.  Has the 
government done anything other than make big announcements, 
especially during an election campaign, about some teeny-weeny 
tax cuts, instead of some substantial tax cuts and policies that 
would encourage businesses not only to stay here but to establish 
here and to create new employment?  No, it has not.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The unemployment rate is now going up and our economy is in the 
doldrums.  Why?  It is because of the total failure of the 
government to provide policies that would make our country 
excessively strong in the world economy.  We are hangers on with 
a weak dollar.  That is the only thing that seems to be an 
advantage for Canadians right now because all of us are being 
asked to take a 30% cut in our earnings in order to sell our 
products around the world.  That is helping but what a price we 
are paying for that.  It is not a long term solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a lot of things wrong with the EI bill.  One of the 
other things that comes to my mind is the total unfairness of the 
employment insurance rate structure.  I know the rates have 
gingerly come down and the Liberals will crow about this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The surplus in the EI fund is $25 billion, now possibly $30 
billion in terms of the actuarial value.  The present act says 
that the chief actuary should give advice.  At the present time 
the surplus in the EI fund is double what it needs to be, yet the 
government keeps collecting huge amounts of money from employers 
and employees.  In fact, it is collecting 40% more from employers 
than from employees.  No wonder these people do not have any 
money to invest and to hire more people.  That is the crux of the 
matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does this bill do?  It takes away the actuarial requirement 
and simply gives the rate setting structure as a new power to the 
minister.  No wonder we are upset about this bill.  No wonder we 
want to talk about it and change it.  I wish the government would 
be willing to do that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK26"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Murray Calder (Dufferin—Peel—Wellington—Grey, 
Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to speak 
on this very important piece of legislation.  This bill 
illustrates once again the progressive agenda of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agenda was set with foresight in the beginning and has been 
followed consistently ever since.  This is an agenda that was 
vindicated by Canadians in the last election.  The critics of the 
government claim that the contents of Bill C-2 represent 
backtracking on the reforms introduced in 1996.  Nothing could be 
further from the truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If members will recall, it was generally agreed during the early 
days of this government that the unemployment insurance scheme 
had to be replaced.  Everybody agreed to that.  After much 
consultation with Canadians and despite the outraged cries of the 
opposition, the government brought in a program to replace the 
old regime with the employment insurance program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new plan was designed to be sustainable, to be fair, to 
encourage work, to reduce dependency on benefits and to assist 
those in need and help workers get back to work and stay at work. 
These goals are being achieved by the employment insurance 
program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The program was implemented with the knowledge that being new it 
would not necessarily be perfect.  We knew that time would show 
up areas requiring improvement.  The legislation allowed for a 
period of continuous monitoring and assessment of the program to 
measure its impact on people, communities and the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not the first time adjustments to the EI regime have 
proven necessary.  The government acted quickly in 1997 to launch 
the small weeks pilot project in order to correct a disincentive 
for some people to work weeks with low incomes.  Our studies and 
discussions with Canadians have shown us that while many parts of 
the EI program are working well, there are some provisions that 
have proven ineffective or in some cases, punitive, particularly 
toward seasonal workers. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1205"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT17"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT17"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1205

<A HREF="#LINKT16"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have always had and always will have seasonal industries in 
Canada.  These industries are in fact vital to our economic 
well-being.  Because these industries by definition employ people 
for only part of the year, we must ensure that our economic and 
social programs include these workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While EI aims at helping all unemployed workers, we also have to 
recognize that some groups, such as seasonal workers, have 
particular needs and that the program does indeed have special 
features built in to benefit seasonal workers.  The hours based 
system, for example, takes into account the fact that seasonal 
work often includes long hours of work over a short number of 
weeks.  As a farmer I can attest to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have mentioned, one of the intentions of the EI program is 
to reduce dependence on benefits by all Canadian workers, 
including of course seasonal workers.  The so-called intensity 
rule was therefore introduced to discourage the repeat use of EI 
benefits by reducing the benefit rate of frequent claimants. It 
was designed to encourage people to take work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we have gone through a period of unprecedented economic 
growth and not all Canadians have benefited equally.  Seasonal 
workers tend to be among those whose fortunes have not improved 
in step with the overall economy.  Some regions still experience 
double digit unemployment rates.  This is reflected in our 
monitoring and assessment reports.  They indicate that the 
proportion of benefits paid out to frequent claimants has 
remained stable at around 40% since the introduction of the 
intensity rule. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The unavoidable fact is that many seasonal workers may have 
little choice but to resort to EI benefits.  There simply may not 
be enough job opportunities available to them in the off season. 
In other words, what was intended as a disincentive to rely on 
benefits has become a punitive measure where there are few 
alternatives available.  That is why Bill C-2 proposes the 
removal of the intensity rule. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Meanwhile, to provide a real solution to workers in these 
circumstances, the EI program retains one of its most important 
provisions, the active measures under part II, the employment 
benefit support measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Using these instruments, the government will continue to work 
with the provinces and the territories and at the local level to 
develop long term solutions that will diversify local economies 
and make them self-supporting in providing jobs.  The long term 
solutions require a concerted effort by all levels of government, 
businesses, community leaders and other Canadians to develop 
effective measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need measures to ensure that the necessary education and 
training opportunities are there for the workers in the seasonal 
industries.  We need measures to promote economic diversity in 
communities that rely on seasonal work.  We need measures to 
build the capacity of communities to become economically 
self-sustaining.  The government continues and will continue to 
work in partnership with all Canadians to ensure that these 
measures are developed and put in place.  That is our commitment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the meantime, we should not forget that the new EI system 
introduced in 1996 and subsequently improved remains effective, 
equitable and responsible.  The hours based eligibility system 
provides access to benefits to people who were not previously 
covered, including some seasonal workers and part time workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first dollar coverage introduced by EI has removed the 
incentive for employers to limit part time work in order to avoid 
paying premiums.  The changes contemplated in Bill C-2 will 
improve the plan even further, helping to ensure fairness and to 
serve the interests of Canadians in the labour market.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The EI reforms of 1996 represented the most fundamental 
restructuring of the unemployment insurance scheme in 25 years. 
While debating the proposed areas of adjustment, we should bear 
in mind that the core elements of EI are being maintained because 
they work.  I want to stress that.  Why throw something out when 
we know it works.  That does not mean that the program is fixed 
in amber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government will continue to monitor and assess employment 
insurance and make changes if it becomes apparent.  It is just 
being flexible and that is what the government has always been 
all about.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, this is my first opportunity to rise in the House since 
the House resumed sitting.  I would like to congratulate you on 
your position and certainly the other Speakers.  I also would 
like to thank the people back home who worked so hard to send me 
back here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suppose that is what we are talking about, the people who 
worked so hard to send us to represent them in the House of 
Commons, yet we are now debating Bill C-2 under the restraints of 
closure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before the motion on closure was brought in on the bill this 
morning, another motion was brought to us, as members of 
parliament, to accept a committee report without debate.  We find 
that wrong.  It does not give us the proper opportunity to 
represent our constituents' wishes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People who believe in us have worked hard to send us here. They 
support our beliefs and principles.  We are all here for that 
reason.  However, we may have different ideas and philosophies on 
how those things should be done.  They support what we believe in 
and they send us here to project and support their beliefs and 
our beliefs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is with a great deal of distress that we continue to have the 
motions of closure.  This is the 69th time since 1993 that the 
government has used closure.  It is wrong because it limits the 
opportunity of members of parliament, duly elected to represent 
their constituents, to voice their opinions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Fraser Valley, the House leader for the 
opposition, in his question of privilege really brought a lot of 
these points to bear.  We need to change things in the House 
somewhat so we can better reflect the concerns of the people who 
elected us.  To a certain degree, the actions of closure really 
put us in a position of not being able to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After we complete debate Bill C-2 in the House today, it will go 
to committee when the committees are struck.  I think Canadians 
need to know that the committees are all weighted in favour of 
the government as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding the report that was tabled this morning from a 
committee, the government used its majority on that committee to 
defeat a motion that would have allowed committee members to 
elect a chairman of the committee by secret ballot.  It is a 
small thing but it would mean a great deal to put some 
credibility at the committee level.  However, it was voted down 
by the government's majority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we finish with the bill at this stage, it will go to 
committee.  Will the government allow meaningful debate at the 
committee level?  Will it take meaningful suggestions? Will it 
allow amendments?  Will it just use its power again as majority 
at the committee level to override anything that comes through? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen it before.  I sat through the committee 
process on the discussions of the Canadian Environmental 
Protection Act.  There were many amendments and hours and hours 
of meetings.  In the end the government brought in its members 
who were used as voting machines.  They were completely unaware 
of what the issues were.  They were completely unaware of the 
debate that had taken place.  They were completely unaware of the 
amendments that they would be voting on.  They were nodded at 
when it was time for them to stand and vote.  That is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People who are making these decisions should at least be aware 
of the issues.  To see members whipped into line, to come to 
committee and vote on a policy that they have no idea about is 
wrong.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to these issues of closure, parliamentary reform, 
the whole idea of committee involvement, and bringing back some 
responsibility to us as members of the House of Commons, it is 
not only our party, the official opposition, that is pushing 
them.  It is everyone.  People in all roles, on the front bench, 
on the back bench and on the government side, have passed 
comments on our ineffectiveness as parliamentarians, on how our 
ability to cause change has been eroded.  It is not a single 
party issue but an issue for all parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Leader of the Opposition has stated that Canadians are 
justly proud of our heritage of responsible government, but our 
parliamentary democracy is not all that it should be.  Too much 
power is exercised by the Prime Minister instead of being shared 
by our elected representatives.  That really gets to the crux of 
the matter.  An excess of party discipline stifles open 
discussion and debate, and grassroots citizens and community 
groups feel that their opinions are not being respected or heard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That gets to the real point of the discussion today.  What we 
are hearing from our constituents is not coming up through us and 
getting to the House because debate is being limited and 
committees are being structured in such a way that meaningful 
change cannot happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Toronto—Danforth, a member for whom I have a lot 
of respect, hosted an event in Toronto last year to support 
farmers from across the country.  I respect him for doing that. 
To do that in downtown Toronto and to have it come off as such a 
success was a good thing.  It brought some attention to the issue 
at hand.  Not much change has happened since then, but I 
appreciate what he did there.  He has stated that parliament does 
not work, that it is broken, that it is like a car motor that is 
working on two cylinders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us fire up the rest of those cylinders.  Let us make this 
parliament work effectively and strongly.  Let us put all the 
horsepower behind it that we can.  Let us give ourselves as 
members of parliament the right and the ability to voice our 
opinions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal member for Lac-Saint-Louis, formerly a Quebec 
cabinet minister, is another person I sat with on the environment 
committee and is somebody for whom I have a great deal of 
respect.  He stated that being on the backbench they are typecast 
as if they are all stupid and are just supposed to be voting 
machines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recent statements made by the Prime Minister while in China 
indicate that this is how he feels about his own backbenchers, 
never mind other members of the House.  He feels that they are 
voting machines, that they will stand and be counted whenever he 
tells them to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Progressive Conservative Party members have not been left out of 
this.  They put forward in their last election platform that we 
must reassert the power of the individual member of parliament to 
effectively represent the interests of constituents and play a 
meaningful role in the development of public policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to bring back into the House and into the hands of the 
democratically elected members of parliament the ability to 
effect policy.  We cannot leave it entirely in the hands of 
bureaucrats.  I know the bureaucrats have a function, but 
certainly their function should be to support what members of 
parliament want and what they are putting forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP House leader has been a champion of parliamentary 
reform.  He takes every opportunity to bring up the subject and 
have it debated.  Even today, in response to the question of 
privilege by the official opposition House leader, he again 
brought up point after point with regard to what needs to be done 
to bring back some power to MPs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is a quote from the front row, from the finance minister. 
He finished a statement by saying that MPs must have the 
opportunity to truly represent both their conscience and their 
constituents.   I like that statement because it pretty much 
comes out of one of the policies and principles of this party, 
which is that we vote as our constituents wish and we vote our 
conscience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The idea that we cannot do that is hard for people to believe. 
Let us look at the alienation in parts of the country where 
people feel they are not being brought into the mix, into the 
debate.  They feel powerless.  There are simple things that could 
be done to bring back the feeling people need to have, which is 
that they are part of the process and when they cast their votes 
it means something.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that the number of people voting in federal elections 
in Canada is dropping is a crime in itself.  Why are people not 
engaged in the debate?  Why do they not feel that their votes 
count for something?  We have seen in the United States how much 
every vote does count.  I think it is a fact that Canadians feel 
that whatever the average guy on the street says or wants does 
not make any difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would anyone elected to serve their constituents not back 
changes to make the House more relevant?  We need free votes in 
the House of Commons.  As members of parliament, we must have the 
ability to vote as our constituents wish us to.  I wish I had 
more time to speak.  There are so many things we could do, but 
when we are debating Bill C-2, amendments to the Employment 
Insurance Act, under a motion for closure, it just emphasizes 
what is wrong with our system. 
<P><A NAME="LINK28"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I very much appreciate the time to talk about these very 
important EI changes before us today and about the certainly very 
concrete steps that the Government of Canada, this side of the 
House, is proposing in this very important area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I do, I want to somewhat address the crocodile tears we 
hear from the members opposite when it comes to closure or time 
allocation.  Especially galling, I think, are the reformed 
Alliance people.  It was not so long ago that the Leader of the 
Opposition was a member of the Alberta cabinet and the Alberta 
government.  When the government sat, which is, as we know, very 
rare in Alberta, he brought in time allocation and closure on all 
kinds of measures, including the restricting of seniors, the 
shutting down of kindergartens, and of course the infamous bill 
11.  So this is really hard to take, from the people opposite 
especially, who say one thing and propose to do quite another. If 
anyone is the king of closure when it comes to those matters, it 
is the Leader of the Opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, that is typical.  I listened intently to the member who 
spoke before me.  I recall that in 1993 and again in 1997 a 
Reform Party member of parliament took a poll of his constituents 
on gun control.  Guess what he found out?  He found out that his 
constituents actually liked what the Government of Canada was 
proposing on gun control.  Did he vote accordingly?  No, of 
course he did not, so again it was “say one thing and do 
another”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on:  Stornoway; the use of cars; the member for 
Edmonton North, her pension and the pigs on the lawn; the member 
for Medicine Hat and his pension; paying Jim Hart $50,000 to give 
up his seat.  I could go on about the $800,000.  Oh, we are so 
fiscally responsible, says he, yet he is so willing to spend 
$800,000 when it comes to taxpayers' money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It becomes a little galling after a while to have to listen to 
those reformed Alliance people opposite who are so good in their 
overzealous way of saying one thing and doing another.  The 
holier-than-thous rise up in unison, it would appear, to try to 
condemn a government that actually is operating in the best 
interests of all Canadians, is doing the right thing when it 
comes to EI reforms and is adjusting accordingly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why?  Having done what we did in terms of the EI adjustments and 
having listened to the people—which is actually what good 
government should do and then readjust accordingly—readjusting 
is exactly what we are doing with Bill C-2 today.  We are moving 
expeditiously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are we doing this?  We are doing it because we need to make 
the adjustments necessary and do so in a retroactive way that 
will enable the workers and those who will benefit as a result of 
the changes we are proposing to benefit in a manner consistent 
with the values of this great country.  That is precisely what we 
are doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It becomes crystal clear, then, at least to me and the members 
on this side of the House, that fundamental elements of the 
reform package such as the hours based system and the first 
dollar coverage are working well.  However, there are some 
elements that need adjustment and fine tuning to ensure 
effectiveness and fairness in the system.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the past number of years since this government took office 
after the Tories opposite, who left this country bankrupt and in 
a mess, we have known that because of good governance, fiscal 
prudence and wise decisions we have brought back prosperity to 
Canada.  In fact, with regard to unemployment we are now 
nationally at 6.8%.  All I can say is that this is enormously 
good news for Canada and for all Canadians.  It is the lowest 
level in a quarter of a century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, as we know, there are still pockets across this great 
country where unemployment remains in double digits.  Those are 
the areas we need to address, because after all, we want all 
Canadians to share in this new prosperity, and when those who are 
not sharing in it need help, it is the Canadian way to assist 
people who require that assistance.  I am thinking, for example, 
of forestry workers on the west coast.  I am thinking about 
construction workers in Ontario and fishers in the maritime 
provinces.  These hardworking Canadians often struggle, but they 
are the backbone of their communities and, by extension, they are 
the backbone of Canada.  These are the people we are reaching out 
to help.  That is precisely what I believe Canadians expect us to 
do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to act swiftly and we are doing that today.  We have had 
hours of debate.  We have had a number of days on this.  It is 
now time to act and move on.  That is why time allocation is here 
today.  We want to proceed, and we want to proceed with 
expedition to ensure that the few elements of our reforms that 
need to be adjusted will be adjusted, such as the intensity rule 
and the clawback provision.  In doing that, the program needs to 
respond, then, to the realities facing countless communities 
across Canada that depend on seasonal industries.  Many offer 
limited options for working off season.  In these many 
communities, I am afraid that the intensity rule has proved 
ineffective in reducing dependency and is viewed as simply 
punitive.  That is why we are doing what we are doing today to 
correct that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members may know, a person's EI benefit rate is reduced by 
one percentage point for every 20 weeks of regular or fishing 
benefits he or she has collected in the previous five years. 
Depending on the numbers of weeks of benefits paid in previous 
years, a person's benefit rate would drop from the usual 55% to 
54%, then to 53%, and down eventually, as we know, to 50%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our goal is simple.  It is to reduce reliance on EI, but—and 
this is a big but—our analysis that we have done in this 
all-important area shows that in practice the rule does not 
curtail frequent EI use, particularly in areas where there are 
few job opportunities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, there is growing concern that the intensity rule acts 
only as a penalty.  That is unacceptable, so we want to eliminate 
that rule, and effective and actually retroactive to October 1, 
2000, we propose, then, that the basic benefit rate be restored 
to 55% for everyone.  I think that is a good move.  Certainly my 
constituents in Waterloo—Wellington agree with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This does not mean that we will accept the high unemployment 
found in these regions.  EI is only part of the solution. 
Certainly we should think about it and think about it hard and 
long.  There is a growing need for everyone, governments, 
businesses, communities and individual Canadians, to work in 
partnership to stimulate local economies and make the economy 
work for everyone, especially people who might not otherwise get 
the chance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to work together, then, to create sustainable employment 
opportunities for everyone.  For example, I want to point out 
that the Atlantic investment partnership is a $700 million 
initiative aimed at helping Atlantic Canada generate jobs and 
growth in the new economy.  I remember with dismay when people 
from the reformed Alliance made the kinds of comments they did 
about Atlantic Canadians.  What was it again?  They called them 
lazy and indolent.  What an insult.  I want to point out right 
here and now what an insult that was, not only to Atlantic 
Canadians but to all Canadians.  That is how those people 
opposite think.  They think in those biased, stereotyped terms.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thank goodness that we on the government side do not think like 
those people with a dinosaur, Jurassic Park mentality, but let us 
move on to the positive.  The positive is quite simply what our 
government is doing to ensure that we help people no matter where 
they are:  east, west, north or south.  We are ensuring that they 
get on with the business at hand and that they have good economic 
bases for themselves and their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will borrow a line from Gilbert Dumont, president of the local 
Charlevoix committee on EI.  He said that we must find permanent 
solutions to employment in our regions.  He is absolutely 
correct. We on the government side are trying to ensure that is 
precisely what happens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why our government is forging strong partnerships with 
businesses and communities to create new opportunities that 
reward work and people in that sense.  We need to provide more 
Canadians with the tools and opportunities they need to support 
their families and earn a good living. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, employment insurance is a tremendously important 
social program for Canadians.  It is well regarded and well 
respected.  From time to time we have to fine tune it to ensure 
that it works effectively and efficiently, but it is a program 
that Canadians cherish.  We on the government side will continue 
to ensure that it is in place for all Canadians wherever they 
live in our great country.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mario Laframboise (Argenteuil—Papineau—Mirabel, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, we are all here in this House to represent the people 
in our respective ridings.  I am sure my problems in this House 
are far from over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout the entire election campaign triggered by the Prime 
Minister, I have heard colleagues admit openly that a mistake 
had been made with the Employment Insurance Act.  The reform of 
1996 was a mistake for all the workers of Canada, the workers of 
Quebec in particular.  This reform has only given the government 
the opportunity to make profit at the expense of the workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A while ago, I heard a member across the way telling us this was 
a social program.  Employment insurance is not a social program, 
it is insurance, one paid into every week by workers from their 
paycheques, in order to be covered if they run into difficulty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the campaign, we saw this government exhibit a flagrant 
lack of humanity.  With the holidays close at hand, the leader 
of the Bloc Quebecois wrote to the leaders of all the other 
parties asking that the House sit December 19 in order to try to 
settle the employment insurance problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That lack of humanity became evident when the only leader to 
refuse to come to the House to discuss the employment insurance 
problem was the leader of the Liberal Party. 
Since we would have come to this House to settle one single 
question, we would have had time to debate and resolve this 
issue of employment insurance that is so important to all Quebecers and 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government, through the leader of the Liberal Party, refused 
to take part in this important debate sought by the leader of 
the Bloc Quebecois. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The position of the Bloc Quebecois on employment insurance has 
remained unchanged.  The debate must be held in two parts, so 
that the pressing discussions on the applicability of the program may 
be held and a decision on the use of the $32 billion surplus 
amassed by the Government of Canada on the backs of workers may 
then be reached. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What will the government do with this surplus, which is growing 
by $6 billion a year? 
Bill C-2 promises a return to workers of no more than 8% of the 
surplus accumulated annually. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So there is a big problem.  The government has again refused to 
listen to the Bloc Quebecois and to split this debate and this 
bill so we may debate a separate bill dealing only with the 
$32 billion surplus and have another bill that would deal only 
with pressing matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My riding of Argenteuil—Papineau—Mirabel faces significant 
employment problems.  Over the summer, the rate of unemployment 
was around 8% to 8.5%.  With the arrival of winter, the rate 
goes up.  At the moment, the rate of unemployment is around 14%.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Employment is primarily in forestry, agriculture and tourism. 
Obviously, with the announcement of large investments in Mirabel 
for the foreign trade zone, major industry is making an 
appearance in our riding.  This, by the way, is the work of the 
government of Quebec, through its finance minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No federal money was invested in the foreign trade zone.  These 
are all tax credits and investment credits from the Government 
of Quebec.  Once again the federal government has done nothing. 
But let us get back to the topic at hand, the EI bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members have understood that the major amendments sought by the 
Bloc Quebecois are still relevant and deserve more attention 
than the limited speaking time we are getting today, because the 
government has decided to shut down debate.  We are still left 
with the infamous waiting period.  Bill C-2 still contains the 
two week waiting period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People in the street call this a penalty.  Workers are made to 
wait two weeks.  This is a penalty.  Everywhere we go, people 
tell us they have to wait out their two-week penalty.  With a 
$32 billion surplus in the fund, is it not time to reconsider 
this waiting period, this penalty applied to workers when the 
fund in fact belongs to them? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is there not some way for associations of workers in Quebec and 
in Canada to sit down around a table and say “Listen, now that 
there is a surplus in the fund, it is time to reconsider this 
waiting period, this penalty applied to workers”? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday there was a major fire in my riding that left some 
forty employees all but out in the street with only employment 
insurance to turn to.  They will have to wait out the two-week 
penalty period because their place of work went up in flames 
yesterday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unbelievable in a modern society, with surpluses of 
$32 billion in the employment insurance fund, that workers who 
are out of work because their plant burned down would be 
penalized and have to wait two weeks. It is high time we 
review this two week waiting period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why will the government not do so? For the simple reason that 
this two week waiting period will allow it to increase its 
surpluses in the employment insurance fund. We were protected 
until today. The $32 billion remained in the government's virtual 
surpluses. That money was not touched. Now, with Bill C-2, the 
government will appropriate the $32 billion from the employment 
insurance fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will be able to use the money saved because of this two week 
waiting period imposed on Quebec and Canadian workers, who work 
hard to earn a living. The government will be able to take that 
money and invest it in businesses. Members should look at what has been 
going on in recent months with investments in the Prime 
Minister's riding. The workers' money will be used to reward 
friends of the Liberal Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This situation is unacceptable. It must 
stop. Workers in Quebec and Canada must finally be allowed to 
take advantage of employment insurance surpluses that belong to 
them. 
These workers need a true program that reflects their needs in 
our modern society, as the Prime Minister says. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time Canadian and particularly Quebec workers have access 
to that money and have a program that reflects their needs, so 
that they can finally benefit, in difficult times, from a true 
insurance program that they have funded themselves. No one in 
the House should ever again say that this is a social program. 
It is not a social program. It is insurance that belongs to 
the workers in Quebec and Canada.

the Queen's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is my 
pleasure today to say a few words on the debate amending the 
Employment Insurance Act.  I have listened intently to colleagues 
from both sides of the House and their serious discussion and 
comments pertaining to what is a very important issue for most 
members of the House of Commons.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I represent a very rural riding on the south coast of 
Newfoundland and Labrador where people through no fault of 
their own find themselves working seasonally.  As someone said to 
me not too long ago, it is not the workers that are seasonal.  It 
is the nature of the business they work in that is seasonal, 
whether it is forestry, logging or the construction industry, 
which is dictated by the abilities of government to fund road 
construction or climatic conditions such as winter conditions 
that prevent construction from taking place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my area of the country it has been dictated by the 
mismanagement of fish stocks around our coast.  People who once 
worked for 12 months a year now find themselves working for much 
reduced periods of time.  The length of employment the people I 
represent now enjoy has been decided in large measure by actions 
of successive federal governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We brought our resources into Confederation.  The Government of 
Canada was supposed to be the custodian of our resources for our 
people.  We have found that the situation has not quite worked 
out, for we find ourselves in some very difficult circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people who I represent along the south coast of 
Newfoundland and Labrador always worked for 12 months a year. 
They did not know what vacations were.  Our fish resources were 
so abundant that our people harvested and brought the fish to 
shore where our plant workers processed the fish in the 
processing plants. Then there was a collapse in our groundfish 
industry and as a consequence the duration of employment was 
significantly reduced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I travel around the coast it is quite sad to see what has 
happened to very proud people who knew nothing other than 12 
months of work and through no fault of their own now work in a 
very seasonal industry, the fishery of Newfoundland and Labrador. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill was introduced last fall. Debate had begun.  Then we 
went into a general election.  Obviously Canadians gave the 
government a very clear mandate to proceed in the direction we 
were going in, which is the direction we are continuing today. 
That is why we reintroduced the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The changes in the bill will certainly improve our ability to 
address the original goals of employment insurance reform that 
were introduced before the election.  One very important 
amendment we see coming forward today is the elimination of the 
intensity rule. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have met on many occasions with representatives of fisheries 
unions, logging unions and construction workers all along the 
coast of Newfoundland and Labrador.  One thing they can never 
understand, and I never understood it as well, is how the 
intensity rule ever got passed into law.  We have been penalizing 
people through no fault of their own because they happen to live 
in regions of the country where they are unable to find full time 
employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The intensity rule has penalized them each time they were laid 
off and went to reopen an EI claim.  The dreaded intensity rule 
reduced their employment insurance benefits by 1%.  They went from 
55% down to 51%, where most of them are right now.  If it had 
continued they would have bottomed out at 50%.  They would never 
have gone back up to the 55% benefit rate if these amendments 
had not been introduced in the House.  I strongly support the 
elimination of the intensity rule because it has penalized people 
in all regions who could least afford such penalization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What really was ironic and brought it home to me was that the 
Government of Canada was the custodian of our fish resources from 
coast to coast to coast.  We make decisions about how much fish 
we can catch and the technologies that can be used in harvesting 
fish.  All management decisions about fish resources are made by 
the Government of Canada, and successive federal governments have 
mismanaged our fish resources. 
That is why our groundfish stocks collapsed and our people were 
put out of work.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>How ironic it was to see the very people who were put out of 
work because of government mismanagement and a decline in fish 
stocks being penalized each time they re-opened an EI claim, and 
through no fault of their own, by the government that was 
supposed to be managing those resources on their behalf. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am absolutely delighted today to see that we are going to 
eliminate the intensity rule and re-establish the benefit rate to 
55%.  Those of us who have followed EI reform for the last six or 
seven years know full well that not too long ago the benefit rate 
was much higher than 55%.  Even with re-establishing it at 55%, 
people are still receiving significantly less in EI benefits than 
they were five or six years ago and are still bringing home far 
less through no fault of their own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, I am very pleased that we are going to see the removal 
of the benefit repayment clawback.  It will be raised to $48,750. 
This is very important as well to a lot of people because at the 
$39,000 cap many people were clawed back when they filed their 
income tax return.  Raising that cap is a very good move. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other encouraging thing is that the measure will apply to the 
2000 taxation year and those people who are filing income tax 
returns about now will benefit for that year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Representing a very rural riding in Newfoundland and Labrador, I 
am very pleased as well to see that there will be an adjustment 
to the fishing regulations pertaining to special benefits to 
ensure that self-employed fishers can take advantage of the 
recently improved maternity, parental and sickness benefits. 
Again, this measure will be effective retroactive to December 
31, 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These amendments are very positive and are amendments that I 
strongly support.  I lobbied and worked hard within the Atlantic 
Liberal caucus and the national caucus to bring about those 
changes because I believed they were needed.  It has been a key 
undertaking of mine to bring about changes.  Even though the 
government, back in 1996, said it would monitor, assess and 
evaluate the employment insurance reforms that were brought in, 
and we had done that, I felt that three or four of those measures 
were very necessary to make the system fair.  Those measures 
included taking away the penalties that were being imposed on 
people who were involved in seasonal work through no fault of 
their own.  I am delighted that we are making those amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, and realizing that my time is about up, I just 
want to say that even with those changes and amendments, there 
are other areas of the Employment Insurance Act that, in my view, 
still need to reviewed, such as changes to the divisor factor and 
some other things.  We are making some very important changes 
with those amendments, but other important amendments and changes 
are needed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK31"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am happy to take part in the debate today.  The member 
who just spoke talked about the need for seasonal workers to be 
covered.  I note that in Bill C-2 there has been a longstanding 
problem where farmers, for example, who work off the farm have 
always had to pay into the employment insurance fund but have 
never been able to qualify. That is seasonal work too. It should 
be one way or the other.  If they cannot qualify, they should not 
have to pay into it.  That is a needed reform that has bugged me 
and a lot of people in agriculture for a long time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ask why it is so important today to rush the bill 
through the House by using time allocation.  This is a leftover 
from the last parliament.  In fact, it probably was created as a 
result of the Liberals losing a number of seats in the Atlantic 
provinces in 1997. 
I think the member who just spoke would agree with that.  He is 
one who moved over to the Liberal Party as a result 
of those changes, so it was politically motivated I suspect.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that if the bill was so important when it was 
introduced last year, why did the government not see it through 
at that time?  The question of how important it was did not seemed to 
deter the Prime Minister when he called an early election after 
only three and a half years.  It was left to die on the order paper 
along with a number of other bills that the government had as its 
priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why was parliament not continued on at that time and allowed to 
have the 
kind of debate we needed to properly debate this bill?  No, we had 
to have time allocation again today.  I have been in the House 
since 1993 and I think it is the 69th time that the Liberal 
government has used time allocation on these types of bills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The part that bothers me more than anything is this: what is so heavy 
on the government's agenda that it would force us to move this 
quickly on Bill C-2?  There is a total of eight bills that have 
been introduced so far, hardly a heavy legislative agenda from my 
point of view.  It is the first bill that was introduced by the 
Liberals this session and they are using time allocation to ram 
it through parliament.  What kind of signal are they sending to 
the Canadian public? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did they call an election so early?  Why did they not have 
it as a priority to continue on and resolve this last fall, 
instead of having to go to an election which caused the House to 
be dissolved?  In fact, they were not in that much of a hurry to 
come back in January.  If it was that important why did they not 
call the House back in January to get right at it?  No, they did 
not do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we have this ludicrous situation where the Liberals have now 
exceeded Brian Mulroney's terrible record in terms of time 
allocation on bills.  I noticed that they managed to be very 
critical of that when they were on the other side of the House, 
They said it was an affront to democracy.  The Liberals have 
passed Mr. Mulroney's record in roughly the same amount of time. 
They are going to continue to use that as a club in the House of 
Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not the first time it has affected me, either.  On 
October 20, 1999, I spoke about time allocation and how it 
affected my ability and other members' ability to speak on the 
one of the bills in the industry category, Bill C-6, the privacy 
bill.  I had just been appointed the industry critic for our 
party.  I have the <I>Hansard</I> here.  It was another bill the 
Liberals seem to have been in trouble with.  They had not 
consulted the provinces to any great length.  The Senate had to 
bail them out in terms of a lot of amendments that came through 
to pick up the bill and make it better.  I give the Senate 
credit for doing that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday Senator Grafstein was very critical of the House of 
Commons for running bills through this place without proper 
debate and proper consideration, in a hurried manner, and 
therefore leaving the Senate to clean them up.  I suggest that 
this is one of those kinds of bills.  Why the hurry?  Why can 
we not have the proper debate in the House?  It does not make any 
sense.  This is the place to debate.  I know a lot of our members 
would like to speak on it and are not being allowed to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an old tactic.  I was restricted in October 1999.  I 
said at the time that it was the 65th time they had used time 
allocation.  We are now up to 69.  The clock is ticking.  I am 
not sure why the Liberals have to do this, but they seem like 
they want to poke the finger in the eye of those people who want 
proper debate in the House of Commons.  It does not make any 
sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the Canada employment insurance program.  The government 
seems to think that it can put in a program that can substitute 
for a job.  That is wrong.  Thirty years ago it was an insurance 
program and the government has moved it away from being that.  We 
would like to make changes to that and have the employers and the 
employees administer this program.  However, that is not the 
case.  In fact, I read in my notes that in Bill C-2 the Liberals 
even want to change some of the aspect of consultation and advice 
provided by the Employment Insurance Commission.  Its advisory capacity 
is 
being taken away. 
It seems like the Liberals want to control this.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government had a $35 billion surplus in the EI fund.  The 
people who watch this said that we probably need $10 billion to 
$15 billion to be prudent.  The fund is roughly $20 billion over 
those amounts.  What is the government doing with the fund?  It 
goes into general revenue and gives the Liberals a chance to play 
with the hard-earned money which has been taken off the 
paycheques of employees.  It also affects employers as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians would be far better served if that amount were lowered 
to a prudent calculation, roughly $10 billion to $15 billion, 
stop the payroll taxes on hardworking Canadians.  The finance 
minister said that in 1994.  When he needed more money to play 
with, suddenly it was not a payroll tax anymore.  That is really 
what it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people would argue that the government has balanced its 
books on the backs of employees and employers who contribute to 
the fund.  There is some justification for that and it needs to 
be reviewed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no substitute in Canada for real employment.  The 
employment insurance program that the government has been 
tinkering with will not do it.  It has to get the fundamentals 
right and get taxes down, including payroll taxes, personal taxes 
and corporate taxes.  We see the United States moving in that 
direction.  Canada has not caught up from the last round in terms 
of corporate and personal income tax.  We are at a real 
disadvantage.  Our employers and companies are at a real 
disadvantage if we compare them to those in the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Twenty years ago the productivity of Canada and the United 
States was almost exactly the same.  What has happened in twenty 
years?  The United States is still number one in terms of 
productivity.  Where is Canada today?  Canada is ranked 13th in 
the industrial world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is no coincidence that these things have happened.  They have 
happened because of thirty years of mismanagement by the 
government across the way, a big interventionist government and 
growing government programs, programs which were financed with 
deficit financing.  Increasing deficits require payments to pay 
off the interest on the huge national debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is faced with a 30 year decline in our dollar.  We have a 
30 year decline in direct foreign investment in Canada.  Even 
Canadians are looking outside our country for a place to invest 
because they cannot get the kind of return on investments they 
need.  The EI fund is one of the funds responsible for this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Up until 30 years ago, when Canada made those changes, Canadian 
and American unemployment rates could be charted.  They were 
basically the same year in and year out, in good times or bad. 
Canada had a divergence in that 30 year period and we are roughly 
3% to 4% higher than the United States all the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There need to be reforms.  There needs to be proper debate in 
the House.  I am very concerned that the government is moving so 
early in this new parliament to cut off debate on such very 
important issues.  It should be chastized for doing that and 
should not follow that course of action in the future.  Members 
across the way should be ashamed to support that kind of 
government intervention.

all, I would like to thank my fellow citizens of Manicouagan for 
showing their confidence in the Bloc Quebecois for the third 
time in a row. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Personally, this is my second mandate, and they almost tripled 
my majority.  What a vote of confidence, and I thank them for 
that.  The local press described my win as a landslide victory, 
since I obtained 54% of the votes, compared to the 28.5%—or to be 
generous 29%—of my closest opponent, a Liberal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I am, of course, pleased to rise to speak on Bill C-2, an 
act to amend the Employment Insurance Act and the Employment 
Insurance (Fishing) Regulations. 
This is a debate that goes back to the January 1997 reform of 
the employment insurance program.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That reform was supposed to have been in response to the expectations 
of the public and the realities of the labour market. 
Predictably, it has had the opposite effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-2 comes nowhere near responding to the expectations of the 
unemployed and of the workers.  With it, the government is only 
providing a very incomplete correction to the problems caused by 
its past reforms.  It is not addressing the real problems, and 
the amendments proposed are highly inadequate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, the matter of eligibility has not yet been 
settled. 
What the government is doing with its employment insurance bill 
is simply legalizing the diversion of $30 billion from the 
employment insurance fund.  This money clearly belongs to the 
workers, the unemployed and the employers who have contributed 
to employment insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Legalizing this diversion of $30 billion is as if the government 
took $100 from a worker's pocket and then gave him only $8 back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Taking the surplus in the employment insurance fund, which came 
from the pockets of workers, without their permission fits the 
dictionary definition of theft.  This morning I checked the 
<I>Petit Robert</I> for the French definition of <I>voler</I>, and it 
translates stealing as taking something that does not belong 
to us.  This is disgraceful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Denis Coderre: </B>Oh, oh, bad language. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Order, please.  I would ask the hon. member 
to be a little more judicious in the choice of his words.  I do 
not want to contradict the definition given by one dictionary or 
another, but there are certain expressions that are never 
appropriate to the fine traditions of this parliament, including 
the word “theft”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Fournier:</B> Mr. Speaker, once again, I did not say 
it. It was in the dictionary, but I will of course respect your 
recommendation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was saying that it is shameful to see the government taking 
money from society's most disadvantaged, men and women who have 
lost their jobs, who are vulnerable and who sometimes have no 
means to defend themselves.  It is all the more shameful to see 
the government boasting in the throne speech that it is 
ensuring all children are protected from poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Worse yet, in another paragraph, there is the following: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a time when losing a job also meant immediate loss of 
income for workers and their families. And so Canadians created 
employment insurance. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government is ignoring the demands by social groups 
opposing the legalization of this misappropriation of $38 
billion dollars from employment insurance, which is now $30 
billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly, employment insurance has become a payroll tax.  The 
government is refusing to give the unemployed and workers what 
is coming to them and continuing to accumulate surpluses on 
their backs.  It has no concern for their welfare, and they are 
left behind by this employment insurance reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The measures in 
this bill will not solve the problems caused by the system, 
including those of seasonal workers in the regions, especially 
young people, women and all workers in general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois opposes Bill C-2 in its present form. 
The Bloc Quebecois is proposing a favourable and constructive 
approach, because it feels that it is essential to respond as 
quickly as possible to the real needs of unemployed workers. 
This is why it is calling for two bills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first bill would deal with urgent needs. 
This is what the Bloc Quebecois would propose: abolition of the 
intensity rule, of course; abolition of the discriminatory 
practice of taxing back the benefits of frequent claimants; an 
increase in insurable earnings from 55% to 60%, so that 
unemployed workers could have a decent income; abolition of the 
clause that discriminates against new entrants in the workforce, 
especially young people and women; and, finally, abolition of 
the waiting period.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second bill would concentrate on long term amendments to be 
discussed in committee, such as the creation of an independent 
EI fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before the election was called in the fall, the government 
introduced the same bill, giving the Liberals full control over 
the EI fund.  At the end of 1999, the surplus in the EI fund 
stood at approximately $30 billion.  Since 1994-95, the Liberals 
have helped themselves to more than $38 billion in this fund. 
Hence the importance of creating an independent fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill does not meet the essential demands of the Bloc 
Quebecois.  The government does not go far enough to improve the 
system and put a stop to the discriminatory criteria.  The 
government broke its election promises when Bill C-44 was 
introduced before the election campaign.  People said that 
bill did not go far enough. 
During the election campaign, the Prime Minister himself 
admitted that his government had made mistakes. He said “It is 
true that we made major mistakes in that bill”. The Secretary of 
State for Amateur Sport personally pledged to make changes to 
the Employment Insurance Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, on November 9, 2000, the daily <I>Le Soleil</I> reported 
that the secretary of state had said that “Following the 
election of a majority Liberal government we will restore the 
process and ensure that the changes are appropriate and that 
they adequately reflect the realities and needs of the people of 
the Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean region and of all Quebecers and 
Canadians. I am committed to making changes to the act and we 
will make changes”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Secretary of State for Amateur Sport came to my riding 
because workers from the FTQ, the steelworkers union, and the CSN 
had planned a protest. 
He came to ask them not to protest, because he would personally 
make sure that changes would be made. This is a disgrace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where is the Secretary of State for Amateur Sport and what is he 
doing? Absolutely nothing at this point. We do not hear him and 
we did not hear him during the debate on this bill. Now that the 
election has been held, we find ourselves with the same bill as 
before and the issue is still not settled. This attitude is 
unacceptable. We can no longer hope that politicians will be 
taken seriously when they display the attitude I just described. 
This is no longer what we call democracy. It is misleading the 
public. People expect more than mere election promises. They 
expect significant and concrete corrective measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the current plan, higher income earners, for example those 
engaged in seasonal work, particularly in the construction 
sector, have to pay money back when they file their income tax 
returns, if they have earned more under the 
employment insurance reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the past five or six years, employment insurance has been 
the single most important factor influencing poverty in Quebec 
and in Canada. As I said earlier, the government claims to want 
to protect poor children. If there are children living in 
poverty, it is because there are parents living in poverty. The 
government has not done anything to reduce poverty in this 
country. Therefore, the Bloc Quebecois will oppose Bill C-2.

disappointing.  I came here some seven and a half years ago, 
perhaps overly idealistic about what parliament was all about, 
how it worked and how I could serve my country and be part of the 
institution that makes laws and governs and guides the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly after seven years I think most of us, not only on this 
side of the House but a good number on the other side, share the 
opinion expressed by my former colleague, Lee Morrison, who 
served in the House for seven years.  In a very blunt article 
yesterday or the day before in the <I>National Post</I>, he 
expressed total disillusionment and extreme disappointment with 
the relevancy of the House Commons and how it works. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not discount any of the accusations or comments he made, 
and I think many of my colleagues would agree with them.  Perhaps 
those of us who are here live in the eternal hope that something 
might change somewhere along the line and we might actually have 
some reform in this place to make it relevant and give us some 
real input and influence in the way things happen.  I think that 
would be a huge step forward.  However, after the government's 
actions this morning I would not hold my breath.  In spite of 
what seems to be a desire on all sides for change, it does not 
seem likely to happen.  It could, however, happen easily. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were accusations from a member of the other place that the 
quality of legislation being passed in this place was failing or 
dropping.  I am sure the comments made by the member of the other 
place were self-serving and meant to justify the Senate's very 
existence, to some degree.  On the other hand, there is probably 
some truth in what he said because over the last seven years this 
government has continually moved to consolidate power in the 
hands of the very few at the centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The quality of legislation would be better if there were any hope 
that when a bill entered this place and went through the process, 
it would emerge amended and improved.  If so, some of the flaws 
that could show up down the road, pointed out no doubt by the 
courts, could be corrected before the bill was finished. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the government seems to have the attitude that once it 
introduces a bill it will lose face if an opposition or committee 
member amends a fundamental part of it.  The government feels 
that would be a loss of face, and it just cannot allow that to 
happen.  The government therefore uses its majority in the House 
and on committees at every stage, and the bill proceeds through 
as a matter of principle and of saving face rather than out of a 
real concern to produce the best possible bill at the end of the 
process.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no reason why the very drafting of the bill or the 
amendment could not be given to the all party parliamentary 
committees for input from all parties involved from the very 
beginning.  Perhaps we could lessen the degree of ownership by 
the government in the bill.  Everybody could have somewhat of a 
stake in the content of the bill, perhaps would be better able to 
support it, and feel that they are actually having some input and 
making some changes to the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am disappointed.  It seems it just goes on and nothing ever 
changes.  In spite of an express desire for change across the 
country, it does not change and I do not expect it ever will 
change to any great degree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-2 is an effort to amend the Employment Insurance Act. The 
intention of the bill is truly misguided.  We went down this road 
many years ago. I think we were making some progress in reform of 
employment insurance, which used to be unemployment insurance. 
Incentives were provided for people to find employment rather 
than incentives to remain unemployed.  The bill seems to be 
returning to those times, especially in economically depressed 
regions of the country, when the EI program, or the UI program as 
it used to be known, was an incentive not to work rather than an 
incentive to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard some discussion earlier in the House about whether or 
not EI had become a social program rather than an insurance 
program.  Clearly this is a move back toward becoming a social 
program and away from becoming an insurance program.  I think 
that is supported simply by the fact that all kinds of sections 
or parts of the EI program are inarguably social programs.  I am 
thinking of maternity and parental leave, which has recently 
become a much larger part of the employment insurance program. It 
is clearly a social program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We moved away from that some years back in that employment 
insurance became harder and harder to obtain.  One had to fulfil 
certain obligations to remain and to receive employment insurance 
wherever one lived.  This is a move back toward seasonal 
employment coverage where people in economically depressed areas 
with seasonal employment went on the program.  They seemed to be 
able to stay on the program for an extended period of time 
without actually having to show that they were actively job 
searching, without having to produce a number of job searches per 
week.  In my view that is a social program because it tides 
workers over from a season of employment to an unemployment 
season and back to employment.  That to me is not an insurance 
program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another kind of perverse incentive that seems to be inherent is 
that the ease of getting into the program and receiving 
employment insurance seems to go up the higher unemployment is in 
the area.  The more depressed the area is, the easier it is to 
get employment insurance.  That does not seem to be very 
productive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Communities and industries in my part of Canada are crying out 
in huge numbers for workers and simply cannot get them.  I get a 
dozen requests a week from companies applying to the foreign 
workers union to bring workers into Canada because they cannot 
find local people to work at the jobs.  Yet we have this program 
that pays seasonal workers in parts of Canada to remain 
unemployed and remain where they are rather than provide some 
incentive to move to a part of Canada like my part of Canada 
where there is a need for those workers and where they could be 
gainfully employed.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a lot of other elements of the program that need 
amending.  We need to change and go back to what was 
started some five or six years ago by this government.  I hope 
the government will listen to some suggestions from the 
opposition and other members in committee so we might make this a 
better bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to address Bill C-2 today and to give the bill my 
qualified support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not to say that I support the government's draconian 
tactics of shutting down the debate using closure.  Use of 
closure once again shows that the government has a disregard for 
the central role of debate in the House and in committees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I feel compelled to support the baby steps that the bill 
takes to reverse the massive damage that the same government did 
to our unemployment insurance system, I do so reluctantly.  I do 
so because I know it is better for the people in Dartmouth to 
have a little improvement than none at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, I also feel compelled to point out the basic 
flaws in the current system which the bill fails to even 
contemplate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-2 fails to deal with the fundamental contradictions of 
our national employment strategy.  We have Canada employment 
centres in almost every community in Canada actively promoting 
self-employment as a way to deal with an increasingly 
transitional labour force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time these same Canada employment centres administer 
an insurance program for unemployed Canadians that is 
specifically designed to deny all self-employed workers the same 
benefits their neighbours enjoy if they find themselves 
unemployed.  This is madness.  Why should someone become more 
economically vulnerable because they followed the government's 
advice to move into self-employment?   Why should they put their 
families at risk because the government has decided that the best 
way to manage our labour market is to cut people off EI benefits? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ottawa has been saving billions of dollars through denying 
people the right to adequate employment protection in the event 
of unemployment.  The calculation of the amount of money lost to 
my community alone has been at least $20 million per year simply 
because of the restrictions this government has put in place.  It 
has limited the amount of payouts claimants can receive and has 
reduced the number of persons eligible for benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I reluctantly support the bill because some of these 
restrictions are being removed and my community needs the money, 
but the bill does nothing to address the fundamental problems 
with our employment insurance system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does nothing, for example, to address the fact that artists 
are currently unable to qualify for employment insurance.  Our 
government considers artists self-employed, a fact that many 
would dearly love to change, and they are therefore denied maternity 
benefits and sickness benefits under EI.  They are also denied 
the ability to participate in the Canada pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the government honestly believe that artists or others who 
are self-employed never have children, never get sick or never develop 
a disability?  It is a tribute to our artists that they have been 
willing to make such a sacrifice for their art, but surely it is 
not a necessary part of our public policy or, if it is, I want 
the government to stand in this place and say so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have no serious industrial plan to allow for the smooth 
transition for workers who lose their jobs in a certain 
occupation to go into another related occupation.  Instead, they 
are told to become entrepreneurs, ineligible for EI, and it is 
often an unsuitable match for both. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think of the situation of the more than 100 workers who are 
being laid off at the Dartmouth marine slips.  These workers have 
worked for years repairing ships.  They have exhausted their 
reduced EI benefits and are now facing welfare.  They want to 
work in the supply bases for the Sable gas fields.  While they 
are receiving co-operation from the local HRDC office, it is 
clear that there is nothing in our employment insurance system 
which connects the dots that they see so clearly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One dot is an industry closing.  Another dot is a related 
industry opening in the same area.   Why can we not just move 
these workers to the new industry and give their families some 
security? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, this is not something our system allows for. 
Instead we have a government basking in over $30 billion of 
employment insurance surplus while still leaving thousands of 
workers, even after Bill C-2, with no benefits.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even worse is the insistence by large corporations and the 
official opposition that the action they would like to see is not 
giving unemployed people adequate benefits for which they have 
already paid or not extending the program to others who need it. 
Instead they call for slashing the costs to companies for EI 
premiums while maintaining our currently restrictive system. More 
money for businesses and less for the unemployed is the business 
agenda of this social program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the government will start to use our employment insurance 
system to address the problems of working families.  It is time 
that the government begins to address the obstacles facing the 
unemployed, artists, Canadians with disabilities, and thousands 
of Canadians who find themselves between jobs through no fault of 
their own and need the assistance from a fair and equitable 
employment insurance program.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Marcel Gagnon (Champlain, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, during the 
recent election campaign, there was so much talk of amending the 
Employment Insurance Act that I thought that a bill would be 
introduced as early as possible in this parliament and that 
there would also be an early opportunity for the House to debate 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no denying that the government members spoke about it 
everywhere.  The Liberals tried to win votes with this bill and 
I think that they succeeded in doing so with their promise to 
amend the legislation to make it fairer and more acceptable to 
workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister himself admitted that some mistakes had been 
made in the Employment Insurance Act and he promised to do 
something about them.  My colleagues mentioned that other 
ministers had visited the various regions in Quebec and said the 
same thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does this mean that there really are two different tunes: the 
one during the election campaign cleverly designed to bring in 
votes, and the other when the rubber hits the road?  In this 
parliament, where decisions are made that affect the lives of 
all Canadians and Quebecers, the Liberals have decided that what 
they said during the election campaign no longer holds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that many voters in my riding did not believe the 
promises they were hearing.  But they hoped.  I am thinking of 
the La Tuque area in Haute-Mauricie.  It is a tourist region. It 
depends on forestry.  Employment there is naturally fairly 
seasonal. 
These people deserve help. That is not the proper word, because 
they are helping themselves.  My colleague for 
Argenteuil—Papineau—Mirabel has just told us that employment 
insurance is not a social measure, but insurance we pay as 
workers, provided we are in insurable jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of paying into insurance is to have protection when 
needed.  We are always at our most vulnerable when we need the 
protection of insurance.  It is always when we are in 
difficulty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding, there are workers whose plant has closed down for 
a time, but they are hoping to get their jobs back.  A paper 
plant has closed temporarily.  When are they going to get their 
jobs back?  There is talk of a two week penalty period, of 
punishing people who are absolutely not at fault.  This 
insurance is a worker's right.  It is not the property of the 
government.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to get called to order like one of my colleagues 
for using words that are apparently not to be used in the House. 
You have already pointed that out to one of my colleagues.  I 
will not say that it is robbery, although I will  think so. 
However, I shall not say so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has a fund containing some $32 billion to $38 billion 
paid into it by workers and employers.  I have been a worker and 
an employer.  When, as an employer, I hire someone, the benefits 
I give in terms of employment insurance, the part the employer 
pays, is deducted from his pay.  It comes out of his hourly 
wage.  So, in fact, employment insurance is paid for 100% by the 
workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the government decides to take that, to go off with it, to 
put it in a common fund, in the  pot, and at the same time 
decides to cut the taxes of society's richest, I see it as 
taking money from the person who needs it, who paid insurance, 
and giving it to the other, who does not need it or needs it 
less.  In my opinion, if that is not theft, it looks like it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I promised the workers in my riding during the election and more 
recently to talk about it in parliament.  It cannot be done this 
way.  Even more shameful, in my opinion, is limiting the time to 
debate it, but I understand them.  I understand their wanting 
not to talk too long about such an unfair law, which makes off 
with money people have legally paid, to use it for other things. 
I understand their wanting to get this law through quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> It is scandalous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Marcel Gagnon: </B>I agree that it is scandalous.  They were 
saying earlier “Wait, we can change this law in committee”.  I 
am not dreaming in technicolour; I know what was promised and 
what was put before the House, but we will see whether, in 
committee, we can change it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I personally think it will make no sense if this law is not 
changed to give the workers their due, especially since this 
parliament, the parliament of Canadians and Quebecers, is the 
parliament of what the Prime Minister boasts about as one of the 
fairest countries, particularly in social terms, for society's 
poorest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it vital we return to order and find a way to give the 
money back to those who paid it, for the reasons they paid it. 
It is not up to the government to say “You have paid this money 
for insurance, but we think you do not need the insurance. 
So we will take it to lower taxes for the rich”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If you had the misfortune of seeing your house burn down, you 
would contact your insurer and say “Unfortunately, my house 
burned down”. Then you would learn from your insurer that you 
are not covered for the first fire, but that you will be paid if 
your house burns down a second time. This is more or less what 
the government is saying to workers. A worker who, following a 
sudden layoff, expects to collect employment insurance benefits 
to make it through this difficult period is told “No, you are 
not covered right now; you did not work enough hours”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, instead of having to work 300 hours to collect employment 
insurance benefits, which were the original terms under the 
insurance plan, a person must have worked 910 hours. Again, this 
act is unfair. It needs improving. 
The Bloc Quebecois is prepared to co-operate if the government is 
willing to split this bill in two.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Geoff Regan (Halifax West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
very pleased today to speak to the employment insurance bill. 
When I was previously here as a member of parliament in my first 
term, I had the experience of being involved in the review of the 
employment insurance bill.  I can say there was a great deal of 
give and take within the Liberal caucus over that bill.  It was 
the initial incarnation of the proposals which were quite 
different from what eventually became the law after a great deal 
of discussion, negotiation, and pushing and pulling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the reasons the government had the support it did for the 
bill was that it promised that there would be an ongoing 
monitoring process.  In the monitoring process it would examine 
the impact of the bill throughout the country, particularly in 
those areas most affected by it which relied the most on seasonal 
industries, as in the case of Atlantic Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was important that promise was made when the bill was passed 
and that the government followed up on it and had a process of 
monitoring the results and the impacts of the changes made in the 
employment insurance bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having done that, the government assessed the situation, 
assessed the impact of those changes, and said that some of it 
had worked well:  in some cases people had been able to find more 
work; others had changed their working style or the way they work 
and had found extra weeks in the year; and others had problems. 
It wanted to see how it could improve the system to better 
assist people who need the assistance while at the same time 
encourage all Canadians to maximize the work they could get, 
which I think all Canadians want to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that the system be fair to Canadians and 
recognize the situations that Canadians are in when it comes to 
their work lives.  There are seasonal workers across Canada, 
whether they be fishery workers in Atlantic Canada, construction 
workers in central Canada, forestry workers in the west, or 
people in the oil and gas industry, who are unable to find 
year-round work year.  They rely on the employment insurance 
system to enable them to feed and clothe their families during 
difficult periods when they would prefer to be working but are 
unable to find work to do so.  This is an important part of our 
social safety net, one that I think Canadians strongly believe in 
and strongly support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to focus today on one aspect of the changes. Several 
changes are being made in the bill, but I will focus on the 
intensity rule, one of the major changes.  The intensity rule was 
designed to encourage people to find the most work they could and 
try not to use the employment insurance system year after year. 
The idea was that for every 20 weeks of benefits claimed in the 
last five years they would drop 1%, from 55% of their average 
income to 54% to 53%.   Each year it would go down 1%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The impact has not been what was expected or intended.  It seems 
to have been punitive and has not achieved the effect desired. 
Other aspects of the system and of the former bill have had 
positive impacts that encouraged people to find year-round work 
and other kinds of work.  However, this aspect of the bill has 
not had that kind of impact.  It has not had the benefit 
anticipated or planned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is encouraging to see the government recognize that and 
decide to change the bill, to decide to amend and eliminate the 
intensity rule so that seasonal workers will not feel they are 
being penalized because they are stuck in seasonal jobs.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine a 50 year old person who has worked in the forestry, 
fishery or oil and gas industry for 25 or 30 years. The person 
has been trained for that work and cannot see any other 
alternative to that.  He or she cannot simply become a computer 
programmer tomorrow or next week.  That is not an option.  The 
person has become part of a seasonal industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to recognize the way our economy works.  We 
cannot apply a cookie cutter approach to every industry because 
every industry is different.  Seasonal industries are important 
to Canada.  The fishery provides hundreds of millions of dollars 
of revenue to Canada and to the GDP of our economy.  It is a very 
important industry on both coasts and on our inland waterways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that the bill be amended.  I am pleased to see 
the government moving toward the elimination of the intensity 
rule.  It will make the employment insurance system fairer for 
all Canadians.  Having been a part of the review group on the 
original bill, it is very satisfying to see the government, 
having gone through this process and having looked at the impact 
of the bill, deciding to make these changes now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also pleased to see that the government has made a change 
to the clawback.  The clawback was originally introduced so that 
people who were making high incomes every year could not collect 
EI on top of that income every year.  We have heard examples of 
people making $70,000 a year and on top of that income receiving 
employment insurance.  Canadians did not like that and that was 
one of the reasons it made sense to make changes to the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having the clawback start at only $39,000 meant that the people 
who were not just high income but also of moderate income were 
being hit by the clawback provision.  The decision to increase 
the clawback level, as the bill would do, to $49,000 or 
thereabouts, will mean that people at moderate and middle income 
levels will not be hit with the clawback.  Those are two very 
important and positive changes, and they come at a time when 
other changes have also happened in employment insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members are well aware of the changes that provide for parental 
leave benefits.  Most Canadians are strongly supportive of and 
recognize this change as important support of families in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill has many benefits for Canadians.  Whether one is in 
Atlantic Canada, which is where my family lives, British Columbia 
or anywhere across the country, there are benefits for everyone 
in the employment insurance system.  However, it is important to 
make these amendments in order to improve the system and make it 
fair for all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage members to join me in supporting the bill.

make his interventions through the Chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders:</B>  Of course, Mr. Speaker, you are the one 
who issues their paycheques.  You are forcing these students to 
pay into employment insurance, yet because they are part time 
they will never be able to collect on the money they have paid 
in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If for some reason they were to leave this job or you were to 
let them go, they would never be able to collect on the money you 
are taking from them.  It is not insurance; it is a tax.  For 
these students who are helping us in the Chamber today, you are 
levying a tax on them.  There is no ability for them to collect 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliamentary pages are like hundreds of thousands of other 
students across the country who pay into employment insurance 
under the guise that it is insurance, and yet if they lost their 
jobs or wanted to collect back on it they never could. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This does not just apply to students.  It applies to more than 
just part time students.  The government is hoodwinking people 
like hairdressers, the self-employed, and all sorts of people who 
are paying into EI but who have no ability to prospect of drawing on 
it because of the way it is structured. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will call it what it deserves to be called.  It is not an 
Employment Insurance Act.  It is an employment tax.  That is 
exactly what you are doing to these students, Mr. Speaker, and it 
is exactly what your government does to millions of people across 
the country when it levies this tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Real things to create jobs, real initiatives other than tax 
cuts, are something my party and I support.  To give an example 
of how nasty this tax is, how pernicious this tax is that you put 
upon these pages and others in the country, the government right 
now has approximately $35 billion in the EI fund.  It is a huge 
surplus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fund's chief actuarial officer says a $15 billion surplus is 
all that is required.  Therefore more than $20 billion is being 
hoarded by your government, Mr. Speaker, from people like these 
pages right here— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I am having some difficulty. 
Certainly I am quite prepared to accept when the member refers to 
the Chair as being an officer of the House that has 
responsibilities within the Board of Internal Economy, the House 
of Commons being the employer of all employees on the Hill 
including the pages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, it is neither my government nor is it my opposition.  I 
would hope the hon. member can make that distinction.  The Chair 
is the Chair of the House of Commons, not of any party, not of 
any member, but of all parties and of all members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I 
too heard the references of the member opposite and I know you 
have addressed them.  However, I hope my colleagues in the House 
can agree that it is inappropriate for a member in making remarks 
to directly or indirectly impugn the impartiality of the Chair in 
the way the member opposite appears to have done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope all members in the House on both sides will accept that. 
If the member opposite has been misinterpreted by me or others in 
the way he has made the remarks, I hope— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Order, please.  The Chair at this 
point is in no way offended, but I did want to make some 
clarifications, not on the opinions, the arguments or the debate, 
but simply on the position of the Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the greatest of respect to the parliamentary secretary, I 
think we are engaging in debate and the debate at this time 
belongs to the member for Calgary West.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am heartened that somebody 
who previously served as the government whip is able to distance 
himself from the Liberal government across the way.  I will 
continue to talk about what the Liberal government has done 
previously and continues to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government is hoarding $35 billion in the EI fund. 
It is unconscionable when not nearly that amount of money is 
necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to tell the people of Alberta, who I know will undergo 
a provincial election very soon, exactly what is happening in 
terms of the EI fund.  I also tell all pages in the House of 
Commons to pay attention because these numbers hold true for 
province of Ontario.  The numbers hold true for those working in 
Ontario as well as those in Alberta. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Alberta pays $1.8 billion into the EI fund.  Alberta takes out 
$500 million.  That leaves in the fund a net $1.3 billion 
overpayment every year.  There are 1.6 million working Albertans. 
If one does the math it works out to roughly $800 per person. 
Those numbers carry forward for House of Commons pages as well. 
They do not earn as much as the average worker because they are 
part time.  If, however, they earned an average wage in the low 
thirty thousands per year, they would be overpaying to the tune 
of $800 per year in employment insurance, in terms of what they 
put in and what they take out in aggregate collectively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is inherently unfair when the government is taxing nearly 
$1,000.  Canadians are overpaying in terms of the Canada pension 
plan.  The young people around this room know.  I know and the 
government knows.  You know, Mr. Speaker, that in 2017 the Canada 
pension plan will go bust when the actuarial demographic weight 
cracks down on it.  Yet they are overpaying into the plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They and others like them are overpaying into both of these 
plans, EI and CPP, to the tune of $1,000 or better per year, 
money they could have in their wallet and spend to their own 
discretion rather than give to the government.  It is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I would propose is somewhat controversial so I hope members 
across the way will listen.  Five per cent of someone's wage, 
whether a janitor or the president of a given corporation or 
public entity, could be taken and put into a mandatory retirement 
savings plan, a super RRSP.  In that way it would not be 
collectively wasted.  It is not a Ponzi scheme. It is not a 
pyramid scheme.  It is not something that goes into general 
revenue where people wonder if it will ever come out again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would go into individuals' accounts.  They would know how 
much money they put in per year.  They would know the rate of 
return on their investment.  They could put it into GICs.  They 
could put it into treasury bills.  They could put it into bonds 
or into any number of instruments.  They would know how much they 
had in aggregate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I asked any one of the bright people in the Chamber today, 
and they should be fairly bright people because they are supposed 
to be running the country, how much they had contributed over 
their lifetimes into the Canada pension plan, I bet not a single 
one of them, not even yourself, Mr. Speaker, would know even to 
the nearest hundred or the nearest thousand dollars exactly how 
much they had put into the CPP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason they do not know and you do not know, Mr. Speaker, 
even though they are supposed to govern this land, is that EI is 
a collectively held fund.  Because they do not have individual 
accounts they do not know.  It is the tragedy of the Commons. 
Ironic is that statement, tragedy of the Commons.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Another 5% would go to employment insurance.  My father has 
recently retired.  I hope he is having a good time and enjoying 
his retirement years.  Maybe he is out doing something a little 
more enjoyable than watching me on TV.  I do not know.  If 
somebody like my father who never collected a day of employment 
insurance in his life could have the 5% he had set aside in EI 
rolled over to his pension when he turned 65, then 10% of his 
lifetime earnings would have been saved and invested for when he 
retired.  That would be fair.  It would be just.  It would make 
sure that people were not abusing the worst aspects of the 
employment insurance system and that they would know it was 
theirs and was there for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see the security guards around here.  I remember that last 
session the government took money out of their pension fund, the 
public service pension fund.  It scooped billions of dollars out 
of their pensionable earnings.  That was wrong.  If they were 
able to put 5% or 10% aside, they would know how much they were 
putting in and what they were getting as a return on their 
investment, rather than having the government take it from them. 
That would be far more just. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope we see that someday, rather than the present system that 
has all sorts of abuses wrapped up in it.  People who work as 
part time students pay into the employment tax but have no 
ability to collect it.  People who are self-employed and run 
their own businesses are double taxed, once as an employer and 
once as an employee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Liberal members across the way laugh.  They are making fun of 
the students in this room.  They are making fun of the security 
guards who work above them.  They are making fun of the people 
who are self-employed and double pay this tax.  They laugh 
despite the fact that they have $20 billion sitting in their 
chest that they should not have.  It is owed to Canadian 
taxpayers, not to the Liberals who laugh across the way.

has been almost two weeks since Canada imposed a ban on beef 
imports from Brazil.  This decision was not based on science but 
on politics.  The Prime Minister's office says that it is a 
health issue not a trade issue, in spite of receiving no evidence 
from their own officials that there is BSE. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though scientists from the Canadian Food Inspection Agency 
confirmed that there is no evidence of human risk, the Minister 
of Agriculture and Agri-Food and the federal government continue 
to persist in discrediting Canada's reputation.  The Liberal 
government is damaging our trade situation further by setting the 
example for other countries to take Canada's lead in basing 
decisions on politics and not on science. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government has gone so far as to muzzle and harass 
scientists within the CFIA who question the government's 
intentions because they know there is not sufficient evidence to 
maintain this ban. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister has allowed the industry minister's bungling 
of the Bombardier file to affect the work of the CFIA and 
Canada's international trade reputation.  It is time to stop

confirmation from the ethics counsellor that the Prime Minister 
indeed did have a stake in the golf course next to the Auberge 
Grand-Mère during the time that it received millions of dollars. 
It is called a conflict of interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ethics counsellor has now confirmed what we have been 
maintaining all along, that the Prime Minister stood to lose 
money if the value of that golf course dropped. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the Prime Minister continue to deny that he had an 
interest in those shares during that time? 
<P><A NAME="LINK76"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the leader's assertion is completely wrong.  Mr. Wilson 
made some comments about hypothetical situations but he continued 
to reiterate that he had looked into the matter fully and he 
found that the Prime Minister had acted totally properly and 
within the rules, and that he did not own shares at any relevant 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest, therefore, that the Leader of the Opposition withdraw 
his assertion because he is only sinking deeper into the mud

that the Prime Minister had a personal interest in the value of 
the Auberge Grand-Mère remaining high.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

Minister was in a conflict of interest.  The Leader of the 
Opposition is completely wrong in saying that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to say that what the Leader of the Opposition is 
asking members to do is nothing more than simply attack the Prime 
Minister for acting on undertakings he made to create an ethics 
counsellor position which did not exist before the 1993 election.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I first asked questions of the Prime Minister's interest for the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I first asked a question 
about the Auberge Grand-Mère on February 1, 1999, two years ago. 
The Prime Minister and his ethics guard dog have pretended that 
the Prime Minister had no financial interest in the Auberge 
Grand-Mère. 
Now the Prime Minister takes off to China and his ethics 
counsellor cracks.  He now admits that the Prime Minister in fact 
did have a financial interest.

Speaker, the hon. member, as she is every day, is completely 
wrong in this.  The ethics counsellor has not changed his 
position.  The ethics counsellor has carried out his 
responsibilities for which he was praised by opposition parties. 
He is doing his job on an independent basis and should be praised 
for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking of cover-up, how long did the hon. member cover up her 
intention to take her pension? 
<P><A NAME="LINK83"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, they try to deflect it, but the issue is that the 
Prime Minister and the ethics counsellor— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Order, please.  The hon. member for Edmonton 
North has the floor.  We will hear her question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, when the Prime Minister 
called the ethics counsellor in January 1996 he warned him that 
the sale of his shares had fallen through.  Until those shares 
were finally sold in 1999, the Deputy Prime Minister said no 
relevant time.  There is nothing more relevant than the fact that 
the ethics counsellor is now condemning the Prime Minister. After 
that, $3.4 million started flowing into the Auberge Grand-Mère. 
If that hotel had been allowed to go belly up, the golf course 
obviously would have been worth less, and the ethics counsellor 
has now confirmed that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question is, why was taxpayer money used to prop up the 
Prime Minister's personal investments? 
<P><A NAME="LINK84"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, when it comes to the flow of funds, the member will have 
to direct her question to the Quebec government.  This was done 
under a Quebec provincial program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister's position, as stated by the ethics 
counsellor to the Standing Committee on Industry, is that “the 
Prime Minister doesn't own the shares and has not owned the 
shares since November 1, 1993, which is the only important 
issue”.  These were the words of the ethics counsellor before a 
committee of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not trying to deflect anything.  When it comes to answering 
the deputy leader with respect to her pension, it is not a 
deflection, it is a direct hit and she has taken it on the chin.

that Statistics Canada's documents and figures are not reliable. 
Since on this occasion we do not have the best system in the

Agriculture and Agri-Food are having talks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would remind the minister that Brazil is a member of Mercosur, 
a free trade association which includes such countries as 
Uruguay and Argentina.  Knowing that Brazilian beef can move 
between these two countries, what guarantee does the minister 
have that Brazilian beef is not entering Canada through 
Argentina and Uruguay?

we are doing the risk assessment on what has been happening to 
the cattle that Brazil has been importing over the last number of 
years.  We need to know that Brazil has had the capability to 
ascertain where these animals have ended up, are ending up and 
will end up, and whether they are ending up in the food chain. 
That is why the risk assessment is being done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other information, the hon. member should get his facts

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Joe Clark (Calgary Centre, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Minister of Industry.  The alleged 
purchaser of the Prime Minister's golf club shares in 1993 was a 
company called Akimbo, controlled by Mr. Jonas Prince.  Mr. 
Prince told the <I>National Post</I> that the agreement was never 
a firm sale but rather an option or right to purchase.  That 
would mean the shares always belonged to the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the Minister of Industry seek the agreement of Mr. Jonas 
Prince to table in parliament all relevant documents and 
agreements in this case? 
<P><A NAME="LINK101"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the ethics counsellor, in testifying before the industry 
committee of the House, said “The Prime Minister doesn't have an 
interest in this matter.  He sold his interest”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He went on to say:  “It was a sale free and clear of his 
interest in that golf course.  The Prime Minister doesn't own the 
shares and has not owned the shares since November 1, 1993, which 
is the only important issue”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was the ethics counsellor's testimony before the standing 
committee of the House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK102"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Joe Clark (Calgary Centre, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
just to keep the Deputy Prime Minister up to date, the ethics 
counsellor has now said that the Prime Minister's shares in the 
golf course were never placed in a blind trust.  That is what the 
ethics counsellor said last week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the Deputy Prime Minister confirm that the Prime Minister's 
shares in the Grand-Mère Golf Club were never placed in a blind 
trust?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the leader of the Conservative Party has admitted to 
fishing on this question.  Yesterday he asked for urgent 
information on executive search firms, saying that search firms 
had been switched in the hiring between Mr. Schroder and Mr. 
Vennat.  I checked and that information is false. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He asked for information on which executive search firms were 
involved in the hiring of executives at BDC.  I can tell him that 
I have in my hands the list of not one or two but of ten.  That 
is normal practice by any corporation when seeking out 
executives, depending upon their skill sets.

yesterday the ethics counsellor, Mr. Wilson, said that the Prime 
Minister did have an interest in the financial health of the 
Auberge Grand-Mère and the Grand-Mère golf course. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Wilson clearly stated that the Prime Minister might lose 
money on his investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the Prime Minister in agreement with Mr. Wilson and will he 
simply acknowledge his financial interest between 1996 and 1999 
in the Auberge Grand-Mère? 
<P><A NAME="LINK105"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, Mr.

him in English: 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“The Prime Minister doesn't own the shares and has not owned 
the shares since November 1, 1993, which is the only important

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Peschisolido (Richmond, Canadian Alliance):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
in 1996, as soon as the Prime Minister discovered that the sale 
of his shares had fallen through, he contacted Mr. Wilson to ask 
his advice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Wilson offered him a clear choice: declare his shares or 
sell them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to know why the Prime Minister did not follow the advice 
of his ethics counsellor, Mr. Wilson.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
instead of the minister saying just any old thing, I would like 
her to try to understand Quebec's approach in this area.  I will 
give her another very straightforward example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, a young offender found guilty of a serious crime leaves a 
rehabilitation centre when Quebec social services consider him 
rehabilitated.  However, with the minister's bill, the young 
person will be treated as an adult and automatically released 
after serving two thirds of his sentence, rehabilitated or not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the minister understand that the bill prevents Quebec from

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General

the Liberals have tried to build to hold back the Prime 
Minister's apparent wrongdoing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week Canadians learned the industry minister's claim that 
the Prime Minister's golf course was in a blind trust was false. 
Now comes the admission that the Prime Minister stood to lose 
money if the value of his golf course fell.  These raise valid 
concerns about apparent conflict of interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the Prime Minister not simply table the relevant 
documents so that Canadians can judge for themselves? 
<P><A NAME="LINK115"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

and has given very full answers on this matter.

<P><A NAME="LINK116"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Canadian

no full answers, but there are a lot of full questions that the 
Prime Minister refuses to answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the documents are there that show his interest in the golf 
course was sold, or what it was sold for, or when it was sold, 
why does he not just table them so that everyone can see and 
judge for themselves?  What is he hiding? 
<P><A NAME="LINK117"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister is not hiding anything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am wondering why opposition members persist in these 
questions. Are they trying to hide the fact that they lost the 
election because Canadians said that they had no vision, that 
they wanted to get rid of the health care system and that they 
wanted to get rid of old age pensions? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are trying to hide a lot and that is why they are bringing

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the 
Secretary of State for International Financial Institutions said 
that there had been problems with the distribution of cheques 
for home heating assistance and that even dead people and 
inmates had received such cheques. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also said that the government was considering recovering 
these moneys, including through income tax returns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the minister endorse these comments and is he not concerned 
that the operation to recover these cheques could look just like 
the distribution process in that it might not be conducted 
properly, that it might be based on ill-suited criteria and that 
it could create new injustices? 
<P><A NAME="LINK120"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as I 
repeated many times in the House, the secretary of state said 
that officials from the Department of National Revenue and the 
Department of Finance are reviewing the matter. Some provinces 
are also involved. Once a decision is made, everyone will be 
informed accordingly. 
<P><A NAME="LINK121"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, at the rate 
things are going, should the Minister of Finance not consider

an injustice by creating another?

did. It was the most effective way to give these cheques to the 
poor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we had chosen another solution, these people would have 
received their cheques next summer instead of in January. I can 
assure the hon. member that it is a lot colder in January than

Mr. Speaker, it is time for somebody on the front bench of the 
Liberal government to stand up for the truth about the unethical 
conduct of the Prime Minister.  Where I come from, a person who 
knows that a wrong has been done and remains silent about it is 
as guilty as the perpetrator of the act and becomes an 
accomplice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time for the Minister of Finance to stop defending the

Mr. Speaker, I want to provide the House with a quote from the 
ethics counsellor:  “We are not looking to catch people.  What 
we are looking to do is give people advice in the first 120 days 
after they are appointed, so we can take together the steps that 
will ensure that there is not going to be a conflict”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask one of the sparks of brilliance over there

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, in Canada we hear a spark of brilliance.  The ethics 
counsellor is quoted as saying that he helped persuade the Prime 
Minister to drop the Liberal campaign promise that he as the 
ethics counsellor would report to parliament.  He also said that 
he feared an independent ethics counsellor would usurp the 
accountability of the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Prime Minister violates the codes of ethics, who is he

</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look back over the course of the last seven years, the 
fact is that the government has invested very heavily, whether it 
be in the Canada Foundation for Innovation or the national child

enormous sums and ought to do so in British Columbia.

program consistently goes off the pavement before it reaches B.C. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the year 2001, out of a budget of $110 million not a single 
cent, zero dollars, nothing, has gone to B.C.  From now on B.C. 
wants its fair share of the money.

years for infrastructure, including $600 million for national 
highways in particular, to be applied at the border crossings, 
which includes the border crossings south of the Vancouver area.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>PROCEDURE AND HOUSE AFFAIRS—SPEAKER'S RULING 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK174"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The Chair will now deal with the 
question of privilege raised by the hon. member for 
Sarnia—Lambton on February 6, 2001.  The question of privilege 
concerned the departure from the House of Commons of two 
legislative counsel who had appeared last spring as witnesses 
before the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member argued that the witnesses had sought, and had 
received, the assurance of the committee that their testimony 
would be privileged and that there would be no reprisals for 
their testifying.  He alleged that the departure of the two 
counsel was a direct result of their testimony and so constituted 
a prima facie case of privilege. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before proceeding further, I would like to thank the hon. member 
for Sarnia—Lambton and all members who contributed to the 
discussion.  In particular, I would like to draw attention to the 
comments of the opposition House leader (the hon. member for 
Fraser Valley), the whip of the Bloc Quebecois (the hon. member 
for Verchères—Les Patriotes), the House leader for the 
Progressive Conservative Party (the hon. member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough), and the hon. member for 
Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his presentation, the hon. member for Sarnia—Lambton 
provided a chronology of events that occurred subsequent to the 
committee appearance of these two individuals and suggested that 
this chronology represented evidence that what he termed their 
“shotgun firing” from the House of Commons was a direct 
consequence of their appearance before the committee.  Thus, the 
hon. member argued that this action constituted a prima facie 
case of privilege.

<A HREF="#LINKT52"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, let me say that this is a matter that I take very 
seriously.  The allegation, if it is founded, carries serious 
repercussions not only for the two individuals directly concerned 
but for the integrity of the committee system of the House as 
well as for the House's reputation as a fair and just employer. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, for my part as I render this decision, I am aware 
that I play two different roles in this situation.  As the 
Speaker presiding over this Chamber, I must determine whether or 
not the hon. member for Sarnia—Lambton has made a persuasive 
argument for this matter being judged a prima facie case of 
privilege.  As the Speaker chairing the Board of Internal 
Economy, which is the employer, I am duty bound to preserve the 
confidentiality of board discussions, particularly as they 
concern matters of staff relations which are, by their very 
nature, completely confidential. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The case before us is especially complex for it intertwines the 
issue of privilege with a complicated staff relations situation 
that predates any invitation to appear before the Standing 
Committee on Procedure and House Affairs.  Added to this already 
difficult situation is the whole matter of resourcing of the 
legislative drafting function, an issue on which many hon. 
members have strong opinions.  Let me try to settle the 
differences of view in this situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As presiding officer in the House, it is my duty to act as the 
guardian of the rights and privileges of members and of the House 
as an institution.  Insofar as parliamentary privilege extends to 
witnesses, I have also to protect their rights and privileges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So first I would like to deal with the issue of the intimidation 
of witnesses before parliamentary committees.  It is clearly 
stated at pages 862 and 863 of Marleau-Montpetit's <I>House of 
Commons Procedure and Practice</I> that the principles of 
parliamentary privilege are extended to witnesses when they 
appear before a parliamentary committee.  I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Witnesses appearing before committees enjoy the same freedom of 
speech and protection from arrest and molestation as do Members 
of Parliament...Tampering with a witness or in any way attempting 
to deter a witness from giving evidence at a committee meeting 
may constitute a breach of privilege.  Similarly, any 
interference with or threats against witnesses who have already 
testified may be treated as a breach of privilege by the House. 
</UL>
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the present case, the hon. member for Sarnia—Lambton has 
recounted a chronology of events and, based on this chronology, 
alleges a cause and effect connection between the appearance of 
two counsel before the Standing Committee on Procedure and House 
Affairs and their subsequent departure from the House.  The hon. 
member points out that the witnesses had asked for and had 
received assurances from the committee that they would be 
protected by parliamentary privilege in the event of reprisals 
arising out of their testimony.  He contends that this protection 
appears to have been ignored and argues that a prima facie case 
of privilege exists. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not going to review the chronology of the events presented 
except to say, with respect, that it is incomplete.  As a review 
of the testimony of counsel before the committee will reveal, the 
relationship between the employer and these employees was already 
in an advanced state of deterioration by the time these 
individuals testified.  Were the appearance before the committee 
the only circumstance to be considered in examining this case, 
there might indeed be a persuasive argument for concluding that 
this is in fact a case of reprisal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, things are not so simple.  By the time of the testimony 
last spring, the employer-employee relationship was already 
characterized by acrimony and recrimination.  The dispute between 
these legislative counsel and management was longstanding and 
continuing.  Indeed, there were several issues that were the 
subject of complaint at the time counsel appeared before the 
committee.  Given these circumstances, the Chair must conclude 
that there is not a prima facie case of privilege. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Chair would commend to all hon. members the intervention of 
the hon. House leader of the official opposition who cautioned 
against judging the situation having heard only one side of the 
dispute. At page 309 of <I>Debates</I> he said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I have a problem with raising personnel issues on the 
floor of the House of Commons...When these two employees of the 
House appeared before the standing committee and asked for 
protection of the House, we did not understand that there were 
outstanding grievances between management and the employees...We 
ended up hearing a kind of rehash of the ongoing problems...we 
did not have the background knowledge to deal with...We should 
not handle a grievance process, in a public forum, on the floor 
of a committee or on the floor of the House of Commons.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opposition House leader like any other member of the board, 
and I remind members that I was also a board member in the last 
parliament when this issue was raised there, is bound by the 
statutory requirement for confidentiality of board discussions on 
this or any other matter, but we all feel a particular 
responsibility with regard to staff relations issues which, by 
their nature, must be kept completely private and confidential. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addressing this most unfortunate situation the board has been 
guided by the usual principles of human resource management and 
in seeking a solution we have made every effort to reach a fair 
and equitable settlement with the parties.  In one case happily 
such a settlement has been possible.  In the other case it has 
not been possible to reach agreement and the individual is now 
seeking redress through a third party tribunal, the Public 
Service Staff Relations Board.  While the matter that is before 
the PSSRB is not, strictly speaking, sub judice, I would suggest 
that we should not interfere in that process but rather allow it 
to reach its own conclusions in due course. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many hon. members have been employers in their professional 
lives before being elected to this House.  All hon. members are 
now employers in their own right of staff here in their Hill 
offices or at home in their constituency offices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that hon. members will appreciate from their own 
experience that the most difficult and often the most 
delicate situation an employer can face is dealing with 
employees with whom there are irreconcilable differences. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliament has set out the terms of the employer-employee 
relationship here at the House of Commons.  Labour relations are 
governed by statute, that is, the Parliament of Canada Act and 
the Parliamentary Employment and Staff Relations Act; by 
collective agreements with bargaining agents; and in this 
instance, by practice that is parallel to the professional norms 
governing counsel employed in the Public Service of Canada. Under 
the terms of this framework employees have the right to raise 
complaints and follow grievance procedures up to and including 
bringing matters before the Public Service Staff Relations Board. 
Individuals also have the right to seek redress through the 
courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the employer of record at the House, the Board of Internal 
Economy is always mindful of its responsibilities in dealing with 
employee issues generally or, in certain circumstances, with the 
cases of individual employees.  As the chair of the board, I have 
a particular responsibility to uphold the integrity of the staff 
relations system and to allow the procedures that have been set 
in motion to reach their conclusions unhampered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, on a close examination of all the facts, I have 
concluded that to interpose into the system of existing 
safeguards, whether they be provided by the PSSRB or the courts, 
ad hoc hearings by members of parliament in the Chamber or in 
committee is in my view to compromise the integrity of the labour 
relations framework that was created by decision of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, a word about the need for increasing resources in the 
Office of the Law Clerk and Parliamentary Counsel.  As previous 
speakers have indicated, these matters are basic administrative 
issues and, as such, must be dealt with by the Board of Internal 
Economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I specifically draw to your attention the ruling given on 
October 23, 1997, with regard to a similar question of privilege 
raised by the hon. member for Sarnia—Lambton.  My predecessor, 
Mr. Speaker Parent, stated at page 1,003 of <I>Debates</I> the 
following: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When dealing with similar questions, my predecessors have 
repeatedly indicated that these should be brought to the 
attention of the Board of Internal Economy and should not be 
raised on the floor of the House as a point of order nor as a 
question of privilege. 
</UL>
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take very seriously the ongoing concerns many hon. members 
have regarding legislative counsel and I must reiterate that 
these concerns have been brought to the attention of the Board of 
Internal Economy and are being dealt with. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary, then, the Chair finds that there is no prima facie 
case of privilege in this instance.  I hope that I have been able 
to throw some light on this complex series of unfortunate 
circumstances while respecting the confidentiality of information 
entrusted to me as a member of the Board of Internal Economy.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I would entreat all hon. members to proceed with 
caution when dealing with staff relations matters.  If we find 
that the procedures for remedy and redress are inadequate, then 
by all means let us address what is lacking in the existing 
safeguards and take corrective measures, but let us be wary of 
situations where we are asked to step into the role of ad hoc 
arbiters on individual cases.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>EMPLOYMENT INSURANCE ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK177">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-2, an 
act to amend the Employment Insurance Act and the Employment 
Insurance (Fishing) Regulations, be read the second time and 
referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK178"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe McGuire (Egmont, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, before I 
begin my remarks I would like to congratulate you on your 
election to the chair.  I believe you are the third elected 
Speaker that we have had in the history of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to take the opportunity to thank the voters of 
Egmont for returning me for the fourth time in the last general 
election.  I believe we came into the House at the same time, Mr. 
Speaker, so we must have been doing something right for our 
constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the fourth time the people of Egmont voted for me.  I am 
both humble and grateful that they bestowed the honour upon me. 
The riding of Egmont extends from the new city of Summerside on 
the eastern boundary all the way west to the North Cape.  With 
the exception of the aerospace industry in Summerside, most of 
the industries in the riding of Egmont are seasonal in nature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a very important fishing area of Atlantic Canada, with 12 
small craft harbours in existence and a very lucrative lobster 
industry.  Farming is a very important part of the economy of my 
riding with exceptional potato producing areas and dairy and 
swine industries.  Forestry plays a smaller but vital role. 
Tourism is an ever growing part of the economy of Egmont.  The 
construction industry also plays a vital role in the riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The unemployment insurance program is a vital program for the 
people of my riding because most of the industries are seasonal 
in nature.  They must have this program in order to survive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I stated earlier, I have been here 12 years and I have seen 
the evolution of this file, the EI-UI debate, through the 
previous Conservative government and our own EI bill.  Now, as a 
newly appointed member of the HRD standing committee, I will be 
playing a closer role with the program to see that it becomes a 
more responsive program for the people of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard people say how unfortunate it was to have time 
allocation invoked to get the bill through the House, even after 
we have gone through the last two federal elections with EI being 
one of the more prominent issues in the election debates.  Both 
times the people of Canada have returned this government.  They 
must be supporting our concept of employment insurance much 
better than the proposals that were set forth by the 
Conservatives, the Alliance, the Bloc Quebecois or the NDP 
governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maritimers have also heard criticism that perhaps Atlantic 
Canadians should go to where the jobs are.  The most mobile 
people in Canada are the people from Atlantic Canada. If we were 
to go to the oil fields of Alberta, for example, we would find 
that most of the workers there are maritimers.  If we were to go 
to Fort McMurray, we would see that over half the population of 
that city comes from Newfoundland and other parts of Atlantic 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We always respond to where the jobs and have done so since 
Confederation, whether it was out immigration to the Boston 
states as we call them, or to Toronto when there were job 
opportunities, or to Vancouver when there were job opportunities 
or to Alberta where there are job opportunities now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know people who work the seasonal industries in my province. 
In the fishing industry, for example, workers fish during the 
spring and summer.  They go to Alberta to work the rest of the 
year.  Then, they return to Atlantic Canada to go back to the 
jobs where they grew up as sons of fishermen, hoping one day to 
replace their parents in the fishing industry.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Critics of the government claim that the contents of Bill C-2 
represent backtracking on the reforms introduced in 1996. 
Nothing could be further from the truth.  The government promised 
that if a monitoring process indicated that the changes were not 
producing the desired results, then legislation would be changed. 
Today this is what we are doing.  We have found that the bill, as 
passed by the House a number of years ago, has a number of flaws 
in it.  We are moving to correct those flaws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was generally agreed during the early days of this government 
that the unemployment insurance scheme needed to be replaced.  It 
did not respond to the new economy in the 21st century.  After 
much consultation with Canadians and despite the outraged cries 
of the opposition, some of whom did not want an EI program at all 
and others who wanted a guaranteed annual income, the government 
brought in a program to replace the old regime with the 
employment insurance program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new plan was designed to be sustainable, to be fairer, to 
encourage work, to reduce dependence on benefits, to assist those 
most in need and to help workers get back to work and stay at 
work.  The program was implemented with the knowledge that being 
new it would not necessarily be perfect.  We knew that with time 
we would likely identify areas requiring improvement. The 
legislation allowed for a period of continuous monitoring and 
assessment of the program to measure its impact on people, 
communities and the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not the first time that adjustments to the EI regime 
have proven necessary.  The government acted quickly in 1997 to 
launch a small weeks project in order to correct a disincentive 
for some people to work weeks with low earnings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member for the area who identified the weakness, I knew 
that potato 
grading companies could not find workers.  If people came into 
the potato warehouses for one, two or three days during the week, 
their benefits would be cut in half by their response to that call to 
go to work.  This obviously was a disincentive to get people to 
work.  We immediately moved to correct that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our studies and discussions with Canadians have shown us that 
many parts of the EI program are working well.  There are some 
provisions that have proven ineffective, particularly toward 
seasonal workers.  We have always had and we will always have 
seasonal industries.  These industries are vital to our economic 
well-being. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Prince Edward Island, in Prince county alone, 65% of the 
workforce works less than a 12 month period in one year.  I take 
offence with anyone who suggests that these changes will simply 
make it profitable for industries to gear up for a short season. 
I would like to comment that the seasonal businesses which are 
profitable, when they have such a short window of opportunity, 
are very fortunate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should be noted that seasonality is determined by a much 
higher power.  If mother nature did not co-operate these 
businesses could no longer be profitable and the basic existence 
of many of them would be put into jeopardy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the employees, if the EI program was not in place what 
would they do to support their families without an income?  We 
are talking about the reality of seasonal workers across Canada, 
not just in Atlantic Canada.  Because these industries by 
definition employ people for only part of the year, we must 
always remain watchful to ensure that our economic and social 
programs do not exclude these people from living and working. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While EI aims at helping all unemployed workers, we must also 
recognize that some groups, such as seasonal workers, have 
particular needs and the program has special features built in to 
benefit seasonal workers across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hours based system, for example, takes into account the fact 
that seasonal work often involves long hours of work per week. It 
also identifies a sector of the workforce, even with part time 
work over the full year, that can now qualify.  For example, an 
employee who works in a seasonal job can accumulate hours in 
smaller numbers in the pre and post season in order to qualify 
for benefits which previously he or she was not entitled to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have mentioned, one of the intentions of the EI program is 
to reduce dependence on benefits by all Canadian workers, 
including seasonal workers.  The so-called intensity rule was 
therefore introduced to discourage use of EI benefits by reducing 
the benefit rate of frequent claimants.

<A HREF="#LINKT56"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The unavoidable fact is that many seasonal workers have no 
choice but to resort to EI benefits.  There simply are not enough 
job opportunities available to them in the off season.  That is 
why Bill C-2 proposes removal of the intensity rule.  This 
translates into a maximum of $988 for a 26 week period and $1,710 
for a maximum 45 week claim in the pockets of Canadians.  If 
there was a maximum claim of 26 weeks, they would only get $40 
more a week when the intensity rule is dropped.  It may not seem 
like a very large amount of money, but for someone making $200 a 
week this represents a very large portion of that person's 
income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage all members to support this program and get these 
measures through as quickly as possible for the benefit of all 
seasonal workers in Canada.

<P><A NAME="LINK179"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, this bill is 
shameful. I admit that it brings slight improvements to the 
so-called reform we began talking about in 1994. Through this 
reform, the unemployment insurance plan, which actually needed to 
be reviewed but not transformed nor diminished, has in fact 
become a plan whereby the government gets richer but people in 
need get poorer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill, not the one we have now but the one which became the 
so-called unemployment insurance reform act, was renamed 
employment insurance plan without any consideration for what is 
actually going on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I admit that the unemployment rate has dropped, but if it has 
gone down, it is largely because the Canadian economy has been 
pulled along by the American economy. 
However, the unemployed who continued to suffer from not being 
able to find a decent or permanent job have been badly hurt by 
the new employment insurance plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The public must realize that the government is introducing in 
the House a bill proposing slight improvements by reducing cuts 
which should never have occurred and which total around 8% of 
benefits paid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the government really aiming at through these slight 
improvements? It wants to gain full control over the fund, which 
contains a surplus of $36 billion to $38 billion—we will know the 
exact amount soon—taken from the incomes of workers and 
businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, these contributions are paid up to a maximum of $39,000 
of gains earned by workers and up to $39,000 paid by businesses. 
Beyond that limit, there are no contributions to employment 
insurance. This means that the $37-$38 billion, which went in 
full to eliminating the deficit, was paid for by low and middle 
income people, but mostly by small and medium size businesses.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They were paid mostly by these people. Higher wage earners pay a 
smaller percentage of their income in EI premiums, as do 
capital intensive businesses, which pay their employees high 
wages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should take over, push the commission aside and 
decide on its own—that is how it was supposed to be—what the 
level of the premiums should be. This is some very bad news that 
will only make people more cynical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To make it look like the money will really be used for specific 
purposes, EI or Deductions for EI purposes is written on 
paycheques. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ever since employment insurance has been in effect, the number 
of eligible recipients has decreased significantly, almost by 
half, but what is even worse is that the hardest hit were young 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard members make eloquent statements in this House to 
the effect that young Canadians need jobs. Yes, absolutely. 
However, the EI system is designed to ensure that, between jobs, 
no one has to go on welfare or take just any job because they 
need money. That is no way for young people to start building a 
future for themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill will bring the benefits of seasonal workers back to 
the same level as those of all unemployed. This is good news. It 
was necessary. We strongly opposed this penalty imposed on 
seasonal workers, which was part of the employment insurance 
reform, but we also know that this was not a coincidence and that 
the government refused to listen not only to those affected but 
also to those who worked with the seasonal workers in those 
regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members of the Standing Committee on Human Resources 
Development, we knew that those in charge of unemployment 
insurance were targeting seasonal workers. They thought that by 
penalizing them they would force them to relocate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not all workers in Newfoundland are prepared to relocate. I 
heard many men and women say that they wanted to raise their 
children with dignity on their own land. What those at the 
highest levels wanted was to force these people to move away and 
look for work in regions where work was available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill proposes modest improvements regarding the employment 
insurance eligibility of women about to give birth, but there are 
huge flaws in this system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sorry to say that the fundamental problem for seasonal 
workers is not that their benefits declined from 55% to 50% of 
their salary, which is serious; it is the reduction in the number 
of benefit weeks, which creates a 4-5-6 or 7-week gap, as they 
call it in that region, when they do not have any income at all. 
It is the reduction in the number of weeks that penalized 
seasonal workers most, and this bill does nothing about that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for pregnant women who want to draw on the plan, was the 
required number of work weeks brought back to a decent level? No, 
not at all. The plan, which has been lowered to 600 hours, still 
has this requirement, which totally excludes many women, not to 
speak of self-employed women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill, which provides for slight improvements, has huge 
gaps. In particular, it allows the government to lay its hands on 
money that is not its own. 
The government should at least recognize that it is indebted to 
the people and state that it will put this money at the workers' 
disposal if they ever need it because of a recession. What we 
are proposing is a true reform. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK180"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Loyola Hearn (St. John's West, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is certainly a pleasure to be able to say a few words on the 
bill, which certainly affects rural areas more than the more 
lucrative urban areas, and perhaps areas like Atlantic Canada and 
parts of Quebec more than any other area of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a few changes in the bill that are looked upon as 
being positive, one of them being the throwing out of what we 
call the intensity rule and reverting to letting people who draw 
employment insurance draw 55% of their regular wage.  That in 
itself is a bit deceptive and I will comment on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ability for family members to get back into the workplace 
after staying off because of the birth of children without having 
to be looked upon as new entrants certainly is positive.  The 
minor changes to the clawback arrangements will also benefit some 
of those at the higher end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the people who are affected most by employment 
insurance are the ones who receive no reprieve at all from the 
new legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are three issues that should have been addressed in the 
bill and have not been addressed.  The first issue is what we 
call the divisor rule.  It is bad enough to see a person who is 
generally living and working in an area where unemployment is 
meagre and quite often where the wage is low having to resort to 
drawing employment insurance knowing that he or she will start 
with only 55% of what he or she normally makes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the intensity rule had not been changed, people would have 
drawn less as each year went by.  However, besides drawing just 
55%, they find their week's work is not what is divided into the 
total income.  The number of weeks is, as we say, exaggerated. 
The divisor rule means that for somebody who obtains 12 weeks or 420 
hours, when the amount of money that person should receive is 
factored in, the total income is divided by 14.  This means the 
individual is getting much less than the 55%, which appears on 
the surface.  That rule is completely unfair and should have been 
eliminated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second concern is the 420 hour minimum in areas of high 
unemployment and the 520 hour minimum in areas of low 
unemployment. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1540"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT59"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are pockets in the country that depend entirely on 
seasonal employment.  Occasionally these people do relatively 
well.  There may be an exceptionally good fishery, a good 
construction season, or a good year in forestry.  That is the 
exception lately rather than the rule, for a number of reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mismanagement of the fishery, and perhaps we could say the 
mismanagement of our forestry resources to some extent, has led 
to very meagre employment.  The lack of concern for the 
processing end of our fishery means that we are seeing a lot of 
our resource going out of our provinces and out of our country in 
a non-processed or semi-processed state. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means there is less work for the people involved.  This 
past year in Newfoundland, for example, the main source of work 
in the various fish plants was processing crab, which has 
replaced cod as the most lucrative species now caught and 
processed in our province.  However this past year saw a 15% to 
20% cut across the board in relation to quotas, which meant 20% 
less work for people working in our fish plants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Along with that the markets this past year, in particular the 
Japanese market, dictated that the commodity they wanted was crab 
sections rather than the extruded crab meat, the main product 
exported over the last <I>x</I> number of years. Sending the 
crab out in sections meant less work for the people who worked in 
our plants.  Mechanization has also eliminated a number of jobs. 
Consequently we saw people who worked in our fish plants receive 
much less work this year than previously, not because of their 
fault but because of resource, market demands and mechanization, 
which is attributable to the employers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Teachers have also been affected.  Because of what is happening 
in our education system with consolidation and tightening up of belts 
economically, we see a lot of substitute teachers who no longer 
even get work enough to qualify for employment insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are times in certain parts of the country where conditions 
are completely outside the control of the individuals involved. 
It is practically impossible for the average seasonal worker to 
obtain enough employment to qualify for employment insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am certainly not advocating that we return to the old 10-52 
method: if they obtained 10 weeks of work and a few hours each 
week they could qualify to draw employment insurance for the rest 
of the year.  I do not think anyone is advocating that, but the 
pendulum has swung too far. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the election campaign the Prime Minister apologized to 
working people in New Brunswick, especially seasonal workers, for 
a mistake that was made some years ago when new employment 
insurance regulations were brought in.  Instead of changing them 
last fall before the election, he ran the election promising to 
make the changes.  Now we have the bill before the House.  The 
changes that were brought in last fall are still the same ones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the fact that many people expressed concern during the 
election, there have been a few minor amendments, but the real 
changes that would affect people in the areas where they are 
hurting most have not been made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hours required are too stringent in certain parts of the 
country during periods when there are downturns.  In the 
construction industry, for example, because of lack of input from 
federal and provincial governments into the great infrastructure 
agreements we hear about, the hours fail to materialize or the 
money is spread so thinly that many smaller regions cannot avail 
themselves of it. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1545"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT60"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of federal-provincial-municipal cost sharing, most small 
municipalities, because of the financial situations they face, 
cannot avail themselves of the infrastructure agreements.  They 
cannot come up with their share of the total input. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These areas are hit extremely hard.  There should be provision 
in the new legislation to modify the regulations during times 
when working conditions, lack of resources or whatever make it 
impossible for seasonal workers in those areas to obtain enough 
employment to qualify for employment insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another concern is the length of time.  We are not advocating 
the 10-52, but we are finding that as people continue to draw 
employment insurance, as they always will in the areas with 
seasonal employment, it is getting to the point where they find 
themselves with absolutely no income during the periods of the 
year when it is needed most.  Quite often the employment 
insurance benefits end in March or April during times when 
heating costs are extremely high and when the cost of living in 
rural areas is extremely high. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These issues should be addressed in the new legislation.  I 
certainly hope that the minister takes them into account as she 
reviews and hopefully provides us with amendments that we can all 
pass. 
<P><A NAME="LINK181"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Sgro (York West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I take this 
opportunity to congratulate you on your new position.  I am sure 
you will serve the House well, and I hope you enjoy it.  I also 
thank the constituents of York West, my family and staff for 
their support in the November 27 election.  I am glad to be back 
and very pleased to speak in favour of the bill today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We on this side of the House know how important the EI system is 
to Canadians.  That is why we feel really good about 
reintroducing the bill that was presented and debated in the 
House last fall.  I had an opportunity to be a part of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians showed us in the last election that they agreed with 
the direction we are taking. We also know how important it is 
that we in government monitor EI and make sure that it continues 
to do what it was meant to do: to help those who are out of work. 
That is why I support Bill C-2. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation is a result of the government's ongoing 
monitoring of EI.  It recognizes the need for EI to keep up to 
date with the realities of the Canadian economy.  The government 
recognizes there were needs for changes in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>About four years ago the government introduced major changes to 
the old unemployment insurance program.  At that time we wanted 
to change a variety of things.  We wanted to make the system 
fairer, reduce dependency, lower program costs, and emphasize 
active employment measures that would help get Canadians back to 
work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The basic objective of that reform was to produce a system of 
employment insurance that would support Canadians in times when 
they were without work, but that would also encourage and support 
them to get back into the workforce as soon and as effectively as 
possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By and large that reform process worked very well.  Measures 
like the new hours based eligibility system opened up access to 
EI for workers who had not previously qualified, such as multiple 
job holders who may be working a few hours for several employers. 
Many women who are employed in those part time jobs now qualify 
for EI if they need it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time new partnerships have been formed with other 
levels of government and with the private sector to help people 
prepare for and find jobs.  The EI system was strengthened and 
improved by the reform.  The economy has also improved since that 
time.  On a national basis we are experiencing very positive 
economic circumstances.  The national unemployment rate is down. 
More people are working in Canada than ever before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Generally speaking, Canadians have never been more prosperous 
and our economic development has never been more robust.  However 
not all Canadians have benefited from this renewed prosperity. 
Some regions of the country continue to have high unemployment 
rates. 
Seasonal workers, in particular, report that they continue to 
have difficulty finding work in their off season in their 
community.  Many of these seasonal workers are being affected by 
one of the measures introduced with the EI bill in 1996, the 
so-called intensity rule.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The intensity rule was originally put in place to reduce 
dependency on EI and to encourage repeat claimants to find work. 
Unfortunately the intensity rule reduces the EI benefit rate for 
repeat claimants.  The rate goes down by one percentage point for 
every 20 weeks of regular benefits collected in the past five 
years.  The impact can reduce benefits paid to repeat claimants 
from the normal level of 55% to 50%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The intensity rule was brought in because Canadians were 
concerned about people becoming too dependent on the employment 
insurance program.  However, it turns out that the intensity rule 
is achieving little in terms of reducing dependency and 
increasing work effort.  Our research has found that the 
intensity rule has not curtailed repeated EI use, particularly in 
areas where there are few job opportunities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite tremendous employment gains in many parts of the 
country, there is still high unemployment in some regions and 
seasonal workers find it difficult to find off season jobs.  There 
is a growing concern that the intensity rule has become more of a 
penalty on seasonal workers instead of an incentive to find work 
as originally intended.  This is a situation that the government 
recognizes needs to be fixed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How do we fix it?  We eliminate the intensity rule as proposed 
in Bill C-2.  It will remove the penalty imposed on Canadians 
who happen to live in areas with very limited opportunities for 
work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who will benefit?  Canadians will benefit in every province 
and territory.  We have heard about the benefits that it will 
bring to Atlantic Canada, and this is good news.  However, it is 
also important to remember that claimants from Atlantic Canada 
account for less than 20% of the EI claims in any given year. 
This will help people everywhere in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In reality, seasonal employment is a fact of life all across 
Canada and there are many regions where alternative employment is 
difficult to find.  We can ask construction workers in central 
Canada how they feel about this, or workers in the forest 
products industries in the western part of Canada, or the many 
seasonal workers in Quebec or the north.  In truth, removing the 
intensity rule will provide economic benefits that will be 
welcomed throughout the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, we know that EI is only part of the solution. 
We will continue to work hard with provinces and territories and 
with businesses and community leaders to stimulate local 
economies because the best solution to unemployment is 
employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will proudly vote for the legislation and I urge all of my 
colleagues in the House to do the same.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Diane Bourgeois (Terrebonne—Blainville, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it is not only as the Bloc Quebecois critic for the status of 
women that I rise this afternoon in the House, but also as a 
woman who has paid employment insurance premiums all her life and 
who has never been able to get any benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During my maiden speech in the House, reacting to the throne 
speech, I said that the Liberal government does not care about 
the realities and the hardships of Canadians and Quebecers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would again like to quote a sentence that caught my attention 
when Her Excellency, the Governor General of Canada, the 
Honourable Adrienne Clarkson, read the throne speech, where the 
intention of the Liberal government to  “secure a higher quality 
of life for all Canadians” is expressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first real evidence of this true intention to secure a 
higher quality of life was the minister's reform proposing a plan 
that is completely out of sync with the new social and economic 
realities of women living in Canada as well as in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister knows very well that the first persons to be 
penalized by her new reform are the women, more than 70% of whom 
have precarious jobs and frequently rely on employment insurance 
because they cannot find a stable and well paid job. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1555"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT62"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Too often, these women are the sole support of a single parent 
family. They do not have a stable job, but must nonetheless 
support their children, feed them, clothe them and give them a 
good education, and they would certainly have wished for a little 
more compassion from the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are also some sections of the Employment Insurance Act 
that discriminate against women. Let me explain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To be eligible for maternity or parental benefits, one needs 600 
hours of work, while someone working in a high unemployment area 
can be eligible for EI benefits with only 420 hours of work. 
A woman living in the same area would need 600 hours to be 
eligible for maternity benefits. Previously, the requirement was 
for 300 hours or 20 hours spread over 15 weeks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, the new eligibility criteria for parental leave are 
unfair to women who were supposed to give birth after January 1 
and asked for parental leave but were unfortunate enough to have 
their child before that date. They cannot ask for the 35 week 
parental leave because there is no flexibility in the act. It is 
not their fault if they had their child at the beginning of 
December even though they were not expected to give birth until 
January 15. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happens then? Did the government think about the adverse 
effects of this situation for these women and their families? Did 
the government not think that these women were also hoping to 
benefit from the new measures, however limited they may be, just 
like other women? What about the thousands of self-employed 
workers who were also forgotten? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to Statistics Canada, self-employed workers account 
for 18% to 20% of the total workforce. The monitoring and 
assessment report confirms that this category of workers is 
experiencing strong growth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet, these workers are still excluded from the employment 
insurance plan. We also know that women account for over 40% of 
these self-employed workers. Almost one worker in five is not 
covered by the new employment insurance plan merely because of 
the nature of his or her work, and that group is constantly 
growing in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier, I said that some workers were forgotten, excluded from 
the act. There is no question that the Liberal government and the 
Minister of Human Resources Development lack vision and are not 
very familiar with the realities of the labour market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet, in an HRDC release dated February 12, 1998, the then 
Minister of Human Resources Development and current Minister for 
International Trade said that one of the objectives of the 
employment insurance reform was to adapt the plan to the new 
realities of the labour market. The following is an excerpt from 
that release: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The objectives of the employment insurance reform were to reduce 
costs and modernize the plan to better reflect the social and 
economic realities facing all Canadians. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not what is happening, because self-employment is 
also part of the new social and economic realities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government and the minister are also acting in bad 
faith. During the last election campaign, the Prime Minister 
himself said the following during an interview given to the 
<I>Canadian Press</I>: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We realized that it was not a good decision in the sense that we 
should not have done it. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister was referring to the cuts made by his 
government to the employment insurance plan.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Even Minister Coderre said “After a majority Liberal government 
is elected, we are going to re-establish the process and ensure 
that the changes are appropriate and respond in large part to the 
realities and needs of the population”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Employment insurance has become a privilege for the women of 
Quebec and of Canada.  This is why the Bloc Quebecois concludes 
that employment insurance reform has been a double, nay, a 
triple, failure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With a view to shouldering greater responsibility for the 
disadvantaged, a fair and equitable distribution of the billions 
of dollars in the employment insurance fund in the hands of the 
Liberal government, with a view to taking into consideration the 
endlessly increasing numbers of people living below the poverty 
line, with a view to helping poor families in desperate and 
terribly urgent need, with a view to providing the children of 
Quebec and of Canada with three meals a day, the Bloc Quebecois 
would have preferred the government to have presented two 
separate bills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first of these would focus on dealing with the urgent 
situations to which I have referred, like the mothers of 
premature babies who cannot take advantage of the new provisions. 
The second would concentrate on administration of the employment 
insurance fund.  This approach would provide a prompt response to 
the needs of the forgotten members of society, while leaving the 
more technical matters to be debated in committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In its desire to share the wealth, and in its great magnanimity, 
the government prefers to gets its hands immediately on the huge 
surplus in the fund, and to forget about the people, to forget 
about all its fine promises, to forget about the dire living 
conditions into which it is forcing families in need in Quebec 
and in the rest of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I again call upon the government on behalf of my colleagues in 
the Bloc Quebecois for justice and social equity.  Rest assured 
that the Bloc Quebecois is still prepared to pass improvements to 
the program quickly, separate from the debate on administration 
of the fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B> I would like to remind my 
colleagues, especially the new members, that they should not 
refer to other members in the House by their names. Ministers 
should be referred to by their departments and other members by 
the names of their ridings. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK183"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
would be remiss if I did not congratulate you on your 
appointment.  I hope that you enjoy your appointment and that you 
find these speeches utterly fascinating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am somewhat reluctant to get into this subject because I am 
from Toronto.  Toronto is of course the place that everyone loves 
to hate.  Indeed, there are times when my colleagues, 
particularly those from the maritimes, express some sentiments that, 
shall we say, may not be Toronto-friendly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me take a few moments to discuss the goals of EI and how 
changes in the bill support those goals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the House knows, the unemployment insurance act was first 
designed in 1940 as a safety net and as an income support for 
Canadians temporarily out of work.  Since then it has evolved. It 
has allowed workers and their families to remain attached to the 
labour market, staving off, in many cases, a period of 
dislocation and financial worry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the years, it has changed dramatically.  Our employment 
insurance system has become a far more sophisticated entity as it 
attempts to respond to market realities.  Some of the changes to 
EI actually resulted in market distortions and had to be 
addressed.  In 1996 we updated the system to better reflect 
market realities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The objectives of our EI reform were to make the system fair, 
reduce dependency, help low income families, ensure the program 
was sustainable, encourage active employment and reduce market 
distortions. 
There were a number of bizarre situations wherein clearly it was 
better to be on EI.  We would therefore have the ironic situation 
of EI creating unemployment rather than creating employment. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1605"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT64"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of these goals have been achieved and are as important 
today as they were in 1996.  We promised Canadians that we would 
carefully monitor and assess the changes to see if they were 
working as intended.  In fact that is in the legislation.  We 
always promised to make adjustments as needed, and the time has 
arrived.  Since the reform it is clear that many elements such as 
the divisor rule and the family supplement are working well and 
that other parts of the program need some fine tuning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We listened carefully to the concerns of Canadians about the EI 
program.  In fact, as other members have pointed out, this was an 
election issue during the last two or three elections.  Members 
such as the hon. member for Fredericton have articulated concerns 
here and elsewhere that are reflected in the bill. Canadians have 
told us about some of their difficulties with some elements of 
EI.  Some elements need adjustment to ensure the effectiveness of 
the program.  We have responded with concrete and progressive 
changes that reflect today's economic realities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The clawback was originally implemented to discourage high 
income claimants from claiming benefits year after year.  The 
member for Mississauga West repeatedly pointed out in the House 
and elsewhere that the threshold was far too low.  Once the bill 
is passed it will raise the net income level at which clawback 
applies for repeat claimants from $39,000 to $48,750.  In future 
only higher income Canadians will face repayment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Middle income workers who need to claim EI will have more money 
to spend because we are raising the income threshold at which 
clawback begins.  The vast majority of middle income earners have 
contributed to the system all of their lives without ever drawing 
benefits.  Yet under the current system, we claw back the very 
first time an individual makes a claim.  This is using a 
sledgehammer to kill a fly.  By definition first time claimants 
are not dependent on EI.  They are not the people who are using 
EI as an income supplement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also removing the clawback for those collecting special 
benefits.  Pregnancy or illness should not affect one's 
entitlement.  Special benefits are designed for Canadians who are 
too sick to work and for those who stay at home to care for a 
newborn or an adopted child.  These are not the people using EI 
as an annual income supplement and there is certainly no reason 
to penalize new parents or people who are too sick to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By changing the clawback provision we will be helping three 
broad groups of Canadians.  First, middle income groups will 
benefit primarily due to the change in the threshold.  Second, 
Canadians receiving special benefits will no longer have to repay 
any of those benefits.  Third, first time claimants will be 
exempt from benefit repayment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition the bill would eliminate the intensity rule.  The 
rule provided that the more frequent a claim, the greater the 
reduction in the percentage benefit to which one was entitled. 
The rule has proven to be ineffective with the unintended 
consequence of being punitive.  The elimination of this rule 
should be of the greatest benefit to seasonal workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Simultaneously it is hoped that the raising of the clawback and 
the elimination of the intensity rule will not mean a return to 
business as usual.  Employment insurance cannot be a substitute 
for a job.  It cannot make it impossible for a low wage employer 
to set up shop in a region.  A prospective employer should not 
find himself or herself competing with EI.  Otherwise it becomes 
self-defeating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should look at the reduction in EI premiums from $3.07 to 
$2.25.  Every 10 cents costs the federal treasury $700 million, 
cumulatively a $6.4 billion tax reduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some say that the government has eliminated the deficit and is 
now paying off the national debt on the backs of the workers.  It 
is true that EI is going into general revenues and for good 
reason.  There is no separate bank account for EI when times get 
tough, which they will sooner or later.  All taxpayers of Canada, 
whether they are employers or employees, will be obligated to 
unemployed workers.  There is no better guarantor than the 
Government of Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians in every province and territory will benefit from the 
improvements to the Employment Insurance Act.  The changes are in 
keeping with the values that Canadians hold dear, values like 
taking care of each other and looking out for one another in 
times of need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we designed the employment insurance system, we wanted to 
do more than just merely insure people's wages.  We wanted to get 
them back to work.  However a concern echoed by many Canadians is 
that the design that we have can be improved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is about ensuring that the system continues to work 
well and is responsive to those who are most in need.  It is 
about ensuring that the system responds to the needs and 
realities of working people.  The bottom line is that EI must be 
there for Canadians. It must be there for those people who have 
contributed and who now need our help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Taken together, the changes to the intensity rule and the 
clawback will improve our ability to address the original goals 
of EI, which were to ensure fairness, to help people return to 
work quickly and to reduce dependency without penalizing those 
most in need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The simple fact is that our employment insurance reforms were in 
the right direction and these reforms are even more in the right 
direction.  Employment insurance is working but it will always be 
a work in progress. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to specifically acknowledge the members for 
Fredericton and Mississauga West, who in our caucus repeatedly 
brought forward these issues.  I congratulate the relevant 
ministers on their willingness to be responsive to members of 
caucus and indeed members of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why I will be voting for the bill and I would encourage 
other members to do so as well.

<P><A NAME="LINK184"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean—Saguenay, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am very excited to rise today for two reasons, one 
being that it is the first opportunity I have to speak in the 
House since I was re-elected. The other reason has to do with the 
relevance and importance of the employment insurance issue to my 
region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I rise not only as a parliamentarian, but also as a former 
bush pilot who has had to rely on employment insurance in the 
past. I will put the problem in context. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have experienced 
in the Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean area since last July has to do 
with the fact that, under the act, employment insurance zones 
have to be reviewed every five years. I did not lose any time in 
making representations, saying that the status quo had to be 
maintained, which meant that people had to work a minimum of 420 
hours to be eligible for 33 weeks of benefits. I was not the only 
one thinking this way, since other parliamentary colleagues 
shared that opinion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my region, Human Resources Development Canada, through its economist, 
recommended to the minister that the status quo be maintained. 
Why? Not just for the sake of it, but rather because it matched the 
reality of our region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To our surprise, when the HRDC data were made public on July 1, 
it was not 420 hours any more that people needed to work to 
qualify for 33 weeks of benefits but rather 525 hours, and for 
how many weeks? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gérard Asselin:</B> Twenty-one weeks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphan Tremblay:</B> My colleague from Charlevoix, who faces 
the same situation in his riding, knows it is for 21 weeks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This might seems like a very innocent series of figures for 
members here in the House, but for many families, many workers 
and many employers, these figures can have major implications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have tried to determine the loss of potential revenue for my 
region, statistically, as far as the money and the premiums we 
pay are concerned. As a good member of parliament, I thought “I 
will go get this information”. I contacted the HRDC 
economist. Who did he refer me to? To the department's chief 
actuary in Ottawa, who came to the riding to explain why this 
unexpected change was made, in summer when everybody was on 
holidays. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Much to my disappointment, we did not get any appropriate 
answer. The officials from the department led us to believe that 
it was the employability figures that explained the new ways of 
doing things. In short, it was a completely unsatisfactory 
argument.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, people protested, not only in my riding but in the 
riding of my colleague from Charlevoix. They were also protests 
from the north shore, the Lower St. Lawrence and the Gaspé 
Peninsula, where the same situation prevailed. In view of the flurry 
of protests, but also, probably and unfortunately, because there 
was a general election in the offing, the minister concluded that 
transitional measures were necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did we need transitional measures? So that our workers could 
get used to it. I completely disagree with the idea that workers 
have to get used to poverty. This is totally unacceptable to me. 
Nobody can get used to poverty and we will see more of it with 
this legislation and the new regional realities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was talking with the minister and she told me “Stéphan, the 
solution is not unemployment but employment”. I totally agree. I 
too believe that employment is the solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this country, in certain sectors, as we can see in my region 
or in my colleague's region, the reality and the economic 
structure are such that employment insurance is a tool of 
development, since it makes up for deficiencies related to our 
economic structure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the tourism industry, for example, summer is the high season. 
Unfortunately, the season is rather short. Some would say that 
the season should be extended. We are working on it. Serge 
Plourde, the president of the Association touristique régionale, 
was telling me that the government must absolutely understand 
that keeping these new regulations, which make employment 
insurance less and less accessible, will have major impacts on 
the tourism industry. People are unable to qualify or to make 
ends meet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Come February, when no more income is coming in and you do not 
qualify for social assistance because you own a house or a car, 
what are you supposed to live on? Air? That is what is going to 
happen. According to the tourism industry, this will result in an 
increase in employee turnover, which will have a serious impact 
on a fast expanding industry that is trying to extend the season, 
as many would like it to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same is true in agriculture and the forestry industry. There 
is no way to prevent the ground from freezing.  It is 
unfortunate, but that is the way it is.  I am a former bush 
pilot, and in the bush, we land on water.  When the lakes freeze, 
the season is dead. That is the way it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has to take its role seriously in committee.  The 
Secretary of State for Amateur Sport mentioned this in the 
election.  Right off, the government said it was prepared to 
further relax its bill, to use the words of the secretary of 
state, “if well reasoned and justified arguments are brought 
forward”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If my fellow citizens are given the opportunity to explain in 
committee, I promise that they will provide well reasoned and 
justified arguments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the same vein, the Secretary of State for Amateur Sport made 
a personal commitment to apply corrective measures to the 
Employment Insurance Act.  He said, moreover: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once a Liberal majority is elected— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think this is what we have here. 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—we will reinstate the process and make sure that the changes 
are effective and meet the needs, for the most part, of the 
people of the Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean and Canadians as a 
whole...I have made a commitment to change the law and we will 
see to it. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean, that is my home. I would be 
prepared, perhaps, to forgive a government that imposed time 
allocation today in the context of this very important debate if 
it were responsible and in committee the public had the 
opportunity to speak and present well reasoned and justified 
arguments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I find hard to justify is that on July 1, 2000 the 
government introduced a new measure that for the people at home 
brings big changes.  Why did the government want to cut 
employment insurance?  It is all the harder to comprehend given 
that the fund's coffers are overflowing.  We are not in difficult 
economic times.  We will be, in the Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean 
region, because this will have phenomenal consequences, not only 
for the workers, but for the employers as well.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-2, an 
act to amend the Employment Insurance Act and the Employment 
Insurance (Fishing) Regulations, be read the second time and 
referred to a committee.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bryon Wilfert (Oak Ridges, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to congratulate you on your appointment to the chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my pleasure to speak on Bill C-2, particularly because the 
changes to the employment insurance legislation will make a 
tremendous difference in the lives of Canadian families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As chair of the greater Toronto area caucus, I can vouch for the 
fact that colleagues in our caucus have been enunciating the 
issue for quite a while and have indicated our support for the 
changes, particularly with regard to the intensity rule and the 
clawback. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Overall we know our EI reforms are working well, but we also 
know that we need to update the system to better meet the needs 
of working families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The vast majority of Canada's working families confront a broad 
range of challenges that they cannot easily solve alone.  Today 
many mothers and fathers work outside the home and discussions 
about child care are commonplace.  There is no doubt that the 
workforce has changed dramatically over the past few decades and 
our employment insurance system must change with the changing 
needs.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When unemployment insurance was created in the 1940s most 
employees were male.  Today women make up nearly half the 
workforce.  In the 1940s most women stayed at home and cared for 
their children.  Today dual income couples make up about 40% of 
the working population.  It is a fact of modern life that both 
parents working is now the norm and not the exception. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time the struggle to meet both work and family 
responsibilities is a top concern for Canadian men and women. 
Forty per cent of Canadian workers report a high level of work 
and family stress.  This is significantly higher than just 10 
years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we listen carefully to Canadians and their concerns about the 
EI program, it would seem clear that we must find new ways to 
make our system more responsive to the challenges facing today's 
families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government recognizes that today's parents find it difficult 
to balance the demands of caring for children and making a 
living.  For children to get the best start in life, parents need 
the time and the resources to nurture them.  This is why on 
December 31, 2000, we enhanced the EI parental benefits to allow 
a parent to stay at home with a newborn child for up to one year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is also why we proposed to support parents under the bill 
by eliminating the clawback for Canadians collecting special 
benefits under EI.  Canadians use special benefits when they are 
too sick to work or when they are at home to care for their 
newborn or newly adopted children.  We realize that the benefit 
repayment system was unduly limiting the assistance Canadian 
families could receive at a time when they needed the most help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The clawback was designed to discourage high income earners from 
collecting benefits year after year, not to discourage parents 
from using maternity and parental benefits.  We do not want to 
penalize parents who stay home to spend more time with their 
young children, or people who are too sick to work.  Canadians 
who collect special benefits will no longer have to repay any of 
the benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, middle income Canadian workers will have more money 
to spend on their families because we are moving to one 
threshold, $48,750 of net income.  The repayment will be no more 
than 30% of their net income in excess of the threshold. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are proposing to eliminate the intensity rule which reduces a 
person's EI benefit rate by one percentage point for every 20 
weeks of benefits he or she has collected in the previous five 
years.  Depending on the number of weeks of benefits paid in 
previous years, a person's benefit rate would drop from the usual 
55% to 54% to a minimum of 50%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By eliminating the intensity rule we will help workers who have 
to rely on EI more often than they would like because job 
opportunities in their communities may be scarce.  These workers 
will no longer be penalized, which means they will have more 
money for their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rules will also be adjusted to make it easier for parents to 
qualify for regular benefits after returning to the workforce 
following an extended absence to care for young children.  In 
essence, the rules will make it easier for parents to qualify for 
EI regular benefits if they lose their job during the difficult 
period of transition into the labour market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we are extending the look back period for 
re-entrants.  Claimants who have received maternity and parental 
benefits in the four years prior to the current look back period 
will require the same number of hours as other clients to be 
eligible for regular benefits.  Combined with extended parental 
benefits, these further changes are good news for new parents and 
will give parents the choice of spending more time at home with 
their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the EI premium rate has been reduced by 15 cents 
to $2.25, putting more money into the pockets of Canadian 
families.  This change may seem small and insignificant, but it 
is the seventh consecutive reduction and has translated into 
billions of dollars in savings for employees and employers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These amendments enhance a number of important initiatives the 
government has put in place to help Canadian families. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1630"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT69"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In earlier EI reform, we introduced the family supplement.  With 
the supplement, claimants from low income families with children 
can receive up to 80% of their insured earnings.  Nearly 200,000 
Canadian families benefited from this measure in 1999-2000. 
Another important initiative is the national child benefit, which 
makes it possible for families to break away from poverty. 
Providing more income benefits and services outside the welfare 
system makes easier for families to support children while 
remaining part of the workforce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bottom line is that easing financial pressures on Canadian 
families may lead to better environments for their children, more 
opportunities for parents and a better chance for the family to 
improve its overall quality of life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These amendments to the employment insurance program are good 
news for Canada's hardworking families.  They reflect our 
government's strong commitment to build new opportunities for 
Canadians that reward work and strengthen families.  These 
changes will let thousands of mothers and fathers help care for 
their children during the critical first months of life.  They 
will alleviate a major source of economic pressure on working 
families and they will put the country's policies more in line 
with the realities facing today's families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support these amendments and ask the House to consider them.

<P><A NAME="LINK191"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, before 
getting into the heart of the matter, I would like to take a few 
seconds to thank the constituents of Laurentides for having once 
again put their trust in me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the third time in a row, the people of my riding have chosen 
me as their representative in the House of Commons.  I am 
profoundly touched by this great vote of confidence.  As I did 
during my two previous terms of office, I will do everything in 
my power to serve them as best I can.  I promise to take all the 
necessary steps to represent their interests in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will start fulfilling that promise right away because, as 
usual, this government is once again trying to take us for a ride 
with Bill C-2. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For many years now, the employment insurance issue has been a 
priority for the Bloc Quebecois.  It is normal because the EI 
program helps people who are in need or who, periodically or for 
conjunctural reasons, have to rely on it because they have no 
income. We are talking mostly about self employed workers, 
seasonal workers, workers in regions, young people and women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois has been fighting for years against the 
federal government's plan to grab the surplus in the employment 
insurance fund, a plan that has now become a reality with Bill 
C-2. 
Let us say it as it is: with Bill C-2, the federal government is 
about to literally establish and legalize the misappropriation of 
$30 billion in funds. This money does not belong to it. This $30 
billion belong to the unemployed, workers and employers, period. 
This fund was not created to save money and to create a surplus 
in order to pay off the deficit and now the debt of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With such a surplus in the employment insurance account, the 
people of Quebec and Canada were expecting major changes to the 
employment insurance plan. With Bill C-44, the predecessor of 
Bill C-2, which was introduced just before the election was 
called last fall, the Bloc quickly realized that such was not the 
case. History is repeating itself with Bill C-2, which 
contains only cosmetic changes. Bill C-2 is almost a carbon copy 
of Bill C-44. There are some minor changes here and there, but 
almost nothing to answer to the real needs of workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois has not been the only party to denounce Bill 
C-2. Advocacy groups for the workers and the unemployed also 
denounced this bill. They think that the government is not trying 
to resolve the real problems and that the changes proposed are 
far from being enough. The main problem—eligibility for the 
plan—remains unsolved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In its arguments, the government is basically saying that Bill 
C-2 is a major reform of employment insurance, because, based on 
government estimates, it will cost $200 million this year, $450 
million next year and $500 million in 2002-03.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is plain and simple hypocrisy. It is playing the people of 
Quebec and Canada for fools, nothing else. Just imagine a 
situation where I pick $100 directly out of your pockets but, 
being a very generous person, I give you back $8. That is how 
generous this government is. That is exactly what it wants to do 
with this so-called employment insurance reform. Moreover, as I 
said earlier, it is running away with the employment insurance 
fund and its $30 billion, and the population and the Bloc 
Quebecois should say thank you to the government? We say never. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More specifically, it means that, based on a $6 billion a year 
surplus in the employment insurance fund, the government would 
only give back 8% of the amount it picks each year from the pockets 
of the unemployed, and we should be thankful for that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Employment insurance has become a payroll tax, because the 
government refuses to give back to the unemployed and the workers 
what is owed to them and is continuing to accumulate surpluses at 
their expense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government obviously does not feel for the unemployed and 
those left behind in the employment insurance reform. The 
measures contained in this bill do not adequately address the 
problems caused by the plan, particularly as they relate to 
seasonal and regional workers, young people, women and 
self employed workers, and here is why. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To begin with, the government has clearly decided to ignore 
self-employed workers, yet their numbers keep increasing on the 
labour market. According to Statistics Canada, the percentage of 
self-employed workers went up from 12% in 1976 to 18% in 1999, so 
that nearly one worker in five  is self employed. The EI 
plan ignores these workers. It is as if they did not exist, while 
there are more and more of them in the Canadian economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about students now, our future, those who will forge 
our society of tomorrow. Our young people must have access to 
higher education if they are to satisfy the needs of the new 
economy. Between the rhetoric of this government, which claims to 
be very worried by our students' fate, and reality, there is a 
world of difference. The EI legislation does not help all our 
students to study, on the contrary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we all know, more and more students pay for their studies by 
working part time, and full time during the summer. They pay 
premiums without even being able to get any benefits under the 
plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last census in 1996 revealed that there were more than 2.8 
million full time students. The 1999 control and evaluation 
report states that nearly one million Canadians earned less than 
$2,000, which entitled them to a refund. However, only 40% of 
those applied for it, 42% of whom were under 25 years of age. In 
other words, nearly 2.6 million students had to contribute to the 
EI system while trying to pay for their studies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The EI eligibility rules are a real orphan clause. 
Young newcomers face more restrictions in applying for benefits. 
Instead of a minimum of 300 hours, that is 15 hours a week for 20 
weeks, they need 910 hours, which amounts to 35 hours a week for 
26 weeks. It is utterly unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On top of that, how can one explain that, with a plan that is 
supposed to help those who pay premiums, benefits have dropped 
28% between 1993 and 1999, and the number of people collecting 
regular benefits has dropped 52.4%? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can one explain that, in 2001, having a child is something 
that should be penalized, according to the federal government? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the government, having a child is something that should now 
be penalized. To punish mothers, the federal government and the 
Minister of Human Resources Development, who is a woman, have 
decided that, to collect the maternity or parental benefits, 600 
hours will soon be required. Whereas a worker in a region with 
high unemployment will be entitled to benefits after 420 hours of 
work, a woman in the same area will have to work at least 600 
hours to collect maternity benefits. Up to now, 300 hours, or 15 
hours a week during 20 weeks, were required. Where is the moral 
sense of this government?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Being a responsible political party that wants to meet the needs 
of the unemployed and the workers, the Bloc Quebecois is prepared 
to pass Bill C-2 quickly on one crucial condition, that it be 
divided into two separate bills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first bill, as suggested by the Bloc Quebecois, would meet 
the urgent needs of the workers not appropriately covered under 
the current plan. Among other things, the Bloc Quebecois would 
want the new bill to eliminate discrimination against younger 
workers and newcomers on the labour market—910 hours to 
qualify—to increase benefits from 55% to 60% of insurable 
earnings, to level the playing field for seasonal workers and to 
eliminate the waiting period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second bill would include long term measures to be debated 
in committee. The Bloc Quebecois is in favour of an independent 
employment insurance fund and coverage for the self employed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, if the bill is not divided, there is no way that 
the Bloc Quebecois can support such a clear misappropriation of 
$30 billion from the EI fund and a discriminatory bill that is 
totally inconsistent with the needs of the unemployed and the 
workers of Quebec and Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK192"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
very pleased to join in the debate with respect to the bill, 
which is designed to improve our employment insurance program so 
that it will be of more help to unemployed people.  Like my 
colleague from Oak Ridges who spoke earlier, I will focus my 
attention on the parts of the bill that actually deal with 
families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think you know, Mr. Speaker, that this government has focused 
attention on children and families from when it was first elected 
in 1993.  In fact, in the depths of the budget cutting exercise 
that we went through, new money was being flowed into prenatal 
and post-natal programs and into support for children.  In my own 
riding for example, the family enrichment centre, which is now 
the family resource centre, received considerable new funds in 
those times, so the government has a record of supporting 
children and strengthening families.  This is the sort of 
investment which, by the way, is even more valuable in difficult 
times because it allows us to invest truly in the future, our 
children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case with respect to EI, there are a number of important 
changes that affect families.  Already in terms of supporting 
children we have created the national child benefit, one of the 
most innovative new federal-provincial-territorial programs of 
the last few decades, which is aimed directly at fighting child 
poverty.  I think members on all sides of the House agree it is 
something which we must tackle at this time.  In terms of the EI 
legislation, that child benefit helps parents stay in the labour 
market while they are bringing up their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have improved benefits and services for low income families 
with children.  We have reduced the barriers that many low income 
families face in moving from social assistance to the workforce. 
Particularly in Ontario there are these serious barriers with 
this discrimination against families on social assistance, 
particularly when they get to the point where they can move into 
low paying positions so they can move up the wage scale. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The child benefit is increasing federal benefits to children by 
$1.7 billion a year for low income families.  This means better 
food, clothing and shelter for children in those families.  It 
also means a better and fairer chance for those children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To make sure that we can do an even better job in helping 
children break out of the cycle of poverty, we will provide a 
third significant investment in the national child benefit by the 
year 2001.  This means that by 2004 the maximum benefit received 
by a low income family will increase to $2,400 for the first 
child and $2,200 for each other child.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parents in a two child family, by the year 2004, could receive 
up to $4,600 to assist them in bringing up their children.  Many 
other programs are also helping Canadian families.  In this case, 
the EI program has a role to play.  We are talking about families 
and keeping the parents in the workforce or, when they are out of 
the workforce, allowing them to get back into the workforce as 
effectively as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One measure is the family supplement, which tops up benefits to 
a maximum of 80% for claimants in low income families with 
children.  Again the emphasis is on families with children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As of December 31, 2000, we enhanced EI parental benefits to 
provide parents with the flexibility to spend more time with 
their young children during the crucial early years of life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed changes in the bill to the EI program will take us 
one step further by providing more money to the families of 
claimants and fixing some of the problem areas that Canadians 
have identified in the EI program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have learned that the intensity rule, which was designed to 
reduce reliance on EI and increase incentives to work, simply has 
not proved to be effective.  The intensity rule reduced repeat 
claimants' benefit rates by one percentage point for each 20 
weeks of benefits claimed in the past five years.  This feature 
has not discouraged the repeated use of EI benefits in part 
because many workers in areas of high unemployment simply cannot 
find other jobs in the off season. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill before us proposes to eliminate the intensity rule 
altogether.  I campaigned on that and I support it.  This does 
not mean that we accept high unemployment levels in the 
communities concerned.  Our challenge is to work together with 
the provinces and territories, business groups and community 
leaders to come up with local solutions that will expand working 
opportunities in areas of high unemployment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have also told us that the clawback sometimes reduces 
the benefits of middle income clients.  When this happens it 
means that money is taken away from many families for whom money 
is tight.  The bill proposes to raise the net income level at 
which the clawback applies to repeat claimants from $39,000 to 
$48,750.  In future only high income Canadians will face any 
repayment of employment benefits.  This will provide relief to 
middle income earners who are temporarily unemployed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians also told us that it was not fair to claw back the 
benefits of people who are too sick to work or who want to take 
time off with their newborn or newly adopted child.  The bill 
would exempt those collecting maternity, parental and sickness 
benefits from having to repay any benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of parents returning to work after caring for young 
children also told us that the current EI provisions dealing with 
re-entrance make it hard for them to qualify for regular 
benefits.  Consequently the bill would create a level playing 
field by extending the so-called look back period for re-entrant 
parents by four years.  This means that claimants who have 
received EI, maternity or parental benefits in the four years 
prior to the current two year look back, will require the same 
number of hours as other claimants to be eligible for regular 
benefits. This is only fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This change makes particularly good sense in the light of the 
government's commitment to families with children through 
initiatives, such as the extension of parental benefits, which 
are designed to help parents balance the demands of work and the 
demands of family while their children are very young. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should also be noted that as a part of the bill we propose to 
modify the fishing regulations to ensure that self-employed 
fishers can take advantage of the enhanced maternity, parental 
and sickness benefits.  This measure would be retroactive to 
December 31, 2000, the same date the enhancements came into 
effect for other EI claimants.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Many parents told us that they wanted the EI premium rates to 
be kept at a moderate level so that they could keep more of the 
pay they earn to buy the necessities of life.  Accordingly the 
premium rate has been reduced by 15 cents from $2.40 in 2000 to 
$2.25 in 2001.  This is the seventh consecutive reduction in 
premiums, resulting in billions of dollars in savings for workers 
and their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Taken together I believe these changes represent good news for a 
large number of EI claimants and their families.  They leave more 
money in the pockets of families.  They will protect first time 
special benefits and middle income EI claimants from having to 
repay their benefits.  They will also support the critical 
transition back to the labour force for parents who take time out 
to take care of their children.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>EMPLOYMENT INSURANCE ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK197">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-2, an 
act to amend the Employment Insurance Act and the Employment 
Insurance (Fishing) Regulations, be read the second time and 
referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK198"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gérard Asselin (Charlevoix, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, this is my 
first speech of this 37th parliament. I have had the opportunity 
to rise on questions and comments a few times, but this is my 
first speech and it deals with Bill C-2, the employment insurance 
bill. It was the second bill to be introduced in the House of 
Commons since parliament reconvened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I must thank all the voters of Charlevoix, all the 
workers, all those who are unemployed and all the seasonal 
workers. We have fought relentlessly since the Axworthy 
reform—which became the Young reform and which has taken the 
names of other ministers since then—which was part of the 
government's electoral platform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister and the government said that as soon as 
parliament reconvened they were willing to correct their mistake 
and to make significant improvements to the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have before us today Bill C-2, which replaces Bill C-44. 
During the election campaign, the Prime Minister told us that the 
reason Bill C-44 did not pass third reading in the House of 
Commons was that the Bloc Quebecois refused to have this bill 
rammed through the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-44 was not passed at third reading because of a 
government strategy.  The Prime Minister decided to introduce a 
bill at the very end of the session in June, in order to give 
parliamentarians time to think about first, second and third 
readings, and perhaps royal assent, over the summer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seeing that the bill did not have the unanimous support of the 
House, of workers and employers in the regions, of social 
organizations, women's groups and so forth, the Prime Minister 
told himself that going into an election campaign with such a 
bill would be a surefire disaster. He decided that he would 
withdraw it and not introduce it at third reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the recent election campaign, he promised to introduce a 
bill, the one we are considering today, but parliamentarians are 
not being allowed to debate it in depth. The bill was supposed to 
have been extensively amended.  We have to get across to the 
government, especially the Minister of Human Resources 
Development and the Prime Minister, people's concerns about this 
bill which, in our view, is worthless. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1655"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT74"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our view, this bill only allows the government to correct 
part of its mistake.  In its reform, it had taken the intensity 
rules and reduced the rate from 55% to 50%.  Hence the penalty to 
seasonal workers of 1% a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister admitted that this was a mistake.  Many regions 
believed the government's promises, given the $30 billion surplus 
in the EI fund alone, and the budgetary surpluses of the 
government and the Minister of Finance because of cuts in 
transfer payments for health and education, in a wide variety of 
areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, Charlevoix was not taken in, 
because we have seen what happened in Gaspé, where there 
have been plant closings and unemployment has risen.  The 
government tried to solve the problem in Gaspé or soften its 
impact, at the expense of the north shore, the 
Saguenay—Lac-St-Jean and the Lower St. Lawrence, taking from them 
to give to Gaspé. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is more or less what the government has done so far.  It 
gives with one hand and takes away with the other.  In an attempt 
to compensate for the funds it would take to increase the number 
of insurable weeks in Gaspé, it decided to reorganize the 
economic regions and to combine the north shore and the Lower St. 
Lawrence, which has forced us into a transitional measure 
involving an unacceptable proposal for our seasonal workers.  We 
were, for example, proposed a figure of 525 hours worked for 21 
insurable weeks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Already, with the 420 hour requirement, six out of ten 
contributors to employment insurance are not entitled to it, that 
is, the seasonal workers in the tourist or forestry industry, in 
fisheries or some other area where employment is seasonal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the minister tells me “Sir, we would like to try extending 
the seasons in your area”, I would dearly love to put a dome 
over the peat bogs so that peat can be cut longer, but that is 
impossible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also looked into the possibility of enclosing the hills at 
the Saint-François river under a refrigerated dome so that there 
could be skiing on artificial snow until August, but that too is 
impossible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have also tried looking into various ways of carrying out 
logging operations in winter with 5, 6, 7 or 8 feet of snow, but 
that too is impossible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister asks us to extend our seasons, and I must mention 
the tourism industry. People who go camping celebrate Christmas 
in August, not on December 25, when campgrounds have long been 
closed. We can promote tourist attractions at various times of 
the year but, on a campground, Christmas is celebrated in August, 
not in December. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Human Resources Development, the Minister of 
National Revenue and the Secretary of State for Amateur Sport 
criss-crossed our regions during the election campaign to inform 
us of the transitional measures that they had put in place. They 
recognized that it would be difficult for those who had qualified 
with 525 hours for 21 weeks, because there would be a grey area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are now in that grey area. On February 15, people will stop 
getting EI benefits. In my riding, people are no longer getting 
EI benefits and they will probably not work before June 1. They 
now find themselves in that so-called grey area. These people 
have no income at all, yet, there is $30 billion in the 
employment insurance fund. People need their EI benefits to pay 
their rent and their food, to put bread and butter on the table. 
Right now they find themselves in the grey area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the coming days, Statistics Canada will probably tell us that 
the unemployment rate miraculously dropped in Charlevoix. It will 
be down in February, in March and probably in April. Statistics 
Canada will come up with these figures. Of course, the government 
is handing out fewer cheques, since people no longer qualify, 
since they are no longer entitled to benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When people no longer get EI benefits, the unemployment rate as 
determined by Statistics Canada drops by osmosis, but income 
security goes up in Quebec, since a number of these people have 
no other option than to go on welfare.

<A HREF="#LINKT75"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When welfare is involved, the bill is footed 100% by Quebecers, 
but EI premiums are in no way the property of the federal 
government.  In my view, the federal government has the authority 
to legislate, but not to interfere.  It is unfortunate  that we 
are being forced to debate this today in order to get the 
government to understand that the bill it is preparing to have 
passed can perhaps put right some of its mistakes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, when the government promised to look at the bill in 
depth, we in the Bloc Quebecois told it that the money belonged 
to employees and employers. We suggested a parliamentary 
committee to split the bill in two in order to correct the 
mistakes that were made when the intensity rule was lowered from 
55% to 50%.  If we correct this error, we can immediately improve 
the rule.  We would be favourable to raising the intensity rule 
to 60% instead of 50% or 55%.  We suggest that there be uniform 
eligibility criteria. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does a new entrant on the labour market need 910 hours to 
qualify for employment insurance?  Someone who works 32 to 35 
hours a week for 10 to 12 weeks and who pays premiums is not 
entitled to EI.  We want this abolished.  We want the number of 
hours to be the same for everyone—300.  Things would be much 
easier then. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also suggest that the two week waiting period be abolished. 
Why two weeks?  We meet someone who has just lost his job and 
received his last week's pay, and he tells us that he has to wait 
two weeks.  It takes a month for the person to begin receiving 
benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois is going to vote against Bill C-2, although 
we know that it will improve things and correct the mistakes of 
the government, which dipped into the fund.  We know, however, 
that the bill allows the government to help itself to the surplus 
in the employment insurance fund.  This is unacceptable.  We have 
always been critical of this, as have trade unions and social 
organizations.  For our part, we will continue to speak out 
against this practice.  On behalf of the seasonal workers in 
Charlevoix, we will be voting against this bill because we think 
it is unacceptable.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cannis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have congratulated the other 
Chairs.  However, this is the first time I can congratulate you 
on your new assignment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout the debate today we heard members from both sides of 
the House talk about the technicalities of the debate, the 
statistics, the hours, the payments, the clawbacks, et cetera. 
What I would like to do is talk a little about the contributions 
to the employment insurance program.  Then I want to go back 40 
to 50 years and talk about where the program was then, where it 
is today, how it has changed, the purpose of it and why we had to 
make changes to it after we came to government in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As you will recall, Mr. Speaker, you were a member of parliament 
at that time as well.  We did a mass review of overhauling the 
system.  At that time, my colleagues from Brampton Centre and 
from Parkdale—High Park and I worked together to modernize the 
program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member from Calgary West made some comments which I would 
like to respond to.  The member of the Bloc from Mercier also 
made some comments with respect to the program.  I say to my 
colleagues that it is appropriate that we take this opportunity, 
not just to talk about the bill itself which will go to committee 
and changes will be made, but to tell the audience out there what 
the EI premium is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to start out by saying that in 1993 the EI premium was 
pegged at $3.30 per $100.  That is what Mr. Mulroney and the 
current leader of the Conservative Party left us with.  Over 
seven years that premium has declined to $2.25 per $100, as 
was mentioned earlier by my colleague from Peterborough.  If 
we add those pennies, as someone called them, which are well over 
$1.05 per $100, and we look at the two million people who have 
found employment since 1993, they add up to billions of dollars.

<A HREF="#LINKT76"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a fundamental difference here that the opposition 
refuses to acknowledge.  In 1993 Canada had an unemployment rate 
of 11.4%.  Today, thank God, we have an unemployment rate of 6.5% 
or 6.6%.  In the last seven years over two million people have 
come back into the employment factor of the equation.  What does 
that mean?  Simply put, prior to 1993 there were two million 
people taking money out of the system.  That is why the system 
was in a shambles.  Now over two million people are putting money 
into the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fortunately, today we are in the position of having surpluses 
with which we can reinvest, surpluses that unemployed people have 
an opportunity to access.  Earlier the member from the Bloc 
talked about higher education.  These surpluses go toward helping 
our youth get higher levels of education, or retraining, or 
perhaps to become a computer programmer, or an engineer or a 
graphics designer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many people have a problem when they talk about the EI 
contributions.  As a former employer part of my obligation was to 
make contributions to the Canada pension program and to the 
unemployment insurance program.  I am willing to bet that most of 
the members in this place, as well as the average Canadian, drive 
a car and own a home.  They buy some form of insurance.  I am 
tired of hearing comments from the opposition, such as those made 
by the member for Calgary West.  He said that we were robbing the 
people.  The member referred to the pages, which was uncalled for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I drive a car.  Year in and year out I pay an auto insurance 
premium.  I wish never to have an accident.  I have insurance for 
when and if I need to access it.  Nobody is paying into this 
employment insurance program with the intent of accessing it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are people in the Atlantic provinces, Ontario, British 
Columbia and other parts of Canada who unfortunately are seasonal 
workers.  There are single mothers in Ontario, Saskatchewan and 
other parts of Canada who work part time to subsidize whatever 
incomes they have so they can buy boots for their children for 
the winter.  Perhaps they wish to subsidize school programs which 
are being cut right, left and centre in Ontario, for example. Are 
we going to penalize single mothers or single fathers who are 
trying to provide for their families?  Surely not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for the Bloc said earlier today that we are righting 
the wrong.  I remember my father saying that to err is human, to 
forgive divine.  Today we are trying to change that.  Today we 
are saying that maybe there was a mistake.  During the election 
campaign the Prime Minister, when was in the Atlantic provinces, 
said that we would correct it.  That is what is happening today. 
We are making the adjustments to this program through Bill C-2. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a problem when I hear the opposition talking about the 
surpluses.  I will go back to buying insurance.  If a person is a 
good driver, his or her insurance premium over the years will be 
reduced to some degree.  We contribute to the EI program and draw 
from it.  However, if the EI system is being continuously used 
then surely there will be some provisions to offset that in some 
form or another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It said in the 2000 monitoring and assessment report that in the 
year 1999-2000 about 400,000 jobs would be created.  Time will 
tell once the statistics come out.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at those 400,000 new primarily full time jobs. There 
will be 400,000 people who will no longer be accessing the 
system.  They will contributing to it.  No one would have thought 
seven years ago that we would be in this enviable position today 
talking about reinvesting in our country, reinvesting in higher 
education for our youth and reinvesting in health programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They talked about the Canada pension program.  Yes, there has 
been a slight increase.  When this government took over it knew 
that it had to do something about it.  The previous Conservative 
government and the leader of the Conservative Party refused to 
take the responsibility.  They had an opportunity to make those 
changes and come to an agreement with the provinces, but they 
chose not to.  They were afraid to.  We made that decision with 
the provinces.  Yes, there has been a small increase, but when we 
compare the decrease in EI contributions as opposed to the 
increase in Canada pension contributions, I think it is a pretty 
fair deal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What Canadians out there need to know is that any premium 
increase to the Canada pension program has to be done with the 
agreement of all provinces.  The government alone does not have 
the right to make that increase arbitrarily.  I am taking this 
opportunity, without going into the guts of Bill C-2, to tell 
Canadians this story so they will know that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People talk about the surpluses.  I am very happy to stand on 
this side of the House, as a representative of the government, to 
say what has been done with the surpluses and to say that we are 
not robbing Canadians.  It is a fair and equitable system, a 
system that has been in place since 1940 to support Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I encourage all members to support this new and 
changing legislation. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK200"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have followed 
the debates that have gone on since this morning with 
considerable interest, especially since the party in government 
invoked closure, with the aim of preventing us from speaking more 
and perhaps from looking more closely at the whole employment 
insurance system governing workers and work in Canada and Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Employment insurance, it must be understood, is a sort of mutual 
insurance, a kind of insurance frequently found in Quebec, 
although less and less so now, because what was mutual is being 
demutualized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government's approach and concept of the employment 
insurance plan was to guarantee real mutual insurance.  Thus, 
workers fearful about one day losing their job decided to 
contribute an amount of money in order to create a fund for 
themselves that would help them, in darker days, to continue 
their day to day existence, meet their obligations, the first of 
which is to eat.  That was the aim of employment insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, this government is incapable of revealing its 
true objectives to the people of Canada.  It is incapable of 
telling it like it is and incapable of saying that to eliminate 
the almost immeasurable accumulated debt of $680 billion, sales 
taxes or gasoline taxes, already fairly high, or income taxes had 
to be increased. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government would rather get its hands on the surplus that 
was generated to benefit the taxpayers, not to let the government 
use it to pay back the debt, the deficits that have accumulated 
over the years. The government's only concern is to show that 
federalism is profitable and that everything is fine, that the 
government is rolling over in clover. That is not true. The 
government is using money it should never have been allowed to 
grab. The auditor general recently said so.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The previous speaker pointed out that since the government has 
been in office the premiums of the employees have dropped from 
$3 to around $2. This is a significant amount of money to pour 
back in the economy. However, for some five years now, we could 
have maintained the current EI system without charging a penny 
more to the workers, because with the surplus we would have 
been able to meet the needs of all the EI contributors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, the government lacked the political will to 
increase the taxes in order to reduce the accumulated deficits. 
Instead, it chose to ignore the problem. 
Employment insurance rules have been changed; only 42% of people 
qualify for it. Yet, 100% of them pay premiums the minute they 
start working, but the government says nothing about this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is as if someone were to take out property insurance and the 
insurer were to say “If your property goes up in flames, you 
have four chances out of ten of getting paid, but you must pay 
100% of your premiums and pray God that your property will not go 
up in flames”. This is somewhat the same thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general recently came here and supported the 
opposition's arguments. There is no basis, no calculation to 
scientifically establish the workers' contribution rate for 
employment insurance. It is pulled out of a hat. Things are not 
so bad. Since much of our debt is owed to foreigners, with the 
fluctuation of interest rates on the international market, 
contributions to employment insurance are reduced or maintained 
at the same level for a while, without any kind of ability to 
objectively and correctly assess the needs of the plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly, if we constantly draw on the employment insurance 
fund to pay for the accumulated national debt of almost $600 
billion, we will never be able to contribute enough to pay off 
such a debt. Was this the true objective of the employment 
insurance plan when it was created? Let us not forget that it 
results from a federal-provincial agreement, from a 
constitutional amendment made in 1943, I believe, that 
transferred the whole employment insurance sector from provincial 
to federal authorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People put their confidence in the federal government. We now 
see the results. In Quebec, we are now used to this, and we no 
longer have any illusions about these people. 
That is why members on this side of the House would rather take 
off with what little they have left now, because in a few years 
we will have nothing left. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the health system, the federal government used to 
contribute 50% of the costs in the provinces. Now it is barely 
paying 15%, but it sets the standards. This is like inviting 
someone to a restaurant and footing the bill while the person 
decides on the menu. It takes some nerve to act like this. Such 
is the story of the party opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about women's issues, including parental leave, as 
they relate to this bill. There are studies—and the Liberals 
know them as well as I do—which show that women are paid less 
than men. This is not from me. Women are certainly aware of that 
situation, because they went all the way to the Federal Court of 
Appeal to defend the principle of pay equity. The government was 
paying women less than men. It was told so by a number of courts 
and administrative tribunals. The government threatened until the 
last minute to take the issue to the Supreme Court of Canada, to 
challenge the principle that equal work should mean equal pay for 
women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the same thing with employment insurance. The same old 
principles that have been governing the Liberals for eons are 
resurfacing. A pregnant worker is not entitled to benefits unless 
she has accumulated 600 hours of work. There is no exception to 
this rule. There are pregnant women who, because of the very 
nature of their work, because they are exposed to certain risks 
such as computers, radioactive rays and so on must, on the 
recommendation of their doctor, stop working before having 
accumulated 600 hours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill does not provide exceptions for such cases. No, the 
rules are very strict. It is always black and white for the party 
in office. That is the law and that is it. They make it and they 
impose it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals are really not exercising the wisdom of Solomon. 
The hon. member for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve is studying law in his 
spare time, but it is not a waste of time.

of time. He has become a legal expert who can be pretty 
convincing. He will tell members the same thing I am telling them 
now. We could have done away with EI contributions for several 
years, as the auditor general told us. The government would have 
been able to maintain the program. Now it is going to take $30 
billion from those who work hard to earn a living and use that 
money to pay off the debt Canada has accumulated over the years 
to cover this government's wild spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking here about $2.8 billion. I see you nodding in 
agreement, Mr. Speaker. The embassy in Tokyo cost $2.8 billion. 
Five thousand dollars does not even cover the value and the 
surface area of the embassy grounds. Such lavishness is just 
incredible. Yet, young women with young children who are 
unfortunate enough to lose their jobs are condemned to live in 
misery by this government. It has no qualms about letting these 
people starve. That is poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about poverty, that is the kind of poverty we are 
talking about, and not the poverty of the billionaire friend of 
the government who made only $250 million instead of $500 
billion on a government transaction involving a 40 year lease. 
He is not the one who is poor. The one who is poor is the woman 
who arrives at work one morning and is told that there is no 
job for her any more. It is the woman who is told by her physician that 
she must stop working because she is pregnant and unable to go 
on. That woman does a lot for society. I know my friends opposite 
are totally insensitive to this kind of misery.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Malpeque, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to have the opportunity to speak to Bill C-2.  To begin, 
I would like to comment on the last remark about Canada's 
embassies around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's embassies are very important, and the hon. member 
opposite knows that.  They are important in terms of trade 
relationships and creating jobs, which the bill is indeed related 
to.  Never mind the malarkey in terms of trying to make a fuss 
about the cost of an embassy.  They are an important part of the 
Canadian government.  I am glad they are there to represent 
Canada in our business relations and other relations around the 
world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also wonder why the hon. member opposite is so excited about 
our embassy when Quebec is out there setting up its own embassies 
and duplicating what is already there.  That is where the real 
waste is, in terms of the embassies that the Quebec government is 
establishing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, I welcome the opportunity to speak on Bill C-2.  I 
especially welcome the amendments to the act.  It is a very good 
step forward to improvements on the original bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quite a number of members on this side of the House had serious 
concerns about certain parts of the bill, especially the 
intensity rule.  That is why, in 1996, we welcomed the proposal 
to monitor the impacts of the bill.  Bill C-2, which is all about 
making positive changes where needed, is a result of that 
monitoring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want EI to work the way it was intended, and that is to offer 
temporary support to workers who are unemployed so they can 
rejoin the workforce. 
I am pleased that for the most part the provisions of the 
employment insurance program are working the way they were 
intended.

<A HREF="#LINKT80"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My contribution to the debate will be to explain the proposed 
changes to the intensity provisions.  The original thinking 
behind the intensity rule was to provide a greater incentive to 
work and to reduce dependence on EI as an income support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some thought the intensity rule would accomplish this by 
reducing the benefit rate of frequent claimants from 55% over 
time to 50%.  In other words, the benefit rate would be reduced 
by one percentage point for every 20 weeks of regular benefits 
collected over the past five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rule has proven to be ineffective.  The monitoring and 
assessment reports indicate that the proportion of EI benefits 
paid out to frequent claimants has remained stable at around 40%. 
There is a reason for that of course, and it is the availability 
of work in certain areas.  In a country like Canada we naturally 
have a lot of seasonal industries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has done much in terms of creating the economic 
conditions for the creation of jobs.  We got rid of the deficit. 
We have introduced new initiatives.  In my region we have better 
utilized the regional development agency, ACOA.  We are 
implementing the Atlantic investment partnership, and are 
basically there as a government trying to create more year round 
jobs, more full time jobs and longer periods of work for people 
in seasonal industries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These initiatives and others across Canada have improved the 
employment picture with the creation of over two million jobs 
since 1993.  However, Canada will always have seasonal industries 
which, by their very nature, require seasonal workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague, the member for Egmont, mentioned his 
riding and the seasonal workers there.  These are important 
industries.  Workers in the agriculture and fisheries only work 
at certain times of the year because of the nature of the 
industries and of our climate.  However, those workers are 
important to the economy.  They contribute to the economy in a 
very great way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, while the intensity provisions make sense in theory, 
in practice we have found that they do not curtail repeated use 
of the EI system, especially in areas where there are few 
opportunities for employment.  As a result, we are quite 
concerned that they have become a punitive measure.  I have also 
called the intensity rule a penalty on seasonal workers, and this 
bill proposes to change that and withdraw the penalty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill proposes to eliminate the intensity provision 
altogether and to reinstate the benefit rate at 55% for all 
claims.  These claims, as we said many times in the past, will be 
retroactive to October 1, 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government remains fully committed to the goals of the EI 
reforms introduced in 1996.  The program is called employment 
insurance.  It is designed to provide temporary income 
replacement and to help Canadians prepare for and obtain 
employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, the Canadian economy has been doing extremely well but not 
all workers enjoy the full benefits of a healthy economy.  Some 
areas in every region continue to have high rates of 
unemployment.  Workers in those areas deserve our assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask all hon. members in this place to note that these proposed 
changes will not affect just the Atlantic provinces.  Sometimes 
we are pegged with that image.  Eliminating the intensity 
provisions will benefit forestry workers in British Columbia, 
construction workers in Ontario and tourism workers in Quebec. It 
will put more money in the pockets of those workers so that they 
are better able to provide for their families.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>During this debate I would ask hon. members to keep in mind that 
EI is just one of a number of ways to help unemployed Canadians. 
I think we all agree that increasing employment opportunities is 
a partnership exercise involving the provinces, the territories, 
communities, and business and labour organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that seasonal workers very much want to increase their 
job prospects.  They understand that long term solutions will be 
found through improving their skills and the economic development 
in their particular regions.  The Liberal government will 
continue to strive in that direction, working with its partners 
to expand and diversify the local economies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments proposed in the bill will certainly help in terms 
of assisting those families, especially where there are seasonal 
industries with important workers in our economy.  I encourage 
all members to support these amendments so that the bill may pass 
quickly through the House, so that those people at work can 
contribute to our economy, and so that those people who work and 
contribute to our economy in those seasonal industries and have 
been unfairly penalized by the intensity rule will now see it 
withdrawn and will be able to receive full benefits, as is 
intended by these amendments. 
<P><A NAME="LINK202"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to have the opportunity to speak to this very important 
piece of legislation, a piece of legislation that has been a long 
time coming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I get into the legislation itself, I do want to take this 
opportunity to thank the people of Churchill riding for their 
support of myself and the staff in my office.  I believe that by 
re-electing me they were also showing support for the work that 
the staff in my office have done over the last three and a half 
years in acting and speaking on their behalf in the Parliament of 
Canada.  Churchill is a huge, very diverse riding, with 
aboriginal and non-aboriginal populations that are almost an even 
split.  There are industrial communities and very poor 
communities.  I truly thank the people from the riding for their 
show of support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Within the riding I have 31 first nation communities.  The 
unemployment rates in those communities are extremely high.  I am 
not talking about 15% to 20% unemployment.  I am talking 70%, 
80%, 90% or 95% unemployment in a number of those communities, so 
I can tell the House that it has been a very tough haul in the 
last few years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many who do work in those communities work at seasonal and part 
time employment.  A lot of that employment is reliant on winter 
roads:  logging and the shipping of equipment and goods over 
those roads while they are in place.  Others fish, trap and are 
guides at some of the best world class fishing and hunting 
lodges.  Others find work in the construction industry in the 
spring, summer and early fall, the only times that we are really 
able in the north to do a lot of those things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through no fault of their own, the seasonal and part time 
workers have suffered severely under this Liberal government's 
employment insurance strategy.  It is no wonder, because I 
listened to a previous Liberal colleague indicate that the 
Liberal government planned its program so that people would not 
be dependent on EI. I do not know which people on EI he knows, 
but most I know would gladly be working rather than be on EI. 
They do not plan their lives to be on employment insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that when a government has a warped sense of 
guidelines as to what a program is based on, chances are that it 
will come up with a program that does not meet the needs of the 
unemployed.  That is why we saw people struggling to survive on 
low EI payments or being forced to go on welfare.  Let us be 
clear about this:  when the government cut EI payments, the 
numbers on social assistance increased and the numbers using food 
banks increased.  In my riding alone, in the year 1998, EI 
benefits were reduced by just under $17 million.  A riding of 
about 78,000 people saw a reduction of $17 million in money 
coming in.  Most of those people had very low incomes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who suffered from this misguided Liberal program?  Those people 
exactly, those least able to cope:  the aboriginal and seasonal 
and part time workers and the women, pregnant or otherwise, were 
those whose suffering was greatest. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1735"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT82"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This program failed drastically to meet the needs of those 
people and not at a time when there was not money in the program 
to benefit those people.  With huge surpluses in the program, 
what did the government do?  It used those dollars to make it 
seem like the government, with its great planning, was reducing 
the deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was not the case.  It was not the government that was doing 
a darn fine job of management.  It was the government doing a 
darn fine job of ripping off those people paying into EI, the 
employers and the workers who were out there working and 
supporting a program that they wanted to have available for 
workers who did not have the opportunity to work.  The workers 
who are out there do not begrudge paying EI, but they want to 
know that the dollars in the EI program are going to unemployed 
workers and to training and not going to making the finance 
minister or the Prime Minister look good.  They want the money to 
go to what it was designed to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I get into more of my thoughts on the government's misuse 
of EI dollars, I also want to comment on an article I have in 
front of me.  My staff often think I am a little crazy because I 
read almost everything that comes across my desk.  I often find 
really good work.  This is from <I>Health News</I>, from the 
University of Toronto Faculty of Medicine.  It is from an article 
from early last year called “Can Unemployment Make you Sick?” 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It's not just the fact of losing a job and an income.  People's 
identities can be highly tied to their jobs—traditionally the 
case for men—so a job loss can be psychologically traumatic. 
—The stress of job loss can produce actual biochemical changes 
in the body (although not all of those are necessarily negative). 
—higher levels of cortisol, prolactin, growth hormone, 
cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol, as well as lowered immune 
reactions compared to when they were still working. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened to all these people that have been talking today on 
EI and I ask them to think of the number of adult men in the 
fishing industry, in the part time jobs and the seasonal jobs in 
my riding.  How many fall into this category? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The article continues: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Among adult men in particular, unemployment is associated with a 
higher risk of heart disease.  Unemployed workers visit doctors 
more often and are admitted to hospital more frequently than 
employed people.  There's even evidence of an increased death 
rate among unemployed people—particularly unemployed middle aged 
men—with suicides, accidents, heart disease and lung cancer 
accounting for the increased mortality. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did these people need the added stress and hassle of the Liberal 
government's employment insurance plan cutting the number of 
weeks that they were able to work, adjusting the intensity rule 
and not allowing them to get as much from their benefits as 
before?  Did they need that?  No.  Added to the stress, they got 
an employment insurance program that did not meet their needs. 
They were made to feel like criminals for wanting their own 
dollars that they put into unemployment.  Also, the government 
could make itself look good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has come up with this legislation and I should 
note that they waited long enough to do it after the great work 
of members of this House of Commons.  I want to commend my 
colleague, the member for Acadie—Bathurst, as well as a number 
of Bloc members who worked very hard to continually bring up the 
issue of changes needed in the EI program, time and time again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must have been two and a half or three years before the 
government finally listened and came up with this legislation, 
saying yes, it would identify some of the areas that need to be 
changed.  Is it going to solve the problem?  Not a chance.  The 
problem is still there, and again, not because the dollars are 
not there in the EI program.  They are there.  I believe it is 
$38 billion a year we are looking at.  That surplus is going to 
be a huge amount of money, which was intended for the use of 
unemployed workers and those who needed training.  These changes 
are definitely not going to meet those needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some other areas we could look at improving.  The 
government could have looked at amendments to eliminate the two 
week waiting period for apprentices.  I hope and I am sure they 
will be introduced at committee stage or in the House of Commons 
later on.  Why on earth, with a surplus in the fund, would the 
government not put in place amendments allowing apprentices this? 
These men and women are apprenticing.  They are in the workforce, 
but they want to go back to school.  They need money coming in. 
EI will pay them, but there is a two week waiting period.

<A HREF="#LINKT83"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why on earth is there a two week waiting period?  Why on earth 
do they have to be penalized for being in the workforce and 
continuing their education?  Why on earth would the government 
put in a two week waiting period and leave it there when there is 
a surplus in the EI program?  There is no reason whatsoever other 
than to give a pat on the back to the finance minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could increase the maximum insurable earnings and give those 
people who are working in high income jobs the opportunity to pay 
in on that and then get an increased amount back.  Also, the 
qualifying period should include any period of employment, 52 
weeks in the 260 weeks preceding.  Give a fair chance to people 
who are going out there looking for whatever job they can get. It 
can be sporadic, with a week here or a couple of days there, but 
they are out there, so give them a fair chance to benefit from 
the employment insurance plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, as a number of Bloc members have mentioned today, allow 
the self-employed to be active participants in the EI program. 
It is not as if the program is suffering.  It is not as if these 
people would not willingly pay into the program.  A good 
insurance program does not look at how it can cut and slice and 
take away parts of itself.  It looks at how the program can be 
enhanced.  Let us enhance the program and allow more people to 
access it.  Allow the self-employed to pay into the program and 
access it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to allow persons receiving workmen's compensation 
payments to continue making EI payments.  Right now they are 
restricted from doing so.  I have situations in my riding where 
persons who are getting workmen's compensation do not have 
payments made to EI or CPP due to the nature of the way the 
structure has been set up.  As a result, they are in a crucial 
period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Madam Speaker, I know you are giving me the timelines, so I just 
want to follow up and say that I also support the setting up of a 
separate commission or insurance board to look after EI. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also have just one comment.  I suggest that what has happened 
with the Liberal government is that the finance minister is 
acting as Robin Hood and Prince John has joined him in taking 
money from the unemployed and giving it to the rich. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK203"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Diane St-Jacques (Shefford, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I would 
first like to point to something very important. The bill was 
introduced in the House before and got to second reading. Then an 
election was called, and Canadians gave us the mandate to 
continue along the same path. This is why we are bringing forth the 
bill again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important to put things in perspective. The 
establishment of the new employment insurance system, in July 
1996, was the first major reform of the program in 25 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The old unemployment insurance system had served Canadians 
well, but it had become obvious that it no longer met the needs 
of the active population. When reforming a system as old as the 
unemployment system, one has to expect that adjustments will 
become necessary later on. This is why the government is putting 
forward the legislative amendments before us today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not going back to the system that existed prior to 1996, 
as some of my colleagues suggested earlier. The 1996 reform 
original objectives remain unchanged. The government still wants 
to bring more fairness to the system, to reduce dependency on 
benefits, to assist low income families, to reduce the costs 
associated with the program and to give greater priority to 
active measures to help some workers get back to work. These 
objectives are as important today as they were in 1996. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my hon. colleagues in the House know, the government has 
reviewed and assessed the effects of the 1996 reform. Our studies 
show that most of the elements of the employment insurance 
scheme, like the divisor and the hours based system, are working 
well, but that some elements need to be changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the whole, the employment insurance scheme is up to its 
raison-d'être, which is to act as a security net for workers 
temporarily out of work. We are constantly reviewing its 
implementation, and we find that it is indeed the case. However, 
it is not perfect. Perfection is hard if not impossible to 
achieve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This does not mean, however, that we should not be making 
adjustments. That is why we are putting forward these proposals 
to the House. This is not the first time changes are being made to the 
employment insurance scheme. We have changed elements in the 
system before. For example, in 1997, we launched a pilot project 
on shortened work weeks, which help ensure that people whose 
income is low at times do not see their benefits cut.

<A HREF="#LINKT84"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The close monitoring of the implementation of the new system and 
the analysis of the opinions expressed by workers directly 
affected by certain provisions now allow us to make new 
adjustments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding the intensity rule, we have to admit that it is a 
measure that did not work as expected. Because it did not result 
in the work effort increasing while dependency decreased, and 
because it is seen as having a punitive effect, we propose to 
eliminate it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, the clawback provision, or more specifically 
the benefit repayment provision, is a different matter. 
That measure was introduced to deter high income earners from 
frequently relying on employment insurance. The majority of 
middle income earners pay premiums for many years without ever 
claiming benefits. Since the purpose was to deter repeated claims 
by high income earners, first time claimants should not be 
affected, because they are certainly not abusing the EI plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are suggesting that all first time claimants should be 
exempted from the clawback provision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure hon. members will agree with me that the clawback 
provision should not apply to Canadians who get benefits because 
they are too sick to be working or because they stay home after 
the birth of a child to take care of a baby. That is why we are 
suggesting that claimants collecting special benefits also be 
exempted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are deeply convinced that the clawback provision should apply 
only to high income earners who rely frequently on employment 
insurance, and not to middle income earners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have realized also that rules governing re-entrants should 
take into account the extremely important role of the parents in 
the early development of their children. Nothing is more 
important than the responsibility to raise the next generation. 
Those who do assume that responsibility ought not to be penalized 
if they choose to withdraw from the work force to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why the government proposes to adapt the rule that 
applies to people returning to the work force.  We propose to 
make it easier for new parents to qualify for regular benefits if 
they lose their job after re-entering the work force after a 
prolonged absence raising children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thus, the increased requirements for eligibility for regular 
benefits will not apply to people who have returned to the work 
force after drawing maternity or parental benefits in the four 
years prior to the present two-year period of retroactivity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill before the House includes a recommendation on maximum 
insurable earnings.  This is an important figure, because it 
determines maximum benefits under the program, as well as maximum 
contributions.  The present bill proposes maintaining insurable 
earnings at $39,000, until the average industrial wage exceeds 
that figure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once it does, we propose that there be an annual adjustment in 
maximum insurable earnings according to the average industrial 
wage in subsequent years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Until 2006 the Canada Employment Commission will continue to 
monitor and assess the effects of the new employment insurance 
program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The changes we are proposing, and the vigilance of the 
commission, will ensure that the EI program conforms to its 
objective of meeting the needs of Canadian workers in need of a 
temporary source of income when they are between jobs.  The

are determined to make the employment insurance program one of

employment.  That is why the Government of Canada will continue 
the work undertaken with the provinces and territories, with 
business and local leaders in order to help create an economic 
climate that provides employment opportunities to all Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
it is always a pleasure to speak to the House when you are in the 
chair, but this should not divert our attention from the 
extremely despicable, antidemocratic and deplorable nature of the 
practice which started during the previous parliament and which 
brings the government to act offhandedly and to resort to gag 
orders on issues of crucial importance for our fellow citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that the citizens of Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, those of 
Shefford and those of every other region in Quebec will remember 
the disregard of this government for members of parliament and 
the arrogance with which it deals with important issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois has always been very much concerned about the 
employment insurance reform. It goes back to the beginning of 
1996, and was sponsored by Lloyd Axworthy, who has left public 
life. The member for Mercier and my colleague, the member for 
Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, an 
admirable man I am sure my colleagues will all agree, and I know 
they will join me in applauding him for his extraordinary work on 
the employment insurance issue—both were worried about the 
shrinking of the coverage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember vividly the arrogance with which 
the government answered our questions, particularly the minister 
at the time, Mr. Axworthy, whenever we said that if this system 
was maintained not even 50% of the population would have access 
to employment insurance benefits.  When we talked that way, we 
were accused of being offhand and airy, we were compared to the 
nutty professor because such a scenario seemed so improbable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the assessment report tabled by the Government of 
Canada through the Department of Human Resources Development 
indicates—as was pointed out by the hon. member for Chambly, a 
well-known authority on social democracy, whose outstanding legal 
knowledge has earned him, in the past, a brilliant career as a 
notary and who remains for me a source of inspiration—that 
nowadays only 4 out of 10 workers qualify for EI benefits even 
if everyone on the labour market does pay premiums. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is this not a damning indictment of our democracy and the 
operations of our institutions? We must understand the 
difference between an assistance program and an insurance 
program. Employment insurance is not a charity. Workers as well 
as employers pay premiums for employment insurance. When things 
take a turn for the worse and we end up unemployed, it usually 
comes as a complete surprise due to massive layoffs, job loss or 
industrial restructuring. These are all circumstances out of our 
control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it that we now have a plan—one of the few in the western 
world I am told—to which the federal government has stopped 
contributing? 
It is essentially workers and employers who contribute, not 
quite equally, to the plan. They do not contribute equally, but 
they both contribute. Is that the vision of our fellow citizens? 
Is that what they expect from a responsible government? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know how fragile the labour market is. I believe I am not 
mistaken, Madam Speaker, if I say that you yourself are in your 
early forties. We have both followed a similar path. We were 
both involved in the labour market without being linked to a 
single employer. However, my 63-year-old father—whom you would 
like very much—worked for the same employer all his life.

worked pretty much all his life for the same employer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, the nature of the labour market is such that this 
scenario is becoming more and more unusual. It is no longer 
typical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that most people will have at least five employers and 
at least five careers over the course of their life and this is 
why it is very important when we are between jobs to have a 
plan that is well adapted to this reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is this the case of employment insurance as we know it? 
Certainly not. 
What is the most incredible, and I will not hide the fact that 
it disgusts me, is the kind of servile complacency with which 
the government party supports the bill. There is not one voice 
of dissent to be heard. What did the members from Montreal, from 
Quebec, from the maritimes say about the representations made to 
them by their fellow citizens? Because, of course, everywhere in 
Canada, people know that the plan does not make any sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such behaviour by the majority is deplorable. 
Government members can rise in the House and talk about social 
justice, about Pierre Elliott Trudeau, about social democracy 
and boast about being true liberals, but, at the same time, they 
can, just like sheep, rise in the House and vote without the 
slightest thought for the poor in favour of a plan that is 
contributing to making them poorer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This will end some day, because the people will not tolerate 
eternally such arrogance on the part of the majority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to remind the House that we had made a demand that 
was supported by almost all well informed groups in Quebec. It 
was that the government present two bills, one being for the 
creation of an independent employment fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Chambly repeated this earlier: the surplus in the 
employment insurance fund amounts to approximately $30 billion. 
This is not something trivial. The chief actuary of Human 
Resources Development Canada himself admitted that this 
situation does not make a lot of sense. Despite the surpluses I 
referred to, the government was not able to make the employment 
insurance plan more generous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois members have asked that the rule of 910 hours 
be abolished. It does not make sense that a young person who is 
new on the labour market and submits a first claim must have 
worked 910 hours to be eligible. Considering the social 
conditions young people live in, can this be considered an 
egalitarian approach. It is already hard enough to find that 
first job. How can we justify making things even more 
complicated for those who find themselves out of the labour 
market for a first time? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Considering the huge surpluses, we had asked that the coverage 
rate be increased to 60%. 
This is an absolute minimum. We do not think we are being 
extravagant. Nor do we feel prodigal in suggesting something 
like that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our pleas were not heard. Because of the servile silence of the 
government majority, our most needy fellow citizens are being 
left in an extremely preoccupying situation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard:</B> <I>The Silence of the Lambs</I>. I think if there is 
one valid movie reference, this is it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will end by calling for negotiations. The Government of Quebec 
wishes to establish an improved system of parental leave. 
Section 69 of the Employment Insurance Act would allow it. 
Why are negotiations hung up and what is the government waiting 
for to transfer the $600 million which Quebec could use 
effectively, by establishing an integrated system, one that 
would be unique and much more generous than what the federal 
government is offering?

<P><A NAME="LINK205"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Aldershot, 
Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I wanted to speak in this debate simply 
to make one basic statement, and that is that I make no apology 
as a member on this side for the legislation that this government 
brought in a few years ago that reformed and changed the 
unemployment insurance, as it was then called, to employment 
insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the same breath I also would say that I support the changes 
that are before the House now, but the point that is important to 
me, and I think that I can speak for certainly many of the people 
in my constituency, is that employment insurance could not stay 
the way it had been for decades.  It had to change and I think it 
still has to change.  This is a temporary fix at most and what 
the government tried to do a few years ago, in my mind, was 
absolutely correct. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We as members of parliament here represent our constituencies 
and different regions of the country and, more important, 
different economic opportunities.  I take the point that was 
mentioned in one of the newspapers recently that this debate 
seems to go on regional lines and that we have on one side the 
western argument where they are not in need of employment 
insurance as much as Atlantic Canada and so on and so forth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not a regional issue at all, but it is an issue of 
economic opportunity in particular constituencies.  In my 
constituency the economic opportunities have long been very good. 
My riding is west of Hamilton and for a very long time there was 
a very successful manufacturing industry in Hamilton and indeed 
there was a lot of wealth in the region.  While many people 
certainly were on employment insurance from time to time, or 
unemployment insurance, for the most part they were not as 
dependent upon it as those communities perhaps that are more 
resource based, where there are tremendous fluctuations in price 
for commodities that can lead indeed to sudden intervals of 
unemployment and where indeed there has to be a safety net. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was young, and I still like to think I am young, when 
I was entering the workforce out of high school, in my family my 
father was a working class Englishman but it was a point of pride 
that was inculcated in our household that if we could possibly 
help it we did not go on unemployment insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have paid into it for many, many years, and when I started in 
the workforce I worked in the local foundry in my community and I 
worked in a number of the manufacturing plants in Hamilton, 
chiefly to earn money for my education, but a job was a job and 
our family did not have much money and I certainly had to get out 
there and earn my keep. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Never did I ever think that employment insurance, or 
unemployment insurance as it was then known, was my entitlement. 
I never felt, and I still do not feel, that simply because I may 
have put many, many thousands of dollars into the unemployment 
insurance program over my career, I do not feel that it is 
something I should be entitled to simply because I put the money 
in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The way I was brought up to look at unemployment insurance was 
that it really genuinely was an insurance program for those who 
were unfortunate in their employment and suddenly lost work.  That 
is what I think it should be now and I support it 100% in that 
context, but as time went on abuses did creep into the system. 
In my own community there were some very, very obvious abuses at 
the time of the amendments we made to the legislation a few years 
ago.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the most notable ones was this whole question of seasonal 
employment. The example that comes to mind most graphically 
in my region was where the school boards would hire the clerical 
staff, the janitorial staff and the custodial staff for 10 months 
of the year and then fire them for two months. Then they 
would go on unemployment insurance and then they would be rehired 
after the cycle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This obviously became a culture that the staff at the schools 
came to accept, that it was their entitlement to be working for 
10 months of the year and then get unemployment for two months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What was actually happening in this process, in my view, was the 
school boards and the provinces that financed the school boards, 
instead of giving a fair salary to the workers based on 12 months 
of the year, what they were doing was that they were giving a 
lesser salary and getting the top-up from the taxpayer, indeed 
not from the taxpayer but from those who were putting generally 
into the employment insurance fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I always felt and I still feel that this is wrong, that this is 
not what employment insurance was ever meant to be.  Madam 
Speaker, you can go across the spectrum and you will find, you 
could find, many examples of this where employers deliberately 
took advantage of the employment and unemployment insurance 
program in order to give less wages and indeed to in another 
sense increase their profits, because when an employer can give 
less wages by hiring a person for only six or eight months when 
in fact they should be hiring them for 12 months, what they do is 
they lower their cost of operation and in fact widen their 
profits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thought it was very, very appropriate to try to address this 
problem of deliberate seasonal employment for the benefit not of 
the workers but for the benefit of the employer, so the attempt 
that was done a few years ago to address seasonal workers I 
thought was very appropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another side of the equation is when we look out of my 
particular area to the country and we look into those ridings—I 
like to think of it; it might be in Ontario; it might be in Nova 
Scotia; it might be in Alberta or British Columbia—where the 
work is seasonal because it is resource based, this creates 
something of a problem too in another sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we have a resource base, a resource that has been exploited, 
be it wood, be it fish, that relies on the workers to work for 
six or eight months of the year and then be off on employment 
insurance for four months of the year as a regular year over year 
thing, what we are in fact doing is that we are subsidizing the 
collection of that resource. That is fine in the one sense, but 
what then happens is that we run the danger of overexploiting a 
resource. If people can cut trees or harvest fish at 
lower than the real cost and deliver them to the marketplace, 
then we are artificially inflating our ability to exploit that 
resource. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consequently, because I really believe that we have an 
obligation to protect the forest, I really believe we have an 
obligation to protect the fisheries and any of these other 
resource based industries, I found it very difficult sometimes to 
contemplate this idea that we automatically think it is the right 
thing to do to subsidize the employment insurance resource based 
industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Madam Speaker, one of the reasons why I support this legislation 
is there is another side to this equation: if you take that 
attitude too literally, not only would I be subject to 
accusations of being a rabid right winger but quite apart from 
that, if you take it too literally then you are not giving other 
parts of Canada an opportunity to maintain their communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us just separate regionalism for a minute and just look at 
northern Ontario.  There are many, many communities in northern 
Ontario based on mining and the forestry.  I think it is 
absolutely incumbent upon all of us as members of parliament to 
sustain those communities and their cultural traditions as long 
as we can.  Madam Speaker, you have to strike a balance when you 
are thinking in terms of employment insurance and its impact on 
resource industries.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I do support the changes that we see here today because I think 
we have tried to make some adjustments because we did not fully 
appreciate the impact of what we were doing before.  But time is 
passing.  We are now into another century and we have to realize 
that even a program like employment insurance has to be revisited 
and modernized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thought there was a very wonderful suggestion being floated 
around over on the other side, and that was the suggestion that 
maybe employment insurance should be applied to self employed 
people.  I think that is a very worthy suggestion from the 
opposition and should be explored.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquière, BQ): </B>Madam Speaker, on 
this February 13, 2001, I rise with sadness to speak to this 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Usually, the day before Valentine's Day, we get ready to tell 
those we love best that tomorrow is a very important day, when 
we will again offer them our very special wishes, but on this 
February 13, the government brought in time allocation on Bill 
C-2. Exactly 66 days prior, the government brought 
back Bill C-44 as Bill C-2. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the election campaign, the government made a commitment, 
particularly to workers in the Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean area, to 
amend the bill and make it acceptable to them. I would not think 
of harking back to the same old stories, but I remember that, on 
two visits made last September and October by the Minister of 
National Revenue, workers back home told him “It is too bad, but 
you are out. We cannot accept Bill C-44”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the campaign, the Secretary of State for Amateur Sport 
came to tell them “Vote for me, give us a strong majority, and 
we will satisfy your expectations”. Today I regret to tell 
workers in the Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean area and throughout Quebec 
and Canada that the government told them a big lie. 
The government said to them “Take my word and we will give you 
what you want”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, it must be recognized that the saying “commitment made, 
commitment retracted” says it all.  I note that this government 
does not want to respond to people's real expectations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have criticized this Bill C-2.  I was at a meeting of some 
one hundred thousand workers in the riding of Jonquière during 
the election campaign.  They had come to tell the government 
that they wanted an independent employment insurance fund.  They 
said that, as they and employers paid into it, they should 
administer it, because they contribute to it to provide 
themselves with some security.  The government turned a deaf 
ear, but spoke to them saying “I do not hear you, but be assured 
I will meet your expectations”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The day after the election, naturally, as Félix Leclerc says “I 
had forgotten your name, I had forgotten the promises I made to 
you”.  I am sad to note that the government is refusing, in the 
voices of democratically elected representatives, to tell the 
House and Canadians how much the workers in the riding of 
Jonquière and the Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean region oppose this bill. 
They will fight until they are backed into a corner to get the 
ministers who visited us to honour their word. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At home, we keep our word, and people who keep their word have 
only one word.  Let the members of the government understand 
that.  When we sit in parliamentary committee, we in the Bloc 
Quebecois will see that this bill meets the real expectations of 
the workers. 
Government members will have to honour their word. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are simply holding our fire.  We will be waiting for them in 
committee.  The real debate will take place there, and the real 
people will be heard.

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House do now adjourn. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, first I thank the Speaker for allowing 
this very important debate on agriculture as we all recognize 
that agriculture is going through some very strenuous times 
today.  Also, I will be splitting my time with the hon. member 
for Calgary Centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Too often members of society outside the agricultural sector 
have a tendency to believe that farmers and agricultural 
producers have a tendency to cry wolf.  Perhaps they should 
think— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  With all due respect to my hon. colleague, there are 
several meetings going on here between members of parliament that 
should take place behind the curtain.  This is an extremely 
important issue that needs to be discussed in the House and 
should be listened to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I could not agree more with the hon. member 
for South Shore.  I have tried to encourage hon. members to 
refrain from carrying on their discussions in the House. The hon. 
member for Brandon—Souris has a very powerful voice and one can 
hear him but they are distracting.  I urge hon. members to carry 
on their conversations outside the House so we can hear the 
debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I know you have control 
of the House as you have had for any number of years.  I do 
appreciate that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very important issue, not only to my constituents but 
to constituents across our great country who work the land, who 
plant the seeds and who harvest those seeds to make sure that we 
as Canadians have a reliable, cheap food supply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will base my discussion on three tenets.  Canadians are 
continually asking me why agriculture finds itself in the 
position it is in today.  In order to answer that we must 
recognize a number of things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first problem is that there is a very unlevel playing field 
in the world today.  There is a very unlevel playing field in 
the subsidies that are being provided by our major trading 
partners, the European Union and the United States of America. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1905"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT96"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have not been given the same opportunity to compete on 
a level playing field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997 for every dollar Canadians spent on farm support, 
Americans spent $2.06, the European Union spent $2.14 and Japan 
spent $3.47.  There is a terrible disparity between the 
agricultural support systems of other jurisdictions and that of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada spends .78% of its GDP on agricultural support while the 
U.S. spends 1.07% of its GDP on agricultural support.  We do not 
have a level playing field with respect to world subsidies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second problem in agriculture right now is the fact that 
costs are going up at an alarming rate.  It costs farmers and 
producers substantially more to put in a crop today than it did 
yesterday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all recognize that gasoline and fuel costs have gone up quite 
dramatically.  The government recognized that by giving Canadians 
an energy rebate.  The cost of putting gasoline into tractors, 
combines and other farm equipment went from 37 cents a litre to 
over 50 cents a litre for the crop year starting in 2000.  Those 
costs are horrendous considering the number of acres farmed 
across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the major inputs to produce a crop is fertilizer.  One of 
the major components in raw materials such as fertilizer is 
natural gas.  We recognize that the cost of natural gas has 
increased substantially over the last while.  Nitrogen has in 
some cases gone from 16 cents a pound to 40 cents a pound this 
spring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That may not mean a lot to those who live in downtown Toronto, 
Vancouver or Ottawa, but when a crop is put in the ground those 
inputs are required in order to get a yield.  The costs cannot be 
recovered.  Unfair subsidies and the cost of production have gone 
up dramatically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third problem is the value of the commodity coming back to 
the producer.  In 1996-97 a producer received $5.50 a bushel for 
wheat.  Today that same bushel of wheat is returning $2.45.  If 
we look at the increase in input costs, at the unfair subsidies 
and at the commodity values that come back to the producer, how 
can a farmer stay in business? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canola, a crop that I see every day of my life with its 
wonderful yellow flowers growing out of the ground, returned $10 
a bushel in 1996-97.  That same cash crop today is now $5.18. The 
value of the commodity has dropped dramatically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Half my time in my constituency is spent dealing with 
agricultural problems.  People 60 years of age, farmers who have 
been in the industry all their lives, have come into my office 
and said that they will not put in a crop this year.  They own 
their land, they are 60 years of age, and they are tired of 
wasting their money every year.  They not prepared to do it 
any more.  Farmers are walking away.  They are putting the land 
back into an inventory and renting it out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A friend of mine who lives in a certain area just south of my 
city said that there are 50 more quarter sections of land 
for rent this year than there were last year.  The producers are 
walking away and trying to rent land.  Land values are coming 
down. Rental values are coming down.  Those individuals, 
unfortunately, are no longer part of our agricultural society. We 
lost 21,200 farmers last year alone. 
There are 21,200 fewer farmers this year than last year, and 
believe me, when people say no, those are the facts.  That is the 
truth.  Let us quit sticking our heads in the sand.  Let us put 
support systems in place so that our farmers can stay on the

</I></B></P><P align=left>The last question I have before I turn the discussion over to 
the right hon. member for Calgary Centre is, what can and what 
should we do? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On that side of the House prior to the election, the government 
decided and had the political will to give Canadians an energy 
rebate.  Somehow $1.3 billion was found and distributed with the 
snap of a finger.  I will not argue whether it was right or 
wrong, only that there was a political will to do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are dollars available in government coffers right now. 
There has to be a political will to help farmers through the next 
planting season.  Those dollars can be distributed in any number 
of ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to hear that it is countervailable or that there 
is a trade issue here.  We have $2 billion of wiggle room in the 
WTO agreement we negotiated with the United States.  We have the 
room.  We have the money.  We need the will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need two things.  We need an immediate cash infusion into the 
agricultural community.  Then we need something more.  We need a 
vision and an understanding as to where agriculture is going in 
the country.  We need a vision.  We need a long term support 
program.  We need something farmers can latch onto to give them 
hope for the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a 40 year old cousin who has farmed all his life.  He is 
asking himself whether he should continue or quit farming.  He 
needs a glimmer of hope to be able to continue to farm.  He wants 
to continue but he wants the opportunity to provide his family a 
livelihood.  He does not want to lose money any more, year after 
year after year, and have a government that is not prepared to 
assist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the Speaker of the House for allowing my constituents to 
have their say on what is happening with respect to agriculture 
and to their communities.  It is not only agriculture that is in 
jeopardy, it is also the communities that feed off agriculture. 
Canada is losing its rural communities and it is up to the 
government to give them the opportunity, the hope, the assistance 
and the support they need to continue in agriculture. 
<P><A NAME="LINK226"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Joe Clark (Calgary Centre, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the House and my colleague for Brandon—Souris for taking 
the initiative to have this essential debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not just a debate about lives and livelihoods, although 
it is that.  It is also a debate about the security of the 
country, the food security of the country.  We face a situation 
in which our capacity not only to be a supplier to the world but 
to look after our own interests is increasingly being 
jeopardized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard a moment ago a dispute from one of the Liberal members 
questioning the figures put forward by my colleague from 
Brandon—Souris about the number of farmers who are off the land 
in prairie Canada, my part of Canada.  The figure I have is 
22,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether it is 22,000, 21,000 or 20,000, far too many Canadians 
are going off the land now.  This is not just an arid statistic. 
This is a reality that is changing the nature of western Canada, 
the nature of Ontario and the nature of the constituency I had 
the honour to represent so briefly last fall, Kings—Hants in 
Nova Scotia.  It is also putting at risk Canada's capacity to be 
an agricultural producer and a country that can grow the food it 
requires and use that food for technology in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not here to argue the numbers of people who are going off 
the land.  I am arguing that the House of Commons and the 
government has to pay attention now to this crisis.  There has to 
be a response immediately.  That is not because there were trucks 
and tractors on the streets in Cornwall the other day.  It is 
because there is a very real threat to the capacity of Canada to 
maintain its food producing ability, and it extends right across 
the nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a need for an immediate cash infusion, and I emphasize 
the word immediate.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers need to know now if there will be money available to 
them from the government.  They do not have the luxury of 
waiting.  They are arranging right now, as we speak in debate 
here, visits to their bankers so they can arrange a line of 
credit in March and April in order to be on the 
fields in May. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we continue to delay and the government does not act, more 
farms will shut down across Ontario, the prairies, Quebec and the 
Atlantic provinces.  That is the crisis we are facing.  There is 
a need now for the minister of agriculture to stand in the House 
and indicate that not only will there be an immediate cash 
infusion but, as we move beyond emergency aid, that there will 
also be a long term program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We proposed in the last election campaign a program based upon 
the old principles of GRIP.  We did not win the election, but let 
me say to the House that the principles of that program, which 
were criticized at the time, have proven themselves to be a basis 
on which we can provide some security to agriculture in the 
future.  If it is not a program of the kind we proposed, there at 
least has to be, for the long term interest of the country, 
immediate action now to deal with cash infusion quickly and to 
ensure that there is long term action on agriculture. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not just about one region of the country. Farmers across 
Canada are affected. We saw the protests on the Hill. Yesterday, 
a rally was held in Cornwall, Ontario. Farmers blocked highways 
so that they would be listened to. The concerns about the future 
of family farms are very real. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On February 9, the provincial ministers of agriculture met in 
Regina and agreed that the financial situation of farmers is 
precarious and that they desperately need help from Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is anticipated that Manitoba farmers will face a 19% drop in 
their realized net income for the year 2000, compared to the 
average for 1995-96. In Saskatchewan, the drop will be 56%, while 
farmers in Prince Edward Island will probably face a 60% 
reduction in their realized net income, again compared to the 
average for 1995-96. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These forecasts are particularly disturbing for Canadian farmers 
trying to compete with producers abroad who benefit from high 
levels of subsidies. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other day in the House, before the Prime Minister went to 
see President Bush, he made a clear commitment to the House and 
to farmers across the country that he would do something about 
the unacceptably high level of subsidy that the American 
government puts into their farm producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know what results have occurred, but I say to the Prime 
Minister, in his absence, that if he is unable to persuade the 
Americans to reduce their subsidies, and the evidence is he 
cannot get them to bring theirs down, then he has a clear 
obligation to ensure that there is financial support to Canadian 
farmers who are suffering in comparison, who are not getting the 
help from their government that American producers are getting 
from their government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can this be done?  Do we have the money to do that?  Let us put 
it into context.  Do we have the money to protect one of the 
basic industries of Canada and stop it from the gradual slide 
toward extinction, which we are now seeing?  Yes, we have the 
money for that if we have the will.  Do we have the right under 
the World Trade Organization?  Yes, we have the right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Officials of the Government of Canada have made it very clear 
that there is at least $2 billion worth of what they call wiggle 
room, which would allow us to put money into Canadian agriculture 
in the same way that countries with whom our producers have to 
compete put money into their agriculture.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I will wind down.  I am just a city boy from Calgary, but one of 
the things I learned in Calgary, in a city centre constituency, 
is that even though we do not grow the grain and produce the 
product right there in the city, the economy of my city depends 
upon the strength of agriculture.  The economy and security of 
people right across the country depend upon the strength of 
agriculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Agriculture used to be a dominant industry in Canada.  It has 
slipped away from the centre of public attention.  That has to 
stop and we in the House of Commons have to make it stop.  It is 
not a question of food, although being able to ensure that there 
is a safe and adequate supply of food is of fundamental 
importance.  It is also a question of the other things that we 
could do with agriculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is not an industry in the nation that has been more finely 
tuned to high technology, to innovation, than the agricultural 
industry.  It is not an industry of the past.  It is very much an 
industry of the Canadian future, unless we snuff it out and let 
it drift away.  The government has been letting it drift away by 
its failure to bring in either the kind of emergency assistance 
or the kind of long range planning that is needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We speak often about quality of life.  We speak often about the 
importance of community.  This is a nation of values, and some of 
the values of our nation are values deeply rooted in rural 
Canada.  Rural Canada, while it is becoming more and more diverse 
now, had its inspiration from a reliance upon resource industries 
and upon agriculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we let the industry fail as is happening now, we run the risk 
of changing the very nature of the country and of undermining 
values that are fundamentally important.  I ask the minister and 
I ask the government to act immediately to get money into the 
system for people who need to see their bankers tomorrow, and 
then to bring before the House long range programs that will 
introduce a degree of stability into Canadian agriculture to let 
us be as proud and productive a producing country in the future 
as we have been in the past. 
<P><A NAME="LINK227"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to say at the start that I 
will be sharing my time with the member for Parry Sound—Muskoka. 
I appreciate the opportunity to make some comments in the House 
of Commons tonight about this important sector of the Canadian 
economy and the very important subject we are talking about in 
reference to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I state unequivocally that our commitment to Canadian 
farmers is strong.  The government understands and appreciates 
the immeasurable contribution that farmers make to our lives and 
to all our communities.  Whether we are in urban Canada or in 
rural Canada they provide all of us with a safe supply of 
nutritious and high quality food at reasonable prices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They generate domestic and international sales of more than $100 
billion a year.  More than 14% of Canadian jobs, which is one in 
seven working Canadians, are in the agriculture and the agrifood 
sector.  It accounts for about 9% of our gross domestic product. 
It is a huge sector.  It is one that is highly productive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian farmers, as has been said and I agree, are very 
efficient.  Their products are admired the world over. Productive 
and efficient as our farmers are, that does not protect them from 
the whims of mother nature and the vagaries of global markets. 
As a former farmer I know all too well the many aspects of 
farming that are beyond the control of any individual or any 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian farmers face a number of challenges, whether they be 
weather, world markets, the pace of globalization, environmental 
issues or growing consumer concerns about the food they eat.  I 
could go on.  Front and centre right now, however, is farm 
income, particularly in the grains and oilseed sector.  Because 
of overproduction in some parts of the world, some of it stemming 
from massive trade distorting subsidies in other countries, world 
grain prices are low. 
Our grain farmers are bearing the brunt of those low prices.  We 
are working hard to address this situation in a number of ways, 
some of which I will elaborate on in a minute. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1925"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT101"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT101"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1925
<A HREF="#LINKT102"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT100"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However I would be remiss not to point out that other sectors in 
our agriculture industry are doing reasonably well, such as the 
dairy sector, the livestock sector and the poultry sector. 
Nevertheless, for those farmers who are grappling with serious 
income shortfalls, the government has worked and will continue to 
work with farm organizations and provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last five years alone we have, along with the provinces, 
invested $7.1 billion to help stabilize farm incomes in safety 
net programs.  The federal contribution to whole farm safety nets 
will be $1.1 billion a year over the next three years. Coupled 
with the provinces, that means $5.5 billion in safety nets alone 
over the next three years.  That is almost double what was set 
aside when I became Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food in June 
1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Very few of the members opposite have had the experience of 
getting all provincial ministers or a group of provincial 
governments on board for a national initiative.  Last summer we 
were able to get all 10 provinces to sign on to our farm safety 
net agreement.  It was a real and meaningful achievement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However that is not the end of the story.  We continue to work 
hard for farmers who are in need.  I am meeting with provincial 
agriculture ministers next month and, as members of the House 
know very well, under the Canadian constitution the provinces and 
the federal government share the responsibility of agriculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to do more and we will do more.  The government 
recognizes that if our agriculture and agrifood industry is to 
prosper and grow then, as we said in the throne speech, we must 
move beyond crisis management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we need to address the immediate farm income situation, we 
also need to examine this challenge in a broader context.  The 
reputation of Canadian agriculture and agrifood products rests on 
consistency and high quality.  Having talked to customers around 
the world I can say that this reputation for quality is virtually 
unmatched by any other country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Increasingly customers both in Canada and around the world are 
asking more questions about the source of their food and about 
the relationship between its production and the environment, for 
example.  They have the right to ask those questions.  If 
consumers for some reason were to lose confidence in our products 
everything else would become moot.  In agriculture, no less than 
any other business endeavour, the customer is absolutely key. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore we must continue to hone and improve our food 
inspection system, which I am proud to say is one of the best in 
the world.  We must keep it that way.  As we work to address the 
income problems of some of our producers, we must also tackle the 
very real environmental challenges inherent in farming, not the 
least of which is ensuring that the sustainability of our 
precious water and soil resources is maintained. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To be able to do these things we must remain focused as well on 
research and innovation.  In their determination to maintain 
their worldwide reputation for excellence and efficiency Canadian 
farmers are constantly seeking out and adopting the newest 
technologies and practices.  Research, therefore, is no less 
important to agriculture than it is to the high tech and 
communications sectors.  Last year we spent $250 million which 
was dedicated federal money for research conducted in our 19 
research centres across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also working extremely hard on the international trade 
front and will continue to do so. Over the past decade Canada's 
agriculture and agrifood exports have almost doubled.  We are an 
exporting nation.  We produce far more than we can eat and use in 
Canada.  They have almost doubled to $20 billion a year.

<A HREF="#LINKT101"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the World Trade Organization and at every opportunity we have 
to meet at all levels with representatives or individuals of 
agricultural and trading nations.  Through our international fora 
such as the Cairns Group we are working to improve access for 
Canadian products abroad and to change international trading 
rules so that our farmers do not suffer at the hands of other 
countries' farm subsidy policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As part of our position at the WTO, we will also maintain our 
right to operate domestic marketing systems such as the Canadian 
Wheat Board and the supply management systems that have served 
Canadians well.  It is the high farm subsidies provided by some 
of our trading partners that have contributed to overproduction 
and depressed prices in commodities such as grain.  I want to 
point out that the Government of Canada's WTO negotiating 
position was not arrived at in isolation.  Our approach to 
addressing this was to discuss it with other countries.  It was 
also done in collaboration with the industry, and I pledge to 
continue that consultation as we go forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I want to say that farm income is not an issue in 
isolation from all other issues facing farmers.  It is an 
important one and one that we need to continue to address. 
However, the other issues also include:  environmental 
sustainability; food safety; maintaining existing markets and 
finding new markets; having access to the best science and 
technology and the best minds available; and adapting to today's 
realities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government recognizes that these issues, like farming 
itself, are extremely complex and that we have to be more 
proactive, that we have to do more, now more than ever.  We have 
to work with the provinces to ensure that our farmers are able to 
ride out the storms, whether they be caused by economic forces or 
by forces of nature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government and I, as minister, pledge to give that our best 
effort, to seek all the resources we possibly can, and to give it 
the highest possible priority in order to focus on the farm 
income issue and all of the other issues in the complex 
agricultural industry.  Our farmers deserve no less.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Andy Mitchell (Secretary of State (Rural 
Development)(Federal Economic Development Initiative for Northern 
Ontario), Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, allow me to say how pleased I 
am to see a colleague from northern Ontario in the chair. 
Congratulations on your appointment to your position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am particularly pleased to have an opportunity this evening in 
this special debate to talk about the issues of agriculture and 
agricultural producers, as well as to talk about the importance 
of the broader issues in the way that they impact on rural Canada 
and rural Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are having a discussion tonight, but there are some things 
that I do not think are up for debate.  One of them is the 
importance of the agricultural sector to Canada, to the Canadian 
economy and particularly to rural Canada.  I do not think there 
is any question about that.  The other thing I do not think there 
is really much debate about is the fact that there are serious 
challenges facing the agricultural sector and, as a result of 
that, challenges that are faced by rural Canada and rural 
Canadians in general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased that we have the opportunity to have this 
discussion tonight and to have members from all sides of the 
House participate in the discussion.  As the evening goes on and 
we listen to members from both sides of the House, I hope that we 
are going to hear suggestions, possible solutions and strategies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think that members of the House and Canadians watching 
are really overly interested in people pointing fingers and 
laying blame.  There may be a place and a time for that, but what 
we are all about in the House, and what I hope the debate is all 
about tonight, is finding solutions for our agricultural 
industry, finding the ways that we as a government, that we 
collectively as members of parliament, can come together, as we 
need to, to find solutions.  I hope that is what this debate is 
all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food pointed out in his 
comments, a lot has been done in the last several years with 
respect to responding to the needs of our agricultural producers. 
The minister talked about the substantial increases in safety 
nets that have been put in place since he took over the 
portfolio.  He talked about the agreement with the provinces. 
It was a very important step to bring all 10 provinces together 
with the federal government to sign an agreement on agriculture. 
It was an agreement that saw no province receive less funding and 
several provinces receive increased funding as part of that 
envelope, and of course last year we saw additional support 
specifically targeted to Manitoba and Saskatchewan.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As important as agriculture is, and it is extremely important, 
it is part of a broader context of rural Canada and rural 
Canadians.  It is part of a very special part of the nation. 
Rural Canada is part of the social fabric of the nation.  There 
are members on all sides of the House who come from rural Canada. 
It is special and unique place, a place of very special 
traditions and very special institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about the agricultural industry, I believe we need 
to talk as well in the broader context of securing the future of 
rural Canada.  It is important to see the scope and the breadth 
of rural Canada.  Yes, it includes those rural agricultural 
communities of Saskatchewan and it includes the dairy producers 
of eastern Ontario.  However, rural Canada also includes the 
mining communities in northern Ontario, as you know very well, 
Mr. Speaker, and the communities in the interior of British 
Columbia that depend on forestry or the outports of Newfoundland 
that depend on fisheries.  Rural Canada is, in a large sense, 
based on our resource industries, including agriculture, and we 
need to deal not only with agriculture but with all of those 
issues that are faced by resource industries and by those 
communities that are dependent on resources for their livelihood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe there is a very clear commitment from the government 
for dealing with rural Canada.  The creation and existence of the 
position that I hold, that of Secretary of State for Rural 
Development, is something that had not existed in the government 
before the Prime Minister made the appointment.  It is a belief 
that we can as a government, that we should as a government, that 
it is imperative as a government for us to work on the issues of 
rural Canada and to understand that the challenges faced by rural 
Canadians, although they share many of the same issues with urban 
Canadians, are different. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to deal with the issue of geography and what that means 
in delivering services over large distances.  We have to deal 
with the issue of population density and what that means toward 
attracting investment into rural areas.  We have to deal with the 
whole issue of the cyclical nature of our resource based 
industries and what that means in terms of the public policy that 
has to be pursued in order to sustain those communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what we need to do as a parliament to deal with those 
special circumstances that are faced by rural Canadians.  That is 
a large part of what this debate is.  It is about taking a 
particular industry that is predominant in rural Canada, 
understanding that it faces challenges that are specific to rural 
Canada and to that industry, and responding in a way that makes 
sense of those challenges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of dealing with rural Canada we have to make sure of 
two things.  First, we have to make sure that we provide rural 
Canada and rural Canadians with the tools they need to deal with 
those challenges.  Second, we have empower those communities with 
the ability to use those tools in a way that makes sense for 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has provided a large number of tools to rural 
Canada and rural Canadians over the years.  Take a look at the 
infrastructure program, the $2.65 billion.  The fact is, when 
those agreements were signed with the provinces there was a 
specific amount that was set aside for the rural communities in 
those various provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Look at the community futures program, which is a program that 
operates strictly in rural Canada.  It is there to provide 
assistance for community development.  It also provides 
assistance to ensure a strong and vibrant small business sector 
in those communities.  There was a $90 million commitment in the 
last budget of the federal government to ensure that those 
community futures programs that operate in rural Canada are 
sustained and are able to do the work they need to do in order to 
help those communities.

<A HREF="#LINKT103"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are several other tools that I could describe, but those 
are two very important ones.  There are several others that are 
provided:  the community access program, the CARTT program under 
agriculture and, as I mentioned earlier, the support that is 
being provided for farm incomes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also important, as we deal with rural Canada and rural 
Canadians, that we empower communities to use those tools.  That 
is why it is important in the approach that we take as the 
federal government to ensure something that we call the bottom up 
approach, one that ensures that communities themselves are 
empowered to undertake the decisions they need to take to sustain 
themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an understanding that not every rural community is the 
same and that the challenges that are faced by a rural community 
in Saskatchewan are different from the ones that you and I face, 
Mr. Speaker, in northern Ontario and different again from what 
some of my colleagues face in Yukon, in central Ontario and in 
other parts of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why it is important to use a bottom up process, one that 
allows communities to set their priorities, one that allows 
communities to establish exactly the strategies they want to 
follow.  The role of the federal government and, for that matter, 
of the provincial governments is to provide those communities 
with the tools they need to pursue their particular objectives 
and ensure that they are sustainable into the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are here tonight to talk about agriculture.  In a larger 
sense, we are here to talk about rural Canada, and in a larger 
sense than that, we are here to talk about Canada.  We are here 
to talk about some very special values. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been very fortunate to have the opportunity to raise my 
family in a rural part of Canada, in my hometown of Gravenhurst 
in the riding of Parry Sound—Muskoka.  It is a very special 
place and the people who inhabit it are very special people.  In 
my community, we believe in the values of community and in the 
values of family.  I believe it is absolutely essential as we 
have this debate in the House that we come together to find the 
ways to sustain rural Canada, to find the ways to ensure that 
this special way of life we all cherish is able to continue, not 
just for ourselves but for our children as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  Since the minister is still in the House, before he 
leaves the Chamber could I have unanimous consent of the House 
for 10 minutes of questions and comments with the minister? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B>  Is there unanimous 
consent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No. 
<P><A NAME="LINK229"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I advise you that I will be splitting 
my time with fellow opposition members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take at face value the high sounding noises that 
we heard from across the way from the Secretary of State for 
Rural Development, but it is of grave concern to me that when we 
have a member asking the minister if he can ask some questions 
related to the dissertation which the minister just gave on 
agriculture, the minister says no.  We cannot even ask some basic 
questions related to the crisis our farmers are facing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would have been more assured about the sincerity of the 
government if at some time between now and going back to last 
November or October we had heard some kind of assurance from the 
Prime Minister, from the secretary of state or from the minister 
of agriculture that their Liberal candidate in Regina was 
misspeaking when that candidate informed farmers who were waiting 
in Regina for the Prime Minister—and who would not meet with 
them—that because they would not vote properly they might not 
get the help they needed.  We have never heard a denunciation of 
that particular comment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am trying to accept at face value the sincerity, but I have 
nothing to back it up.  Questions will not be answered today and 
horrendous statements are not refuted or not reprimanded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Secretary of State for Rural Development has also said that 
the government is looking for strategies.  I do appreciate his 
honesty from that point of view.  The suggestion is that the 
government does not have the strategies but is looking for them. 
I appreciate that openness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to note, as we look at the immediate crisis upon 
us, that funding is needed.  It is important to note that farmers 
in Canada from coast to coast, our producers, are able to do 
incredible things.  They are able to feed the world. 
They are not simply asking for subsidization.  They are not 
simply asking for more money.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The strategies that have been formulated by the Canadian 
Alliance have been based upon numerous meetings with producers 
from coast to coast.  There were some 76 meetings with thousands 
of farmers, as compared to the government committee that trotted 
around some time ago.  I think it had nine meetings.  We are 
talking about 76 meetings with thousands of producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those producers said some things in terms of direct strategies. 
They asked that their input costs be lowered.  We have offered a 
number of ways to do that.  There was a proposal in the House to 
lower costs of fuel, including diesel fuel.  Liberal federal MPs 
voted against that.  There was a strategy.  We were offering some 
hope. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have talked about the ability to lower user fees.  Our 
estimations through Agriculture Canada are that user fees related 
to fertilizer purchases alone hit the farm community at something 
to the tune of $300 million.  We have asked for a reduction of 
that to help with their input costs.  The answer is no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have talked about value added.  If we increase the value 
added areas of this part of our economy there will be more demand 
for the product, whether we are talking about the ethanol 
capabilities and possibilities that are there in Ontario or the 
pasta producing plants throughout the west.  We have suggested 
that the government lower business taxes, lower costs of those 
businesses and increase the incentive to invest.  We have offered 
that as very specific strategies.  What do we get?  No action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am having trouble with the sincerity in terms of wanting to 
help our agricultural sector.  We have said that we should look 
aggressively at negotiating downward the horrendous subsidies 
faced by our farmers. Members know quite well that European grain 
farmers are subsidized to the tune of something like 56% of their 
income; U.S. farmers, something like 36% to 38%; and Canadians 
farmers, something like 8% to 9%.  This is not a case of our 
producers saying that they simply need huge amounts of increased 
subsidies, but they do need some help now.  We have offered some 
very specific strategies and we do not seem to be getting any. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have offered the very clear strategy of giving producers, 
especially our grain producers, marketing choice related to the 
wheat board.  These are specific strategies.  We are not saying 
that we should crater the wheat board.  There may be a place for 
it for those who choose it.  Again we get no response.  We have 
been asked for the strategies and we do not get them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our members have done significant detailed work in terms of 
improvements to the grain handling and transportation system.  We 
have offered those as specific strategies.  We are even willing 
to say that if members opposite in the Liberal government pick up 
those strategies we will applaud them.  We will even give them 
credit.  This has now gone beyond partisan concern.  We have 
producers right now who are saying that they do not think they 
can get into the ground this spring.  Something needs to happen 
now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The AIDA program has been identified for two years.  There is 
something like $1.7 billion sitting there on the cabinet table 
when it should be on the kitchen tables of our farmers.  Almost 
half of that has been refused for those who are applying.  In 
many cases it is on technicalities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the problem with the federal Liberal government?  We 
have farmers and producers who are saying they need those dollars 
now.  They are sitting on the table.  We approved those dollars 
to move ahead, and still we see no action.  There are farmers who 
do not know if they can make it through this spring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of reducing downward these subsidies, there is great 
capability on behalf of our government to do that if it had a 
will to do it.  It could marshal the power of other trading 
nations and use that collective buying power in terms of being 
significant on these reductions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not simply a western problem or an Ontario problem.  Let 
us look at the situation with P.E.I. with the potato shipments 
shut out at the border.  We know through the people who had done 
the research related to the potato wart that this was not a 
problem.  We understand the minister was globetrotting somewhere 
when these issues should have been dealt with.  We had P.E.I. 
farmers either putting their product into the bins or ploughing 
them into the ground. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to do something and we need to do something now.  They 
have asked for strategies and we have given those strategies. 
My colleagues will go into these in even more detail.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a time for partisan positioning.  It was only a few 
weeks ago that I met a group of farmers.  One farmer held his 
hand out and as I shook his hand he held on to mine.  He said 
that he was holding on but that he did not know if he could hold 
on through the spring.  He said that they needed those dollars to 
be released to them now, the dollars that were on the table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Politics aside, we are talking about enabling and empowering our 
agriculture community to do what it does best, which is to be the 
most innovative in the world.  Canadian producers and farmers 
have proven that they can be the hardest working and most 
constructive in the world.  Our agriculture community has proven 
that it can be number one in the world when it comes to 
conservation policies.  It is time they had the support of a 
government that would clear the obstacles and allow them to be 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time we had a federal government that set and maintained a 
vision for agriculture, a vision for our agriculture community to 
literally be able to feed the world and, at the same time, feed 
their own families while they are doing it. That is the position 
of the Canadian Alliance, the official opposition.  The 
government has asked for strategies and we have given them 
strategies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are asking the government to act on those strategies because 
time is running out for too many farmers.  It is time to move for 
the family farm. 
<P><A NAME="LINK230"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, tonight we are here, as was stated 
earlier, to talk about an agricultural policy.  Actually what we 
are here talking about is the lack of any sensible agricultural 
policy on the part of the Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is there a crisis in agriculture in Canada?  When we talk about 
the grains, oilseeds and corn producers and the Prince Edward 
Island potato producers, there is a darned serious crisis, a 
crisis that involves the very livelihood and social fabric of 
many communities in western Canada, Ontario, Prince Edward Island 
and in fact farmers in every province.  Yes, this debate is 
necessary but it is not about agricultural policy, it is about a 
real crisis that is happening right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to touch for a moment on the history of this crisis 
because this did not come up just tonight or last week.  This 
came up five to ten years ago.  The lack of policy from 
governments over the past 30 years, no long term strategy for 
agriculture and no willingness to change and evolve as 
agriculture needed to evolve and change over time, is what is 
missing and the reason we are in a crisis today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997 we had a bill called Bill C-4, the famous Canadian Wheat 
Board amendments bill.  The Canadian Wheat Board was never 
changed to a voluntary wheat board the way it should have been so 
that farmers could go ahead and market their own grain and 
increase their incomes.  Those who needed the services of the 
wheat board could still have availed themselves of it via a 
voluntary process.  We would have had value added as the pasta 
producers were trying to do.  It would not be obstructing the 
durum producers of southern Saskatchewan and Manitoba who want 
to form a durum cartel with their North Dakota neighbours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The failure of this government is very evident in the bills that 
it has tried to put forward, which have continued the excessive 
regulation of the agriculture industry and have not freed it up.  I 
will give a couple of examples in a few moments that will show 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other bill that really hurt farmers was Bill C-34.  What did 
we get from that debacle and the two years of wasted time we 
spent on the Estey-Kroeger report bringing up all the good 
solutions on the rail transportation system and on how the 
transportation of our grain to the ports had to be a commercial 
contract based system?  We got a whole bunch of regulations with 
no solution, big debates and disputes between the various 
entities on moving our grain to port. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have tried over the course of the last two years to deal with 
agricultural issues.  We have had emergency debates on 
agriculture income.  We can look in <I>Hansard</I>.  We have had 
supply days on agriculture income. 
We have had an emergency debate on the grain strike in Vancouver. 
A grain strike could happen again.  It happened in Montreal.  It 
hurts producers like the pulse producers who shift containers 
over.

<A HREF="#LINKT106"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The pulse industry is one of the bright spots on the prairies in 
that they are actually making money growing pulse crops.  It is 
another example of what the government is not doing and certainly 
could be doing.   Western farmers and Ontario farmers are 
producing pulse crops.  The government is always talking about 
research, but it does very little in the way of pulse crop 
research.  There is one researcher in Saskatoon who does a bit in 
this regard, but there are three full time researchers working on 
wheat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is working with Monsanto to develop a GMO wheat 
and will still have wheat at the same value it is today.  Wheat 
is sold right now for below the cost of production.  Pulse 
producers could make a profit on what they produce, but they 
could use some federal government dollars to match up with their 
producer dollars to do research.  Where is the government on 
that?  It is not providing that matching dollar.  It still wants 
to do research on canola and wheat.  Its priorities are all wrong 
in that area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have just talked about the transportation issue briefly.  They 
cannot guarantee their customers overseas in India and other 
places that they will have product delivered to them on time. 
That is another suggestion the government could work on.  Final 
offer arbitration is good example that could be used to ensure 
that the containers are loaded on to the ships and shipped to the 
customers.  The Estey-Kroeger report should have been implemented 
and it was not.  That also hampers our reliability in delivering 
our products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has let the crisis build and build.  We have 
talked about solutions, but the only solution is to go with what 
farm groups are saying, that they need $1 billion over and above 
existing safety net programs.  There has to be an immediate cash 
injection before spring seeding.  That means right away.  The 
government has agreed to the emergency debate and it has no 
choice but to implement an immediate cash injection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem with the AIDA program and the new CFIP is that it 
leaves out the farmers in crisis: the grains, oilseed, corn and, 
as of late, soybean producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know my colleagues in the farming business will certainly have 
heard, but did anyone else hear what happened to commodity prices 
yesterday?  Did they go up or did they go down?  We are talking 
of grain, wheat, canola and the other crops in crisis.  The 
futures market is down on every blasted one of them.  Very 
clearly that is the problem today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers need to get their crops in the ground.  They need to be 
able to adjust to other crops.  However, the problem is that when 
the government cut out all the subsidies, including the Crow rate, 
it never replaced them with a decent, predictable long term 
program that helped all farmers as opposed to just a few.  AIDA 
seemed to help hog farmers, but it did not help farmers who were 
suffering from the longer term problem of low income over many 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about trade issues for a moment.  The government 
seems intent on irritating the Americans at every turn.  Lately 
North Dakota has seen fit to pass some legislation, or at least 
present it in the house, partly because of the agreement our 
government made with the United States two years ago when we were 
having problems with R-Calf, the cattle business issue that went 
back and forth in the west in particular.  They had a 40 point 
agreement where they would sit down before trade disputes arose. 
Before a trade dispute arose, such as the Prince Edward Island 
potato issue, the government would get together with United 
States farmers and politicians and prevent trade action.

<A HREF="#LINKT107"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we see trade action happening with Brazil.  Is that not an 
interesting little case?   We have political debts being paid to 
Bombardier and the province of Quebec.  In order to get back at 
Brazil in any sniping little way the governement could, the agriculture 
minister had to be involved because it involved an importation of 
beef from Brazil.  That importation of beef was stopped because 
of political interference.  It was not stopped because of any 
other issue.  In the next couple of days we will see that ban 
lifted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When our NAFTA neighbours, the United States and Mexico, see 
political interference on trade issues they will not be very 
happy with the government.  I do not have the inside track on 
what they are telling the government, but I can say that the 
United States secretary of agriculture is no doubt phoning Ottawa 
to tell the Prime Minister to life the ban on beef because it is 
hurting trade between the Americas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the intent of the government is to irritate our trade 
partners, there is no hope for our farmers.  It is too bad that 
the government was not thrown out in the election of November 27 
because it has ruined agriculture and I see no solutions coming 
from over there.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski—Neigette-et-la-Mitis, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the member for 
Champlain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This evening in the House we have an opportunity to discuss an 
extremely urgent problem, basically the state of emergency in the 
area of agriculture.  This debate was requested by the member for 
Brandon—Souris under Standing Order 52. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is interesting about the Standing Order is that it provides 
that, in determining whether a matter should have urgent 
consideration, the Speaker shall have regard to the extent to 
which the debate or study requested concerns the administrative 
responsibilities of the government or could come within the scope 
of ministerial action. The Speaker also shall have regard to the 
probability of the matter being brought before the House within 
reasonable time by other means. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to begin by thanking the Speaker for having 
recognized the urgent nature of the matter we are to debate this 
evening and for having authorized us to proceed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Turning now to the criteria he must consider, he clearly 
identified this as an area concerning the administrative 
responsibilities of the government, as we all know it does. His 
other consideration was the probability of the matter being 
brought before the House within reasonable time by other means. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Minister of Finance, for instance, tells us that he was 
not thinking of bringing down a budget at this time of year but 
was going to wait until the fall, we wonder how the government is 
going to assume its responsibilities and find ways of dealing 
with this emergency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The crisis in agriculture has not sprung up overnight. Already 
in December 1998, the Standing Committee on Agriculture and 
Agri-Food set aside all its other concerns and turned its 
attention to this issue. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2005"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT109"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT109"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 2005

<A HREF="#LINKT108"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It sounded the alarm with its report titled “The Farm Income 
Crisis in Canada”.  Although the title might suggest that the 
committee had grasped how urgent it was to act, the committee's 
recommendations were described in the Bloc Quebecois dissenting 
report as paying no attention to the urgency of the situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must acknowledge, three years down the line, just how accurate 
the Bloc Quebecois comments on the committee's recommendations 
were.  The Canadian agricultural sector is in a state of ongoing 
major crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his letter to the Speaker of the House requesting the 
emergency debate, our colleague from Brandon—Souris described 
the crisis very well. He pointed out that agricultural 
communities across Canada had attempted to remedy the deplorable 
conditions that afflict them today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Referring to a labour survey carried out by Statistics Canada, 
he said that, in 1999 alone, the prairies had lost 22,100 farmers 
as a result of the heavy psychological and financial pressures on 
the agricultural industry, not to mention the natural disasters 
and the unjustified subsidies in other countries which aggravate 
the situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone who has spoken, the leader of the Progressive 
Conservative Party, the leader of the Canadian Alliance, all of 
the members, have drawn attention to the same thing. 
Unfortunately, we could expect nothing better from the government 
than the reactions we have just heard from the minister and the 
secretary of state. 
No doubt some money is invested in agriculture, but not enough, 
given the scope of the problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government lacks vision, as our colleague from 
Brandon—Souris pointed out.  It is probably not the only one to 
lack vision either, since agriculture is in fairly poor shape. 
The people in the west have long, and perhaps too long, not been 
allowed to diversify their crops enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prince Edward Island produces potatoes.  Naturally, when there 
is a problem with potatoes, when the U.S. threatens to no longer 
allow Prince Edward Island potatoes into the states and Mexico 
wants to follow suit, clearly, if your province produces only one 
crop, you have big problems and your problems will grow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things that helps Quebec farming in a way—I see 
great financiers in this House and so I may use a financial 
expression—is that Quebec has a diversified farming portfolio, 
so that when glitches occur in one area, it is possible to fall 
back on another crop and try to cut losses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When our colleague from Brandon—Souris wrote the Speaker to 
submit his request, he raised a very important point.  He noted 
that the subsidies the U.S. and the E.U. give their farm 
producers cause ours, who have had a lot of their subsidies cut 
enormously by the Canadian government, to have a hard time 
competing in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us make no mistake.  The debate our colleague put on the 
table this evening is really of national concern, and the 
questions he raised directly affect all farming communities right 
across Canada, as he himself mentioned in his February 12 letter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must discuss the problems facing the agricultural industry in 
depth and we must try to find specific solutions to resolve these 
problems in the short, medium and long terms.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have some catching up to do.  I have been an MP since 1993 
and I must unfortunately note that the Liberal government led by 
the member for Saint-Maurice has really neglected the 
agricultural sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have become—to use an expression often used in my 
culture—more Catholic than the Pope.  Because the WTO said that 
the agricultural industry should not be subsidized, the 
government seized the opportunity to quickly cut as many 
subsidies as possible, while the Americans hung on to theirs, 
completely destabilizing agricultural production in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about the problems affecting western Canada, 
Ontario and Prince Edward Island in particular, we must not kid 
ourselves.  While the situation may not be catastrophic for all 
farmers in Canada, it is at least difficult.  We will have a 
better idea of the extent of the problems facing our producers 
when we can examine the action plan soon to be submitted by 
provincial ministers to the office of the federal Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, as part of the consensus reached at 
their meeting in Regina. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we will have an opportunity to gauge just how open-minded 
the Liberal government is, depending on whether it takes this 
consensus into account and looks for ways it can help farmers. In 
the context of market globalization, it is up to us to take the 
initiative to go global so that we not lose out because others 
made the decision for us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that it is also important that we find a way of being as 
self-sufficient as possible in our agricultural production. There 
are ways of comparing the extent to which each of the provinces 
helps farmers.  Quebec has, I think, been successful at pooling 
its resources so that money is distributed to producers within 
programs providing real assistance that reflects the needs and 
difficulties of our farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope with all my heart that the government is open to the idea 
of negotiating assistance to farmers.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Marcel Gagnon (Champlain, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I may be a 
total newcomer to this House but I have a feeling of déjà vu 
about tonight's debate.  I must explain that I have that feeling 
because I am a farmer's son and very much involved in the 
agricultural field at home in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. colleague said that perhaps Quebecers were lucky enough 
to have a kind of safety net for agricultural producers. I know 
what she was referring to, for I was in the grassroots of the UPA 
during the 70s when we were working to get that safety net. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have sympathy for the farmers expressing their concerns for a 
crumbling industry, for I too have known the farmer's life.  I 
find it a pity that the government has not been able, as my 
colleague has said, to foresee such situations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Agriculture is the basis of our economy.  Agriculture does not 
exist just for the farmer.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened to what the Secretary of State for Rural Development 
has had to say.  I found it rather depressing and it took me back 
some 25 years to hear him talk about protecting the rural 
lifestyle, the necessity of getting down to basics, that rural 
Canada counts on its agriculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must state that agriculture does not exist for the farmer, it 
exists because of the consumer.  Its purpose is not preservation 
of a lifestyle.  We are not talking folklore here.  There is an 
element of that, of course.  I think most people like to go out 
into the country to visit farmers.  Their lifestyle appeals to 
us. 
However, agriculture exists first and foremost because consumers 
need food safety, they need healthy food produced close to where 
they live. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague explained how agriculture was the cornerstone of 
the economy. This is what we must understand. When a farmer is 
forced to come to protest with a combine in front of parliament, 
it means that he is in debt up to his eyeballs. It means that he 
sees a new season ahead but he does not know if he will be able 
to start it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It means there was a lack of vision, not on his part, but on the 
part of the government. When people come here en masse to protest 
to get help, to ask all political parties to come to their help, 
to ask the government to take action, there is a problem. They 
are there. They are there and they need help. They need support 
and we must be sensitive to their plight, before the problems 
start to surface. They want some sympathy for the vulnerability 
of their profession. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a farmer gets up in the morning, he often wonders what will 
happen next. A farmer is vulnerable to anything, including the 
weather and the environment. He is vulnerable to market prices 
because his government did not protect him adequately. He is 
vulnerable because production was not properly planned. A farmer 
is always the first one and the last one to pay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank those who proposed this debate in the House. It reminds 
me of a debate which, as I said earlier, took place in Quebec in 
the seventies and eighties, and during which I personally worked 
very hard to get the safety nets that we needed. 
I imagine that a responsible government, which boasts that it has 
the best and one of the richest countries in the world, will not 
stand by while agriculture, a pillar of its economy, collapses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers need support and agricultural programs on a daily basis. 
They need us to view their work as something other than a quaint 
way of life that must be preserved.  They need to feel that 
consumers need their services.  In order for them to be able to 
deliver those services, they have to be able to make a living at 
what they do.  This means we must be able to anticipate the tough 
times so that they are not left to face their problems alone the 
way they are now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly I am calling on the government to come to the assistance 
of farmers, particularly those in the west, who are now in a 
difficult situation. We are not perhaps experiencing the same 
problems in Quebec right now.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, agriculture in Quebec still requires assistance from the 
federal government.  In this area, as in others, the money in the 
federal government's coffers represents our tax dollars. The 
government has to stop thinking that when it helps us, it is 
doing us a big favour.  That is not the case.  This money comes 
from the taxes paid by Quebecers and Canadians.  We will always 
be here to ensure that Quebec gets its share of what it has to 
spend on agriculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is only fair: when one pays taxes, one should be able to 
expect, particularly when things are not going well, that the 
government will be forthcoming with our, not its money. It 
should direct taxpayers' money where it is needed so that 
consumers and producers feel more secure and producers are 
less vulnerable when times are tough and a source of constant 
worry.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is an 
honour for me to rise in the House on this particular emergency 
topic of agriculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For a number of the participants who have spoken in this debate, 
there is a degree of frustration being felt in the Chamber.  Mine 
is a frustration of a member who was here in the last parliament. 
We thought we discharged our responsibilities, as members of 
parliament from all parties, to raise the subject of this crisis 
and to point out some solutions for the government.  In short, we 
discharged our responsibilities to the best of our abilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our frustration probably pales in comparison to the frustration 
that was felt by the farmers who came to Ottawa, who lobbied, who 
buttonholed members of parliament, who called meetings in their 
communities and who staged tractor demonstrations to draw 
attention to the farm crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not matter whether it is Saskatchewan or Manitoba, or 
the corn and soybean producers in Ontario, or the problem that 
has come to light recently in Prince Edward Island with potatoes. 
I am sure my colleague from Nova Scotia will be addressing that 
particular issue later in the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The frustration is aggravated when we hear the Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, whose remarks I listened to carefully 
earlier this evening, acknowledging that there are particular 
financial hurts out there.  He specifically indicated the grain 
and oilseed producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That in itself is not new either.  Going back to 1997 and 1998 
it was acknowledged even by the agriculture minister that the 
major hurt was with the grain and oilseed producers.  What came 
out of that, with our lobbying and the lobbying of others, was 
the agricultural income disaster assistance program, AIDA.  Who 
did it help the least?  The grain and oilseed producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, it helped other people.  It was based on an Alberta 
program that was really designed for the red meat sector.  It was 
not designed to help grain and oilseed producers.  Why? 
Essentially, if we plotted it on a graph, the changes are very 
slight.  They have been slight downward changes in grains and 
oilseeds over the past number of years.  If we are dealing with 
livestock, we see sharp spikes.  The up tilt is large for three or 
four years then all of sudden there is an abrupt drop.  That 
triggers some assistance for those farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is frustration about that.  It is frustration when we hear 
the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food say he will do more. 
The question that comes to mind is, when will he and the 
government do more? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister responsible for rural development, or the 
provincial secretary, says that agriculture is extremely 
important to everybody here. 
Please tell that to the Minister of Finance and the Prime 
Minister.  With due respect to the agriculture minister and the 
secretary for rural development, they cannot do that on their 
own.  It has to be a collective effort.  It has to be a team 
effort that involves all of the cabinet, especially the 
leadership of the cabinet.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On that point, may I quote from an e-mail that most of us who 
are participating in this debate probably received.  It states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Had the government implemented strategies three years ago to 
reduce government imposed costs; to deal with growing farm debt; 
to develop and implement safety net programs which are effective 
for grains and oilseeds; and to provide targeted assistance where 
it was needed; you would not likely have been called to 
participate in an emergency debate tonight on agriculture. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that to be absolutely correct. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to take a few minutes to outline where this crisis 
originated.  I believe that if we do not know where we came from 
it will be much harder to plot any solutions. Essentially, I 
believe what happened was that 1993 was a very significant year 
in this entire debate.  It was not only the election of the first 
term of the government, but it was also the coming into effect of 
the GATT Uruguay round, and it was the first time agriculture was 
addressed at the GATT.  There was an agreement of good faith. 
All the signatories agreed to reduce their subsidies and domestic 
supports by 20% over five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the government, which had a mantra of eliminating the 
deficit as quickly as possible, chose to hide behind the GATT 
Uruguay round agreement and to slash, cut and hack subsidies. 
They cut supports not by 20% or 30% or 40%, but by 60% over the 
five year period to the point where our farmers were unable to 
compete with their counterparts in Europe and the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The classic example from western Canada is the elimination of 
the Crow benefit in 1995 which costs Canadian farmers in western 
Canada more than $600 million each and every year.  In the 
province of Saskatchewan alone it costs about $320 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other speakers earlier in this debate have reported on the 
disparity between supports.  I need not do that.  It is on the 
record.  I would just point out that it is because of those 
supports that food freedom day is coming earlier and earlier in 
the country.  We are paying so little for food that is being 
produced by our farm families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last year, and people may dispute the numbers, the number 
of farms reported by Statistics Canada that were no longer 
operating was approximately 6,400 in the province of 
Saskatchewan.  People who know this far better than I will tell 
us that in good years and bad years, since the 1930s in 
Saskatchewan, there have always been 1,500 farms that go out of 
business.  There are fewer farms but the ones that remain are 
getting larger.  However, 6,400 is a sharp increase in the number 
of farms that have gone out of business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was acknowledged as well that it was because of the devastating 
cuts, 
government officials conceded.  Mike Gifford, who used to be the 
trade commissioner for Canada and reported to the Standing 
Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food, reported that we could 
have $2 billion worth of inputs or support payments to Canadian 
farmers immediately without risking any degree of retaliation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had AIDA which did not really work for the group that it was 
intended to work for in Manitoba and Saskatchewan.  They are 
primarily corn and oilseed producers, but the program was based 
on the Alberta livestock program.  We follow that now with a 
Canadian farm income program which we believe has less money in 
it than the AIDA program.  As well, we have all of the problems 
around that with getting payments for farmers to assist with that 
program.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Secretary of State for Rural Development said it was 
important that this debate not be just a litany of the problems, 
that there should be some solutions.  He was encouraging members 
to come forward with solutions.  I submit to the hon. member that 
there is no shortage of solutions, which have been proposed by 
any number of farm organizations and political parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Agricore, for example, has a number of what I think are workable 
short term solutions.  Agricore is suggesting that AIDA and CFIP 
will not address the long term price depressions which are now 
hurting producers.  It suggests that the government needs to work 
with safety net committees to design and implement new ways to 
support the farm economy, such as a payment through the net 
income stabilization account directly to the producer, as well as 
an increased contribution to the provinces for funding of 
companion programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provinces, under this proposal, would decide how the 
programs would operate in their respective provinces.  Companion 
programs would work better than national programs because they 
would recognize the differences that exist in each province and 
accordingly would have different solutions.  The requirement for 
a provincial contribution would be waived.  The Canadian 
Federation of Agriculture is also proposing companion programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last election campaign, the New Democratic Party had a 
whole farm safety net program which we thought required putting 
in $1.4 billion per year for each of the next four years.  That 
would basically double the amount of money available under our 
safety net programs and would at the same time provide $100 
million for a program to help young farmers get established on 
the land and a program for older farmers averaging 58 and 60 
years of age which would ease them off the farm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I referred to the Canadian Federation of Agriculture.  The 
federation suggests:  adequately funded farm income programs; 
companion programs that meet farmers' needs on a provincial 
basis; and NISA rules that allow farmers to withdraw funds when 
they need them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I may just pause there for a minute, Mr. Speaker, that last 
point is extremely important.  It seems to me that NISA is an 
extremely paternalistic program.  I have had farmers tell me that 
they have taken money out of their NISA account and then decided 
later on in that year that they would like to take out more 
money.  They had not taken out enough because their crop did not 
come through to the extent that they thought it would.  They were 
rejected because they could only make one withdrawal in any 12 
month period.  That is not an adequate solution.  These people 
have to be given responsibility.  They know far better than any 
of us here what their specific problems are.  If there is money 
there and they cannot access it and withdraw it, that surely is 
another great frustration and one that ought to be very simply 
dealt with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CFA also suggests that we need a disaster program that is 
structured to deliver funds quickly rather than delay relief for 
farmers.  That is a reference to the fact that only 51% of the 
1999 AIDA claims have been paid out thus far. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CFA goes on to suggest that we need $900 million per year 
for the next three years to restore safety net programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have numbers ranging from $900 million a year to $1.4 billion 
to more than that.  There are farmers who phone to talk to me.  I 
am thinking of Lloyd Pletz in Balcarres, Saskatchewan, or Murray 
Downing in Manitoba.  I am sure they phone other members of 
parliament as well to talk about programs and the specific ideas 
they have for costs of production.  They feel that our farmers 
are simply unable to compete against the high subsidies coming 
from the United States and Europe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are long term solutions as well, not just solutions for 
the short term.  I agree with previous speakers who have 
acknowledged that we do need a short term program to get farmers 
out on the land in a month, six weeks or two months' time, but we 
certainly do need a long term safety net program that is going to 
work for all of our farms and all of our farm families.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of those suggestions include:  tax rebates on fuel; cost 
recovery; and reconsideration of user fees, which shot up 
dramatically as the government was consumed with eliminating the 
deficit back in the mid-nineties. I know they have been capped 
at this point, but I think the government needs to reduce and in 
some cases eliminate them.  In these times of crisis, total farm 
debt in the last few years has increased by more than 44%, which 
needs to be addressed as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Ontario Federation of Agriculture was front and centre in 
the demonstration yesterday in Cornwall, if I read the papers 
correctly, Mr. Speaker, a demonstration you are acquainted with. 
The OFA talks about the need for safety nets, freight subsidies 
and other support programs and about restoring that support to 
the 1993 levels that I talked about earlier in regard to the 
costs of production, in order to subsidize the gap between 
farmers' financial capabilities and the average crop production. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food will be 
meeting with his provincial counterparts in Quebec City early 
next month.  We would really like to see some announcements prior 
to that so that farmers can prepare for their spring planting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me refer to the agreement that was signed by provincial 
ministers in Regina last week.  This was a meeting they 
requested, without the federal minister and officials being 
present.  In their communiqué at the end of that meeting they 
said, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is now up to the federal government to fulfill its 
responsibilities and immediately invest accordingly to address 
this urgent situation.  Provinces agreed to work with the federal 
government to prepare a framework that is predictable in the long 
term, effective and fair to all provinces.  This framework will 
take into account a number of factors including the specific 
features and needs of each of the provinces and the relative 
economic importance of their agricultural sector in Canada. 
The ministers hold that integrated risk management in agriculture 
will require a joint response.  This means a substantial 
contribution from Ottawa.  While this urgent situation is 
occurring in the provinces, the additional funds required are in 
Ottawa. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me close by trying to encapsule some of the messages that 
the government needs to heed very quickly.  We have heard them 
from different parts of the House during the debate this evening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first message is that over time the federal government has 
gone from taking the major responsibility for safety nets and 
disaster funding to a position of requiring provinces to pay 40% 
of the cost.  Even though agriculture has always been jointly 
administered, it is only in the last number of years that the 
provinces have been specifically instructed that if they are 
going to have a safety net program they have to pony up 40% of 
the money.  We are in a situation in Manitoba and Saskatchewan 
where we have a relatively small tax base and a lot of farmland, 
which is making it extremely difficult for provincial governments 
to come up with the 40% that is required to have an effective 
safety net program and effective protection for farm families. 
That is one thing that needs to be taken into account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, over time, the federal government, going back 5 years 
and probably 13 or 14 years prior to the arrival of this 
government, took away major programs that helped farmers, 
including the two price wheat system, which my colleague from 
Regina—Qu'Appelle will tell you came off in 1988, and the Crow 
rate in 1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, farmers have faced and continue to face a number of 
challenges, such as international subsidies funded by the 
national treasuries of the European Union and the United States. 
The numbers have been talked about earlier in the debate in 
regard to how low our subsidies are in comparison to those 
trading partners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, there are declining margins as input costs eat up more 
of the revenue, and there are the continued production and price 
risks associated with farming.

<A HREF="#LINKT115"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, what I am trying to say is that farmers in this 
country simply need to know whether the federal government is 
going to stand behind them or if they are going to have to 
address all of the farm issues by themselves as they have 
essentially had to do over the last number of years.  That is the 
important question that needs to be addressed tonight. 
<P><A NAME="LINK234"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Speller (Haldimand—Norfolk—Brant, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I will be splitting my time with the member for 
Malpeque. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will take a few minutes to talk about an issue that I consider 
to be one of critical importance to the food security of our 
country.  I believe that the future of our food industries and 
Canada's ability to produce safe and cheap food is at risk in 
this debate tonight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not sure that Canadians are aware of this, but if we 
compare a normal food basket one might buy in any Canadian city 
to one in any other city or country around the world, we find 
that Canadians are paying the cheapest prices for the food that 
they buy.  Unfortunately these prices are not getting down to the 
producers who produce the food.  That is the problem we are faced 
with this evening.  In fact, the amount going to the farmer, the 
producer of that food, has declined dramatically over the last 20 
or 30 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is that farmers today, in many commodities, cannot 
even get back the price of production.  This means that in regard 
to the price of their labour, their fuel costs and their 
production costs, they cannot even get those costs back when they 
sell their food. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of reasons for this.  Input costs are up. 
Input costs are the expenses incurred to operate a farm, such as 
costs for fertilizer, seed, labour and fuel.  In fact, the cost 
of ammonia, which is used in making fertilizer, is up by 56%. 
That raises the cost of fertilizer.  We have seen the price 
situation with fuel, not only across Canada but around the world. 
Those fuel prices dramatically increase the costs of production 
for a farmer because a farmer uses a lot of fuel when he produces 
a product. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Commodity prices in certain agricultural products are extremely 
low.  For example, the grains and oilseeds prices have dropped 
dramatically since 1995.  The price of corn has dropped by some 
46%, wheat by 34% and canola by the same amount.  These are 
figures put out by the Canadian Federation of Agriculture.  I 
believe that these prices are directly impacted by export 
subsidies and by trade distorting domestic subsidies from a 
number of countries around the world, particularly in this 
situation with the United States and the European Union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are the solutions?  I think a two-pronged solution is 
needed here.  We need to first deal with the short term problem, 
which is the problem being faced by farmers today in that they 
cannot get back their costs of production.  We also need to deal 
with some of the underlying problems of income.  This should 
involve a short term injection of cash, not only from the federal 
government but also from the provincial governments.  At the same 
time, for the long term problem we need to continue to take an 
aggressive role at the international negotiating table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was glad to see the Prime Minister stand in the House and then 
take this issue to his meeting with George Bush last week.  The 
Prime Minister went there and said it was a key priority on his 
part to talk to President Bush about the export subsidies and the 
ways in which we can coalesce with other countries around the 
world to bring these down.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was glad to hear from the Prime Minister that President Bush 
was of the same opinion.  The Minister for International Trade 
and the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-food have also taken the 
word of Canadian farmers to the international table.  They did 
that by working with farm groups, farm organizations and 
provinces to come up with an international agreement they could 
take to the negotiating table, an agreement that first and 
foremost was credible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will take time.  If we look at how these negotiations have 
gone in the past, we realize that we are talking about a number 
of years to get to a point where there may be agreement.  What do 
we do in the meantime?  We need an short injection of cash.  I 
was glad to hear the minister of agriculture tonight make the 
point that more needs to be done and indeed will be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provinces also need to get involved.  Let us look at the 
expenditure figures from all the provinces.  The federal 
government spends about 2% of its expenditures on agriculture; 
British Columbia, 0.4%; Alberta, 2.6%; Saskatchewan, 5.7%; 
Manitoba, 2.5%; Ontario, the richest province, my province, 
0.78%; Quebec, 1.6%; New Brunswick, 0.5%; Nova Scotia, 0.9%; 
Prince Edward Island, 2.4%; and Newfoundland, 0.3%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Grains and oilseeds in Saskatchewan is a particularly important 
area.  I believe there is room at the provincial level to move 
forward on the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Federation of Agriculture says farmers need income 
programs that are adequately funded, that are able to be 
delivered quickly and efficiently, and that will be in place 
until we can get international agreements to deal with them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we as a country moved over the last number of years to deal 
with the deficit we said we needed to make certain commitments to 
do so.  I believe we as a country need to continue to move 
forward in that area.  This is not just a rural issue.  I am not 
sure if Canadians or people in Toronto, for instance, know that 
one in six jobs in Toronto is in the food industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is at risk is our national sovereignty, our food 
sovereignty, a cheap and safe food policy.  We need the 
understanding of urban Canada because we are asking the 
government for tax dollars.  We are asking Canadians at all 
levels for a commitment on the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is as serious an issue as Canada has faced for a number of 
years.  We need to look at it both federally and provincially so 
that we as a government and as a country can move forward with 
solutions.  We need a royal commission or something at the level 
where not only ministers of agriculture from across the country 
but representatives of all government levels and departments come 
together to solve the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farm families are looking to us tonight for solutions.  I 
believe we have some.  The government is seriously looking at 
them.  I believe the Prime Minister is focused on it.  I ask for 
their patience.  I ask that they come together with their friends 
and neighbours in urban Canada to ask for their understanding as 
we in the House are asking tonight.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Malpeque, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is 
with a great deal of sadness that I enter the debate tonight, 
another emergency debate on the farm crisis.  We have had all too 
many of them in the House over the last seven years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is there a farm crisis today?  Yes, there certainly is. Before I 
deal more specifically with the farm crisis, I must state that 
not all the industry is in trouble.  Supply management 
commodities are doing okay.  In the late sixties farmers in the 
country came together with the support of government to develop a 
system in which to market their product and gain fair returns on 
their labour investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those marketing systems are still in place today because of the 
hard work of government members.  We were able to retain those 
supply management systems at the GATT negotiations and the WTO 
discussions.  We need to continue to fight to retain them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it were left up to the opposition party those kinds of 
systems would be destroyed.  Consumers are doing well by supply 
management systems.  They have cheap, high quality food and 
farmers get good returns for what they produce.  There is 
balance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, there is a farm crisis in Canada and, to a great extent, 
globally.  As mentioned previously, the CFA, the Canadian 
Federation of Agriculture, on February 6 held a food freedom day 
on which, by February 6, the average Canadian had earned enough 
to buy a year's supply of groceries at the grocery store level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about farmers' raw material costs freedom day?  That would 
have been on about January 9 or 10.  The rest of the time is 
taken up with the profits of the chain stores. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CFA also mentioned that in Canada the ratio of cost of food 
to personal disposable income is only 9.8%.  Food is actually too 
cheap in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to put the farm crisis into some perspective.  I will 
quote a statement made by the NFU, the National Farmers Union. It 
states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The market is failing farmers, it is failing all around the 
world, and it has been since at least the late 1970s.  The market 
is failing to return a fair and adequate share of the consumer 
dollar to farmers.  And it is failing to allocate to farmers a 
reasonable return on labour, management, and equity from our 
agri-food system's huge revenue stream.  Moreover, this market 
failure is entirely predictable.  It is a direct result of 
dramatic market power imbalances between agri-food industry 
multinational corporations and the family farms that must do 
business with these firms. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at a graph, it is interesting what the NFU is 
really saying.  It says that some people are doing okay at the 
expense of the farm community.  If we look at a graph of the 
increasing farm sector trade, we find that exports from the farm 
sector are going up about 60% but the net income for the farm 
sector, having produced that economy for everyone else in the 
system, is going down to somewhere around 6%.  Some people are 
gaining as a result of the farmers' productivity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second quote I want to turn to is by Elbert van Donkersgoed 
of the Christian Farmers Federation.  He stated that “the year 
2001 looks like another year of running with the bulls”, 
comparing it to Pamplona, Spain.  He went on to state: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For farmers, running with the bulls has become a necessity. 
Massive agribusiness conglomerates manage the food chain.  There 
are fewer and fewer buyers for farm products. The competitive 
marketplace has become an endangered species.  But farmers are an 
accommodating lot.  They go along to get along.  They will find 
the silver lining: economic doctrine says the giantification of 
Tyson (Foods) should deliver the much-heralded efficiencies of 
scale.  Besides, quasi-independent farmers running as a pack in a 
narrow market lane is thrilling; and the bulls can get around to 
goring only a few.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest that year after year there are less and less of 
those farmers left. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He goes on to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Truckloads of grain will leave farms across Canada for yet 
another year of meagre returns.  Canadian governments have been 
counting on the bulls of international trade, the United States 
and the European Union, to modify their subsidizing ways. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I raise those points because many out there are suggesting the 
serious problems in the marketplace are functioning in the 
farmers' interests.  However, those are just two points of view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened to the opposition and to the mover of the motion. 
The concern I have with tonight's debate is that, as usual, 
rather than proposing solutions they are attacking the 
government.  I would love to get into a debate with opposition 
members in terms of some of the points they raised.  It is hard 
to resist the urge to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I feel very passionately about the supply management system, 
which the Alliance would destroy.  I feel very strongly about the 
Canadian Wheat Board, which the Alliance attacks.  The Canadian 
Wheat Board in this difficult market has been able to maximize 
returns, such as they are, to primary producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom:</B>  What is the price of wheat? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter:</B>  That is my point.  If the member had 
listened to what I said about the international marketplace, the 
prices are down.  Thank goodness we have the Canadian Wheat Board 
because it maximizes what little return there is back to primary 
producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague, who spoke just previous to me, said that Canada 
must support its farm community.  I agree that it must.  If the 
Europeans and Americans continue to subsidize at the levels they 
do then Canada has an obligation to support its producers at 
similar levels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regardless of the different policy points of view, I believe we 
have a deeper problem, an underlying problem.  I know I am doing 
the unthinkable, but I must say something about the managers of 
the agriculture and agrifood policies at the Sir John Carling 
building.  I know one should not attack the bureaucracy because 
the opposition and some of our own members will say the minister 
is responsible, and that is true.  However, I have spent 17 years 
in the farm movement and eight years in the government.  I know 
how hard we try as backbenchers to put forward solutions, but I 
have never done anything so frustrating as dealing with the 
potato wart problem in Prince Edward Island. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Potato wart is not a problem.  Finding a solution seems to be. 
Our trade officials are too weak-kneed to challenge the Americans 
on what they are doing.  The department seems unable to come up 
with a solution in terms of an assistance package.  There are 
always 16 reasons why the bureaucracy cannot do something and 
never one why it can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am frustrated with the department and I am laying it on the 
table.  As members we can have our debates on politics and on 
policy but we need the department to put them forward in a 
positive way.  I am laying it out here because I am frustrated 
about it and I think it must be said.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter:</B>  There are certainly no specifics coming 
from that side.  All they can do over there is attack the very 
good policies that we have in place.  They would undermine supply 
management.  They would destroy the Canadian Wheat Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have policies in place.  We have put a lot of money into the 
farm sector.  We know it is not enough and that we have to do 
more but at least this government is willing to work with the 
farm community to come forward with positive solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Kevin Sorenson:</B>  It is just you with all the answers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter:</B>  I admit that I do not have all the 
answers.  Mr. Speaker, I am being interrupted.  Could you call 
the House to order?

more order, but short of unanimous consent the member is getting 
very close to his limit on time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have laid out what I 
think is part of the problem, which is the upper establishment at 
the Sir John Carling building itself.  I think that has to be 
said, and I hate to have to say it, but I believe it to be true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the past five years the federal government has spent about 
$13 million in support for the agrifood sector.  We have strongly 
supported its supply management.  There are some industries that 
are seeing success out there.  We will see more aggressive action 
on the part of the government to deal with the grains and 
oilseeds and the potato situation in P.E.I. 
<P><A NAME="LINK236"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, before I begin, I thank the Speaker 
for allowing us to have this emergency debate tonight.  It has 
been a fairly rare occasion that we have been able to get these 
kinds of things and I commend you and the Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also compliment the member opposite who just gave his speech. 
It is not too often that we compliment them, but some of the 
remarks he made toward the end of his speech should be heeded and 
listened to.  He made remarks with which I agree.  I think that 
many times those who are administering the programs may not 
understand the problems down on the farm.  I appreciate the 
comments that were made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most of my address will be to people who are not on the farm 
today.  Those who are listening by television in our cities may 
not understand this problem, so I would, in essence, like to send 
my address to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue is of tremendous importance to my riding.  Anyone 
listening to this debate has to realize how important it is to 
them, and many Canadians do not.  We had a rally last year in my 
riding and one of the signs that was being held up by the farmers 
just jumped out to me.  The sign read, “If you eat food don't 
just thank God, thank a farmer”.  That sign really said a lot. 
We take for granted so often the quality of food that farmers put 
on our tables.  If one eats, one should support agriculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me answer several questions in my speech tonight.  First, 
the question I would like to ask is, is the crisis real?  We have 
heard a lot of statistics and numbers here tonight to prove that, 
but the presence of farmers from my province in Ottawa tonight 
indicates that they are seeking assistance.  They are here paying 
their own way.  They cannot afford to hire professional 
lobbyists.  They are trying their best to explain to whomever 
will listen that they cannot survive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I invite anyone who does not believe that there is a huge 
problem in my riding or in rural Saskatchewan to join me in my 
riding sometime.  They should come and answer the phone in my 
riding office or even at my home.  The should come with me to the 
store, the post office, the curling rink or the church.  I cannot 
go anywhere without hearing a description of how this is 
impacting the people in my riding.  It really tears my heart out 
to listen to those wonderful people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I even had a funeral director tell me about two very sad 
funerals he had to do for farmers who saw no hope.  The crisis is 
devastating on the farm.  Ninety-seven per cent of the farmers in 
a survey done in my riding stated that the federal government was 
not doing enough to help them through the crisis. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2105"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT120"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seventy per cent of farmers in this survey said they lost money 
farming last year.  People in the cities should realize that they 
did not just get a small income; they lost money. Eighty-five per 
cent said that their farming operation was worse off than it was 
last year.  Seventy-five per cent were seriously considering 
whether or not to even continue farming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here are some of the comments that I got on this survey: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is disturbing that the government boasts about the budget 
surplus and yet they cannot come up with $1 billion for farmers 
per year. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers see a lot of money flowing to Ottawa in the form of tax. 
Yet when they are in need it does not come back to them.  They 
would like tax reduction or they would like some assistance. It 
is not coming.  Here is another quotation: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My family has gone through separation.  We did get back together 
but with immense stress, emotional and financial.  I farm eight 
quarters (a fairly small farm), plus we have two full time jobs 
to pay living expenses and help pay farm bills. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words farmers are working off farm to put food on their 
own tables but yet they grow grain that feeds the world.  Here is 
another quotation: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The financial stress of farming is causing a great deal of family 
problems. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This crisis is not just manifested in the economics of the 
situation.  There is a tremendous cost to our families and to our 
whole rural way and quality of life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another question I would like answered.  Why should we 
be concerned about the crisis?  Why should someone in Toronto, 
Vancouver, Winnipeg, Montreal or Halifax be concerned? So what if 
we lose our farmers?  Does it matter?  Let me explain why this is 
serious and why Canadians in our cities should be telling the 
government to take action and put $1 billion more into farm 
assistance immediately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is what happening.  As our family farms disappear, 
corporations are buying up the land.  If this trend continues 
they will gain control of our food supply.  When that happens, 
they will no longer produce the quality of food that Canadians 
have come to take for granted but they will gain a monopoly. When 
that happens the people in our cities will no longer enjoy the 
low cost food.  Quality and price will change dramatically when 
we lose our family farms and the large corporations take over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another point I would like to make is on an environmental issue. 
Family farmers care about the land.  They will pass it on.  They 
care about the different plants and animal species.  The large 
corporations will not be as concerned about the soil and 
resources or about passing the land down to their children and 
grandchildren. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is also an environmental issue which could catch the 
attention of our environmentalists.  I wish they would pay 
attention to it.  Squeezing our farmers means that they are desperately 
looking for more ways to make an extra buck. They may use more 
chemicals and fertilizers to keep going one more year.  Family 
farmers are the best caretakers of the land because they want it 
to be there for many generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another question I would like to answer is:  Have we not been 
giving farmers lots of handouts already?  It seems like they are 
always getting money.  The government has given the impression 
that is the case but it is not.  It announced $1.7 billion in 
assistance, but it never gets into the pockets of farmers.  It 
ends up fuelling a bureaucracy.  Only half of the money it 
announced several years ago has been received by farmers in any 
way.  The programs are complex and they are structured so that 
they do not get the money to those who need it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of Canada need to know that other countries are 
standing behind their farmers but our federal government does 
not.  Because the Europeans and Americans help their farmers stay 
on the land and see the value of plenty of farmers providing 
quality food, it has driven down the price of food in Canada. 
What has happened here?  Canadians in our cities have benefited 
from this because they know they can take advantage of the 
crisis.  They get food produced at below the cost of production. 
Our farmers deserve to get paid for the work they do.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I would like to say on a very touchy subject that 
this Friday in Yorkton a rally is being held to promote the idea 
that Saskatchewan should separate, that Saskatchewan would be 
better off economically.  The feeling of alienation is a serious 
problem.  I do not think this is the way to go, but I remember a 
huge rally in Montreal just before the last referendum on 
separation in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The theme of the rally was that we loved Quebec and wanted it to 
stay. Maybe it is about time we showed farmers that we care for 
them.  They do not think the rest of the country feels their 
pain.  Hopefully the government does not reflect the feeling of 
most Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A real antidote to the alienation in rural provinces is to 
reform our Senate and make parliament effective.  The House of 
Commons needs to become more effective.  We need to wrestle power 
away from the Prime Minister who does not treat all Canadians 
equally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The farm crisis might not be as serious if we had democracy in 
Canada.  My appeal this evening to all who are listening has been 
to those in the cities.  We need their help on the farm. I ask 
them to put pressure on their MPs and their government to do 
something to help our farmers.  We need that assistance right 
now. 
<P><A NAME="LINK237"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Anderson (Cypress Hills—Grasslands, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, debate on farm income is near and 
dear to my heart.  I have farmed for 25 years and I have been in 
situations where I thought we were doing pretty well.  I have 
also been in situations where I wondered if we would be able to 
make it through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My home area of Cypress Hills—Grasslands, and particularly 
Frontier, was settled in the early 1900s by people who came 
mainly from Scandinavia looking for new opportunities.  From the 
beginning some succeeded at farming and some did not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the decades, particularly through the dirty thirties, 
people left our area.  Depopulation took place a long time 
ago in southwestern Saskatchewan.  We have already gone through 
what many other areas are only beginning to go through.  To farm 
means that farmers will face obstacles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers have always faced and are willing to fight through 
disasters.  All of us who have farmed have fought drought, 
floods, insects and heat.  We were willing to do that, but this 
problem is different.  This is a problem that does not come from 
the weather or from farmers themselves.  Income crisis is not the 
fault of farmers.  It has come about by circumstances totally 
outside our control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Trade negotiations far away and unfair foreign subsidy programs 
have reduced our incomes to disastrous levels.  Our income once 
again is dictated to us by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problems of the WTO talks and foreign subsidization programs 
have several results.  One of them is that income drops for 
farmers.  One of the newspapers in my constituency printed a 
notice that kitty litter now costs seven times as much as wheat. 
It is wrong when cat litter is worth more than our food. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On one side the income drops and on the other side the costs 
increase.  If inputs skyrocket and income dives, it cannot work. 
A second result is that it is destroying people personally. 
People's willingness to continue farming is being taken away from 
them.  Some of them are giving up.  They cannot make it on their 
own.  They do not want to be dependent on the government.  They 
are proud people who want to be proud of what they do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people are self-employed.  They are the ones who pay in 
but do not receive a lot back.  They do not have fancy health 
plans, or in some cases even decent health care.  They cannot 
take sick leave.  They do not have big pension plans, but they 
are still the heart and the soul of our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need a new framework.  How could things be different?  I 
would like members to come to my area of Cypress Hill—Grasslands 
and in particular to the Claydon, Frontier and Climax area with 
me.  It has been home for nearly 100 years now to people who 
have been willing to take a chance.  When people moved there it 
was a new opportunity for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People have continued to look for opportunity there and they 
have found it.  Through the years they have established 
businesses.  In the early seventies our community had 
agricultural implement manufacturers, primarily Friggstad. 
In the 1990s we had Honey 
Bee Manufacturing which makes swathing equipment and combining 
equipment.  We have had processors move in that began to process 
our products and sell them themselves.  We have diversified into 
specialty crops.  People are interested in retailing in fuel, 
fertilizers and chemicals.  Now people in our community are 
looking to the future. 
This is an area with only hundreds of people, not thousands of 
them.  How does success happen in an area like that?  There are two 
things that strike me about that area.  First, the people desire 
to be free from government.  They do not want to be dependent on 
government.  They know that the government cannot sustain them 
long term.  Second, they have an attitude that they will survive. 
They are going to survive and they will do what it takes to 
survive.  We are doing that.

ask for solutions and have heard some suggested by different 
people.  I do not know if it wants specific solutions or not.  It 
never initiated this debate and agriculture has never seemed to 
be a real priority for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to make some suggestions anyway.  As a producer, I 
would like to suggest first that the government strengthen what 
remains.  I can think of two things, in particular the crop 
insurance programs that are in place and the NISA plan.  Why not 
use NISA, tune it up, make it work and make it work better? As 
well, I would suggest, as we have heard tonight from my party and 
also from one of the parties on the opposition side, that we need 
stronger tax cuts and a reduction of government fees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One program that worked last summer was the Canada-Saskatchewan 
adjustment program.  Both Saskatchewan and Manitoba were 
recipients of that.  It was easily administered.  The money was 
out there very quickly.  It got to where it was needed and it was 
used to do what had to be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, we should eliminate the failures.  I can think of two of 
them.  They are the AIDA and the CFIP.  These have been poorly 
administered and ineffective.  They are dangerous because people 
get their hopes built up on what they are going to get out of the 
programs and then it is taken away from them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know examples of where people have received money and 
have had it clawed back from them.  I have constituents who have 
come to me and told me that they have been asked for the money 
back before they had even received it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second thing that needs to be dealt with is our trade 
positions, which must be a lot more aggressively pursued.  The 
trade positions we end up with leave agriculture in a very bad 
situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government needs also to give hope for tomorrow.  We need to 
get emergency aid out there right now.  We have half, or $800 
million, of the AIDA money left.  We are calling on the 
government to deliver another $1 billion before seeding time. 
That has to get out if we want farming to work successfully in 
the grain and oilseed sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government needs to look to create incentives to change. One 
of the problems with AIDA is that it has rewarded people for 
staying the same.  If I have grown a product and it has gone 
downhill, there is no incentive for me to change it because I can 
continue to try to collect from that program.  We must look to 
create incentives to change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The pulse growers are a good example of people who have gone 
into specialization diversification and have done a good job 
without a lot of government help.  We can look to them for an 
example of people who are making agriculture work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest we need to open access.  We need to open it to 
the railways so we can get access to move some of our own 
products on 
the railways.  I would also suggest, as we have heard earlier 
tonight, that we need to open access to marketing, particularly 
for grain.   We need to allow freedom and open it up so people 
have choice in what they are marketing and can deal with their 
own product.  We can market other crops worldwide and we can 
certainly do it with grain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government will not address these solutions, I have 
another suggestion.  It had better come up with some quick and 
effective transition programs for those who cannot continue to 
farm.  We heard earlier that 6,400 people moved off their farms 
last year.  That is going to accelerate very rapidly.  These 
people know how to work.  They want to work on their farms. 
However, if we are not prepared to help them, we had better be 
prepared to help them go on to something else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I want to ask the question: is agriculture a 
necessary industry?  If not, what is?  If it is, the government 
needs to move.  For three years it has failed to effectively 
address the situation in grains and oilseeds.  It is time that it 
starts to mind the company store by addressing this immediate 
need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our ancestors came here for the opportunity.  Let us try to make 
sure that there is one for our children as well.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (York North, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
will be splitting my time with another member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One snowy day in January I found the parking lot of my 
constituency office dwarfed by giant combines and huge tractors. 
Inside my office a delegation of local farmers waited for me.  We 
had a good discussion. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2120"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT123"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As each man left we shook hands.  One of the last men to leave 
took my hand and said “Please make those people in Ottawa 
understand what we are going through”.  He had been quiet 
throughout the meeting, saying nothing.  The few words he left 
with me touched me in a very profound way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As parliamentarians, as members of the House, the primary reason 
we are here is to make those people in Ottawa understand what our 
constituents and collectively what Canadians are going through. 
It is our duty to bring the stories, the concerns, the 
challenges, the hopes and the dreams of Canadians to Ottawa.  We 
do this to ensure that decision making reflects the reality of 
Canadians' lives and that as best as is possible what we do here 
in this Chamber serves those who look to this place for 
leadership, for answers and at times for help.  If we neglect to 
do this, the laws we make, the policies and programs we develop, 
will never meet the needs of Canadians.  We will never solve the 
problems that our nation faces.  We will never answer the 
fundamental questions we are required to address as a nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am honoured to represent the riding of York North, an 
agriculture rich part of Ontario known for its dairy farms, its 
grain and cattle and the wonderful vegetables grown on our marsh 
farms.  In fact, when I was a schoolgirl in Thunder Bay we 
studied the famous Holland Marsh in market gardening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of its proximity to Toronto, York North has the 
distinction of being a bit of a hybrid riding, an agriculture 
basin and an important industrial region as well.  We are home to 
many people who commute to work in Toronto, to those who live in 
the numerous small towns and villages in the rural countryside 
and to a great many who have farmed in this area for generations 
and who continue to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the years our proximity to Canada's largest city has meant 
that York North has become increasingly urbanized.  This can be 
said for many ridings represented in the House.  A good deal of 
our farmland has disappeared.  Despite this, the myth that the 
greater Toronto area does not make an important contribution to 
our agriculture sector can be quickly dispelled.  A recent study 
noted that there are approximately $585 million in farm receipts 
in the York region alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly, the agrifood sector remains vitally important to the 
economic health of the GTA and the York region.  These are 
hardworking, resilient people who have farmed for generations. 
They have seen good times and tough times and now many are going 
through the toughest of times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am working closely with the agrifood producers in my riding. 
One of them, Mr. Don Chapman, has said to me and to the 
newspapers that “Farmers don't want subsidies.  They don't want 
tax rebates.  They don't want to call in crop insurance.  They 
just want to be paid fairly for their products”.  The government 
must listen to their need for immediate assistance and long term 
support.  We produce some of the greatest agricultural products 
in the world and yet our farmers are in a dire way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The farmers in my riding tell me Ontario farmers need an 
increase in the Canadian farm income program of $300 million. 
This program is split 60:40 with the province, which means that 
we need Ontario to step up to the plate to the tune of $120 
million.  Our agriculture sector is a shared responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The farmers in my riding also talk about longer term solutions 
and actions.  They talk of increased funding to agricultural 
research and of the development of new markets.  They talk of 
strengthening environmental programs.  More important, any income 
assistance program should help ensure that they receive adequate 
returns for their investment, their input costs and their labour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know debates are easy but coming up with practical long 
term solutions is not.  Will we settle on some concrete 
initiatives this evening?  I think not.  More time is needed in 
the House on this matter.  More time is needed to discuss the 
many facets of this complicated and lingering problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A local vegetable growers' association wrote to me recently to 
outline some of these facets.  In addition to the serious weather 
pressures faced recently, they wrote that growers must contend 
with eroded markets due to the consolidation, increased domestic 
supply, increased year round global supply and free trade 
agreements that force growers to compete with the treasuries of 
the United States and the European Union.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same vegetable growers noted that a pre-harvest survey of 
growers conducted in July 2000 placed crop losses to the growers 
of Bradford, Cookstown and East Gwillimbury at approximately 
3,500 acres, or an estimated 40% of the total area grown.  This 
is alarming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other aspects to the problem as well.  We need to 
discuss these important issues such as increasing our support for 
local growers.  As Wendell Berry, the noted farmer, essayist and 
poet once wrote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The orientation of agriculture to local needs, local 
possibilities and local limits is indispensable to the health of 
both land and people, and undoubtedly to the health of democratic 
liberties as well. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do we reach for lettuce trucked here from California instead 
of that grown perhaps only miles away?  There is something so 
fundamentally wrong about that.  How many of us even consider 
what such a simple choice does to our farmers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why I urge the House and the government to initiate a 
national debate on food.  We as Canadians from urban and rural 
communities need to understand how the producers of our 
foodstuffs live.  We need to understand why mean farm incomes 
continue to go down and why input costs continue to rise.  We 
need to understand why the next generation of farmers is not 
stepping up to take over our farms.  In fact, according to some, 
the next generation has already decided not to.  It is the 
generation after them that we need to woo back to the land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Calgary Centre referred to this debate as 
one about food security.  I agree with him but I would go 
further.  I believe that this is a question of food sovereignty. 
If we care about good quality food in the country, and if we care 
that we as a nation have control over this very basic need, then 
we must understand that, as Wendell Berry also says “Whatever 
determines the fortune of the land determines also the fortune of 
the people.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A vibrant, sustainable, profitable agricultural sector is part 
of who we are.  If it is suffering, then we are suffering.  More 
important, we become vulnerable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call on all members of the House to support our family farms. 
I call upon the government to do what is right. 
<P><A NAME="LINK239"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, thank you 
for giving the House the opportunity to debate this very 
important issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people consider Durham to be part of the GTA so that therefore 
we would not know about farming.  In fact, my riding is proud 
that its second largest industry is agriculture.  Our first one 
is General Motors.  Agriculture is a big feature of the Durham 
riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just as a personal note, I spent about eight years of my life 
farming on a part time basis.  I can well remember the years when 
I could not get my farm crop in because of weather conditions and 
the elevators in the spring would not give me the proper pricing 
for that.  I had to dump the crop on my farm floor and feed it to 
pigs.  I can certainly understand the trials and tribulations 
that have occurred in the agricultural industry.  Some things are 
predicated by weather conditions, others by market forces.  The 
decisions are made way beyond the farm gate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our farmers are having a crisis.  Every member in the House has 
agreed that we have a significant one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was just speaking to a number of farmers in my riding last 
Friday.  They belong to an organization called the Canadian Foodgrain 
Bank.  This is an organization that many people would not 
understand.  The farmers get together to volunteer their time and 
labour to grow grain.  They basically have a storage facility. 
CIDA actually purchases that grain and ships it overseas.  The 
farm community, even in its time of need, has found ways to 
reach out to those less fortunate in other countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is only appropriate that farmers are looking to us in their time 
of need. It is time for us to discuss their issue and to ensure 
that they are properly taken care of.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not have to tell hon. members that a couple of world wars 
have taught a lot of nations that it is very dangerous to be 
dependent on other countries for their food supply.  Even though 
some people will argue, improperly I think, that other 
agricultural countries could possibly outproduce us, I do not 
believe that is true.  I think it is dangerous if it is true. 
We must sustain our Canadian agricultural industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me the farm sector is broken down into a number of 
areas.  We have a very dangerous tendency in the House to talk 
about agriculture as if it were some kind of holistic thing.  In 
fact it is many industries all at once. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the supply management industry.  Some people have 
suggested it is doing well.  Others have suggested it is simply 
on a life support system.   It is actually crumbling under the 
weight of international pricing and the move toward tariffication 
as opposed to a quota system for some of our supply based 
industries.  It too is in jeopardy and needs to be protected.  We 
as legislators need to stand up for that industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However it is true that the supply management industry is not 
under the strain of grain and oilseeds and the other sectors of 
the agricultural industry that do not have a supply management 
industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These industries are coming to the government and saying that it 
is their supply manager.  As a bunch of small producers they find 
it very difficult to compete, not only internationally but 
domestically.  After all, there are only two or three major 
buyers of livestock in Canada but there are many livestock 
farmers.  There is a great disproportionate disparity in the 
marketplace.  I believe another member talked about the failure 
of the market to deal directly with farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many people talked about the crisis today and suggested that we 
need money and cash injection.  I agree with that.  However I 
would like to talk today about the whole concept of program 
delivery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I started to study this debate I sourced some interesting 
statistics, Canadian revenue income statistics.  These figures 
are for people who reported their incomes in 1998 from farming. 
They may be somewhat inaccurate because they come from people's 
tax returns.  This is on a personal income tax basis, so it does 
not reflect people who carried on farming in a corporate entity. 
They would not show up in these figures.  However it gives us a 
rough overview, a sort of barometer of what is actually going on 
in the agricultural industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A total of 439,990 tax filers who claimed that their chief 
source of income was from farming had a total income of about $2 
billion. That works out to a median income for farmers of $4,552. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is even more startling is the report of the National 
Council of Welfare in 1998 which talked about a low income cutoff 
for people determined as being on welfare.  For a family of three 
it indicated $20,000 as the low income cutoff level.  That is 
lower than for people who live in the city because it is believed 
that their taxes and other expenses are possibly cheaper.  They 
were taken into consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is amazing to see, as people have losses from farming, up 
through the income stream that we have 214,470 farmers with 
$20,000 worth of income. Basically that indicates that 50% of the 
people who filed their tax return in 1998 and declared their 
chief source of income to be from farming are living in poverty. 
That is a very sad testament for our country.  Basically the 
people living in urban areas are the net benefactors of that 
policy.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not so much government per se, but for whatever reason we 
have been the beneficiary of a cheap food policy.  Nine per cent 
of our disposable income is spent on food.  That is lower than 
the United States which has a bigger per capita income than we 
do.  We have a cheap food policy in Canada but it has been driven 
on the backs of our farm community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard the concerns of people regarding various 
government programs.  Historically what has happened is that 
every time we have had a problem or a crisis in the farm sector a 
plan has been developed to prevent it, to adjust it or deal with 
it. As a consequence, we have created a band-aid solution to farm 
income support systems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have talked about a safety net system.  The intentions of 
governments, no matter what stripe, have basically been good, but 
they have not been able to take the time to sit down and look at 
the long range aspect of farm income support systems.  I suggest 
that we look in another direction, which is to create a 
negative income tax for farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have an AIDA system, a NISA system, a CPIF system, a market 
revenue system and a crop insurance system.  We have a 
multiplicity of systems.  We normally put $1.6 billion toward 
agriculture support.  We put another billion dollars per year up 
to $2.5 billion.  I just said that the total income of farmers 
reported in 1998 was $2 billion.  There is no question that we 
could afford a negative income tax system to support our farm 
community without making every farmer an accountant or a lawyer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding, half of the people who are entitled to these 
programs are not getting money because they cannot fill out the 
damn forms.  The first category in this group lost $255 million. 
These people cannot afford to pay $1,000 for an accountant or a 
lawyer to fill out these forms, so they do not get the money. 
The money is not getting to the people who need it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, we do have all these programs in place but the money is not 
getting to the people who are entitled to it.  We will have to do 
things in a better way. 
<P><A NAME="LINK240"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, this is another emergency debate that many of us have 
taken part in several times before.  I have been in the House 
almost eight years and it really disturbs me that we continue to 
go down the same road having to deal with these situations with 
agriculture in a knee-jerk fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to try to take the politics out of this issue 
because it has been a problem that has plagued us for a long 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that Canadian people have to be asked and have to 
answer a very basic question:  Do we want agriculture in this 
country or not?  That is what it comes down to.  When it comes 
down to the oilseed and grain sector, that is the very stark 
choice that is happening in the prairies and other parts of the 
country these days because it simply will not be around unless 
we take a different approach to how we handle agriculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have seen the devastation and we have heard about it here 
today.  We have heard a lot of good comments summarizing the 
seriousness of the situation.  I agree 100% that we have a very 
vital industry that is going down the tubes.  People are losing 
their farms.  I see it every day in my riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that we will have do something in the short term with 
emergency aid, but unless we have some kind of long term plan to 
deal with this and unless we have some appreciation by the 
Canadian people that it is in their interest that we have 
agriculture in Canada, we will lose this war.  One of the reasons 
I say that is that we simply cannot compete with subsidies 
against massively populated countries like the United States or the 
European Union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should mention at this time that I will be splitting my time 
with the member for Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We simply cannot play that game.  We will lose every time.  We 
have to do something today about the emergency crisis, but I make 
the case very passionately that we simply cannot win that game in 
the long term.

<A HREF="#LINKT127"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What could be done?  First, I think Canadians have to decide 
whether they want this agricultural industry.  We could import 
food more cheaply from other countries, I would think right now, with 
the subsidies out there.  We could go that route and we would see 
the devastation that would happen in our rural communities.  I am 
afraid it would not stop there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have one rural community that lost several farm dealerships 
last year.  The community is in decline.  I had a public meeting 
and there were grown people crying at that meeting.  That is how 
serious it is.  They are losing their farms.  It is not just the 
farmers.  The businessmen were losing their car dealerships.  It 
does not stop there.  It goes to the cities, because in western 
Canada in particular where I live, agriculture is a very big 
part.  For every job in agriculture there are seven spinoff 
jobs.  If we do not think this affects the entire country we are 
not living in a real world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What could be done?  We know some of the things that could be 
done. There is the short term aid I talked about.  Others have 
suggested tax relief on excise taxes on fuel.  Those are things 
we could do at home.  We could have transportation reform to try 
to get the cost of delivery down. We will have to do that.  There 
have been some good suggestions in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real problem has to be addressed by the international 
community.  Canada has to play a lot stronger role in doing that. 
After all, who else will do it if we do not do it?  Canada has 
long been a leader in trying to get some rules around doing 
business and trade in the world.  Right after the war we were one 
of the main proponents calling for trade rules.  Agriculture was 
not included for a lot of different reasons, but we were there 
and we continue to push for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest we have to be a lot tougher in those negotiations.  If 
we want our agricultural industry to survive, we have to start 
looking after our national interests much more than we are doing 
today.  When it comes to situations like NATO saying that Canada 
is not playing its part and that we have to up the ante and put 
more money into it, we should be saying to them that we are 
prepared to do that.  We are prepared to talk about that, but not 
if countries that are part of that organization have policies 
which are destroying a vital sector of our economy.  We have to 
look after the national interest first, and we are not doing 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes beyond that.  Europe spent $150 billion on agriculture 
subsidies last year.  We know that it overproduces.  It does not 
only supply its own markets.  That was its goal to begin with, 
but it produces 10% or 15% overage from what they need.  What 
does it do with it?  It dumps it on to the world market just to 
get rid of it.  Those depressed prices kill our agriculture 
exports because they have to compete against that fire sale 
price. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Europe comes to us next time with a problem in its backyard 
saying that Canada has great peacekeepers that are needed again 
in Bosnia or some place, I would say we are prepared to do that 
but not if it continues those kinds of policies that are killing 
a vital sector of our economy and destroying a way of life in 
Canada, destroying our rural communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It just seems to me that we have to get more hard-nosed.  We 
have to recognize that we have a vital industry that is important 
to us.  We could probably import our food cheaper than we could 
produce it right now with the subsidies that are out there, but 
what happens in 15 years if those subsidies are no longer there? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happens if the currency changes and there is a terrific 
devaluation?  All of a sudden the price of our food becomes much 
more expensive.  What will happen?  Canadians will wake up and 
ask:  what happened to our farmers; why were the policymakers not 
more responsible; why did they not encourage our farmers; and why 
did they not tell us about the vital need for agriculture and 
food security?  Those are the questions they will be asking once 
the agricultural industry has gone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say we need some foresight.  Collectively as a country we have 
to be much more hard-nosed.  That is the long term answer. People 
say to me that long term is 10 years or 15 years and their eyes 
glaze over.  This problem existed when I came here in 1993, which 
will soon be eight years ago, and we are still going along with a 
knee-jerk reaction.  The sooner we start to realize that our 
national interests have to be protected, the sooner we can work 
toward some kind of solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage all members of the House to work together to that 
end.  I am sorry to say that the way we are going is not the 
answer.  We simply will not have a grain and oilseeds sector left 
in the near future unless we do something very important like the 
move I am suggesting.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Cheryl Gallant (Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise to add to the sense of urgency 
that our party believes exists in regard to letting the 
government know that there is a crisis for the Canadian family 
farm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my home province of Ontario, the agricultural sector in rural 
Ontario remains an important engine for economic growth. 
Projected farm gate sales of $8.84 billion for 1999 tell us that 
agriculture in Ontario continues to grow.  Additionally, the 
simultaneous increase in farm gate sales and the decline in farm 
jobs tells us that farmers continue to become more productive 
with a trend toward more capital intensive operations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Agriculture is big business in my riding of 
Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke.  A recent study that also includes 
our fellow Alliance members in the county of Lanark shows that 
there are 7,021 jobs tied to the agricultural sector and over 
$240 million per annum in sales from farms and businesses that 
buy and sell to farms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The study also states that for every on farm job in Renfrew and 
Lanark counties, there are an additional 1.3 jobs off the farm in 
the economy serving the needs of local farm operators.  The sales 
expenditure multiplier shows that for every dollar spent by a 
farmer there is an additional $1.45 in sales by businesses that 
deal with farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the past federal election, I was able to hear firsthand 
the plight of our local farmers.  There has been a loss of small 
farms through consolidation.  It is getting harder to find 
processing plants and markets to take their produce.  Government 
services are actually being withdrawn from farmers and the gap is 
not always filled by the private sector.  There is a shortage of 
skilled trades workers due to higher wages that are available 
elsewhere.  Our most tragic problem is the exodus of our youth 
from the rural areas and the family farms because it is felt by 
some producers that there is no future on the family farm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most significantly, many of the farmers I spoke to believe that 
the problems facing farmers today are tied to one thing:  low 
commodity prices.  Much of the frustration my constituents had 
with the former member and the current government was that when 
they tried to draw attention to the farm crisis they were pushed 
off and told that the problem was the weather. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the Canadian Alliance know better.  Farmers are being 
driven off the land by a Liberal government that has had its head 
in the sand when it comes to the practices of our trading 
partners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers are not asking for special treatment but for a level 
playing field when it comes to heavily subsidized foreign produce 
being dumped into our markets.  Even though U.S. farmers are paid 
10 times the amount of government dollars that the Canadian 
government pays to our farmers, Canadians enjoy some of the 
lowest food prices in the developed world.  Where European 
consumers spend 30% of their incomes on food and Americans spend 
11%, Canadians spend just 9.5% of their incomes on food. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian farmers need a government that is on their side.  It 
saddened me to learn that in the last parliament, Liberal, PC and 
NDP members on the Standing Committee for Agriculture and 
Agri-Food voted twice against allowing the committee to travel in 
Ontario to hear from farmers directly.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As an Alliance member from Ontario I am not afraid to hear about 
the plight of farmers in my home province, and they have my 
commitment that they will have a voice through me in this 
parliament, where they have not had one since at least 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What farmers in Ontario and Renfrew county need is an immediate 
cash injection to safeguard the spring crop.  They need a cost of 
production farm support program, one for all of Canada, and a 
government that will protect the independent farmer and the 
consumer from big business, which is buying up all the 
competition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once big business has driven the independent producers out of 
business, wait for prices to climb out of control.  All we are 
asking is that the government support the needs of Canadian 
farmers so they can continue to put quality homegrown food on the 
tables of consumers.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jerry Pickard (Chatham—Kent Essex, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the member for 
Haliburton—Victoria—Brock. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to have the opportunity to take part in this debate 
tonight.  Member after member has stood in the House and pointed 
out that there is a tragic crisis in the agricultural community, 
and no one in the House, no one who has spent time with 
agricultural people, will deny that.  We certainly need to make 
some changes.  We need to move that agenda very rapidly and we 
need short term and long term solutions for that crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A safe and abundant food supply that is very cheap is clearly 
one of the joys that we in Canada share.  The agriculture and 
agrifood industry plays an enormous role in the daily living of 
every Canadian.  The agriculture and agrifood industry is the 
third largest employer in Canada, generating about $95 billion in 
domestic, retail and food service sales each year and $22 billion 
in exports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, the agriculture and agrifood industry holds a 
significant place in our country's economy.  That is why the 
current state of this industry—and its future—is an extremely 
important issue for all people in Canada.  Every Canadian must 
pay careful attention to what is happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian farmers boast an impressive record despite the 
distressed economic situation they are facing.  Farming has 
always been a risky business, but never more so than today.  Low 
commodity prices, adverse weather, high input costs and 
overproduction due to high subsidies in the United States and the 
European Union are causing great hardship for our Canadian 
farmers.  This is particularly the case for our grains and 
oilseeds producers, who have experienced significant income 
declines due to circumstances far beyond their control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prices paid to Ontario and other Canadian farmers for sales of 
most Ontario grains and oilseed crops have been near their lowest 
historic levels in value.  In real dollars, they are lower in the 
last four years than in any historic past.  This is a direct 
result of government policies in western Europe and the United 
States.  We are told that a crop farmer in Ontario growing a 
typical balance of corn, soybeans and wheat receives less than 
half as much government support as he or she would receive from 
growing identical crops just a few miles south of my riding, in 
the United States.  This is the reality my local farmers face. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since December 20, the price of corn has dropped 10 cents to 13 
cents a bushel.  Soybeans are down 82 cents to 84 cents a bushel. 
Fuel and fertilizer costs are up.  Last summer ammonium nitrate 
was $300 a metric tonne and now it is $345. 
The price of urea has increased from $300 to $450.  Local 
property taxes are forecasted to increase.  Farmers are having 
difficulty obtaining bank loans and banks will start foreclosure. 
In fact, news of foreclosures has already been splashed across 
the media in my area.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers are wondering if they can even plant their crops this 
year, and the level of frustration among farmers is reaching a 
peak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The approach the federal government has taken so far involves 
short term and long term measures.  To respond to the farmers' 
immediate needs, emergency assistance has been put in place, 
first in 1998 and again last July.  We worked hard to implement a 
three year $3.3 billion federal plan for agricultural incomes. 
This approach includes an outgoing income disaster program, which 
Canadian farmers called for.  Annual funding for safety nets now 
committed by the federal government is almost double what it was 
before this agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the past five years the federal government has spent 
approximately $13 billion in support of the agrifood sector, but 
immediate cash shortfalls and assistance programs are only part 
of the solution.  At present, they are not helping our farm 
community as much as our farm community needs.  Several members 
of the House have made it very clear a cash injection at this 
time is imperative.  There is no question that we need to make 
sure there is some stability in that agricultural sector here in 
this country now.  I think that is extremely important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have to realize that we need to go onto the 
international scene, as many members of the House have said and 
certainly as the farm communities have said.  We all want forms 
of agricultural support subsidies eliminated.  Support subsidies 
in Europe, in the United States and in other countries that 
compete with our farmers cripple our farmers if our farmers do 
not get the same supports.  If we try to raise our supports, we 
will just have a spiralling roof which will make it impossible to 
have reasonable prices for commodities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our farm communities have said very carefully that they do not 
want subsidies, they want fairness.  They want good prices for 
their products.  Cheap food is a reality in Canada, but we have 
not supported our agricultural producers who are producing that 
cheap food in the way we need to.   The sooner the better, the 
minister has said, let us get rid of these subsidies.  Let us not 
just go on a cheap food policy, but let us stop international 
dumping at low costs.  Everyone gets hurt when it is an 
internationally subsidized crop.  Clear rules are needed to 
prevent the forms of export assistance from becoming subsidies 
for export. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same goes for domestic forms of assistance that can be as 
trade distorting as export subsidies.  If world prices that are 
already too low are being driven down by these unfair practices, 
if these practices are hurting our farmers and farmers in the 
majority of other agriculture producing countries, these 
practices should be curtailed and eliminated.  Rules that apply 
equally to all are an important part of a trade equation.  Trade 
rules that are open, secure and predictable, as well as fair and 
level, are the key to ensuring that agricultural policies of this 
country and all other countries are fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why I am pleased to hear the Prime Minister recently 
state that we must address the subsidy problem, that our farmers 
should be able to compete on a level playing field.  The subsidy 
wars are of no interest or help to Canadians.  This is a battle 
Canada must win.  Positioning the Canadian agriculture and 
agrifood sector strategically for the long term is an important 
element in helping Canadian farmers achieve stability, 
profitability and long term support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why I was equally pleased to see that agriculture was 
mentioned in the recent throne speech and that the government 
will help Canada's agricultural sector move beyond crisis 
management.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could not agree more.  It is time the Government of Canada and 
Canadian farmers moved beyond the crisis management mode and 
worked together.  I support the government's efforts to support 
this vital industry. However, we must commit to doing even more 
for our farmers at this time, especially those in the grain and 
oilseed sectors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to do everything possible to help farmers who put food 
on our tables through this difficult period.  We need to close 
the gap and put farmers on a fair and equal footing.  That is 
what farmers want; that is what the government must do; and that 
is what I have heard from every member of the House who stood 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to recognize very clearly the agricultural crisis.  It 
is important to thousands of families across the land who do not 
farm.  It is important to the sectors of society that sell goods 
to farmers.  It is important to the sectors of society that use 
farm products.  It is important to the sectors of society that 
are helped by this thriving industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not forget that this basic industry has been the 
foundation for Canada's development in the past and in the 
present.  It will be the industry of the future that will ensure 
the well-being of Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John O'Reilly (Haliburton—Victoria—Brock, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am using the last half of my friend's time.  I wanted 
to make sure that the debate included 
Haliburton—Victoria—Brock.  If I combine my riding with the 
neighbouring riding of Hastings—Frontenac, they together 
comprise a third of the land in southern Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My riding is a rural riding in Ontario, with 24 Santa Claus 
parades, 18 cenotaph services and many other such things that 
happen in rural ridings.  When visiting its 44 municipalities I 
realize that I am dealing with small groups of agriculture based 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the same in your riding, Mr. Speaker, which is a big farm 
community.  There was a rally in your riding the other day, and I 
thank you for attending it.  Some farmers from my riding were 
there to make the point that there was a crisis in certain 
sectors of agriculture today.  More than one sector of 
agriculture is affected because today's problems in one sector 
are tomorrow's problems in another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are 27 commodity groups in Ontario.  I have been trying to 
encourage farm groups to get together as one voice and not as 
segregated groups trying to accomplish things for their own 
sectors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I work with farm groups.  I realize they are very proud people. 
They are not looking for a handout.  They are looking to work on 
a level playing field, as the saying goes, and to be able to 
compete globally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has some of the most efficient farmers in the world.  My 
riding has a lot of agricultural groups that work through the 
supply management system.  There are over 400 working dairy farms 
in my riding.  When I approach farmers with items of concern, 
when I bring some of the chief negotiators into the riding to 
work with them to find ways to be more productive, the meetings 
tend to be very big. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before this debate I attended a meeting with the Minister of 
Finance.  I wanted to make sure he knew exactly what the problems 
were, what the numbers were and what we were asking for.  I 
wanted also to be assured he had those numbers when he went to 
cabinet along with the minister of agriculture, so that they knew 
exactly what it would take for the 60 days between now and 
planting season.  After planting season, farm people must look at 
what they will get for their crops in the end.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a quick fix to get the seed in the ground.  It is 
required in order to get a good price for the product.  That is 
the systemic problem in Ontario and other provinces at this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This afternoon we met with the members for Malpeque, Essex, 
Lambton—Kent—Middlesex, Leeds—Grenville, 
Dufferin—Peel—Wellington—Grey, Elgin—Middlesex—London and 
the member for Etobicoke North, who does not have any farms there.  He is 
parliamentary secretary and we thought we should have him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we dealt with it, talked about it and laid out the numbers, we 
saw that it was a whole farm problem.  It is not just one 
commodity group, although at this time grains and oilseeds are 
having problems and are at the forefront.  Other sectors could be 
affected because Canada's food production is under attack from 
the world.  If we allow ourselves to be taken over, if we allow 
the marketplace to be the only force that decides, we will not 
have family farms.  We must deal with the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I compliment some of the people in my riding: Ed Bragshaw, Bruce 
Webster, Joe Hickson and Bill Holland.  They have held rallies. 
They have presented petitions.  They have had phone campaigns. 
They are addressing the problem in a way that is very important 
to them and to me.  They bring their voices forward to be heard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also compliment the member for Toronto—Danforth, who is a 
leader in promotion and a tremendous thinker when it comes to 
things like the farm aid show.  There are no farms in his riding, 
but he is looking at being the voice for bringing farmers 
together.  He is trying to make some type of promotional hook, 
and he knows today's problem with grains and oilseeds is 
tomorrow's problem for other sectors of agriculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A farm organization gets six cents worth of product in a box of 
cereal while a dollar on that box goes to a hockey player.  I 
have nothing against hockey players.  I know your son is in the 
NHL, Mr. Speaker.  I am glad he is getting a dollar from a box of 
cereal.  The point is that if a farmer gets six cents for the 
cereal while a golfer gets a dollar for his picture on the box, 
there is obviously something wrong with the way we do business in 
agriculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our parties here tonight are close to short term solutions but 
the long term problems will still exist.  An instant infusion of 
cash does not help the systemic problems.  Another compounding 
issue is that on very successful farms the average age of a 
farmer is 57 or 58 years old.  The younger generation is being 
discouraged from farming because of the problems in the 
marketplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the short term I compliment the agricultural community for 
putting its voices together and bringing the problem to the 
forefront.  I thank you, Mr. Speaker, for allowing the debate to 
continue.  I compliment the member for Brandon—Souris for 
bringing the problem to the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the House to continue to debate our food system, not just 
grains and oilseeds but the whole farm problem, the whole 
food system, and the safety of our food which is uppermost in our 
minds.  I think this problem is the tip of the iceberg for what 
is going on in agriculture today.   We must address it very 
aggressively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House has to take a proactive stand to make sure farmers are 
protected and that they get a decent return for what they 
produce.  The input costs have to be taken into consideration for 
the price of the end product. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the House will continue to address the whole farm problem 
and not just the one segment before us tonight.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I intend to share my time with my colleague from Nova 
Scotia who has a brilliant dissertation to make about the 
problems facing maritime agriculture, including the problems in 
Prince Edward Island. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the worst crisis in prairie agriculture since the 1930s. 
I am talking specifically about the grain and oilseed industry. 
In the 1930s many people were forced off the land.  Today the 
same thing is happening and it is happening in spades. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the fall of 1999 to the fall of 2000 some 22,000 prairie 
farmers were forced off the land: 6,500 in my own province, about 
4,000 or 5,000 in Manitoba, and more than 10,000 in Alberta.  So 
many farmers were forced off the land that statisticians at 
Statistics Canada at first could not believe what their computers 
told them.  About 40,000 people in the farm industry were forced 
off the land at the same time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The crisis on the prairies is unlike anything we have seen since 
the 1930s.  All one has to do is drive around small towns in 
Saskatchewan and Manitoba to see how real the crisis is.  The 
situation is the same in Alberta outside of Edmonton and Calgary. 
Regina and Saskatoon are not doing badly, but the rest of 
Saskatchewan is really suffering because of the farm crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the election campaign and last summer I went to every 
small town and village in my riding.  With the exception of one 
or two, every town is suffering a loss of population.  People are 
moving out and businesses are closing because of the collapse of 
the farm economy.  The towns that are doing well, like my 
hometown of Wynyard or the town of Fort Qu'Appelle, are doing 
well because of other industries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a chicken plant in Wynyard called Lillydale that 
employs about 500 people.  The employees are unionized and 
receive decent wages and have decent working conditions.  Despite 
that, the town is only holding its own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fort Qu'Appelle is a tourist town with a big tourist industry, 
particularly in the summertime.  There too the people are only 
holding their own.  Most other towns are shrinking because of the 
crisis in agriculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two things have to happen and they have to happen soon.   First, 
we need an immediate injection of cash into the farm economy so 
that farmers can seed their crops in the spring.  If that does 
not happen thousands more farmers will leave the land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, we need a long term farm program that has some 
relationship to the cost of production so that farmers have basic 
some guarantees about the commodities they produce.  We can do 
that within the confines and context of the World Trade 
Organization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It strikes me as strange that farmers in Canada are not as 
supported as farmers in the United States.  Canada has a $100 
billion surplus for the next five years.  We can afford now to 
help grain farmers.  Washington helps American farmers in North 
Dakota, Montana, Oklahoma and right across the midwest of the 
United States.  Brussels helps European farmers.  What does our 
federal government do?  It does very little when it comes to 
helping grain and oilseed farmers across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we need is a long term farm program that is based on the 
cost of production so that farmers have an idea in the spring 
what they will receive in the fall.  They need to know they will 
get back at least the cost of producing a crop and a decent 
living wage for their families.  That is the kind of thing that 
will have to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have to realize that if the government does not take the 
initiative to intervene in terms of long term programs to support 
the family farm and its way of life, those farms will disappear 
and corporate farms will take over.  Small towns will be gone and 
soon Cargill, Dow Chemical, Monsanto and big corporations will 
run the entire western Canadian farm base.  The only institution 
large enough to turn the trend around is the Government of 
Canada representing all the people of the country.

</I></B></P><P align=left>What we should realize is that agriculture is the basic 
foundation industry of this country and when the farmer is better 
off then we are all better off in terms of our economy and the 
creation of jobs in Canada.  That is what a lot of people in the 
government do not seem to realize or understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some sections of farming that are not doing badly. 
The member for Malpeque said earlier that in the late 1960s 
legislation was read in the House to bring in supply management 
and marketing boards for four commodities.  We have the Canadian 
Dairy Commission, CEMA, the Canadian Egg Marketing Agency, the 
Canadian Chicken Marketing Agency and the Canadian Turkey 
Marketing Agency.  These supply management boards guarantee to 
the producers in those areas a cost of production and a standard 
of living which is reasonable and decent for the products and 
foods they produce.  For the consumers, they produce a stable 
price for people who buy milk, turkey, chickens and eggs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even those marketing boards are now under threat because of the 
World Trade Organization and mainly because the Americans see 
them as an inhibition to a so-called free market.  For the 
Americans, the free market definition is what is good for a huge 
transnational corporation is good for the people of the United 
States.  I say that is wrong.  We have to fight to maintain our 
supply marketing boards.  We have to fight to maintain the 
strength of the Canadian Wheat Board.  It is very important that 
we have a single desk marketing agency which is the Canadian 
Wheat Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am surprised time and time again to see the Alliance Party get 
up and talk about a dual marketing system which in effect would 
destroy the Canadian Wheat Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are issues that are very important if we are to preserve 
the farm in Canada.  If we had a dual marketing system, the 
Canadian Wheat Board would not survive because it would be in 
competition with the huge transnational, multinational grain 
companies in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are some of the issues.  We plead tonight with the 
Minister of Finance to loosen the purse strings a bit and come up 
with an immediate injection of cash so that grain farmers can 
afford to put in a crop.  We plead with him to come up with an 
immediate injection of cash that would help the farmers.  There 
are stories after stories being told of their hardships and about 
people being forced off the land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More important, in addition to that number one priority, is to 
make sure we have a long term program that is based on the cost 
of production so that farmers, like grain farmers, dairy 
producers, chicken producers and turkey producers will have some 
kind of a guarantee for the price of their commodities when they 
plant a crop in the spring.  They should have some kind of a 
guarantee of a decent price come the fall. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know why this has not become a priority of the Liberal 
government.  We get up here day after day and say there is a 
crisis.  We have Liberals day after day saying there is a crisis. 
My God, if there is a crisis, let us do something about it.  Let 
us restore some democracy to this institution.  Let us separate 
parliament from the executive.  Let us have parliament say to the 
executive, the Government of Canada and to the cabinet, that this 
is a crisis, that as a crisis it is a priority and if it is a 
priority then money should be spent in making sure we solve the 
problems, not just for the farmers but for the people of Canada. 
That is what has to be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead we have an institution that has become more of a 
debating society where people get up and pontificate and make 
speeches.  Some of them are good, like the member for 
Brandon—Souris who made an excellent speech.  We come up and 
make these speeches time and time again.  No wonder people are 
getting cynical of this institution.  No wonder only 60% of the 
people voted in the last election.  In spite of all the good 
words, the good intentions, all the speeches, the research and 
the money spent to run this place, it is falling on deaf ears 
when it comes to the Minister of Finance, the Prime Minister, the 
mandarins in the Privy Council Office and in the Department of 
Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is about time the House passed a motion insisting that the 
will of parliament is to make sure we have an immediate short 
term program for the farmers and a long term program based on the 
cost of production to keep our farmers on the land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My time has expired and there is going to be an absolutely 
eloquent speech coming from my friend from Nova Scotia.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure and 
sadness at the same time to rise in the House to speak on the 
crisis in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Coming from the east coast and going through the crisis in the 
fishing industry, I say that the parallels are exactly the same.  My 
colleague from the Conservative Party from St. John's East, the 
member for St. John's West and the five Liberals who come from 
Newfoundland and Labrador can eloquently state that the exact 
same thing that is happening to our farmers in 2001 happened to 
our fishermen and their families in 1993.  What did the 
government learn from that?  Absolutely nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two weeks ago a group of farmers and their children spoke to our 
caucus about the crisis in the industry.  I asked a young man who 
was about 12 or 13 years old from Saskatchewan if he was going to 
go into farming when he was old enough.  The young man said no. I 
asked if any kids in his school who were going to take up 
agriculture as a way of life like his father, his grandfather and 
his forefathers did.  The answer was no.  This young man came to 
the House of Commons.  He was very nervous.  He spoke to us as 
parliamentarians and told us very honestly that there was no 
future for him or his classmates in agriculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say this to anyone who is listening to the governing 
party, the official opposition and other political parties.  Just 
who in hell will our farmers be in the future?  Who is 
going to feed us?  Who is going to feed our children?  Who is 
going to look after us? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we wake up and have breakfast in the morning, and when all 
Canadians wake up and feeds their kids oatmeal and cereal, where 
do they think that food comes from?  It comes from the farmers. 
We are losing our food sovereignty.  The day we lose that is the 
day that will live in infamy.  It will be a very sad day when we 
have to rely on other nations to feed our population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just recently an absolute shame happened on Prince Edward 
Island.  On a corporate farm, Cavendish Farms in P.E.I., a few 
potatoes were found with a bit of a wart.  They call it a potato 
blight.  Immediately it was sent to CFIA.  Immediately the 
Americans were told and on Hallowe'en they shut the market down 
to P.E.I. potatoes, causing a huge crisis.  About $30 million to 
$50 million of agricultural funds are being lost by potato 
producers on the island. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did the Americans have the gall to tell our Canadian 
representatives?  They said that not only was P.E.I not allowed 
to sell potatoes to the States because of the blight, it was not 
even allowed to sell its potatoes to other parts of Canada 
because of the so-called fear that the blight might spread to other 
fields.  Imagine that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did our minister say?  He said they would talk about it 
more and discuss it further.  The minister showed absolutely no 
backbone by not standing up and protecting the producers in 
P.E.I., and by not telling the Americans once and for all to take 
their agricultural concerns and shove them where the sun does not 
shine.  I say that with due all respect to my American cousins. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Canada does not stand up for its producers, who will?  Who 
will stand up for the P.E.I. farmers?  I give kudos to the member 
for Malpeque.  He is not only a personal friend, and I know he is 
in the governing party, but he has done yeoman's work in his 
years as a president of the National Farmers Union and as a 
Liberal backbencher to pursue this issue within his own 
government.  He has told me many times how frustrated he is with 
the department of agriculture and with the lack of attention it 
pays to Canadian farmers and their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an absolute disgrace that I, as an immigrant, have to 
stand in the House of Commons to try to defend the interests of 
farmers along with the eloquent speakers from Regina—Qu'Appelle 
and Palliser, and also my great colleague Mr. John Solomon of 
Regina stood in the House time and time again to plead, to 
bargain, to do anything to bring the attention of the House to 
the farmers.

</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened?  We get the same old rhetoric.  We do not know if 
we can do anything.  We are not sure.  We are going to have to 
pick up the phone and see what the Americans are going to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the short amount of time that I have left, let me say that 
Mr. John Solomon, 
a former member of the House, was in Brussels once at a UN talk. 
He met a French minister.  They talked about the agricultural 
subsidies and the battles which were going on.  What was said to 
Mr. Solomon was very clear about how the European Union looks 
after its farmers.  The French minister said to John that if he 
thought for one second that the French were not going to look 
after their farmers because of the States or Canada, then he was 
out of his head.  He also said that France would do everything in 
its power to see that its farmers were taken care of.  They 
wanted French farmers to produce food to feed them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is almost a revelation.  It is unbelievable that in France 
ministers stand up for their farmers.  However, what do we do in 
Canada?  We play the boy scout routine.  We cut, slash, 
absolutely annihilate the farmers and force them off the lands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Newfoundland many years ago there was a premier named Joey 
Smallwood who brought in the resettlement program.  At least he 
had the intellectual honesty to tell the people he was going to 
move them from the outports and industrialize them into the major 
centres. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government does not even have the courage to tell the 
farmers that it is going to force them off the lands, which is 
the exact same thing it did to the fishermen on the east coast. 
The same crisis is happening to the fishermen on the west coast. 
It is not a surprise.  There is no secrecy in this issue. I 
honestly believe that the government has an agenda in place to 
get rid of the independent family farm and move it to major 
transnational corporations and to big agri-farms.  I think that 
is the future that the government wants to pursue.  That is 
absolutely incredible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the east coast we lost the independent fishermen.  We lost 
our lighthouses.  In central Canada they are losing their grain 
elevators and their family farms.  How can the government stand 
up and call itself a national party that cares about all 
citizens when it will not even look after the people who feed us 
every single day? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask you, Mr. Speaker, in your role in this Chamber, and anyone 
who is listening, when you have breakfast in the morning, 
to say a little prayer for our farmers and for the women and the 
children on those farms.  They are the ones who feed us.  They 
are the ones who take care of us.  If we cannot take care of them 
and look after them, then we do not deserve to be in government. 
We do not even deserve to be in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, I think it would be excellent for the House and the 
Department of Agriculture and Agri-Food to get out of their ivory 
towers.  Everyone should get on a combine or put on a pair of jeans 
and a sweatshirt and go out on the family farm.  We should get up 
at 4 o'clock in the morning to see what it is like to plant the 
seeds in order to look after our farmers and our food.  We must 
see where it actually comes from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been sanitized to think that we just get up in the 
morning, we open up the fridge, the cupboard and, voila, there is 
all this food.  If we run out, we go to the local store.  That 
food comes directly from the farm from people who make a minimum 
salary and from people who love what they are doing.  They feel 
absolutely out of touch with what is going on in the government. 
The government is absolutely out of touch with them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask all members of parliament, especially my colleagues 
from the Liberal party for whom I have great respect, to please 
do something to help the farmers now.  Bring in the long term 
plans for our farmers so that we can have farming in this country 
for many years to come.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  Before we give consent to this particular request, I 
would like to make it known that this request was sought not on 
the floor of the House but in an earlier meeting and it was 
denied.  I hope that by agreeing to this now we would not be 
setting any precedent or giving the government the impression 
that this is something we want to do at an earlier point in an 
emergency debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The members on the other side do not have to agree but I am 
trying to make a point here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When there is an emergency debate, presumably members of the 
opposition or others who sought the emergency debate would want 
to have an opportunity to convince the government members that 
there is in fact an emergency.  In order to do that, we need to 
have government members on the other side to talk to, which is 
one of the reasons we did not agree to the autopilot motion 
earlier.  Otherwise we would have been speaking to an empty House 
all night. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seeing as the debate is winding down, we agree but without 
prejudice to agreeing to do this in other circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Let me take this in the usual two

<P><A NAME="LINK248"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton—Kent—Middlesex, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, while I am pleased to have this opportunity to include 
my comments during this emergency debate, it is unfortunate that 
this debate is even necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must change the mindset that exists in some quarters of 
official Ottawa, which may see agriculture as some outdated 
sector of our economy and may suggest that better management on 
our farms might solve all today's problems.  Trust me: management 
of our farms is not the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are asking our farmers to confront and challenge the highly 
competitive export market while being tackled by subsidies in the 
U.S. and the European Union.  Farmers need a level playing field 
to continue in the industry.  For example, let me share with the 
House this evening an income statement from a local farmer, as of 
December 31, 2000.  He owns and rents about 600 acres.  His 
nitrogen costs were about $250 per tonne, a 67% increase from 
1999.  As of January 31, 2001, the cost is $350 per tonne, a 40% 
increase in one month.  His diesel fuel increased 42% in one 
year.  His income was just under $186,000 and his expenses were 
just slightly over $242,000.  His net income is thus a negative 
$55,300. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this point I should mention that I will be sharing my time 
with the hon. Minister of Natural Resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How long can we expect this farmer to continue?  This financial 
predicament has nothing to do with bad farming practices but 
everything to do with matters outside his or her control, such as 
high input costs and low commodity prices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that the decision makers are listening, because what is 
happening on our farms is not due to bad management or outdated 
ideas.  We have survived thus far, due in large measure to good 
management and meeting the challenges of ever changing times. As 
a farmer in my life before politics I know well of the trials and 
tribulations.  We cannot control the weather any more than we 
wish we could control the U.S. congress or France's financial 
backing of its agriculture sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many issues, one being subsidies, that our government 
is addressing on the global stage.  Those matters are important 
and vital to the long term survival of our highly diversified 
farms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hear from farmers and their organizations every day.  In rural 
Canada we are independent and self-sufficient.  Demonstrations, 
blocking of traffic and rallies to highlight food freedom day are 
not the first objectives of farmers, but the frustration has 
grown rapidly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last summer several meetings were hosted by the Ontario 
Federation of Agriculture for farmers to talk about their 
circumstances to their provincial and federal elected members. 
One of the largest meetings was held in my riding, which is home 
to many farm leaders such as Ontario corn producers, soybean 
growers, asparagus growers and Ontario wheat producers, and the 
list goes on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that the employment and sale expenditure multipliers 
indicate that for every job in agriculture there are an 
additional 1.28 jobs outside agriculture, and for each dollar in 
sales in agriculture, there is $1.57 in sales in agriculture 
related businesses.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When farmers are in financial difficulty the ripple effect is 
felt across all sectors of the economy, especially in our rural 
communities.  Agriculture is big business.  It is an original 
life science.  This sector is continuously evolving and adapting 
in order to achieve goals and meet new challenges identified by 
science, trade and societal demands.  Food production has become 
more efficient.  Farmers have increased crop diversification, and 
agriculture's impact on the environment has gained much 
significance, especially in recent years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To maintain Canada's high standard of agricultural production, 
the industry requires investment.  Strengthening the agriculture 
and agrifood industry will serve to benefit all Canadians by 
providing safe and affordable food, greater employment, new uses 
for non-food products and a greener environment.  We must secure 
conditions for success by improving farm income supports, 
lessening the tax burden on our farmers, improving research and 
development and investing in sustainable agriculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A vision for the future of agriculture has been laid out but the 
path to get there is still uncertain.  Some progress has been 
made and too often that gets lost in the rush by others to 
criticize and condemn.  I congratulate our Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food for working with the provinces on the 
new $5.5 billion three year national safety net agreement.  It is 
part of our 85% increase in farm support since 1995 while the 
Ontario government, for example, continues to spend less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new safety net agreement followed many months of intense 
discussion.  It was not easy.  The prairie provinces felt they 
should be treated differently from Ontario, while the Ontario 
government was pushing for its fair share of the nationally 
allocated safety net dollars.  Ontario received an additional $32 
million per year as a result of those positive changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe we now have the appropriate programs in place, but we 
must enhance that with additional funding.  It is essential to 
point out that the provinces do have a role to play here as well. 
They are quick to denounce and, in Ontario's case, slow to 
support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The intent of safety nets is to set a solid foundation for a 
complementary package of programs to address a variety of farm 
income problems resulting from such factors as fluctuating 
prices, poor weather and foreign subsidies, but we must now look 
at doing more.  Commodity prices are at historically low levels. 
For some products, prices will stay low for both the short and 
the long term.  Foreign subsidies are not coming down.  Farm 
input costs, including fuel and fertilizer costs, are not going 
down.  Together they account for about $3.8 billion, or 13% of 
total input expenses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have enhanced NISA by allowing participants easier access to 
their accounts, and the federal government contributes at twice 
the rate of the provincial governments.  We have renewed crop 
insurance.  We have extended and enhanced the market revenue 
insurance program, which is expected to pay out more than $200 
million for 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers often need access to credit to help them get their crops 
planted in the spring.  That is why in April 2000 we launched the 
spring credit advance program, worth $52 million to 3,000 Ontario 
farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also know that farmers have bills to pay in the fall, often 
before they want to market their crops, so we continue to provide 
fall cash advance programs through the advanced payments program, 
through which the federal government pays the interest on the 
first $50,000 of an advance issued to a producer.  About 4,000 
Ontario farmers have been in the program over the past three 
years, saving over $6 million in interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>National and provincial farm groups are suggesting adding $300 
million to farm safety nets to address the crisis in the grains 
and oilseeds sector in particular, with 60% from the federal 
government and 40% from the province.  This would help level the 
playing field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to make certain that Canadian food continues to be 
produced at a reasonable price and at a fair return to our 
primary producers.  Our nation is a success with a strong and 
viable agriculture industry.  Let us all work together to ensure 
that agriculture remains a success within Canada.  We can, and we 
must, do more.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Maloney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to speak in the emergency debate on our agricultural 
sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will take this opportunity to talk about food safety, an issue 
that is very important to the agricultural industry and to all 
Canadians.  Food safety has become an issue in the media recently 
as a result of Canada's decision to suspend imports of food 
products from Brazil. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to remind the House that Canada has one of the 
safest food supplies in the world, and during this debate I want 
to explain to the House how the current issues involving 
Brazilian food products have arisen as a result of our vigorous 
measures to put the health and safety of Canadians first and 
foremost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a system of laws, regulations, inspections and product 
approval procedures that protects the health and safety of our 
food supply.  The system is based on checks and balances to 
ensure that all parties fulfil their responsibilities. Imported 
products are subject to the same rigorous production and 
inspection standards that we set for our own domestic food 
products.  Canadians expect no less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently the food inspection systems in Canada and in other 
countries have had to respond to a new and troubling development, 
the growing threat of TSEs, transmissible spongiform 
encephalopathies.  TSEs are fatal diseases that affect the 
central nervous system of animals or humans.  They include 
diseases such as scrapie in sheep.  In elk and deer, they take 
the form of chronic wasting disease. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past few years there has been a growing concern about the 
form TSEs take in cattle, bovine spongiform encephalopathy or 
BSE, also known as mad cow disease.  Researchers speculate that 
ingesting BSE infected beef may be related to Creutzfeldt-Jakob 
disease, the form that TSE takes in humans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has taken several measures to prevent the introduction of 
BSE or the spread of TSEs.  So far these measures have proven to 
be successful.  We have no reason to believe that BSE exists in 
Canada, but there is no such thing as zero risk and we cannot 
guarantee that a case of BSE will never occur in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In today's debate on what is happening in agriculture, I wish to 
reassure the House that the government has placed a very high 
priority on keeping BSE out of Canada.  As a front line of 
defence, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency implements Health 
Canada's policy of keeping animals diagnosed or suspected of 
being infected with TSE out of the human or animal food chain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian veterinarians and livestock producers have been alerted 
to the signs of BSE.  They must report suspected cases to a 
federal veterinarian.  Adult cattle exhibiting symptoms 
suggestive of BSE are destroyed and subjected to a laboratory 
examination for BSE.  Canada tests hundreds of cattle for BSE 
every year and has tested over 4,800 cattle in total since its 
BSE surveillance program was started.  This level of testing 
exceeds international recommendations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I want to emphasize that Canadians have a right to 
expect that the food that comes into this country meets the same 
high standards we apply to domestic products, so we have a policy 
of not importing ruminant meat and meat products from countries 
that have BSE. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have additional import controls in place for other 
animal products and byproducts from countries which have 
confirmed BSE in native animals.  In fact, since December 7 we 
have suspended the importation of rendered material from all 
species from any country that has BSE.  These countries include: 
the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Portugal, Denmark, Spain and 
Italy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, there are troubling signs that BSE may have spread 
beyond the countries where it first became a problem.  For that 
reason, Canada has implemented a fair and reasonable policy to 
require our trading partners to provide us with information that 
would permit us to assess BSE status.  In May 1998 we sent our 
trading partners notification of these policies.  We provided a 
questionnaire to be used in assessing BSE status in these 
countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our trading partners responded, except for one country, Brazil. 
Argentina, Uruguay, Australia, New Zealand and the United States 
all provided information that has allowed the Canadian Food 
Inspection Agency to conduct a proper assessment.  Brazil did 
not.  All these countries have been recognized as BSE free in 
accordance with the established process.  Brazil has not.  In 
addition, further information came to light that Brazil may have 
imported cattle from European Union countries that are not free 
of BSE. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the interest of the health and safety of Canadians, we cannot 
stand by and let food products come into the country that we 
cannot demonstrate are BSE free.  That is why earlier this month 
Canada suspended current imports of canned corned beef and liquid 
beef extract from Brazil.  We proceeded with the removal of these 
products from the marketplace.

determine the safety of its beef products, we cannot let these

</I></B></P><P align=left>Today the Canadian Food Inspection Agency announced that a team 
of scientists would conduct an onsite visit in Brazil as part of 
a continuing process to fully assess the Brazilian regulatory 
system for the risk of BSE.  The team will be joined by officials 
from the United States and Mexico that are also working with 
Canada to review the documentation provided by Brazil on its BSE 
situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Together we are assessing three specific risk factors:  Brazil's 
feeding and rendering practices, its import practices, and its 
surveillance and laboratory procedures.  We need further 
information on these factors before we can have confidence that 
the Brazilian regulatory system is keeping BSE out of that 
country.  Once the information is complete it will be reviewed 
and verified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Food Inspection Agency is doing everything possible 
to expedite this process and complete the assessment as quickly 
as it can.  If Brazil meets Canada's requirement and is assessed 
as free of BSE, the temporary suspension of imports will be 
lifted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians can be proud of the high standards set by its food 
health and safety system.  We have one of the best systems in the 
world, but that does not mean that we will allow ourselves to 
become complacent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will continue to be vigilant, to learn, to reassess, and to 
respond as science and experience evolve.  We impose rigorous 
standards on the food produced in this country. We impose the 
same standards on the food that comes into this country.  In 
today's debate on the state of agriculture in Canada, the 
strength of that food and safety system deserves the support of 
the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the very brief time remaining, allow me to address the 
current crisis in our grains and oilseeds industries.  A 
combination of factors has challenged our agricultural producers. 
Subsidies to our trade competitors, especially the U.S.; global 
grain stocks surpluses; and financial and political instability 
in Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe have decreased demand 
for our commodities and pushed prices to their lowest levels in 
20 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unpredictable weather last spring and summer plagued farmers in 
my constituency of Erie—Lincoln.  Many fields were too wet to 
plant, notwithstanding all the spring soil preparation that had 
been completed and the significant costs incurred.  Indeed the 
cost of diesel and nitrogen fertilizers increased over 20% during 
the year 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those who got their seeds in the ground the situation only 
deteriorated.  When the cool damp weather persisted crop growth 
was stunted or non-existent.  At the end of June in place of 
crops that should have been lush and green, there were vast 
expanses of dried mud hard as concrete peaking above ponds of 
water.  The 2000 crop year in my area was quite literally a 
washout with no yield or a pitifully poor yield. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result some farmers in my area are experiencing a 
disastrous cash crisis.  I recall one young farmer coming to the 
microphone at an OFA meeting and advising that he had saved 
$10,000 a year for the previous 10 years to accumulate enough 
capital to buy a farm and embark upon a career he dearly loved. 
In one growing season his equity was drowned out.  It was enough 
to make a grown man cry.  In fact, that is exactly what he did 
before all those assembled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This evening we have heard the many forms of safety net policies 
already in place.  Last summer the federal and provincial 
ministers of agriculture reached an agreement on a new three year 
framework for safety nets.  The Canadian farm income program will 
provide up to $5.5 billion in support to farmers over the length 
of the agreement, $3.3 billion from the federal government and 
$2.2 billion from the provincial government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farm groups have long been calling for a disaster component as 
part of the safety net programming.  The Liberal government has 
responded to this request with new funding of over $1.2 billion 
for disaster relief over the life of the agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the first time producers have a safety net framework that 
includes such programs as NISA, crop insurance and its companion 
programs, as well as disaster relief programming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The spring credit advance program also deserves mention.  Under 
the 2000 spring credit advance program, $356 million in advances 
were issued to 31,000 producers.  An evaluation of the 2000 
spring credit advance program indicates that the program was well 
received by producers as it provided low cost access to credit. 
The spring credit advance program will be available for the 2001 
crop year as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the current year, advance payments program producer 
organizations have given over $925 million in advances to 
producers to provide cash flow until they sell their 2000 crops. 
Producers may continue to apply for these advances until May 31 
of this year.

extinction.  The sovereignty of our food supply is too important.

rise to speak to the emergency debate on agriculture.  That pride 
comes from being a farm partner.  I was born and raised on a

</I></B></P><P align=left>I could stand here and talk for hours about agricultural 
subsidies, the failure of the AIDA program, the transportation 
costs and the Canadian Wheat Board's monopoly.  I could talk 
about the decimation of our rural communities, the loss of young 
families to urban centres and the fact that our small town can 
hardly keep its school open let alone field a minor hockey team, 
but I felt this was an opportunity to let the farmers speak with 
their own words. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year, prior to entering the political arena and during the 
ongoing farm crisis, I took some personal action. I was very 
discouraged with the words and actions of the agriculture 
minister and the federal government toward struggling farm 
families.  I thought that if I put a face on the problem perhaps 
the importance of the issue would be noticed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appealed through the media to farm women and children in 
Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Alberta to write letters about the 
circumstances that they were facing on the farm and to send them 
to me.  I vowed to somehow try to get the minister of 
agriculture's attention with those letters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Well the minister of agriculture is not here tonight but we 
shall have it in <I>Hansard</I>.  I am going to speak their words. 
I received letters from farm women, farm men and children.  They 
are amazing letters with words that speak of hard work, 
sacrifice, heartbreak and of feeling forgotten by the nation and 
their government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the letters were agonizing to read but most of the 
agonizing letters did not come from farm women and children, they 
came from men. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This evening I want to read short excerpts from just a few of 
the letters.  I urge all members of the House to sit back in 
their chairs, close their eyes and listen.  I wish there were 
more members here to hear them.  I want members to really listen 
to the words they are about to hear. These are not words of a 
politician.  These are the words of farmers, farm wives and the 
children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Letter No. 1 reads:

</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a farm wife raising four sons age 4 to 15.  I work 
full-time.  Due to low grain prices and excessive moisture, my 
husband was forced to work full-time in town.  So that left our 4 
sons on the farm for long hours.  I did not realize how stressed 
my eldest son was until he expressed concerns, weeping to me one 
evening.  He felt he had to (be the) head of the farm while his 
dad was away.  He's 15.  He should be a kid while he can.

12-quarter farm.  They never splurged on anything and definitely 
don't have any luxuries.  They never took my sister and I on a 
holiday because they couldn't afford it.  I always thought my 
sister and I were deprived because we didn't have lots of clothes 
and we didn't have our own brand new vehicles when we turned 16. 
I have to sit back and watch everything that my dad achieved in 
his 37 years of farming go down the drain.  Their retirement is 
going down the drain because everything always went back into the 
farm so they could keep up and make the payments. Years of hard 
work and tears are down the drain.  Even if my mom and dad 
survive another year on the farm, it won't be the same.  The hurt 
of knowing this cannot even be said.  It won't be passed down to 
any more family ever again.  And that's not because I don't want 
to continue in my father's footsteps, it's because we can't make 
a living.  The government is slapping farmers in the face.  Could 
I charge the government with abuse? They would slap me in the 
face and laugh at how pitiful I am, and continue on with turning 
Canada into their goal of becoming the next Third World country.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is difficult to explain the toll and the effect that the farm 
crisis has had on my husband, myself, and my family.  Who would 
have ever guessed that the year 1998 would be so disruptive for 
our family.  As usual, the crop was put in this spring, despite 
the fact there was basically no moisture.  My husband had to have 
his gall bladder removed and so he had scheduled his surgery 
sandwiched between seeding and springtime.  My husband has never 
been hospitalized before in his life.  The stress mounted daily 
as he awaited his surgery and as he awaited the growth of the 
crop. Now, only a wife knows and understands the pride that men 
have that does not allow them to speak of their innermost 
concerns and fears.  This is what the government does not see. 
It does not see farmers losing their pride and self-respect.  It 
does not see the wives who try to improve their husband's frame 
of mind only to have their husband turn against them.  And the 
government does not want to see the despair in the eyes of the 
farmer. 
The beginning of 1999 of course brought no relief—take 
extensions on the loans, buy a little at a time, hope for AIDA. 
I don't think so; hope is long-gone, not even a subject to be 
brought up on the farm these days.  This is the real farm 
crisis—the loss of hope, continued discouragement and deep 
depression and a disregard for government figures who are 
clueless as to the plight of farmers.

financially.  We have applied for AIDA but we have heard nothing. 
We cashed in on all the RRSPs that we had to make last year's

the government to see our family as worthwhile contributors to

characterized by people determined to succeed.  One thing that 
has not changed is the farmers' sense of pride and many farmers 
still prefer to put on a stiff upper lip regardless of how bad

to help support the farm and because I liked working with 
farmers.

saw the farm wife and the children in tears because they knew 
they were about to lose their farm.  On many occasions I saw the 
husband in those situations with a blank look in his eyes because 
he knew he was about to lose the farm that had been in his family 
for three or more generations.  I lived through this and I hoped 
and I prayed that I would never live to see it happen again.

have been ignored.  My colleagues have done also brought forward 
suggestions.

examples.  It was mentioned earlier this evening that P.E.I.'s 
potato production has been completely shut down.  We have a 
provincial program in P.E.I. to buy potatoes and compost them. We 
do not have any kind of program from the federal government. We 
have a promise but no cold hard cash is on the table. The only 
things on the table on a farm in P.E.I., if they are lucky, are a 
teapot and couple of elbows.  They are sitting there 
contemplating their future and wondering whether it will be in 
the potato industry or in any other industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have an ongoing issue.  It is not complicated.  We cannot 
expect our farmers to produce against the rest of the farmers on 
the planet, and specifically against farmers in the United States 
and in the EU, if we do not subsidize our farmers to the same 
degree that the Americans and the Europeans do, and we do not. 
We are a buck and change behind the Americans, and we are two 
dollars and change behind the Europeans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not rocket science.  We have to be on a level playing 
field and maybe then we could convince the Americans and the 
Europeans to drop their subsidies back.  However we cannot do 
that when we are behind them in the starting blocks.  We can only 
do it when we are at par.  We do, without question, have a crisis 
in agriculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to point out some numbers.  Numbers make our eyes 
glaze over after a while and we start to say that maybe it is not 
a number issue, but it is always a number issue and it is always 
an issue of dollars before it is all done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we enter the 21st century and Canada faces new challenges and 
trends, some of which I talked about earlier, such as 
globalization and liberalization of trade forces, Canada will be 
forced to become more and more competitive.  Farm incomes are 
already unstable.  Infrastructure is crumbling.  Access to 
capital is restricted.  Foreign governments continue to subsidize 
their agriculture industries at high levels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I used some rough figures a minute ago but I have an example 
here of real numbers.  In 1997, for every dollar Canadians spent 
on farm support, the Americans spent $2.06, the European Union 
spent $2.14 and Japan spent $3.47. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to Brian Doidge of the Ridgetown College of 
Agricultural Technology, Canada spends 78% of its GDP on 
agriculture support, while the Americans spend 1.7% of its GDP. 
The figures are based on the OECD aggregate measures of support. 
The figures say very clearly that we are behind and we are not 
doing anything to catch up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From 1998 to September 2000, emergency income support program 
payments directly to growers amounted to $48.2 billion in the 
United States and $3.1 billion in Canada.  The debate is over. 
With that type of a ratio it is impossible to catch up unless the 
government is determined to catch up and unless the government 
says that it is going to reach parody and that when it reaches 
parody it will talk about being equal and about everyone dropping 
their subsidies back.  In the meantime, if we do not do that we 
will not have any farmers left. 
The grains and oilseeds may be the hardest hit today, but that 
will spread to the other commodity groups.  It is only a matter 
of time.

</I></B></P><P align=left>A Statistics Canada report in August 2000 noted that a look at 
the month by month statistics since January 1997 shows that total 
employment in agriculture has plummeted from the fall of 1998. 
Agriculture employment on the prairies used to hover around the 
200,000 mark.  An August survey puts that number at 160,000, that 
is, 40,000 fewer people were working in agriculture on the 
prairies.  That computes, then, to 22,100 farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not mind entering this debate, but I am beginning to 
question why we are here, why we stand on our feet, why we 
continue to ask the government to deal with a crisis situation, 
to deal with a major problem in this country, while government 
members continue to sit over there and do nothing and literally 
sit on their hands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a huge neighbour to the south that is a very powerful 
trading partner.  It has shown us at every turn of the wheel that 
it will use a phytosanitary certificate for a non-tariff trade 
barrier.  It continues to do that.  It has done it in the 
Christmas tree industry, my background.  It has done it with 
P.E.I. potatoes time and again.  It has done it in other 
commodities.  It has done it in lumber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We, as the Parliament of Canada, have to better represent 
Canadians.  We can encourage the government but we cannot force 
this majority to do something it does not want to do.  I think 
the member for Peace River said it best.  The members over there 
have to decide.  The backbench members of the government have to 
force and lobby their own government and their own Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food to respond to this crisis.  If it is 
not done, we will see a day in this country where not only will 
we no longer have the family farm, we will be importing food. 
That is not a day I look forward to. 
<P><A NAME="LINK253"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Loyola Hearn (St. John's West, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
perhaps people will wonder why somebody from Newfoundland, mainly 
known as a fishing area, would want to enter into a debate on 
agriculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two reasons.  One is the similarity between what is 
happening now in the agricultural industry and what happened in 
Newfoundland a few years ago when we had a total collapse of the 
fishery.  Earlier tonight one of the members mentioned that 
comparison.  We once saw a resource where people made a 
reasonable living, giving and taking over the years.  Then, 
perhaps because of mismanagement, perhaps because of overfishing, 
perhaps because of climate conditions or migration patterns, or 
perhaps more realistically because of a combination of all of 
them, we had a total collapse of the ground fishery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government at the time, being a good Tory government, 
stepped in immediately and helped out in that crisis.  Now we see 
a similar crisis in the west.  In comparison, besides the crisis 
and besides the need for help, there is the effect afterwards. 
Once the present government moved in and realized the magnitude 
of the problems, it seemed it was easier to turn control over to 
the larger corporations, which is what we see happening now in 
the fishery.  The smaller, independent fisherperson is being 
frozen out of the industry.  More and more control is being taken 
by the bigger players. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we fail to see sometimes when we look at rural Canada, 
whether it be a farming area or a fishing area, is that it is the 
work, the product and the income generated in the rural areas 
that make our urban areas a success.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why have our major towns and cities grown so fast?  Is it 
because of the office work, because of the stores that are built 
there?  Yes, but these offices and stores only exist because they 
serve the needs of many of the people in the rural areas who come 
into the larger areas for all their needs and services. 
Consequently, one is dependent on the other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also forget quite often to look at the spinoff from the 
primary industries, from the fishery or the farming industry, not 
realizing that when a farm goes out of business and the farm 
family is affected and has to go into bankruptcy or move away, a 
number of other people are also affected by that move. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Listening to the members on the government side speak tonight 
reminds me of Nero, who fiddled as Rome burned.  Each one stood 
up, many with prepared texts, and talked about all the good 
things government is doing to assist the agricultural industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter:</B>  You obviously weren't listening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Loyola Hearn:</B>  I hear my friend from Prince Edward 
Island say that I was not listening.  I was listening very 
carefully, and I know that the farmers in Prince Edward Island 
are listening tonight too and still wondering when the federal 
government will step in and help them, as their own provincial 
government has done in the present crisis they are facing.  They 
are asking if their help will come before Easter or after Easter. 
Hopefully it will come very soon.  Whether it will be the Easter 
bunny or not who delivers the help to them, I am sure they 
certainly will need it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The farmers in western Canada are listening tonight and 
wondering where the solutions are.  We hear the problems being 
raised and enunciated on both sides, but we hear the excuses 
being given about all the government is doing, which is a sign 
that it intends to do very little to help them in their present 
crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two things we have to look at.  One is a long term 
plan for farming.  In my own province of Newfoundland, the 
farming industry is also basically neglected by governments, both 
federal and provincial, yet dairy farming is an extremely 
important, lucrative industry.  We do have plenty of land for 
vegetable farming.  We do have people growing specialty crops and 
doing very well, but very little attention is being paid to the 
agricultural industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If somebody comes in and wants to create a few new jobs with a 
call centre or some other weird and wonderful idea, governments 
flock in with all kinds of handouts.  The fly-by-nights come in, 
grab the money, last a few months and then are gone.  Yet our own 
solid industries, our own solid working people who can create all 
kinds of new jobs in industries like the agricultural industry, 
get absolutely no encouragement and no help.  These things have 
to change.  That is where the long term plan comes in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the immediate plan that is needed right now is 
immediate action to help farmers who need help today, not 
tomorrow, not next month or not the month after.  They are 
preparing now for spring planting and if these farmers do not 
receive help, if they do not receive a cash injection 
immediately, this coming year is shot.  If this year is shot for 
them, the same thing will happen to farmers in Saskatchewan, 
Alberta, Manitoba and Ontario that happened to fisherfolk in 
rural Newfoundland.  They will pack up and leave the rural areas 
to find work somewhere else.  The primary resource, the food 
producing areas in the country, will die, and we know what 
happens when food is not produced.  More than the areas die. 
People die also. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude with words from a song by a great Canadian 
singer and songwriter, Murray McLauchlan.  It is called <I>The 
Farmer's Song</I>.  He talks about “these days when everybody's 
taking so much, somebody's putting back in”.  The farmer is the 
one putting back in and perhaps it is time we here in this great 
establishment recognize that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parkdale—High Park, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate having the opportunity this evening to 
speak to the financial situation facing some of our agricultural 
producers and our government's response to the hardship that 
these growers are experiencing.  I will be sharing my time with 
the member of parliament for Essex. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, you may ask why a member from a very urban riding 
in Toronto would want to stand up and speak on this issue this 
evening.  Perhaps even more you might ask what an urban member 
could possibly know about the situation facing our farmers in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would say to the members opposite that in fact my colleagues 
on the government side have done their job very well, but let me 
start with the why.  I can only use as an example for the why 
something from a conversation that I had with the member of 
parliament for Essex, who so eloquently said that when we speak 
about the quality of life we are also speaking about the quality 
of the food we eat.  That is what is integral to the quality of 
life.  It begins with the food we eat.  All of us need to realize 
that it is not just a rural issue but a national issue, and today 
I am proud to rise and say it is an issue that is important to 
the constituents of Parkdale—High Park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I sat through the debate in which my colleague from the riding 
of Haldimand—Norfolk—Brant actually provided a very interesting 
statistic.  He said that one in six jobs in Toronto is in the 
food industry.  When I speak of the member for 
Haldimand—Norfolk—Brant, let me tell the House that I had an 
opportunity this summer to visit his riding and speak to his 
constituents about their concerns.  I would say to those people 
if they are listening that they have a wonderful advocate for 
farming issues, and these are not just farming issues but 
national issues.  He spoke to other colleagues who had come to 
the riding and we met with these people, listened to them and 
talked to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me use as another example my colleague who is the member for 
Barrie—Simcoe—Bradford.  Her riding is perhaps 80% urban and 
20% rural, but again she has talked to us and stressed what has 
happened to the farmers in her riding with the adverse weather 
conditions that Ontario farmers have experienced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about it and people say that it is just a rural 
issue and the urban MPs do not care, that is not true.  Actually 
it was last spring that the member of parliament for 
Toronto—Danforth organized a farm aid concert in downtown 
Toronto to bring this issue to everyone's attention.  He did it 
to help the farmers and to help our urban colleagues understand 
just what an important national issue this is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the members opposite this evening also spoke about the 
member of parliament for Malpeque and said that he hoped the 
farmers from Prince Edward Island were listening.  I hope so too, 
because I would tell them that they have a passionate advocate 
who understands their issues and brings them to caucus on a 
regular basis.  I also had an opportunity to meet with his 
constituents this summer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even more so, when I was on the foreign affairs and 
international trade committee and had the opportunity of chairing 
the international trade committee in the last session, I 
travelled with the committee across the country.  We listened to 
farmers.  We listened to the Canadian Federation of Agriculture. 
We listened to the National Farmers Union.  It was at that time 
that I learned that our member for Malpeque was once the 
president of that National Farmers Union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is funny how a city girl can actually not only learn a lot 
about what is going on with our farms and our farmers but also 
realize, as the member for Essex said, that it is about the 
quality of life that affects all of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has been the approach of our government to help these 
growers who are experiencing these financial difficulties?  At 
the beginning of the debate this evening, the Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food outlined the government's approach, 
which has been to stabilize incomes while working on several 
fronts to encourage long term growth in the industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, we are investing in programs and services that are having 
a direct impact on the sector's ability to adapt and diversify in 
today's competitive global economy. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2330"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT149"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are investing in innovation, in protecting our environment 
and in the safety of our food supply.  We are investing in 
promoting trade which is so vital to the agriculture and food 
industry and to the Canadian economy in general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot stress enough how all parties across Canada should 
listen to what farmers and the agricultural federation have to 
say about what our position should be at the World Trade 
Organization and also as we negotiate the free trade of the 
Americas agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From what I have learned over the last few years, I can only 
conclude that Canadian agriculture is successful and that current 
programs work well to stabilize farm income fluctuations for the 
vast majority of commercial operations.  At the same time we 
recognize that some Canadian farmers are facing serious financial 
constraints.  Low commodity prices, international subsidies and 
adverse weather have had serious impact upon some of our 
producers, particularly those in the grains and oilseed sectors 
who have experienced significant income decline. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have all listened to the concerns of the farm community and 
understand the difficulties that some producers are facing due to 
circumstances well beyond their control.  The government has 
worked with farm organizations and other levels of government to 
address the situation with financial programs designed to target 
its assistance to those who need it the most. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my hon. colleagues are aware, after many months of extensive 
discussions with the provinces and territories, the Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food reached a national framework agreement 
on safety nets for farmers.  The agreement, signed by all 
provincial and territorial ministers last July, provides for a 
total investment by the federal and provincial governments of up 
to $5.5 billion for farm income programs for the year 2000, 2001 
and 2002. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agreement was a significant step forward.  For the first 
time ever, all agriculture ministers across the country agreed on 
a common integrated approach to our farming safety net programs. 
One of the most important aspects of the agreement is that it 
includes an ongoing income disaster program, a feature which the 
producers had actually called for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Funding under the national agreement is based on the standard 
60:40 federal-provincial cost sharing ratio.  Over the three 
years of the program, the federal government will provide up to 
$3.3 billion to fund the most comprehensive safety net packages 
to date. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should point out to my hon. colleagues that annual funding for 
safety nets now committed by the federal government is almost 
double what it was before the agreement was reached.  The 
commitment of funds allows us to help farmers manage the risk 
they face from natural events and market fluctuations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Specifically the government contributes a major portion of the 
funding for crop insurance and for the net income stabilization 
account which is a program designed to provide income 
stabilization to individual producers for long term.  Farmers 
have the opportunity to deposit money each year into their net 
income stabilization accounts and receive matching government 
contributions.  Farmers can then withdraw money when needed in 
lower income years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada has also put in place the spring credit 
advance program that provides interest free loans for producers 
to help with the cost of spring planting.  The program has been 
very well received by the farm community.  An amount of $356 
million in interest free money was delivered in the first year of 
the program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also the advance payments program.  Under the program 
producers can obtain loans of up to $250,000 for the storage of 
eligible commodities, with the federal government paying the 
interest on the first $50,000.  This allows producers to market 
their crops when prices may be more favourable while still 
meeting their short term financial obligations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned, the three year framework agreement with the 
provinces includes disaster assistance that is targeted to those 
who need it most.  Under the Canadian farm income program, $2.2 
billion in federal-provincial money has been allocated for 
disaster programming for the 2000, 2001 and 2002 fiscal years. 
Applications for the 2000 tax year will be available very soon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are continuously improving our existing programs and looking 
at ways to help farmers manage risk.  For example, changes were 
made to the NISA program last year to increase producers' access 
to their NISA funds.  For 1999, thousands of those participants 
have made withdrawals of more than $400 million dollars. 
This program is doing what it was designed to do; stabilizing 
producers incomes when needed.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I believe that we are going in the right 
direction.  The government with the help of all of my colleagues 
will continue to work for farmers across Canada to ensure that 
Canada's agricultural sector continues to be both competitive and 
strong. 
<P><A NAME="LINK255"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Susan Whelan (Essex, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to start tonight by reminding everyone about Canadian agriculture 
and Canadian farmers, a bit of a history lesson perhaps. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, our farmers farm in Canada under some of the most severe 
geographic and weather conditions in the world.  Over 55% of our 
food production is produced farther north than any other country 
in the northern hemisphere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How did this come about in this land called Canada?  I ask the 
House to think back to the time when the king of France, occupied 
by the European war, when asked about the settlers in New France 
and what would happen to them, said “Who cares.  Let them 
survive the best way they know.  Who wants that land of ice and 
snow anyhow?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They did survive and became the most productive part of our 
society.  If all other parts of our society were as productive as 
our farmers we never would have known inflation as we did.  There 
was no other part of our society that became as productive per 
person as those engaged in agriculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At one time in the early development of our country, Canada, one 
farm family produced enough for itself and one other family.  Now 
today one farm family produces enough for itself and 160 other 
families.  How do they accomplish this great feat?  From the very 
beginning the governments of the day established display farms, 
research stations and experimental farms to help the new settlers 
from all over the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through Agriculture Canada our scientists and our farmers worked 
together.  They developed new short season hardier crops, disease 
resistant cereal grains, a new variety of soyabean, canola, 
lentils and the very best genetic breeding programs in the world 
for our livestock and poultry industries.  They learned how to 
produce fruit and vegetables in short seasons.  They developed 
the best storage systems in the world; controlled atmospheres for 
apples, oranges, cabbage and carrots.  You name it, Mr. Speaker, 
we stored it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We developed programs in Canada to help our farmers build this 
kind of storage.  For example, the government paid up to 
one-third of the cost if three farmers joined together to build a 
storage facility.  British Columbia in time was able to ship the 
highest quality of apples to over 30 countries in the Pacific Rim 
area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada took advantage of the international laws to create the 
Canadian Wheat Board, the Canadian Dairy Commission, the Canadian 
Egg Marketing Agency, the Canadian Chicken Marketing Agency, the 
Canadian Turkey Marketing Agency, all of these fair marketing 
agency systems that allowed good farmers a decent profit for what 
they produced, as well as providing consumers with a very fair 
priced product. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would it not be just great if the energy producers of oil and 
gas could offer the consumers of their products the same fair 
priced products today? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we make a comparison to other parts of the world we must 
remember the differences.  For example, in the United States of 
America the constitution is different.  The federal government 
in the United States has total authority, 100%.  It  does not 
have to deal with 51 ministers of agriculture.  The states' 
secretaries of agriculture are nothing more than agriculture extension 
services.  Imagine the United States of America's secretary of 
agriculture having to do the same as the Canadian minister of 
agriculture?  Under our constitution it is a shared 
responsibility, much different and more difficult to administer 
among rich and poor sectors.  For instance, Alberta is oil rich 
and Manitoba and New Brunswick have very limited resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is nearly impossible to run a fair national program with the 
status quo.  However, I must say that our farmers are victims of 
their own success, doing what the economists told them to do: 
“Produce, produce, produce.  That's your answer to economic 
prosperity”. For agriculture in an over produced global world 
it can be economic death. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to read from the Palm Beach <I>Post</I> from Sunday, 
December 24, 2000. 
It reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For somebody who works the hard northern land that was first cut 
by homesteaders' plows less than a century ago, the big harvest 
of government checks usually happens in the fall $40,000 for just 
being a farmer, another $40,000 for emergencies like bad market 
conditions, more than $100,000 for not making any money on what 
is grown, and $50,000 for taking other land out of production. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Good crops or bad, high yields or low, it hardly matters, the 
checks roll in from the federal government, the biggest payroll 
in farm country.  By the end of the year, some farmers can 
receive up to $280,000 simply by having another miserable year of 
failure.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In eight states, including Montana, government assistance made 
up 100% of all farm income.  This is what is happening in the 
United States today.  This is what is causing the price of grains 
and oilseed to be depressed so that Canadian farmers who are the 
most productive, efficient farmers in the world cannot compete 
fairly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has put programs in place.  However, the 
government also needs to take a look at how we fix those programs 
to address the grain and oilseed crisis.  All the parties have 
to come to the table, the federal, the provincial government and 
all the farm commodity groups.  We must find a way to help 
Canadian producers compete.  We do not want to be, as the article 
goes on to say “a ward of the federal government, a slow fading 
county, a society that is similar to welfare”.  We do not want 
our agriculture sector to resemble that.  We have to work to 
ensure that trade laws are changed so that rules are enforced so 
we can play on a fair playing field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the meantime, we need to do something now for our Canadian 
farmers.  Our farmers and our rural communities that are at risk 
in the grain and oilseed sector need immediate assistance.  The 
government is looking for a solution and working toward a 
solution, but again we need all the parties to come to the table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to find a way to help our Canadian producers compete. 
They are part of our society and contribute greatly to our 
quality of life.  We cannot forget the history lesson of how 
Canada was formed.  We cannot forget what they mean to the fabric 
of our society.  We cannot forget how important it is to ensure 
that Canadians have safe, efficient, good quality and low cost 
food for all Canadians, whether rich or poor, so that we can 
ensure that this country stays strong.  We do not want to be at 
the mercy of any other country for our food supply.  We must 
always remember the important history lesson of our Canadian 
farmers.  We must not forget, we shall not forget.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Kevin Sorenson (Crowfoot, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is indeed a privilege to be in the House tonight to 
speak on behalf of farmers in the west and to speak on behalf a 
sector that is hurting, a sector that is diminishing and 
disappearing.  We are here tonight because we believe that we can 
make changes.  We have not totally given up hope.  We believe 
that there is still a place for the family farm in western Canada 
and throughout Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I realize, Mr. Speaker, that you are a sporting enthusiast.  We 
may be all having a little difficulty this evening staying awake. 
It is 12.45 p.m. here and 9.45 p.m. in Alberta. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a new member of parliament, I have already given my response 
to the throne speech.  Tomorrow I will give a speech with regard 
to the young offenders legislation.  I was not aware that I was 
going to give a speech on agriculture tonight, but I was told 
that if I waited until midnight I might find a opening.  I am 
glad I did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This little illustration I am about to tell the House is about a 
football game in 1929.  California was leading Georgia Tech by a 
score of seven to two.  The quarterback went up to the line and 
shouted for the ball.  When the centre passed the ball to the 
quarterback he turned and handed the ball to a running back by 
the name of Roy Regals.  Roy Regals took the ball, ran into the 
line and bumped up against his tackles and his guards and got 
turned around.  He started running one way.  Then he started 
running another way.  Pretty soon he found himself running in the 
wrong direction.  As he ran the wrong way the crowd hollered 
“no, no, no” but Roy thought they were hollering “go, go, 
go”.  He continued to run in the wrong direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>California had a player by the name of Benny Lam.  Benny Lam 
took after the running back and he tried to run him down.  He 
caught him at the five yard line.  He explained to his running 
back that he was running in the wrong direction. 
Georgia Tech tried to kick the ball from its end zone and get out 
of trouble.  When they kicked it, it was blocked.  The opposing 
team fell on it and won the football game.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe we have a government very similar to the player who 
was running in the wrong direction, putting out all the effort to 
get a job done and working hard to see that agriculture and many 
other sectors that are in dire straits get help.  However the 
government is running in the wrong direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have stood for years and decades in the House to tell the 
government that there were troubles coming in the agricultural 
sector which needed to be addressed.  They put it on hold. 
Everything was continually put on hold. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This past fall we travelled throughout the constituency of 
Crowfoot, a constituency that is dependent on agriculture and 
whose lifeblood is agriculture.  We saw communities that are 
dependent on farming, grain and cattle.  We were told that they 
would not make it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have travelled through many small towns in this past election 
campaign and found many more doors locked on main street than 
opened.  When we talk to businessmen, whether in Drumheller, 
Stetler, Hannah, Camrose or Killum, they say that if we want to 
help their businesses we should help the farmers.  If we want to 
keep the businesses alive, it will not come in any other way than by 
helping the agricultural sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have looked at ways of helping agriculture.  Government 
members looked at ways of helping agriculture.  They were heading 
in the wrong direction.  They came up with the AIDA program. They 
promised billions of dollars to farmers.  They promised that 
there would be money coming and then gave us a paperwork 
nightmare.  The other ones having nightmares are the accountants 
because they are the only ones who can fill out the forms.  More 
farmers end up paying a higher accounting bill than they get in 
return from the government.  We need to change the direction in 
which we are headed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have talked about the concerns of transportation. I am a 
farmer.  I have farmed for 25 years.  Farming is the only 
business which pays the end price for every purchase made. 
Farmers pay a retail price on everything they buy.  Everything 
they sell is sold at a wholesale price.  They also pay the 
freight both ways when they sell it.  Before they sell any grain 
they pay for the freight when it leaves the farm gate.  When they 
buy sprays and cover their input costs, they pay the final cost, 
which includes all those things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have talked about tax reform.  Many of our members won the 
election on our stand on tax reform.  One of our directors, a 
gentleman from Czar, Alberta, went to the United States and 
toured a John Deere factory.  He spoke one evening with the 
president of John Deere.  He told the president the problem with 
a lot of the equipment and machinery manufacturers was that they 
did not make equipment for the smaller farmer, the farmer who is 
looking for a $40,000 tractor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was told that when the iron comes out of the smelter and 
rolls out it is taxed.  It goes to the next level and is taxed 
again.  If all levels of accumulative taxes were removed from a 
$100,000 tractor, we would end up with a $40,000 tractor.  The 
level of taxation on all input costs is too high. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The family farm is disappearing.  I want to mention a true story 
about what happened during the election.  I knocked on the door 
of farmhouse, walked in and went to the kitchen table.  The 
farmer sat down with me and told me that he would not make it. 
He was 72 years old and he had no hope.  In past years he had a 
glimmer of hope.  He thought there would be hope, but he saw no 
hope coming from the government or anyone.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As he sat there he told me that he spent two hours on the Sunday 
previous looking for a .22 shell.  He said that there was no hope 
for him.  When I left that farmhouse, he was sitting, weeping at 
the table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only time I have ever stolen anything in my life is when I 
left the farmhouse that day.  I went to his gun rack on the 
porch, took the rifle and put it in my pickup.  It is a true 
story.  It simply illustrates the degree of hopelessness people 
are feeling out there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have received phone calls and letters from people in my 
riding.  I have had individuals sitting in my office, breaking 
down and weeping.  A 58 year old farmer from Edgerton told me 
that on the night previous his 26 year old son who has one young 
child had come in to his home and had told him “Dad, I am 
leaving.  Why would I stay?”  This individual had most of his 
land finally paid for.  He was looking forward to his son taking 
over the farm.  We are losing a generation from the farm and they 
will not come back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do we want farms to look like in 10 years?  What do we want 
western Canada to look like in 10 years?  My communities are 
dependent on the family farm.  We are begging the government to 
listen.  The Prime Minister stood in the House the other day and 
said that he would go to the United States and encourage 
President Bush to drop the subsidy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need help and we need it now in the agricultural sector in 
western Canada.  We need help from a government that will say 
that we will not simply ask Mr. Bush but will lobby governments 
in Europe, in the United States and throughout the world, our 
competitors.  We want our farmers on a level playing field with 
farmers around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are too many stories out there about people who have lost 
hope.  Twenty-two thousand farmers over the last year have packed 
their bags and said that they were going somewhere to find a job. 
They were going to learn about computers so that they could work 
in the city somewhere, which our government is encouraging them 
to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The family farm is disappearing.  What will it look like in 10 
years?  I have no idea.  I do realize that just as in the 1930s 
in Alberta and throughout western Canada populist movements came 
along and people found hope.  People are looking to the 
government today for hope.  They are looking to each side for 
hope.  Let us hope and pray that we come up with some long term 
solutions soon and a quick influx of cash before spring work.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney—Alouette, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I consider it a privilege to be able to end the 
debate this evening.  I thank you, Mr. Speaker, for entertaining 
the application for the emergency debate.  I think that we have 
made points on all sides of the House tonight on why it is a very 
important topic.  I will reflect for a moment on the speech my 
colleague from Crowfoot just gave.  What he has done is he has 
given us a human context for this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can come to this place and debate numbers, failed programs 
and subsidies that are in place in certain jurisdictions and not 
in others, and then leave at the end of the night.  We will have 
done our part somewhat in raising these issues, but the fact of 
the matter is that when we leave this place tonight people across 
the country will still be in dire straits because of the farm 
income crisis my colleague and others have mentioned.  We need to 
do something immediately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government provided relief with the AIDA program, but we 
know that has not completely solved the problem, partly because 
of the administrative quagmire that has ensued where the money 
has not gone to the people who have needed it.  We have heard 
from individuals, from our own members today who represent the 
constituents across the country, that it needs to be fixed and 
needs to be fixed now.  We need to get those dollars to the 
people who need them so that they can put their crops in this 
year.

</I></B></P><P align=left>My riding is one that is an urban-rural riding.  I consider 
myself a city boy.  I spent most of my life in the city, but had 
the opportunity to spend many of my summers as a young man on my 
uncle's farm in Killarney, Manitoba, and to see firsthand what it 
was like to live on a farm and what hard work went into the 
production of foodstuffs in our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a network of people across this country that puts food 
on the table for all Canadians.  We need to keep that in mind, no 
matter what region we may come from or what demographic we might 
associate ourselves with.  We need to put the help out there 
right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to correct a couple of comments that I heard from 
my colleague across the way who has been here and listening to 
the debate.  The member for Malpeque mentioned that the Alliance 
does not support supply management.  Nothing could be further 
from the truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have many dairy farmers in my own riding, in Agassiz.  We have 
a research station in Agassiz that does good work and we have 
producers who work very hard.  This is an issue that touches us 
from coast to coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard passionate speeches tonight as to why the 
government needs to move ahead in terms of foreign subsidies, 
which other nations are providing to their farmers.  Our 
government seems to have moved in a unilateral disarmament way in 
relation to subsidies.  We need immediate action on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have asked for implementation of measures that would help 
with input costs, such as reducing fuel taxes and many other 
measures.  As my colleague for Crowfoot so eloquently explained, 
our farmers are paying the retail price for production.  They 
are putting in the input costs themselves, such as the high cost of 
transportation, and getting wholesale prices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know there are solutions out there.  One of our colleagues 
from the government side said that we need to find a way to help 
our farmers compete.  There are ideas.  They are here before us. 
They have been laid out in debate this evening.  We are asking 
that the government take the ideas that are there and put them in 
place and do it now.  It is only when we take the actions 
necessary to back up our words that we show with our deeds we are 
serious about what we say in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Opposition members and government members, we need to move ahead 
co-operatively.  This is not a partisan issue, as we are all 
aware.  We perhaps have different ideas about how to get to the 
solution, but we know that there are people in need tonight in 
our country.  They are the producers, our farmers and their 
families, who may not be putting in a crop again, who face 
personal loss, and not only of their jobs.  It is more than a 
job.  It is a way of life for so many and I think all of us have 
been touched by those who have lived that life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is for that very reason that as we leave this place tonight 
we need to put action to our words.  I implore my colleagues on 
the government side to use whatever influence they may have with 
the ministers and with those who have the opportunity to move 
ahead on regulatory changes, input taxes and the foreign 
subsidies that have been mentioned.  I implore them to move ahead 
on those things and do what they can.  People across the country 
are waiting for that and looking for leadership from this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tonight's debate has been a great opportunity.  I hope the 
importance of this issue is not lost on any of us.  It is my 
sincere hope and wish, as I think it is the wish of all members, 
that as we leave this place tonight we do not just 
compartmentalize this debate, put it on the shelf and say that we 
did our job.  It is my sincere hope and wish that we move forward 
on the initiatives that have been suggested and look for real 
solutions to help real people who are in dire straits tonight 
across our country.
