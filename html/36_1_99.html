profession which has not been recognized for its value to our 
society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners also concur with the national forum on health 
which stated that the Income Tax Act discriminates against 
families that choose to provide direct parental care in the home 
for their preschool children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners therefore pray and call on parliament to 
pursue initiatives to eliminate tax discrimination against those 
families that choose to provide care in the home for their 
preschool children.

residents of the city of Quesnel, British Columbia in the

impose a moratorium on ratification of the MAI until full public 
hearings on the proposed treaty are held across the country so 
that all Canadians can have an opportunity to express their 
opinion about it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
despite the fact that the MAI talks have been suspended, and we 
hope for good, petitions continue to roll in from across the 
country from thousands of Canadians who are concerned about the 
MAI and the fact that the government still has not given up the 
idea of a multilateral agreement on investment similar to that 
which it was seeking at the OECD. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore I have petitions from various provinces calling on 
parliament to reject the current framework of MAI negotiations 
and instructing the government to seek an entirely different 
agreement by which the world might achieve a rules based, global 
trading regime that protects workers, the environment and the 
ability of governments to act in the public interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opportunity is now for the government to do this.  Given 
that the talks have broken down, we hope the government will 
finally listen to the many thousands of petitioners who have been 
asking it to do this.

from 525 residents of the province of British Columbia who are 
concerned about the hepatitis C debate that is ongoing in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These petitioners draw the attention of the House to the 
following. Whereas the majority of Canadians are in favour of 
fair compensation for all victims of tainted blood; whereas 
research indicates that the validity of the surrogate testing was 
available in 1981 as opposed to the 1986 year stated by the hon. 
health minister; whereas the number of infected individuals 
appears to have been dramatically overstated by the Minister of 
Health; therefore the petitioners pray and request that 
parliament revisit the issue of hepatitis C compensation to 
reflect the concerns of the citizens of Canada, to offer a fair, 
compassionate and humane compensation package to all who received 
infected blood.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I also have 
a petition which sounds like it came from the same group of 
individuals.  Many of these petitioners are from British Columbia 
and they are also calling on the federal government to change its 
stand on hepatitis C. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These petitions are coming in vast numbers and will not stop. As 
the victims have said, they will not go away until the federal 
government changes its mind.  There have been some chinks in the 
armour and these petitions will carry on until that takes place.

morning.  The first petition is signed by residents of 
Burnaby—Douglas and other British Columbians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It points out that the Canadian Constitution Act, 1982 
guarantees freedom of conscience and religion and it urges 
parliament to establish peace tax legislation by passing a 
conscientious objection act which recognizes the right of 
conscientious objectors to ensure that their commitment to apply 
a portion of their taxes that was to be used for military 
purposes to instead go toward peaceful purposes such as peace 
education, war relief and humanitarian and environmental aid,

Speaker, the second petition is similar to that tabled by my 
colleague from Winnipeg—Transcona. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It calls on parliament to reject the current framework of MAI 
negotiations and instructs the government to seek an entirely

petition, Mr. Speaker, notes that there continue to exist over 
30,000 nuclear weapons on the earth and that the continuing 
existence of nuclear weapons poses a threat to the health and 
survival of human civilization in the global environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore the petitioners urge parliament to support the

</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners are unhappy with the MAI negotiations, in 
particular with Don Johnston, the head of OECD and who is pushing 
this agreement on Canadians.  The petitioners feel this is the

world might achieve a rules based, global trading regime that 
protects workers, the environment and the ability of governments

<P><A NAME="LINK33"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I ask the 
government when it will call Question No. 21 which we tabled on 
October 22, 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary tells us the government is 
continuing to make inquiries, but it has not yet given us an 
answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will look seriously into 
the whereabouts of the response to Question No. 21. 
<P><A NAME="LINK34"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta—South Richmond, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, on October 28, 1997 I asked Question No. 33.  There 
seems to be a reluctance to answer the question.  The question has 
to do with the Oak Bay Marine Group and the Sport Fishing 
Institute, two organizations very near and dear to the fisheries 
minister's heart.  I was told on April 29 that the response was 
with the House leader's office.  I was informed he had it on 
March 26 and on April 16 as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the parliamentary secretary could look in his desk 
to find that response this morning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I regret to say that I do 
not have the response in my desk, but again I will look into it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, you will have noted that in the last several days 
we have in fact replied to a considerable number of questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cummins:</B>  Mr. Speaker, on December 2, 1997 I 
asked Question No. 56, which at one point I was told was with the 
House leader's office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary pointed out at one point, quite 
inaccurately, that roughly 800 questions had been received to 
that point, which was a great exaggeration.  He said that he had 
answered half of them.  If he had I guess I would be finished. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On many occasions he has told me that I could expect an answer 
in a timely fashion.  The parliamentary secretary is beginning to 
remind me of Bill Clinton.  Clinton said that Monica Lewinski was 
going to— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  That is a point of order and I think 
the hon. member is straying far off the point.  I think the 
parliamentary secretary has got the point.  He has indicated 
already that he is working on answers to the hon. member's 
questions and I am sure he will continue to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. parliamentary secretary wish to address this 
question also? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams:</B>  Mr. Speaker, again I have noted Question

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP)</B> moved: 
<A NAME="LINK39">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House urge the government to press 
for the invitation of representatives of the Hepatitis C Society 
of Canada to the upcoming meeting of federal, provincial and 
territorial Health Ministers in order to provide advice on how to 
address the financial needs of all those who contracted 
Hepatitis C from the federally-regulated blood system. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, it is an unexpected and an unanticipated 
honour for me to be the lead speaker in this important debate, 
but an honour nonetheless.  I will be sharing my time with our 
leader, the member for Halifax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in this Chamber have been at this issue now for more than a 
month, 39 days to be precise, and all of us on this side of the 
House have been trying to ensure that social justice be provided 
to all hepatitis C victims on this sad and tragic issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A week ago today we voted on a motion that would have extended 
some measure of justice, dignity and compassion to all who 
contracted hepatitis C regardless of the date they became 
infected. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1020"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT4"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT4"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1020

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government refused and in the ensuing vote the government 
position was upheld narrowly.  The federal, provincial and 
territorial ministers of health stood shoulder to shoulder behind 
the agreement they had made in Toronto.  The agreement was that 
governments would compensate only some of those infected with 
hepatitis C through tainted blood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister insisted that last week's motion to extend 
compassion to those on the outside looking in on the agreement be 
treated as a motion of confidence in the government.  It worked 
to some extent.  The government won that confidence vote by 155 
to 140.  It won the confidence vote in the House of Commons, but 
in the process it lost the confidence of the nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal Minister of Health said that the file on 
compensation was closed, but this file would not stay closed 
because this deal would not and could not survive public 
scrutiny.  It would not stay closed because it is a deal that 
draws a line in the sand and says that if a person became 
infected with hepatitis C after January 1, 1986 they will receive 
compensation, but if they were infected before December 31, 1985, 
the governments are sorry but they are unable to extend benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have listened day after day to the Minister of Health as he 
has tried to justify this sordid deal.  When he talked about the 
class action suit Canadians contrasted those words with the 
classless inaction they were witnessing from this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most moving moment in my short tenure as a member of 
parliament occurred after the vote last week when victims of 
hepatitis C and their family members stood in the visitors' 
gallery to applaud opposition members for their support even 
though that support fell slightly short. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What governments have been trying to do for the past 39 days 
against tens of thousands of Canadians is not the Canadian way. 
When calamity or disaster strikes it is not the Canadian way to 
draw a line in the sand.  When the flood in Quebec's Saguenay 
region occurred two years ago relief went out to all, not only to 
some who were affected.  It was the same last year with the Red 
River flood in Manitoba.  When the ice storm struck eastern 
Ontario and Quebec this past January provisions were made in the 
emergency relief program to ensure that small farmers working off 
the farm were also protected.  That is the Canadian way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did our health minister think he could get away with 
something so thoroughly un-Canadian as this hepatitis C deal? I 
believe part of the answer lies in the current lack of resources 
extended to our provincial and territorial governments for the 
provision of health care by the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Five years after medicare was introduced at the national level, 
a gift from the Government of Saskatchewan introduced by Tommy 
Douglas and Woodrow Lloyd, the Pearson government made it 
attractive and saleable to the other provinces by providing 50:50 
funding, 50-cent dollars.  The federal government would match 
every 50 cents put up by the provincial and territorial 
governments.  Today those 50-cent dollars have been whittled down 
to less than 13 cents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe Saskatchewan is the only province that has backfilled 
every penny of health care money which the federal government has 
taken out in recent years.  It has not been easy for Saskatchewan 
to continue with the important health funding that is necessary 
in an era of transition.  Thanks to this government 
pharmaceutical costs have been going through the roof.  The 
Saskatchewan government and other governments have been managing 
as best they can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tommy Douglas is recognized as the father of medicare in Canada. 
As I said a minute ago, medicare was Saskatchewan's gift to 
Canada.  Tommy had a great way with people and with words, as 
those who had the privilege to know him will attest.  One of his 
phrases goes like this:  “When someone tells you that it's not 
the money, it's the principle, you can be almost certain it's the 
money”.  That is what we have been witnessing in the House over 
the past 39 days.  This has not been about principle, it has been 
about getting away with it as cheaply as possible and not doing 
the right thing, not doing the Canadian thing.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The original deal pleased no one because the victims were not 
present to make their case or to counter misinformation at the 
negotiating table.  No one knows the hepatitis C issue better 
than those who live with the disease.  They must be at the table 
for the next round, as this motion indicates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians expect us to act in the best interests of the victims 
of this blood tragedy.  Let the victims now have their say on how 
to address their financial needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not often have a second chance either in life or in this 
House.  In this Chamber we tend to deal with a topic and move 
on.  However, this is one time that Canadians, by their words and 
actions, have forced all governments to revisit an important 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should celebrate this opportunity to do the right thing, 
finally, for all the victims of hepatitis C.  Let us celebrate the 
fact that we have been given a second chance to make amends and 
offer compensation fully and fairly.  That is the Canadian way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been given a second chance to do the right thing.  This 
file is open once again.  Let us not blow it this time.  We call 
on all members of the House of every political stripe to support 
this motion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK40"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, today 
the New Democratic Party brings this motion before the House in a 
spirit of working with the health minister and his government and 
with their provincial and territorial counterparts to ensure the 
successful negotiation of a compensation package to meet the 
financial and health needs of all victims of hepatitis C. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A week ago today will be remembered as a low point in the 
history of this parliament, perhaps a low point in Canadian 
history.  It will be remembered as the day when 155 members on 
the government benches, for all the wrong reasons, stood together 
to oppose a public policy measure that Canadians knew in their 
hearts as well as in their heads was the fair and proper thing to 
do, namely, to compensate all victims of hepatitis C. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that victims of hepatitis C had no control over the 
conditions that resulted in their infection, but it is also clear 
that the Government of Canada had regulatory control and 
responsibility.  That responsibility remains to all victims of 
hepatitis C. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When last Tuesday's vote was over the federal health minister 
declared that the file was closed, that the matter was over and 
that there was nothing more to be said.  However it was 
absolutely clear to us, to the members of the New Democratic 
Party caucus, indeed to all members on the opposition benches, 
that this file could not be closed until justice was done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it was not already clear to members on the government 
benches, it certainly was clear after they visited their ridings 
over the weekend and heard from ordinary Canadians the sense of 
outrage they felt about the violation of the very promise, the 
very essence of Canada's health care system, namely, dividing the 
victims into the deserving and the non-deserving, dividing the 
victims into categories of have and have not, and shutting out of 
our health care system those who had no ability to control the 
conditions that resulted in their being infected with hepatitis 
C.  It is a health condition with which many will live for the 
rest of their lives and to which many will lose their lives in 
the months and years ahead. 
The fact of the matter is that it goes to the very essence of 
being a Canadian to ensure that people get the health care 
attention they need when they need it, and that means recognizing 
that we share a community and societal responsibility for that.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Today it is clear that the federal minister and the provincial 
and territorial ministers will meet again.  We want to plead 
today with the health minister and his colleagues to ensure that 
the victims of hepatitis C have representation at the table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are the ones that understand the devastating effects of 
hepatitis C.  They are the ones that understand what a toll it is 
taking not only on their lives but on their families.  They are 
the ones who need to be given voice and an opportunity to ensure 
this is not just another round of false hope but in fact becomes 
an opportunity to ensure that justice is done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some may dwell in the days ahead on why some members of the 
House did the wrong thing when the opportunity was presented to 
them a week ago.  Others may dwell on the question of what 
motives account for various governments changing their minds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me say I think that all 301 members of the House have a 
responsibility, as my colleague from Saskatchewan has already 
said, to work together to set aside the recriminations, to set 
aside the imputing of motives and to ensure that justice is done 
on the basis of decency and compassion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen the incredible courage of hepatitis C victims over 
the last weeks and months.  In case we need any reminder of what 
we are doing here, what our responsibility is and what unites us 
as members of the House, let me briefly quote from a letter 
received today from one of the spokespersons on behalf of the 
Hepatitis C Society.  Jo-Anne Manser wrote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I don't fear death—I know that I'll walk straight into the arms 
of God who loves me as His precious child.  So it matters not 
that my Prime Minister and health ministers think so little of us 
now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But, I do fear for my children who must grow up in this, so 
please stay strong and continue to fight for truth, justice and 
compassion in Canada—not only for victims of the tainted blood 
disaster, but for our kids. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You are in my heart and prayers always.  Hopefully, one day we 
can all heal from this painful process and then have the courage 
to forgive. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was a note written obviously with a very strong sense of 
compassion, not just concern about her own circumstances as a 
mother of young children but a sense of compassion for all 
families of the victims of hepatitis C.  It was written not just 
to express appreciation for the fact that members of the House 
have remained in solidarity with those victims, but I choose to 
believe that it is a message to all 301 members of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a responsibility now to move forward.  We have a 
responsibility to include the victims of hepatitis C through 
their representatives of the Hepatitis C Society in the process 
of working together with the different levels of government to 
find a solution, a fair solution that will compensate those who 
through no fault of their own find that their health has been 
jeopardized and in far too many cases their lives foreshortened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us accept that as a challenge to all members of the House. 
Let us see it as a reminder of why our constituents sent us to 
Ottawa, why they entrusted to us the responsibility to work 
together to find solutions to problems that Canadians face and to 
ensure that at the end of the day the Canada that has had 
compassion and caring at the very heart of our being is the 
Canada that emerges from this disastrous chapter in Canadian 
health history.

that.  The victims of hepatitis C had no choice or alternative to 
turn to.  They did not have the option of banking their own

crutches, and in some cases bearing crosses symbolizing the 
mothers and fathers, family members and friends who lost their 
lives to hepatitis C. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is absolutely clear that today we have a responsibility to

their hospital beds, to plead for compassion and justice from 
their elected representatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us today use the opportunity to recognize the dedication and

not close and that the compassion of Canadians prevailed in this

come out of the experience much sicker, whether it is hepatitis C 
victims or a variety of other diseases they may pick up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is no negligence and there is no legal liability, does 
the member think we should be moving into a system of no fault 
insurance or no fault compensation?   If the member does not 
believe in a no fault compensation package, what distinguishes a 
group of pre-1986 hepatitis C victims from all the other people 
who enter into the health care system and come out, tragically, 
oftentimes much worse for the experience?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have to say in all 
honesty it distresses me somewhat that I feel there is some back 
sliding here into those spurious arguments that focused on what 
the Minister of Health and his 154 colleagues who voted against 
justice last week have done over the last few weeks.  This is 
what has been so lamentable and so tragic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have insisted on reducing the matter to issues of legal 
liability.  They have insisted on saying they cannot set 
precedents.  They need an artificial construct or a window, in 
this case from 1986 to 1990, during which time they can actually 
say the Government of Canada should have administered a test that 
was available and did not, and therefore they accept the 
responsibility and the legal liability and it is just too bad 
about those other victims who succumbed to hepatitis C before the 
test began to be administered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, it is simply inaccurate to say that 1986 to 1990 is some 
magic set of dates.  The fact of the matter is that there were 
discussions taking place between the Government of Canada and 
provincial governments about introducing such a test as early as 
1981 and the decision was made not to do it for all the wrong 
reasons, for financial reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, let us recognize that there is a wealth of ethical 
capital in the country, the same ethical capital that results in 
Canadians saying it was nobody's fault there was an ice storm but 
we will compensate; it was nobody's fault that there was a flood 
but we will compensate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about a system failure here and we have a 
responsibility to compensate people for having been infected by 
it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK44"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I was 
fascinated by the headline I saw on Saturday which said the 
hepatitis C victim compensation was rock solid.  The headline I 
would put on the docket today is that the hepatitis C 
compensation package of the government is more like a rock slide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a hopeful nature to what I am to say today.  Although 
the issue is not resolved and is not completed, I see positive 
movement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I give credit today to the victims.  I have actually met some of 
them.  I hope it would not be unfair to characterize them as a 
ragtag assortment of people who are sick.  The hepatitis C 
organization which I have come to know a bit about does not have 
enough money to rent space.  It borrows space.  It is lucky if it 
has enough money to afford faxes.  It is borrowing computer 
equipment for the Internet and whatnot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud this little ragtag group—and if anyone takes that as 
a slam, it is not—of ill people has up to the might of the 
federal government, to its PR people, to its communications 
people, to its huge spending capabilities, and has said quietly 
and sincerely “This is not fair and we won't go away until it is 
changed”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the group of cynics who says “You cannot do anything in the 
face of a big, powerful government”, this indicates to me that 
is not so.  I am so proud of those individuals who would not lie 
down, who would not fall over, who would not just say “Because 
I'm sick I will accept this compensation”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The joy of this is in a fax I received this morning from a woman 
in B.C.  She congratulated the opposition parties for what they 
are doing and whatnot, but what she went on to indicate was heart 
rending to me.  She is eligible for compensation.  She is in that 
window as the deal stands.  However, she said “I will not take 
anything until all the needy are properly looked after”.  She 
also said that I could use her name and her remarks. 
Her name is Doris Corrigan in Surrey, B.C., who in my view is 
compassionate beyond belief.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has also been fascinating to watch the arguments of the 
government systematically dismantled by these individuals. The 
argument that this would cause a floodgate of frivolous legal 
claims has been dismantled.  The argument that this would cause a 
precedent to be set that would destroy medicare was dismantled. 
There is also the argument that the test was unavailable before 
1986. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I practised medicine from 1970 until I came to parliament.  I 
must admit that my memory is not always perfect but I remember 
the very first week I was in practice in my small community. What 
test did I order during that very first week in 1970?  I ordered 
the ALT test.  I ordered that test to try to find out if one of 
my patients had hepatitis.  It was the most specific sensitive 
test available to us at that time.  Normally a screening test 
would be done to look for liver damage.  If liver damage was 
found the most specific test which was ALT would be done.  I used 
the ALT test throughout my medical career.  I used it every 
single time there was a patient with hepatitis and I wanted to 
see how serious the hepatitis was. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister said so plainly on TV last week that the test was 
not available in Canada before 1986.  What he should have said 
and should have added to that is that the regulators decided not 
to use that test to screen for hepatitis C in donated blood.  If 
he had added that proviso, he would have been on firm ground. But 
to say the test was not available before 1986, I cannot use the 
word I would like to use to express how I feel about that, but it 
was wrong.  It was available.  It was here.  I used it. Every 
single MD in Canada knows that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those physicians listening who do not know the name of the 
test by ALT, we call it SGPT.  That is the common name of the 
test.  It was the most specific test we had available.  It was 
available, used here and regulators decided it was not useful for 
screening, which was a mistake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a negative talk at all.  Because I am hopeful I 
wanted to say what the hepatitis C victims expect.  I received a 
letter this week from one of my colleagues at home who said “I 
do not favour compensation for everyone who is not symptomatic”, 
in medical parlance, asymptomatic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is what the hepatitis C victims want.  They want the 
connection between hep C seropositivity connected to a 
transfusion to give them the opening to walk through a door into 
the room of compensation. They only want funds if they are sick. 
They have not been able to make that issue clear because they are 
not at the table, which is why I so strongly support my NDP 
colleagues who are asking for them to be at the table.  They are 
not at the table to be able to tell the government.  Who are 
negotiating?  Class action lawyers. My colleagues in the NDP are 
on the right track by saying they need to be there to express 
what they want from compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They also need to be there because they have the best numbers 
figures.  They have gone through these.  The trace back and look 
back figures are now coming forward, but the numbers that the 
government is using are inaccurate.  We can look at the 
international experience and do some calculations and find that 
as well as looking at the domestic experience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my hopeful comments I also want to look to the future. What 
does the future hold for our blood system?  What really went 
wrong in our old blood system is that there was not one single 
person in charge.  There were experts who gave advice and whose 
advice was ignored for various reasons.  There was no one there 
who could say “That decision is wrong and for safety we must go 
that road”.  What will our new system do to prevent this? What 
about CJD, the human variant of mad cow disease?  Would it be 
prevented by the new blood system?  There is a big question mark 
here because in the new blood system again it is not one person 
in charge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who should be in charge? 
The federal Minister of Health should have that mantle on his 
shoulders.  He should be able to say from all the discussions 
that take place “This must happen”.  It is not something he can 
delegate to someone else.  It is not something he can throw away.

</I></B></P><P align=left>New therapies are coming along which are so exciting to these 
victims.  Ribavirin and interferon, a combination that has just 
been approved in the U.S., gives me great hope that we may be 
able to throw away this compensation package for those victims 
who are not very sick.  Is this not our desire, to have these 
people cured rather than needing compensation?  If we cannot cure 
them, when they have been let down by the federal regulator, 
surely we should look after them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to pay tribute to Joey Haché.  Joey is the 15-year old 
boy who came here on his own hook.  On Monday just before the 
vote he said to his dad “Dad, I have hepatitis C.  I want to go 
down there and I want to see how this works in parliament.  They 
are voting on an important issue to me”.  He does not live very 
far from here, so down he came.  He sat up in the gallery.  He 
watched the voting.  He spontaneously rose afterward and clapped 
for the opposition members for their stand. I had an opportunity 
to meet Joey after.  I shook his hand and said “I think you are 
the bravest guy here”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Joey watched the proceedings in the House of Commons the next 
day and said that he did not like the way some questions were 
answered in the House. He wrote out his questions to the Prime 
Minister.  He could not ask them, but who could?  He brought them 
to me. Joey was asked if I had approached him and tried to drag 
him down here for partisan purposes “Did he try to use you for 
political purposes?”  Joey with his cute little 15-year old 
smile said “You know, I think I am using the member for Macleod 
for my political purposes”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just to set the record straight, Joey was not contacted.  He 
spontaneously came here and said what he wanted to say with his 
resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very hopeful today for the victims.  I want so much to be 
able to stop this haranguing.  I want to say to the government 
that it has finally done the right thing, even if it had to be 
dragged there kicking and screaming.  That is my sincere hope for 
the sake of the victims. 
<P><A NAME="LINK45"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (Charlotte, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the member for his good speech and for the work he has put into 
this file, as have all members on this side of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the questions I have for him regarding yesterday's 
announcement from Ontario is what will fundamentally change? 
Obviously in this country, unfortunately and regrettably we have 
rich provinces and poor provinces.  At the end of the day I still 
believe it is going to take a great deal of leadership by the 
federal government to put a package together that will include 
all victims of hepatitis C. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of the provinces are under financial restraint.  Unless the 
federal government takes a leadership role in this when they get 
back to the table, what is going to change unless the health 
minister stands up with the support of the Prime Minister and 
says that all victims are going to be compensated? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member can take no small 
pride in the amount of work he has put into this file as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be patently unfair for one rich province to say that it 
will give funds and no one else would.  Imagine the position a 
poorer province would be in if it said it would not look after 
these individuals when the numbers of dollars especially in 
relationship to the numbers of victims are not that great. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen inflated figures, figures which I think are 
completely unfair.  The numbers I have used as a comparison, 
another jurisdiction with four million people ended up with 732 
victims who were sick enough to go for compensation.  If we 
extrapolate that in Canada we will find that the figures are far 
different. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nova Scotia, a relatively have not province, led the file on 
HIV.  The Tory government there led the push for HIV 
compensation.  I do not think that anybody would say that it did 
that because it had lots of extra funds. 
The province did it because it was correct, proper and right.  In 
a sense it shamed other governments into following its lead.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that funds will be taken from other frivolous things, 
such as giving money to businesses that are already successful, 
and put where Canadians think the funds should go. That is to 
those who have been unfortunately harmed because federal 
regulators did not do what they should have done.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo—Chilcotin, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am aware that the federal Department of Health and 
Department of Agriculture and Agri-Food got together and 
established a new research facility in Winnipeg.  It has been 
commissioned and declared safe for studying the most exotic and 
dangerous diseases.  I believe it has a class four designation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ask the Reform health critic if he is aware of this 
new facility being involved in any of the research in testing for 
hepatitis C or any aspect of improving the well-being of 
hepatitis C victims.  Is this research facility involved in any 
of this at all? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the commissioning of this 
new research facility has been fairly recent.  It is the perfect 
facility to be leading the charge in this way.  This facility 
looks after things like the ebola virus which is profoundly risky 
to all human life.  The facility certainly could and should be 
involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have only been in touch with one of the highest officials in 
the lab.  I am not certain how far down the road it is with new 
equipment and whatnot to be conducting these experiments. This is 
the perfect facility to be a world leader in this area and 
certainly something I endorse personally.  Once again, we surely 
want to fix the problem before it comes rather than fix the 
problem after it is there.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, we usually say 
we are pleased to take part in the debate on a motion tabled by 
a colleague no matter which party he or she belongs to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I am not opposed to the motion by my colleague from the 
New Democratic Party, I find it difficult to speak again about a 
tragedy of national proportions where we have to fight to see 
justice done so that the victims of this tragedy are not left 
out in the cold. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has been trying to single out a number of victims 
for compensation in order to show compassion and to exclude 
other victims, who were not infected during the period agreed 
on.  But these people were also infected and have suffered 
unprecedented prejudice.  They are being told “It is not our 
fault.  You must face the consequences, as we will not recognize 
our responsibilities”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is a shame we are forced to tear each other apart in 
order to get those in power—this government, which is in a 
position to see that justice is done—to understand that these 
people who have lost their lives, who are in despair, have lost 
everything because of this terrible disease. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be pleased nevertheless to try once again to heighten 
the awareness of this government, who is in a position to make a 
decision by taking part in the debate on this motion my NDP 
colleague moved this morning.

</I></B></P><P align=left>For the benefit of our viewers, the motion reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House urge the government to press for the invitation 
of representatives of the Hepatitis C Society of Canada to the 
upcoming meeting of federal, provincial and territorial Health 
Ministers in order to provide advice on how to address the 
financial needs of all those who contracted Hepatitis C from the 
federally-regulated blood system. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the point we have reached with all that has been said and 
written on the compensation of the victims in recent weeks, I 
think a little clarity in the facts and a little compassion 
would be well received.  These the Hepatitis C Society of Canada 
could provide. 
We are in favour of this aspect of the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for whether or not it is appropriate to compensate all 
victims regardless of when they were infected, I believe that 
our audience along with the majority of members in this House 
want the victims to be heard and justice to be done for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After four years and $15 million, the Krever commission of 
inquiry into tainted blood reached the same conclusions.  In his 
report, Justice Krever made recommendations on this, including a 
recommendation that there be no-fault compensation for all 
victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nevertheless, despite repeated demands from all sides, the 
present government is still refusing to give in to common sense 
and is stubbornly clinging to a rather dubious argument against 
equitable compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The answer is clear, however.  Should there be fair and 
equitable compensation for all victims who contracted hepatitis 
C from tainted blood, as there was for those who contracted HIV, 
or should there not?  I believe the answer is self-evident. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I call upon all members of the Liberal government, who 
will also be having to vote on this motion this evening, to ask 
themselves this question and also to give some thought to what 
the people of their respective ridings think. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I call upon the Minister of Health to reflect seriously 
upon the reasons behind his government's acting this way, when 
the most elementary logic tells us that justice and compassion 
must take precedence over any other consideration, no matter how 
legitimate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, justice and compassion are not what has guided 
the federal government since the start of the Krever inquiry. 
Need I mention all the obstacles this government has put in its 
way? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Briefly, if last November, we had the opportunity to read a 
report that managed, for once and for all, to cast light on the 
sad events surrounding this tragedy, it is surely not thanks to 
this government, which did anything but help it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is never too late to do the right thing, and there can be no 
better time than the present to remedy the past and show some 
good faith. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In recent days, a number of new elements have been brought into 
the picture.  And although there have been no changes on the 
government side, the present situation is no longer satisfactory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The province of Ontario announced that it was going to 
contribute between $100 and $200 million in order to compensate 
those who contracted hepatitis C before 1986. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Premier of Manitoba, Gary Filmon, said he was prepared to 
sit down with the federal government and the provinces to review 
the March 27 compensation package. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>British Columbia passed a resolution supporting last week's 
resolution by the National Assembly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nova Scotia's Conservative and New Democratic opposition plans 
to hound Russell MacLellan's minority Liberal government to urge 
the federal government and the provinces to negotiate a new 
agreement compensating all hepatitis C victims. 
It should be remembered that this Liberal government is a 
minority government.  The Liberals hold 19 seats, the New 
Democrats 19 and the Conservatives 14.  A vote of confidence on 
this issue could topple the government.  Nova Scotia's throne 
speech is scheduled for May 21.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, we learned this morning that a meeting would soon be 
held with the federal Minister of Health and his provincial 
counterparts, but we do not know when.  A certain openness to 
compensating everyone can be detected, however.  It remains to 
be seen how. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thousands of people are excluded from the agreement because they 
were infected before 1986 or after 1990.  This is unfair and 
unacceptable. 
In our view, the federal government must take its 
responsibilities and set up a special program that would be in 
addition to the existing agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since they took office, the Liberals have reduced the deficit 
primarily by passing on the costs to the provinces. Between 1994 
and 2003, Quebec and the other Canadian provinces will have 
suffered a shortfall of $42 billion. This accounts for 52% of 
the cuts, while the federal share is barely 12%. This in itself 
says a lot about the financial situation of the governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the year 2003, a further $30 billion in federal cuts will 
have been imposed on Quebeckers and Canadians in health, 
education and social assistance. Of course, it is the provinces 
that will have to find ways to absorb these cuts, and they will 
have to take the rap, not the federal government. 
Meanwhile, the federal government has surpluses and, by the year 
2000, there will be a surplus of $25 billion in the employment 
insurance fund, which will have accumulated at the expense of 
the workers and the unemployed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why we are calling for the establishment of a special 
fund, because this government has the means to compensate all 
hepatitis C victims. The provinces have done their share so far 
and, in addition, they must pay for the health care costs of all 
these victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the motion by the New Democratic Party would 
bring a little humanity and compassion to the upcoming meeting 
of health ministers. Let us hope that the federal government 
will follow up on it and recognize, after everyone else, the 
unfairness of a situation it alone can correct adequately.

as this where people are trying to take the high moral ground 
about who is doing the best for whom it might be worthwhile for 
all of us to reflect on what is taking place.  It is important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part of this national debate on blood is to note that the 
consumers, and we have called them the victims of hepatitis C, 
they have always been involved in the process.  Their input 
remains crucial and critical to the refinement of the policy, so 
much so that we have turned directly to victim representatives in 
order to establish how that initial package of $1.1 billion 
should be spent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not happy about the climate but it is important to keep in 
mind that ministers in this government and especially the current 
Minister of Health have had extensive consultations with 
representatives of groups affected by the blood crisis, as did 
ministers in other jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The consumer perspective was an integral part of the process of 
negotiations and consumer representatives were appraised of 
developments throughout the process.  Representatives of groups 
such as the Canadian Haemophilia Society and the Hepatitis C 
Society of Canada met regularly with a variety of politicians and 
their views were fed into the process at various stages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The blood system is ultimately about people, altruism and 
equity, not federal provincial relations, not partisan politics 
and not political advantage.  As soon as we come to realize this

House are aware, governments are offering to settle litigation. 
An offer to do so differs therefore from the standard approaches 
to program development and the amount of money governments put on 
the table does not flow into a clearly defined program to render 
benefits but rather is placed before the courts as part of an 
effort to negotiate a settlement of legal claims arising from a 
specific set of factual circumstances from the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I draw the attention of the House to the importance of the three 
class actions initiated in three provinces during the 1986-1990 
period.  As is normal, when the courts are approached to resolve 
conflict, settlement is always a preferred option.  The Minister 
of Health has been on record for quite some time about his desire 
to settle the litigation in an expeditious way so that plaintiffs 
would not be obligated to wait years to determine how the courts 
would rule on their particular cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many Canadians are likely not familiar with the mechanism of a 
negotiated court approved settlement.  While this way of doing 
things carries many complexities, it has several advantages. 
First, the negotiations take place under the aegis of the courts 
so there is an emphasis on fairness in the final determination of 
that settlement.  Second, both sides of an issue are brought to 
the negotiating table to work out the details of the settlement 
in a way that is both transparent and accountable. Third, that 
flexibility is available to both sides in the determination of 
the specifics of a settlement package so that many aspects of 
what is inevitably a complex problem, which hepatitis C poses in 
society, can be addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Negotiated court approved settlements have been used on several 
occasions in the past in health areas to deal with the 
complexities of injury from health systems.  While negotiated 
court approved settlements are not perfect venues for addressing 
all social problems, in cases where the issues are difficult and 
there has been an adversarial context, they offer a way forward 
which is both fair and open.  Consultation with and involvement 
of groups and their representatives is inherent in the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been some suggestion in society that we can substitute 
for court mechanisms through other processes such as mediation, 
arbitration, et cetera.  While these alternative dispute 
mechanisms are gaining popularity, in the present state of 
affairs in the justice system most affairs are transacted using 
traditional mechanisms.  The seriousness of the blood tragedy and 
the long term importance of these negotiations to the lives of 
those affected argues in favour of employing a well established, 
well understood mechanism to achieve a settlement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Accordingly, governments have instituted negotiations with 
plaintiffs through the courts.  One of the major advantages of 
this approach is that it can accommodate a variety of what are 
called structured settlement negotiations.   This means that far 
from being a simple once off transfer of funds, a settlement can 
involve a variety of mechanisms to accommodate medical need and 
medical risk over time.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government negotiators will be indicating a preference of 
ministers for an initial lump sum payment combined, and I stress 
that word, with variable payments over time geared to severity 
and disability.  This is a suggestion only and plaintiffs may 
have different views, but it does indicate the power and 
potential of the structured settlement context to meet individual 
needs over a lifetime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we are in the early phases of considering what long term 
implications of hepatitis C from the blood issue are, during the 
course of these negotiations governments will be displaying their 
knowledge of the epidemiology, natural history, research dynamics 
and treatment potential associated with hepatitis C so that the 
best evidence and research can be mobilized to achieve solutions 
in this area for a large number of people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time the negotiations will take into account 
different preferences arising from different circumstances of the 
plaintiffs.  The process is therefore very flexible and open to a 
very wide group of people, input and many points of view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another important element of the negotiated court approved 
settlement context is the potential that it offers to design a 
national solution to this issue which was initially a regional 
class action.  Certain provinces through their class action 
legislation have the potential to create national classes to 
which all Canadian residents who qualify could subscribe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part of the dynamic of the negotiated court approved settlement 
will be to ensure that such a national class context emerges. 
This is not to say that individuals will lose any of their 
traditional rights before the courts, but rather to emphasize 
that class action legislation provides a potential to generate 
national frameworks for resolving issues of health injury. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing we want to do at all costs is to avoid the 
balkanization of approaches to an issue and issues that are 
fundamental as those raised by the blood tragedy. A Canadian in 
Newfoundland should have exactly the same rights in this area as 
a Canadian in British Columbia and others in between.  The 
justice system should not be used as a vehicle to advance 
benefits to some at the disadvantage of others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The courts have traditionally addressed medical injury using a 
particular format:  pain and suffering and economic loss.  This 
format has been engaged in the case of hepatitis C as well and is 
inevitable on the basis of the calculations which will be made in 
and around partial or total liability in this area.  This does 
not mean that we need to be limited to this format in determining 
how a settlement could be structured.  Indeed a structured 
settlement could be based on a variety of formats, including 
medical need over time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The power of such an approach is that it would allow individuals 
in like circumstances to be treated alike and individuals in 
unlike circumstances to be treated differently.  This would 
undoubtedly enhance the perceived fairness of any settlement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I know you want to cut me off on this but I 
appreciate the fact that you have been attentive so far and I 
thank you. 
<P><A NAME="LINK49"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want 
to say first of all I am very encouraged particularly by the 
latter comments made by the Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Health.  He talked about the importance of avoiding 
balkanization, avoiding a situation where the victims of 
hepatitis C in one area are compensated a different amount than 
the victims of hepatitis C in another area.  I am very pleased to 
hear the parliamentary secretary, I assume on behalf of his 
colleagues, the 154 other colleagues who voted against really 
avoiding a balkanized system last week.  We all have to be 
encouraged by that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do have a question though for the parliamentary secretary.  I 
listened very carefully to his comments.  He is the first 
intervener from the government side today on the NDP motion. 
Perhaps it was inadvertent but he appears to have strenuously 
avoided dealing directly with the motion that is before us.

<A HREF="#LINKT15"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the parliamentary secretary that the motion before us 
is to ensure that representatives, consumers as he called them, 
of the Hepatitis C Society of Canada be invited to participate in 
the upcoming meetings of the federal, provincial and territorial 
health ministers to ensure that their financial and health needs 
are addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary himself has made the point that 
there was consultation with the victims in earlier stages, that 
their views were sought.  Unfortunately the government chose to 
ignore the views and petitions that the Krever recommendation 
that compensation be paid to all victims should in fact be the 
official position.  That is why we now have a balkanized 
situation where some hepatitis C victims have been offered 
compensation and those outside the 1986 to 1990 window have not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the parliamentary secretary specifically address on his 
own behalf and on behalf of the government as its designated 
speaker whether or not he and the government will support the 
pleadings contained in the NDP motion?  Will they agree that the 
representatives of the Hepatitis C Society of Canada be included 
as participants at the table when the federal, provincial and 
territorial ministers of health meet to deal with fair 
compensation, not on a balkanized basis but on a universal basis? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joseph Volpe:</B>  Mr. Speaker, let me first thank the 
leader of the NDP for acknowledging, as she heard my presentation 
on the matter, that the Government of Canada has been acting 
responsibly, reasonably and purposefully on behalf of all 
victims.  I initially called them consumer groups but I indicated 
that they are sufferers, victims of hepatitis C. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am happy to acknowledge that for once there has been a member 
of the opposition who has thought through the presentations of 
the government and has agreed that there is merit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to her question about whether I am addressing the 
issue presented by her motion directly, I would like her to 
reflect a little bit more on the first few words I used in my 
intervention.  Specifically we have already over the course of 
negotiations that led to the offer which is under discussion 
talked with representatives of hepatitis C victims. We talked to 
the individuals themselves.  There were consultations by the 
federal Minister of Health in all cases.  All of those issues 
were brought forward in the negotiations with the provincial and 
territorial health ministers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When someone speaks through actions, does that not indicate they 
are acting in the same responsible fashion that the opposition 
members would suggest we ought to adopt?  If we have kept 
victims, victims representatives and victims groups in the loop 
of consultations leading to the package under discussion, have we 
not already done what many would suggest we ought to do? 
<P><A NAME="LINK50"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (Charlotte, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to 
thank the New Democratic Party for putting forward this motion. 
It is an important debate and I thank the members for their 
support.  I believe I speak for all members on this side of the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The position taken by the federal government in regard to the 
compensation of the hepatitis C victims was certainly untenable 
from the start.  When that package was announced it included only 
the victims between the years 1986 and 1990.  The question was 
how could it establish that date.  There was no reason for it. 
Basically it was a position that no one could defend and 
certainly not the government. It came up with what I call an 
artificial date or box of convenience.  It was based on when 
testing was available. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1125"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT16"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I guess from the government's point of view if one were a lawyer 
it could be argued that way.  That was the position the 
government could best defend in a court of law, that is, in any 
lawsuits or civil cases that may come before the courts from the 
victims prior to 1986.  That in itself was also a very shallow 
argument. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members of this side of the House have said repeatedly over 
the years there was a test available which was being exercised 
routinely in West Germany prior to 1986 and going back certainly 
to 1981.  What is now commonly referred to as hepatitis C was 
routinely being tested for in that jurisdiction and many others 
before that time period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's position is completely untenable.  It leaves 
thousands of Canadians outside a compensation package. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Shame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  It is a shame.  It becomes so 
ridiculous that for example a person infected on December 31, 
1985 would be outside the package and a person lucky enough to be 
infected on January 1, 1986 would be in the package. From any 
reasonable point of view it does not make a bit of sense.  That 
was the strategy the government decided to pursue.  It was the 
one the government attempted to defend and it has not done a very 
good job of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday there was a move, I guess it could be called a crack 
in the armour.  Premier Harris of Ontario announced that he is 
willing to put $200 million into a compensation package for those 
people outside the frame or box of convenience, the years 1986 to 
1990.  That is heartening for many of us but it is not the end of 
the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debate falls right back into the lap of the federal 
government because the question then becomes, can all provinces 
afford to do that?  The answer is no they cannot. Where will it 
leave the poorer provinces? We do not know where it is going to 
leave them. Some are suggesting it is still going to leave them 
out in the cold so to speak because many of them cannot afford to 
do more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we on this side of the House have consistently 
stressed the importance of the federal government acting 
unilaterally to do the right thing.  When the federal health 
minister meets with his counterparts the provincial ministers, we 
are hoping that will be addressed by the federal minister.  We 
hope they will say “Yes, we do have to take the leadership in 
this”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The generosity being expressed by other provinces is important 
and I hope that file continues to move.  I hope the other 
provinces can come up with something. But at the end of the day 
it still will be the federal minister who will have to lead on 
this file.  I do not believe he has done that in the past number 
of weeks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I think has been happening on the government front benches 
is that it has been a battle between the finance minister and the 
health minister. I do not think any of us in this House would 
stand and say that the health minister of this country would 
actually deny compensation to victims.  I think he has been a 
victim of internal politics within his own government. The 
finance minister with a big Cheshire cat grin on his face day in 
and day out as the health minister is besieged and attacked 
refuses to move, refuses to budge. That is one of the problems we 
see being played out on the front benches of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has changed in the equation?  I do not think a heck of a 
lot has changed. 
I think the health minister has caved in to the power of the 
finance minister.  At the end of the day there will still not be 
any money for innocent victims left outside the original package. 
I do not think that is right.

<A HREF="#LINKT17"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are going back to square one again.  What I think the 
government has to consider is the box it put itself in and the 
difficulty the health minister will have moving off some of the 
statements he made in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the things he stated are pretty outrageous. In the past, 
he indicated this could bankrupt the Canada health care system as 
we know it if compensation were extended to victims outside the 
original package. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know how he can retract those words.  I do not know how 
he can go into cabinet and wage a convincing fight if he still 
takes that position.  I do not know what will happen when he 
meets with the provincial ministers if he still holds on to that 
point of view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think it will be particularly healthy and I do not 
think it is going to lead to any kind of package that we in this 
House could support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am saying is that there may be a need for a change in the 
leadership of this file on the federal level.  I will not go 
beyond that because only the Prime Minister can decide.  I think 
the health minister is boxed into a position that will be very 
difficult for him to negotiate from, basically a position of 
weakness.  I do not think that is healthy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion today speaks to the inclusion of 
hepatitis C victims in these negotiations.  I think it is only 
fair that that happens because I do not think these people are 
asking for anything other than what is reasonable and what is 
fair.  I think their point of view has to be at the table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other thing that we have lost sight of in this House, which 
the member for Macleod spoke on, is the real number of victims 
left outside the package. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If members have been following this file they will find that the 
number is absolutely exaggerated.  The health minister sat over 
there day in and day out telling us the victims are in excess of 
40,000.  He routinely mentioned 60,000 victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He is saying this for a reason.  He wants the Canadian public to 
believe that the health care system would be bankrupt because of 
the number of victims who have yet to be compensated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That has to be corrected.  Again, I do not know how he can go 
back in good faith to the bargaining table and disconnect himself 
from some of the previous statements he made. That is one of the 
reasons why the victims have to be there.  I think they can talk 
intelligently about what those real numbers might be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the <I>Globe and Mail</I> today, Mr. Picard is suggesting that 
the number could be as low as 6,000 victims, 10,000 victims or 
maybe 15,000 victims.  We do not know.  I think that is one of 
the things to be established from day one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think they can come up with the kind of package that 
means anything until there are real numbers to work around.  That 
is why these people have to be at the negotiations, so some of 
the honesty in terms of numbers and what they are looking for is 
actually expressed at that table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will continue our pressure on the government, particularly on 
the health minister.  I hope at the end of the day the Prime 
Minister and the Minister of Health do the right thing.  I hope 
these victims are compensated and the real story comes out. 
<P><A NAME="LINK51"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the discussion about a date is 
causing some confusion.  It is not an arbitrary date.  It is not 
a whimsical date.  It is a date everybody is looking at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about a period in which something was generally 
available, a mechanism was generally available and people could 
have done something and did not do it. 
It is important to understand that.  We are talking about 
something that all interveners have suggested, that somebody else 
is responsible for a condition which is regrettable and tragic. 
Everyone acknowledges that but the moment that we recognize that 
the fault is inherent we have to point the finger.  The finger 
was pointed specifically by those who have investigated the 
situation as starting about 1986.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the member opposite wants to as well discredit other previous 
speakers, for example the member for Macleod who talked about 
tests being available in the seventies in which he as a 
responsible medical practitioner engaged, and he wants to refer 
to that as a point of reference, that is fine.  Let him as well 
address some of the issues that flow from that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is important to underscore that this is not an 
untenable position.  It is a position that everyone has agreed 
has some basis in reason and rationality.  For him to engage in 
hindsight and the accuracy of the hindsight about tests being 
available, I ask him to think again about whether they were 
generally acceptable and whether there was action on them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason the 1986 date was fixed, and it was not arbitrary, is 
authorities recognized that something could have been done then 
and was not done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I cannot believe what I 
am hearing from this parliamentary secretary.  They are sticking 
to that line which is a complete failure. The member is talking 
about going back to the table and still sticking to this date, 
which is absolutely and totally artificial. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that is the basis on which the government is going to go into 
this argument, I go right back to the point that I made 
previously.  Nothing is going to change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Has the government not learned anything in the last four weeks 
in this House?  The only people who support that position are 
government members. If they continue that line of logic, the poor 
victims will gain absolutely nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After four weeks in this House I would think that the 
parliamentary secretary to the minister would have learned 
something.  This indicates that nothing has been accomplished in 
terms of the ability of government members to absorb information. 
On that, I rest my case. 
<P><A NAME="LINK52"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have a 
procedural question for the member for Charlotte.  The Reform 
Party treats an opposition day motion as a free vote. We give a 
recommendation and members will vote according to how they feel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder how Conservative members will treat this non-partisan 
opposition motion today.  Will they treat it the same way?  Will 
they be voting freely without whip constraint?  Will they be 
voting with their hearts, will they be voting the wishes of their 
constituents? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we will certainly vote 
with our hearts in the right place with regard to this motion.  I 
hope members on the other side can do that.  There were a lot of 
them squirming in their seats just a week ago when they had to 
vote to deny compensation for those innocent victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the Prime Minister allows his people to vote with their 
hearts today.  I am sure that if the parliamentary secretary and 
even the minister spoke with their hearts, and just a bit with 
their minds, they would have voted with us on this side of the 
House, as I am sure Mr. Speaker would have done as well if you 
were in that position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion before us today is good and we have to continue 
debating this issue.  I believe at the end of the day this House 
will overwhelmingly, at least on this side of the House, support 
that motion.  I know we certainly will.

suggestion for the government.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We present this motion in good faith and in the spirit of 
co-operation with the belief that if we all work together we can 
make a difference.  I sense the frustration that the Conservative 
health critic has just expressed. We are beginning to feel that 
same sense of frustration having listened to the parliamentary 
secretary's comments pertaining to this very constructive 
suggestion.  We will try again, throughout the course of this 
day, to put before members of the Liberal Party the rationale, 
the testimony, to help them understand that the time has come to 
overcome this impasse, to put aside the past history on this 
issue, to do what is right and to act on behalf all blood injured 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hope today marks the turning point.  As my colleague from 
Saskatchewan said, if we have a second chance let us use it.  Let 
us not drop the ball.  We have the opportunity to make a 
difference today in an otherwise sorry chapter in this history 
of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had five weeks of emotional, difficult debate in the 
House.  We have had five weeks of personal testimonies on the 
steps of this building.  We have heard heart wrenching stories 
from those people who are suffering from the disease of hepatitis 
C through no fault of their own and who are affected by this 
serious issue.  They are looking for compassion and justice.  We 
know we have to end this chapter and get on with making a 
difference for all blood injured Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday the Minister of Health gave us a light of hope when he 
said he was prepared to convene a meeting, in short order, of all 
federal, provincial and territorial ministers of health.  That 
was an important step.  We took hope yesterday. Today we want to 
see that hope become a reality.  We would like to see the 
government open the door a little further.  We hope the 
parliamentary secretary's comments are not a reflection of this 
government's attitude and approach today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today the parliamentary secretary said a couple of very 
disturbing things.  I hope he will rethink his statements and his 
position on those matters.  He said that those people affected by 
the failure of our blood system, the victims of this tragedy, 
were consulted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason we have made this motion today, presented this 
constructive suggestion to include representatives of the 
hepatitis C society and the hemophilia society, is they have not 
been consulted.  They were not included in the development of the 
agreement that limits compensation to the period of 1986 to 1990. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, there were consultations earlier on. Many months ago the 
Minister of Health expressed to all those affected that he was 
willing to listen and do the right thing. We have it in writing. 
We have documentation from the minister showing his concern and 
compassion.  But we also know that five weeks ago when this 
decision was put on the table at the federal-provincial ministers 
meeting of health, they were not included.  They were left out of 
the process.  They were not in the loop. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the record and for the benefit of the 
parliamentary secretary, let me read briefly from a letter dated 
April 20 signed by Jeremy Beaty, president of the 
hepatitis C society.  In that letter he asked specifically for 
the government to consider the viewpoints of the those affected 
by the tainted blood scandal: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As representatives of the largest hepatitis C through 
transfusion group in Canada, we ask that you provide funding for 
independent legal representation to enable our society to access 
professional advice that is based on social justice and 
compassion, on behalf of all hepatitis C transfusion victims. 
This is an issue you can immediately address, and show clear good 
faith, through a willingness to assist us in our efforts to reach 
a just resolution. 
</UL>

<A HREF="#LINKT20"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a clear indication on the part of the Hepatitis C 
Society, which includes all victims of this tragedy and which 
certainly encompasses the feelings of the Hemophilia Society, 
that they have not been included.  They need to be included. 
They want to be part of the discussions.  We have before the 
House a very positive suggestion to do just that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not forget today the contribution that members of the 
Hepatitis C Society and the Hemophilia Society and all blood 
injured Canadians have made to this parliament and to this 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is hard for us to imagine what they have gone through, the 
roller coaster ride they have been on, the ups and downs, the 
hurts and the hopes.  Today let us not hurt those victims once 
again.  Let us give them some hope and at least show good faith 
that we as members of parliament will work together to ensure 
that the deal is opened up, the question of compensation is 
re-thought and that they will be at the table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be absolutely clear that we are not trying to get 
political mileage out of the suggestion as the parliamentary 
secretary suggested.  At the outset he tried to dismiss our 
efforts in the House and tried to cast aspersions on our 
intentions as trying to divide and conquer.  For once in the 
House we have some solidarity.  There is support from all 
quarters.  We are working together to do the best thing, to do 
what is right.  Let not the parliamentary secretary diminish 
those efforts.  Let us instead hold up this solidarity as an 
example of what our democracy can be and what inroads we can make 
when we work together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hope that today the parliamentary secretary will talk with 
his colleagues and will check with the Minister of Health who 
gave a very clear indication yesterday of re-opening the file, of 
rethinking this entrenched, intransigent position, and of 
accepting full responsibility for the fact that these people were 
poisoned through the blood system which is clearly under federal 
regulation.  It is that federal regulatory body that failed.  It 
is the responsibility of the federal government to acknowledge 
that failure and to work co-operatively with all the provinces 
and territories to come up with a meaningful package that ensures 
that all who were affected by this disaster, by this crisis, by 
this tragedy are able to receive some financial assistance, some 
compassionate relief, some compensation for the havoc that has 
been wreaked upon their lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To conclude, all of us in the House recognize that the measure 
of a society—and I believe Justice Krever said this as well—is 
in the dignity and the respect that we confer upon the most 
vulnerable in our society, the most humble members among us.  Let 
us today make the right decision.  Let us hold up this parliament 
and this nation as a shining example, a beacon of light for 
compassion, concern and justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wanted to indicate at the outset of my remarks that I would be 
sharing my time with the member for Halifax West.  I understand 
my 10 minutes is about to lapse.  However, before I pass over 
this opportunity I would like to make one final comment and that 
is that this has been a very trying time for everyone.  Most of 
all, it has been a heart-wrenching period for those affected by 
this very sad chapter in the history of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The onus upon all of us is to acknowledge that what we are 
dealing with is a failure of the federal government to ensure 
that proper regulations were in place to protect our blood 
system.  That is not to say there is not a will on the part of 
all provinces and territories to co-operate and to work out 
solutions to ensure that the financial plans and programs are in 
place to assist everyone.  It is to say that we need leadership 
from the federal government and, most of all, we need compassion. 
Let it happen today.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime 
Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the member for 
her presentation on this issue.  I would like to indicate and 
reiterate for the record that indeed the Minister of Health did 
indicate yesterday during question period that “Today's 
development is a new one.  The ground has moved and an important 
partner has changed its position”, referring of course to the 
province of Ontario, a major province of our Confederation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was not present for the earlier part of the debate, but I am 
sure we all share the point of view that this government is known 
for its compassion.  I think the hon. member would agree that had 
it not been for the federal Minister of Health the issue of 
compensation for hepatitis C patients would not have advanced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1990 I started speaking on the issue of HIV infection and 
certainly this has been a preoccupation of this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree this is a non-partisan issue.  It is an issue that calls 
on good public policy and policy that is imbued with 
reasonableness and compassion at all times.  We have to put this 
together.  The challenge for us now is how to creatively approach 
this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the motion before us, I certainly would agree to 
a consultation with and the involvement of the Hepatitis C 
Society of Canada.  I have consulted with my constituents. 
Patients have called me.  When I explained to them the position 
of the government I must say, without hesitation, that they 
agreed with the position the government has taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I assured these individuals that we have not abandoned the other 
patients with hepatitis C.  In fact we have taken an approach of 
compassion for all of them, contrary to the Reform member who 
only alluded to the victims infected from 1981 on.  When we say 
all, we have to speak of all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to say that I am prepared—and I cannot speak for 
the government—to work in a very non-partisan fashion as we 
approach this very delicate issue to address in a creative way 
the needs of patients with hepatitis C, even those who were 
infected before 1986.  We will have to approach this in a very 
creative, non-partisan and careful way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the 
comments from my colleague, the member for Winnipeg North—St. 
Paul.  I want to assure him that we on this side of the House are 
questioning the individual positions of Liberal members.  We are 
not questioning their ability to feel compassion or to apply the 
right values.  What we are saying is that those values have not 
been translated into public policy and the decisions by this 
government to advance an agreement that is limited in scope, 
which creates two classes of victims, is not grounded on the 
values of compassion, concern and justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have presented today a resolution that is in the spirit of 
non-partisanship.  It is in the spirit of co-operation to 
encourage all players to get back to the discussion table and to 
include those who are most directly affected, those who live and 
breathe these issues day in and day out, as well as to consult 
with members of the Hepatitis C Society, the Hemophilia Society 
and all blood injured Canadians to get advice on how the 
financial needs of all blood injured Canadians can be achieved. 
That is the right thing to do. 
<P><A NAME="LINK55"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, my question 
is similar to that posed by my Conservative colleague.  This is 
an NDP motion and I presume the NDP would be supportive of this 
motion.  However, if there were a dissident, if someone decided 
not to, would they be forced to vote against their conscience on 
this issue or would this be a free vote for the NDP? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to put all 
of this into context.  We are all united on this motion today and 
we have been unwavering in our support throughout the past five 
weeks for a compensation package that includes all blood injured 
Canadians.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our support goes back to September 1996 when my leader and other 
members of my caucus agreed to support members of the Hepatitis C 
Society of Canada in their petitions to the government for full 
and fair compensation.  Our position has always been clear on 
this.  We will not change our position.  We will stand united 
with one voice because we believe it is the right thing to do. 
<P><A NAME="LINK56"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
very honoured to rise to speak on our motion.  I will read the 
motion again because it is very important to understand exactly 
what we are debating and exactly what this motion is asking.  It 
reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House strongly urge the government to press for the 
invitation of representatives of the Hepatitis C Society of 
Canada to the upcoming meeting of federal, provincial and 
territorial Health Ministers in order to provide advice on how to 
address the financial needs of all those who contracted Hepatitis 
C from the federally-regulated blood system. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I am honoured to speak to this motion, at the same time I 
am somewhat saddened.  I am saddened that we in this day and age, 
we in this country of Canada, we in this House of Commons have 
come to the point where we have to debate something which we 
would expect would be a normal thing to do for those who have 
compassion and caring.  It is sad we have to debate something 
that should automatically follow, fairness to our fellow human 
beings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I entered politics, when I was approached to become a 
politician, I had to think long and hard about it.  I shared 
with so many Canadians a cynicism about the political process and 
what we can really do within that process.  I received wise 
counsel from my wife, my children and people close to me.  They 
said “We need people like you in politics.  We need people who 
care about other people.  We need people who will not sacrifice 
or compromise their values.  We need people who will not put 
money or themselves first, but who will put others first”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The more I thought about that the more I realized it is 
important that if we feel we have something to contribute to 
society we should move forward.  We should put that forth in such 
a way that politics will not change us, but that we may have a 
changing effect upon politics.  That is the reason I chose to 
enter politics.  Since then I have constantly said to people that 
if they ever see me changing from the kind of person I am, to 
remind me so that I may always remember from whence I came and 
the primary purpose for being here, which is to serve others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two principles that seem to be working at odds in the 
issue of hepatitis C:  the principle of economics versus the 
principle of compassion and caring for others.  The principle of 
economics is ruled by the head.  We figure out how many dollars 
we have, we think about our bank accounts and we concentrate on 
that bottom line in our budgets.  But the principle of caring for 
other people is ruled by the heart.  It comes from the heart. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important on this issue that we allow our hearts to 
rule our heads instead of the other way around.  We have heard 
arguments in this House in which the rule of economics has become 
the bottom line.  We have heard that we cannot afford to 
compensate all victims, yet we know that the auditor general has 
found a $2.5 billion surplus.  So we can rule that out right 
away.  We need not be concerned with the economics.  We should 
now be looking at doing what is right.  We should be looking at 
what our hearts tell us as we deal with this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important for us to remember that we are indeed building 
the future for our children.  We are making history today.  We 
are setting a stage that generations down the road will look back 
upon.  They will look at us and judge us by what we have done 
with respect to this issue.  We want to build a future that our 
children can be proud of.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our motion calls for an invitation.  There may be a lot of 
argument today about the cost and about setting precedents, but 
our motion calls primarily for one thing.  We are asking that the 
victims, through their representatives, have an invitation to the 
table so that they may be there to address the issue and be part 
of a decision that will certainly impact upon their lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion emphasizes and underlines the need for communication, 
the idea of people having a say in decisions that affect them. We 
see far too often today that one of the problems of our society 
is that we do not communicate with people about the decisions 
that affect their lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see it with respect to young people and the decisions we make 
around scholarships, the millennium fund and so forth.  Quite 
often decisions are made without input from those who are to be 
affected by these decisions.  We see it with respect to our 
aboriginal peoples.  Decisions are being made at tables and first 
ministers conferences when the aboriginal people are excluded 
from those meetings.  We see it so often in many aspects of our 
lives.  We see decisions being made about programs that affect 
fishermen and people who are struggling to find a way to earn 
income but they are not invited to the table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we are emphasizing the importance of communication on a 
very important issue.  We are saying those victims should be 
invited to the table so they may have a say in this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Halifax West constituents care about this issue.  Many of them 
have approached me and asked my stand on the issue.  They have 
expressed full support.  They feel that the victims should be 
compensated and compensated fairly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two things have struck me since I have come to the House of 
Commons, two things that kind of stand out for me, two things I 
find hard to get used to because they do not seem to balance one 
with the other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first is how we approach question period.  I have spoken 
about this matter before.  When we are doing the nation's 
business quite often it is very confrontational but also quite 
often very disrespectful.  We do not respect the opinions of 
other people.  We do not listen properly.  We are constantly 
yelling while people are trying to talk and express their views. 
That bothers me.  I hope it will continue to bother me because 
the minute it stops bothering me is when I have started to let 
politics change me rather than bring the change to politics I 
hope to bring to politics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing that impresses me favourably is that we open each 
session of the House with a prayer.  The Speaker says a prayer. I 
am not sure how many people listen to the words of that prayer, 
but it asks for God's guidance as we do our deliberations on the 
nation's business.  The stark contrast is how we then proceed to 
move into question period and everything that takes place there 
seems to fly in the face of the prayer that has been said in 
terms of what we hope to do in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to think in terms of the heart.  That is very applicable 
to the issue we are dealing with.  We need to think in terms of 
the prayer when we open each session. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I pray that as we deal with this issue all members of the House 
may give thought to doing what is right in the eyes of their 
Creator, in the eyes of the God who put us on this earth to serve 
Him and to serve our fellow man, so that we may let our hearts 
rule as we deal with this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The money element is not that terribly important.  For example, 
when I first started to work many years ago I worked as a welfare 
officer.  I was responsible for assessing applications from 
single parent families, from the disabled, from many people in 
circumstances beyond their control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was told on the first day on the job “When you go out to do 
an application, make sure you never, ever give any one of your 
clients money out of your own pocket because you will be setting 
a precedent”.  We have heard that word quite often during this 
debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Armed with my rules and regulations I went out on my first case. 
The first case I had was one young lady who came to the door 
with three children, a baby in her arms and two children clinging 
on to her legs.  She looked at me and said “Mr. Earle, can you 
lend me some money because I don't have any money to buy milk to 
feed my baby.  I can't feed the children”.

<A HREF="#LINKT24"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>She took me to show me her cupboards and her cupboards were 
bare.  Her refrigerator was bare.  I looked at this woman, at the 
baby crying in her arms and at her hungry children standing 
there, and right away the first rule went out the window.  I 
reached into my back pocket and gave the woman some money.  As I 
walked away from her home I thought I may never see that money 
again, but the feeling I got in my heart far outweighed any 
concerns I had about losing the money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reassuring part was that about a month later I received a 
phone call in my office from this woman.  She wanted me to come 
and visit her.  I went to visit her and the very first thing she 
did as I walked through the door was to repay the money she had 
borrowed to get food for her family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The money will take care of itself.  We have to let the heart 
rule in this matter. 
<P><A NAME="LINK57"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I compliment the member opposite 
on a very emotional and passionate intervention.  I remind him 
that people on this side of the House are no less sensitive or 
compassionate.  As I said in my earlier intervention, we let our 
actions speak as loudly as our words. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have in the past through the Minister of Health engaged all 
victims of this terrible tragedy in consultations.  We have kept 
them involved and have considered all their needs.  They were 
brought to the table, which led to the package that has received 
nationwide attention over the course of the last month and a 
half. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I may be a little unfair here and I will do a mea culpa if I am. 
The member and the member who preceded him wanted to draw 
attention to the fact that all of us share a particular 
responsibility.  His colleague, the member who preceded him, was 
very forceful in indicating that the federal authority bears full 
responsibility for the tragedy.  I know members on the opposite 
side of the House want to reflect on the way the blood system 
worked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, there is a federal regulator.  The provinces, as they know, 
are directly responsible for administering the health care 
system.  The Red Cross at the time was responsible for 
co-ordinating and delivering the blood system. Together they had 
a responsibility to the public for the safety of the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know members on both sides of the House when they quote Krever 
will remember what he said in the interim report, that what 
Canadians wanted was a system that was accountable, transparent 
and, above all, safe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we are talking about responsibility I know members on the 
other side want everyone to remember that this is a shared 
responsibility and words like fully do not enter into the 
conversation, into the dialogue, and should not be part of the 
rhetoric. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What should be part of the debate is the important steps taken 
by the federal authority starting from the interim report of 
Krever to move immediately and forcefully on all aspects of the 
report that related to the federal responsibility to ensure that 
we have at the very beginning confidence in a blood supply that 
was to be as safe as any other in the world.  We started doing 
that a couple of years ago and have continued on that basis. That 
should be a priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should also ensure that the accountability is transparent and 
that everybody understands where it comes from.  I know members 
on the other side, even when they are prone to rhetoric in the 
House, which I imagine is the proper place for it, will not want 
to forget where the lines of responsibilities lay and will lie.

are more than rhetoric.  My remarks come from the heart, as I am 
sure his do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also take comfort from his remarks where he indicated that the 
government had involved the victims up to this point.  If that is 
the case, it certainly lends support to the fact that he will see 
fit to support our motion.  The motion simply calls for a further 
involvement of the victims by bringing them together at the table 
so they can have a say in their future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also the motion is very clear with respect to the fact that the 
meeting involve federal, provincial and territorial health 
ministers.  It will involve all parties as well.  I thank the 
hon. member for his comments.  I certainly urge him to support 
the motion because it will further underscore what he said about 
the involvement of the victims.

like to indicate that I will be sharing my time with the hon. 
member for Waterloo—Wellington. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the government, I wish to inform the House that it 
is our intention to support the motion introduced today by the 
party of the hon. member for Halifax. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Had I worded the motion myself perhaps I would have written it a 
little differently in the sense that I think I would have 
preferred wording which would have suggested that the 
representatives of the Hepatitis C Society of Canada be invited 
to a consultation or meeting immediately prior to the ministers' 
meeting in order to leave no ambiguity that the ministers may 
want to meet among themselves.  I think that is understood in the 
motion although it is not quite clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provincial ministers in any case would want it that way. 
However the motion is that we urge the government to press.  It 
is not definitive in any case.  In that regard we are prepared to 
support the motion in question. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to say a few words about the excellent work done so 
far by the hon. Minister of Health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague, the Minister of Health, has worked tirelessly on 
this issue and I can say that it is because of his efforts that 
there is an offer today for Canada's hepatitis C victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to offer him my full support and tell him that he 
has my personal support, as well as that of all my colleagues, I 
am sure, for the excellent work he has done to date. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know of the very caring nature of the Minister of Health and 
how he fought very hard for the package offered to the victims of 
hepatitis C.  We know a consensus was achieved which the minister 
supported and defended on the floor of the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a spirit of solidarity when ministers of health of 
different political stripes arrive at a consensus.  I am not 
saying what position he personally took to arrive at that 
consensus but that does not matter in a sense.  It is like a 
cabinet decision in the sense that once the consensus was 
achieved he defended it.  He did it valiantly.  He did it 
brilliantly.  He did a fantastic job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a situation before us today, notwithstanding the 
commitments repeated several times over, where some people are 
now gravitating away from that consensus.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore the Minister of Health indicated that he is willing to 
have a meeting with his counterparts at the provincial level and 
that meeting presumably will take place in the not too distant 
future.  He indicated his willingness to meet with 
representatives of the Hepatitis C Society of Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should add that the Minister of Health told me that he met 
with representatives of the hepatitis C victims group on a dozen 
or so occasions.  This in itself shows the very strong 
commitment by the Minister of Health to helping these 
individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In recent days, we have had many questions in the House from 
members across the way.  In some instances, we were told to cut 
health spending at the same time as we were told to come up with 
more money. 
This is typical of the Reform Party members.  They demand that 
the government cut transfer payments to the provinces, including 
those for health, slash aboriginal benefits, and so on, all the 
while claiming to be the defenders of the less fortunate.  The 
Canadian people do not believe a word of it. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, we had messages that were certainly 
contradictory when it is known that the provincial and 
federal arms of some of the other political parties were giving 
messages that were different. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Be that as it may, the members of the House have asked a number 
of questions on the floor of the House, as is their right.  I do 
not deny that.  I have been in opposition long enough to know 
that it was my right to ask questions when I was there.  I think 
I exercised it on a few occasions, if I can put it that way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today that is no longer the issue before us.  The issue before 
us is different.  It is one of identifying whether, as I raised 
moments ago, the consensus that existed and that was supported by 
all ministers still exists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In one case, we know there is some deviation.  Now that 
consensus is no longer the same, is there a need for a meeting of 
ministers?  It is our opinion that this would certainly serve a 
very useful purpose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When such a meeting is held should the Hepatitis C Society of 
Canada be invited?  Our position is yes, but we think the meeting 
would have to be held somewhat separately from the one that would 
follow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All ministers would have to arrive at a new consensus, if there 
is a new consensus.  I have no way of prejudging the result. 
Nevertheless, reading the motion in the broad sense as I think I 
am doing, giving the benefit of how it could be read, then we are 
prepared to support the motion in the name of the hon. member for 
Halifax. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will wrap up, because I know there are several members wishing 
to speak today to this issue, which is a very important one for 
all of us.  There is not a single parliamentarian, I believe, 
who does not have hepatitis C victims in his or her riding, just 
as there are none without cancer or AIDS victims among those 
they represent.

that the necessary money is available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the meantime, I am pleased to repeat what I said earlier, 
which is that the government intends to vote in favour of 
today's motion, in the hope that the discussions between the 
Minister of Health and his provincial counterparts will be very 
productive and that the meeting will take place in the near 
future.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
on behalf of the NDP which moved the motion we are debating 
today, we welcome the government's support for the motion.  We 
think this contributes to the progress we have been trying to 
make in the last few days on this issue by pressing yesterday for 
the minister to have a meeting, given the new circumstances, 
getting that commitment from the minister late yesterday 
afternoon so that we could then proceed to have a different 
motion before the House today from the one we had planned. 
Earlier we had intended a motion calling on the government to 
have such a meeting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We received the commitment that there would be such a meeting 
and then we went on to move a motion to help influence the nature 
and hopefully the outcome of that meeting by moving this motion 
that the representatives of the hepatitis C society be invited to 
any upcoming meeting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the government House leader has interpreted the motion 
correctly.  It certainly does not mean to preclude in any way 
that the federal, provincial and territorial ministers of health 
cannot meet on their own in the final analysis to determine 
whatever consensus we hope there will be for compensating all the 
victims of hepatitis C. It is very important that they do meet 
with the representatives of the hepatitis C society in that 
context so that the victims have a direct opportunity to put 
their case before the people who will be deciding any future 
arrangements for compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure that one of the people most happy about this in the 
House of Commons today is the Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Health because he will be saved any further embarrassment of 
having to stand in his place hour after hour avoiding answering 
questions as to how the government was going to respond to this 
motion.  I am sure he is greatly relieved and he will be able to 
sort of untwist himself from the various positions that he 
managed to take. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Mr. Speaker, let me start by 
congratulating the parliamentary secretary for all his hard work 
not only today in the House of Commons but every day and for the 
interest he has in the health of Canadians, on informing himself 
about all the issues involving health, on answering questions in 
the House, on his faithful attendance in the House of Commons, on 
his work generally here and in committees and even throughout the 
country as he assists the Minister of Health.  He has done a 
superb job.  I extend my congratulations to him as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the hon. member for Winnipeg—Transcona for clarifying 
the intention of his motion.  I think that is helpful. I am sure 
everyone duly noted the context in which the motion was made. 
This will certainly assist the ministers of health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to recognize one thing, however, even on the passage of 
this motion.  This would urge the government to press for this 
invitation and it is certainly our intention to do so once the 
motion is passed. But it does not say that the premiers would 
agree to it. That is a different matter. They will have to answer 
for themselves in that regard.

parliamentary secretary did give an interesting speech this 
morning which was not down the government line.  In fact, it was 
somewhat negative on this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if we could ask for unanimous support of the House for 
the parliamentary secretary to come back now and give a second 
speech where he can support the motion. He certainly did in the 
first one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I had previously thought 
this was a serious issue.  On our side of the House we still 
consider it a serious issue.  I hope other members consider it a 
serious issue.  Unfortunately it appears that one member does 
not. 
<P><A NAME="LINK61"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I rise in the House today to speak in favour of the motion 
presented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On March 27, 1998 the federal government, the provincial 
governments and the territorial governments announced financial 
acceptance and assistance to people infected with hepatitis C 
during the 1986 to 1990 period.  Yesterday the Government of 
Ontario offered compensation for pre-1986 individuals and is 
exploring possible legal avenues to require the federal 
government to meet the responsibility for its share of the total 
hepatitis C costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provinces, territories and the Red Cross were the operators 
of the blood system in the 1980s.  The provinces and territories 
are also responsible for the operation of their health insurance 
plans and the delivery of health care services.  The federal 
government is the regulator of the blood system.  This role has 
recently been confirmed and clarified by Justice Krever in his 
final report. In addition, the federal government has taken a 
leadership role in rebuilding what was clearly a flawed system by 
acting to ensure the emergence of new forms of governance in this 
area and new forms of risk management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, far from abandoning its responsibilities in the 
area of blood and blood system management, the federal government 
has taken a leadership role in negotiating the emergence of a new 
blood system with a new governance structure.  As part of this 
effort, the federal government felt a responsibility to turn its 
attention to the issues of the past. Following the release of the 
final report of the Krever commission, it took upon itself the 
role of leading the settlement of hepatitis C claims in the 1986 
to 1990 period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In doing so it moved to accelerate the settlement of claims from 
victims for this period and to smooth the transition for the new 
blood system. This government has been consistent, forward 
thinking and diligent in its efforts both to help victims and to 
reassure Canadians about the future of the blood system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In redesigning the system and in dealing with the issue of 
hepatitis C, the government has had the benefit of many 
conversations with consumer groups and others.  There has been 
extensive consumer involvement in both processes.  The Minister 
of Health has met on many occasions with representatives of 
groups such as the Canadian Haemophilia Society and the Hepatitis 
C Society of Canada.  These consultations have been a source of 
many new ideas.  Their importance has been recognized in the 
decision to involve consumer groups in the negotiated court 
approved settlement process announced on March 27.  As a 
government we will continue to do so in the interests of all 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to speak about the New Zealand experience.  New Zealand 
has a no fault accident compensation scheme.  It came into force 
in April 1994 and the relevant act was amended in 1982 and again 
in 1992.  Originally the scheme compensated for all injuries 
resulting from any accident without any regard to fault, 
including medical misadventure.  While original the no fault 
scheme was relatively generous, in 1992 it was changed. 
Amendments were introduced to exclude hepatitis C infections from 
the list of compensation events because it did not meet the 
standards established for medical accident or something that was 
severe within a period of mishap and therefore rare.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the same year changes in program administration led to lump 
sum awards being replaced by an independence allowance for 
non-financial losses of up to $38 Canadian per week tax free. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The New Zealand Hemophilia Society obtained an extension for 
hepatitis C claims until June 1995 but as of that date New 
Zealand's no fault scheme no longer covers hepatitis C 
infections. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I draw the attention of the House to the independence allowance 
cited above, in particular the $38 per week.  This is not a large 
amount of money.  No fault schemes like this one strike a balance 
between the range of conditions that can be factored into the 
scheme and the affordability of it.  In the evolution of New 
Zealand's scheme awards, though they cover a range of conditions 
they became small and common types of mishaps with gradual onset 
and chronic impacts like hepatitis C and have therefore as a 
result disappeared from that scheme.  We should perhaps take this 
history of New Zealand into account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Equity requires inclusiveness and inclusiveness limits 
affordability unless benefit levels are driven down to very low 
levels as in New Zealand's case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When equity is put aside and the focus is only on the specifics 
of a particular diagnosis, there is capacity to contemplate 
higher level awards as in the case of Ireland.  Sooner or later a 
scheme that runs on these grounds will face the challenge of its 
own internal inconsistencies, and there will be a tendency to 
drive out certain specific high cost conditions by redefining the 
basis on which the no fault scheme applies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of the day, unless policy and program are carefully 
designed, one is left with a no fault scheme that applies to 
severe and rare conditions and is characterized by benefit levels 
that are small marginal add-ons to income.  We need to note that 
is certainly most important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While Justice Krever documented these various scenarios in some 
detail, his report contains little analysis of the incentive 
structures around the world with both for cause and no fault 
schemes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada like most other countries has much more experience with 
for cause schemes than with no fault schemes.  While there are 
many calls to reform the justice system, the details of tort law 
are sufficiently worked out that courts can render justice when 
cause and effect are well defined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government and its partners in the March 27 
announcement placed relevance on just these processes to render 
justice in a very sensitive area.  As to no fault, there are 
serious and important issues of equity that will have to be 
addressed in this area before a sustainable scheme can even be 
possible.  Doing no fault on the fly is a recipe for disaster, I 
would suggest, especially in the medical area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even in New Zealand where it gave no fault a sustained effort, 
the problems have been numerous and the administrative 
difficulties immense over the years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Canada is to proceed down the no fault route it must be on 
the basis of a sustained debate about the merits of no fault in 
many areas and a careful analysis of the many implications that 
no fault carries.  We will not head up the blind alley New 
Zealand has travelled, at least I would hope not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today in New Zealand commentators are pointing ironically to 
Canada as an example of how things could have been done 
differently on hepatitis C.  Canada's leadership has been 
recognized abroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the most important parts of the national debate about 
blood has been the involvement of consumers in the process. Their 
input remains critical to the refinement of our policy. Ministers 
in this government, especially the Minister of Health, had 
extensive consultations with representatives of groups affected 
by the blood crisis, as did ministers in other jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The consumer perspective was an integral part of the process of 
negotiation and consumer representatives were apprised of 
developments throughout the process.  Representatives of groups 
such as the Canadian Hemophilia Society and the Hepatitis C 
Society of Canada met regularly with a variety of politicians and 
their views were fed into the process at various points.  This 
will continue.  It will be an integral part of the process and I 
support that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The blood system is ultimately about people, altruism and 
equity, not federal-provincial relations, not partisan politics, 
not political advantage.  As soon as we come to realize this we 
will all be better off.

with the hon. Leader of the Opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I rise today to speak in support of the NDP motion before us.  I 
must say I am very glad to hear government members will be 
allowed to support this motion.  It is about time the Liberal 
government did something positive for all hepatitis C victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the Canadians who contracted hep C from tainted blood and 
are now sick or dying what I say in the House are merely words, 
and as they will say they are not looking for words but actions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot possibly convey in the few short minutes I have here 
the pain, the suffering and the humiliation these victims have 
had to endure over the past some 20 years.  However I will read 
into the record a letter that speaks volumes, far more than 
anything I could say.  It is a letter from a victim's 
perspective.  This gentleman lives in my riding.  I met with him 
over the weekend.  I have had conversations and correspondence 
with him before that.  His name is Floyd Hubbard.  He wrote the 
following to me on Saturday: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I contracted hepatitis C through heart surgery in 1983.  I've 
been on Interferon for 7 months, which has caused me to have a 
heart attack.  My enzymes went down, but I've never been so sick 
in my life.  There were days when I thought I would die and days 
when I wished I would. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the medical treatment you (Liberals) say you'll help us 
get.  Well I for one don't want it again.  I had 15 years on 
vitamins and minerals and herbs, plus a changed diet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I had to choose treatment I would choose a naturopath, a 
masseuse, or to go swimming in a steam bath.  In other words, 
natural healing now if you're going to help us get this.  That is 
better than Interferon, the only treatment for Hep-C. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other day I asked my doctor if I could get him to fill out a 
form for my disability income tax credit.  He didn't think I was 
entitled to it.  I had to beg.  Do you know how this feels? Today 
it takes me hours to shower and dress.  I know I'll probably need 
a wheelchair soon as I am going downhill fast.  I was a capable 
husband.  Now I'm so sick my wife and I sleep in separate beds. 
No wonder there's so many marriage breakdowns. I was also a good 
father.  Now my children and grandchildren are afraid they'll 
give me their colds and viruses.  I hardly ever see them. This is 
a disease of loneliness, shame and isolation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had a good paying job, a 12-acre farm and a business.  It's 
all gone as a result of this disease.  What do I have left?  Not 
even my pride, you (Liberals) took that away on Terrible Tuesday 
when I watched the democratic vote that took place with the 
Liberals. We are led to believe we all have one vote; you, Mr. 
Prime Minister, took mine away from me.  I couldn't believe I 
live in Canada, “Glorious and Free”. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Hubbard is more than just one of thousands of Canadians who 
contracted the hep C virus through no fault of their own.  He has 
been victimized twice, first by a federally regulated agency that 
allowed poison blood to be pumped into his veins, and second by 
an uncaring and cruel government which refuses to accept 
responsibility for compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This past Friday and Saturday I probably went through one of the 
most difficult times in my short life as a parliamentarian.  I 
met with about two dozen other people who have been infected with 
this disease in a couple of meetings in my riding.  It was very 
difficult to sit and listen to what they have gone through and to 
realize how they felt about what happened on this day of shame 
last Tuesday in the House. 
The common theme in all of their talk is the hope that they would 
not be forgotten.

</I></B></P><P align=left>They said “Let us into the discussion.  Let us sit around the 
table with people who are making decisions concerning the 
well-being of our lives.  Let this not just be a deal that is 
struck by politicians.  Let us in”.  They said “Give us a 
compensation package for all.  If it is not for all then it 
should not be for any”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even people within the 1986 to 1990 window were telling me that 
they would not accept the compensation package unless it was 
given to all victims of the tainted blood scandal.  Then they 
said something else important that has not been injected into 
this debate heretofore.  They said “Compensation should be on 
the basis of wellness.  It should not just be a lump sum that is 
simply given to people who have hep C and then forget about us”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right across Canada, as in my riding of Nanaimo—Cowichan, there 
are many others in the same boat.  It has become to many of them 
an abandoned boat void of government compassion.  All this time 
we have seen Liberal members across the way hiding behind a rock 
of intransigence, failing to recognize that they need to do the 
right thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not dwell on this rock of cruelty.  The events of the 
last few days show us that perhaps the rock hard Liberal defence 
of stubbornness and stupidity is finally cracking.  With the 
provinces slowly coming on board, the last line of government 
rationale is turning out to be papier maché instead of rock solid 
reasoning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Though it appears government resolve in the matter is waning 
there are still signs that Liberal backbenchers are not permitted 
to think for themselves in this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take for instance what happened at the health committee 
this morning.  A few weeks back I requested through the clerk of 
the committee that health committee MPs, a non-partisan group of 
representative MPs from all parties, meet in order to invite the 
health minister to appear.  I want to personally extend my thanks 
to the NDP member for Winnipeg North Centre and the Reform 
members for Macleod and Wanuskewin in signing on to the 
initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was my belief that the meeting would have allowed for better 
questioning of the health minister concerning the hep C 
compensation issue, that perhaps we could finally get to the 
bottom of why this window is so narrow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened at the meeting this morning?  Did we get our 
answers?  No.  We got a repeat of last Tuesday's vote, only worse 
because not only are Liberals denying compensation for those 
outside the timeframe but now it seems they are unwilling to let 
the minister come to the committee to answer questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In effect, Liberal members decided to hide behind a rock of 
silence.  When it came down to the vote it was once again the 
solidarity of the opposition against the solidarity of government 
members, and the chairman had to cast the deciding vote because 
there was a tie. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am glad to hear that the members of the Liberal Party are to 
support the motion.  I am glad they have all been consulted on 
the matter ahead of time and that indeed they will all 
individually give the motion their support.  That will be quite a 
change from the day of shame last Tuesday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Beyond that the party across the way really needs to examine its 
commitment to accountability.  That is the bottom line issue. 
Indeed, how can they look their constituents in the eye and say 
to them they represent their point of view in parliament? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I will be voting in support of the NDP motion.  In 
this regard my actions in the matter will speak far louder than 
words. It is time to do the right thing and to vote to help all 
victims of hepatitis C contracted through the tainted blood 
scandal. 
Prove to Canadians that we are truly caring for them and that the 
Liberals across the way are truly the custodians of health care 
and not the undertakers for those left out of the government's 
compensation package.

withdraw the kinds of statements that cast aspersions on his 
colleagues in committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reed Elley:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am very glad for the hon. 
member's diatribe on the committee structure. Unfortunately, the 
very reason the motion had to be made in committee was that we on 
this side of the House did not feel we were getting the answers. 
We look upon the committee structure as the court of last resort 
for us so that we can finally get answers.  I reiterate that once 
again it was the Liberal majority up against the opposition, and 
the Liberals stonewalled it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK64"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Nunziata (York South—Weston, Ind.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, one thing is certain.  The new position of the 
Government of Canada is not a position it took willingly and 
freely.  It is a position the government has been shamed into. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been listening very closely to the parliamentary 
secretary and other members from the government side.  I listened 
very carefully to what the Minister of Health had to say 
yesterday following the decision of the Premier of Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have yet to hear the minister or the Government of Canada 
accept the principle that all innocent victims of hepatitis C 
ought to be compensated. I would like to ask the hon. member 
whether I am correct in stating that the government has yet to 
accept that principle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Health is now saying that he is prepared to 
attend a meeting of health ministers.  It seems to me that a 
prerequisite of having any credibility whatsoever in attending 
such a meeting is the admission, the understanding or the 
acceptance of the principle that all victims should be 
compensated, that all victims should have access to a 
compensation package. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reed Elley:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague 
for the question.  This is exactly why we wanted to open this 
question up at committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We wanted to get the minister in to ask him these hard 
questions.  We wanted to ask why there is this narrow window of 
1986 to 1990 when Justice Krever and other authorities on the 
subject have told us that hepatitis C was in the blood system 
prior to 1986.  In 1981 Dr. William Moore of the Red Cross 
laboratories told his own officials that he was concerned about 
hepatitis being in the blood supply. 
He said “Here is a test that has been used in other countries. 
Use it”.  They denied him that.  It was not used.

<A HREF="#LINKT33"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government cannot get away from the fact that the Minister 
of Health is the custodian of the country's health care system. 
He is the top regulator.  The minister has to take responsibility 
for it. Health ministers in those days could have taken 
responsibility for it, put a stop to it and we would not have 
this tragedy today.  That is where the liability lies.  They are 
not accepting it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK65"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I rise to support the motion before the House and to add 
my voice in urging other hon. members to do likewise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For weeks the issue of securing fair compensation for all the 
victims of tainted blood has been front and centre in the House. 
The health minister and the Prime Minister presented legal, 
financial and accounting arguments against expanding the 
compensation package, but weightier arguments based on the 
concepts of fairness, compassion and morality have also been 
presented with many of them being provided by the victims 
themselves. These arguments led to expanding the compensation 
package for victims of tainted blood.  We on this side of the 
House are pleased to finally see some small movement in this 
direction by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The principal objective of the official opposition in this whole 
exercise, and it is reflected in the NDP motion before the House, 
is simply to get fair compensation for all those who contracted 
hepatitis C as a result of defects in the federally regulated 
blood system.  The objective is not to drag the government down 
and thereby score political points.  The objective is to simply 
do the right, fair and compassionate thing for the victims of 
this tainted blood tragedy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Daniel Johnson, the former Liberal leader in Quebec, is to be 
commended for his initiative in raising this issue in a new way 
in the Quebec legislature.  Premier Harris of Ontario is to be 
particularly commended for his leadership in this matter.  Not 
only has Premier Harris declared that the compensation package 
should be renegotiated but he has also agreed to bring more money 
to the table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We feel therefore that the time has come for the federal 
government, in particular the Prime Minister himself, to start 
showing some real leadership on this issue and to drive it to a 
fair and compassionate resolution.  In our opinion the exercise 
of this leadership involves three things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First it involves the Prime Minister himself convening a 
national federal-provincial meeting in order to resolve this 
injustice.  We agree that the victims of tainted blood themselves 
should have input to this meeting, which is the thrust of the 
motion before us.  We also believe that this meeting should be 
convened by the Prime Minister because the federal health 
minister has lost all credibility on this issue. To coin a 
phrase, he has hit rock bottom. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, federal leadership on this matter should involve 
directing the Minister of Finance, who has been strangely silent 
throughout all of this, to develop a plan for financing the 
federal portion of an expanded compensation package by 
reallocating funds within the existing federal budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, in order for the federal-provincial meeting alluded to by 
this resolution to be successful, the federal government must 
clearly and publicly abandon three arguments which the health 
minister and the Prime Minister have been using over the past few 
months to fight any expansion of the compensation package. These 
arguments need to be identified and abandoned now because if the 
government continues to maintain and advocate them, the 
federal-provincial meeting envisioned by this resolution will not 
be successful. Let me be specific. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the Prime Minister must fully and frankly abandon the 
argument that there was no test available prior to 1986 to detect 
hepatitis C in the blood supply.  This is a false argument. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Justice Krever said clearly that such tests were available.  My 
colleague has already referred to Dr. Moore of the Canadian Red 
Cross national reference laboratory proposing a test to help 
screen donors for non-A and non-B hepatitis as early as May 1981 
and the New York Blood Centre was testing for hepatitis C in 
1982. 
The government must acknowledge that its 1986 line in the sand 
was drawn there primarily for political reasons which are simply 
not acceptable to the Canadian people.

<A HREF="#LINKT34"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the government must abandon the argument that 
compensating all victims of hepatitis C who contracted the 
disease through tainted blood will somehow open the floodgates to 
compensate everyone and anyone who becomes ill for whatever 
reason. This too is a fallacious argument. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one is asking the government to compensate everyone who 
becomes ill regardless of the circumstances or the causes.  What 
we are requesting is that the government compensate people who 
became ill as a result of proven government negligence, 
negligence established as a result of a thorough, objective, 
scientific and judicial inquiry by the Krever commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, the government must abandon the argument that somehow 
compensating all victims who contracted hepatitis C from tainted 
blood will be fiscally irresponsible. The official opposition 
finds this argument both hypocritical and false. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is hypocritical coming from Liberals who normally have no 
hesitancy about spending public money on anything, particularly 
when it is other people's money. It is also false because there 
is a way to increase the federal compensation for victims of 
tainted blood in a fiscally responsible manner.  There is a way 
to increase the federal compensation for victims of tainted blood 
without increasing total federal spending, or taxation, or 
unbalancing the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister should be directed to find the money, not 
through any spending or taxation increases but by reallocating 
resources within the existing spending limits. Possible sources 
of funding include the $7 billion in savings proposed by Reform 
to the finance committee during the budget, debate and the 
finance minister's so-called $3 billion contingency fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, the federal government should approach the 
funding of this expanded compensation package in exactly the same 
way that a Canadian family faced with an unanticipated family 
crisis would face the problem. If the family had no additional 
sources of revenue, the only way to cope with a crisis like this 
would be to reallocate funds, to take money from some other 
purpose and apply it to dealing with the crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is precisely what the federal government should do in this 
case.  If it needs help in applying the novel concept of fiscal 
responsibility within existing spending limits to this situation, 
the official opposition would be more than happy to offer that 
help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I want to pay tribute to all the victims of 
hepatitis C who have persisted in presenting their case.  They 
have persisted in the face of intransigence from the leader of 
our country, and the Minister of Health who is supposed to be the 
guardian of the health care system, and the intransigence of the 
government itself. These people are persistent despite their 
illness and lack of resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This resolution before us today acknowledges their persistence 
and gives them standing at the federal-provincial meeting. May I 
suggest that the greatest tribute we can pay to these people is 
not through resolutions, through speeches or through press 
releases but by simply doing the right thing.  In this case doing 
the right thing involves providing just and compassionate 
compensation for the effects which this terrible tragedy has had, 
is having and will continue to have on their lives and on their 
families.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, no one in this House has anything 
against acting to do the right thing.  I want to remind the 
Leader of the Opposition about what the right thing and the 
responsible thing is and what this government has done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the course of the last almost five years that he has been 
in this House, the Leader of the Opposition has had the 
opportunity to press the last government and the current 
government to act on this issue. I remind him and other members 
in this place that his voice was remarkably silent. 
Notwithstanding his silence, the Government of Canada through its 
health ministers acted swiftly on the recommendations of Krever.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, the current Minister of Health moved that his colleagues 
at the provincial and territorial levels recognize the ongoing 
issue needed to have their energies for a quick resolution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But he suggested it be done within the environment of parameters 
that all can accept, and the Leader of the Opposition says we 
have to do this on the basis of some fault or guilt we can find 
and it has to be done through an appropriate system, à la Krever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the Leader of the Opposition is aware that what he 
is telling all Canadians is that the judicial process which has 
worked in this country for so many decades is the exact process 
he is suggesting we use, and that he is not talking about 
compassion, he is talking about justice.  Will he decide for once 
to tell us exactly whether he is talking about compassion or 
whether he is talking about justice and fairness? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member has a 
pretty short memory, or perhaps we should say a selective memory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He might recall that during the period the Krever commission was 
carrying on it was the government that attempted to stonewall 
that commission.  It particularly endeavoured to prevent that 
commission from getting cabinet documents that might have 
implicated Liberal cabinet ministers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The period Krever was talking about, 1981 when the test was 
available, was when there was a Liberal government in power.  I 
suggest the official opposition has pressed this point during the 
Krever inquiry.  It was the government that resisted our 
inquiries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our view the government has not done the right thing in 
response to the member's question and no amount of apologizing 
after the fact, no amount of legal gobbledegook from either the 
minister or other members, no amount of spinning the story, no 
amount of trying to now appear to be on the side of the premiers 
when the government a week ago was castigating them in this very 
House as being opportunistic, callous and cynical; no amount of 
that type of thing will remove from the government's record the 
fact that it acted in this case not with compassion and not with 
justice but it acted in precisely the opposite fashion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK67"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime 
Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask the Leader 
of the Opposition a very simple question.  Out of respect for his 
position as Leader of the Opposition of Her Royal 
Majesty and at the same time out of humility, can the Leader of 
the Opposition acknowledge once and for all and say the right 
thing, that it was this Minister of Health who advanced 
this issue of compensation for the victims of hepatitis C in 
Canada by convening the ministers of health across the country to 
the table? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning:</B>  Mr. Speaker, to set the member 
straight on that question, it was the victims of hepatitis C 
themselves who advanced the case.  They did a far more effective 
job of it, far earlier than any politician on either side of the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was Justice Krever who advanced this case to the point where 
it simply could not be ignored by the government or stuffed under 
the table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The role that has been played by the Minister of Health in this 
issue has been that of a lawyer arguing the government's side of 
the case, not of a health minister whose primary concern is the 
health of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were arguments on one side of the issue.  There were 
arguments on the other side of the issue. The health minister, 
this lawyer in health minister's clothing, took the arguments on 
one side of the issue and consistently presented them in this 
House until he was knocked off that position by the provinces, 
the victims and the official opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Nunziata:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent 
to extend the time to ask the Leader of the Opposition a 
question. 
I notice that a good number of members were rising to ask the 
Leader of the Opposition questions and I would ask that the time 
be extended.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my 
time with the hon. member for Halton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>May I thank the hon. member for Palliser for introducing a 
constructive and helpful motion in a non-adversarial spirit.  I 
think the ultimate solutions to this issue will come in a spirit 
of co-operation that will include all members of the House.  I 
will have something to say on the content of the resolution 
shortly, but let me simply say in historical retrospect a good 
deal of present problems stem from the way in which this issue 
was first handled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have consistently in the past as an expert witness on 
constitutional affairs before numbers of federal parliamentary 
commissions and others argued against the use, even the abusive 
use, of royal commissions of inquiry on issues that properly can 
be handled by parliament and should be handled by parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the Mackenzie King ploy which is peculiar to Canada among 
all the common law countries that if you have a difficult problem 
you postpone the decision by setting up a royal commission, 
knowing that it will take a long time.  This is I think one of 
the problems.  When the Mulroney government made the decision to 
go to a royal commission I think it had enough facts to make a 
decision at that time.  All the social problems were known and I 
think it could have been handled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead we, in a very delayed way, handled in a forum not 
conducive to broader community solutions a problem that could 
have been handled otherwise.  As the United States supreme court 
has said, only limited aspects of social and community problems 
are seen through the narrow windows of litigation and legal 
processes.  I think this has been one of the problems in dealing 
with the hepatitis C crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is, however, one of the interesting paradoxes that the 
gentleman whose name has been so often cited on both sides of the 
House, with the impression in my mind that very few members have 
consulted his report and those who have may have been lost for 
the large continuing truths in the thicket of information that 
goes through so many volumes, is somewhat opposed to legalistic 
solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was a student of our greatest torts and delicts lawyers and 
Dean Cecil Wright of the University of Toronto.  Wright's basic 
solution for problems of this sort was to take it away from 
lawyers, take it away from legal processes, get into the larger 
area of community compensation in relation to social problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting that the first direct application of that 
thinking was in automobile insurance, take it away from the torts 
lawyers. You get a different aspect and a different approach. 
Horace Krever who was my colleague for four or five years has 
essentially reflected that approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A very perceptive editorial in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> today 
makes this comment, that he does come out in a way with a 
non-legal solution.  He looks at the issue and wants a solution 
that sees a problem as a community problem, not a one shot 
solution as such, but what do you do with people whose lives have 
been potentially shattered and in certain cases actually 
shattered. Is it not part of the community problem solving 
approach, the social security network, to be able to handle 
medical emergencies that arise, that have arisen in the past and 
that will surely arise again in the future in this period of new 
patent medicines so suddenly without full tests? Is it not better 
to handle it in that larger context? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the answer to that is yes, it is better handled in that 
context.  I rather regret that the Mulroney government did not 10 
or 12 years ago bring the parliamentary standing committee on 
health into the act.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The health committee in this parliament is one of our best 
committees.  We know its members work hard, are dedicated and do 
not travel much.  They do their work, and why not in this 
particular context. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the problems, however, in the interpretation of the 
Krever commission report as it has emerged has been to confine 
and fetter the solutions into the context of a lawyer's package, 
a financial legal settlement.  When the issues are before the 
courts, a great deal of this goes toward lawyer fees.  However, 
even outside the context of a legal settlement by lawyers before 
the courts, I think some questions are relevant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is generally assumed, by the way, that somebody is liable in 
this case.  I am not sure as a lawyer whether this is true other 
than the Red Cross, but I think this is the approach that 
distorts a solution along the broader lines I have suggested. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The arbitrary figure that has emerged of $60,000 per person is 
apparently, on the statistical evidence, unnecessary in a third 
of the cases, somewhat arbitrary in another third but totally 
inadequate, clearly, in at least a third of the cases we have 
been seeing. It will not meet more than a fraction of the burden, 
the disruption and destruction of the total life picture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think what we are looking for is a solution within the 
existing social security network.  People on this side of the 
House take great pride in it but we can recognize also the 
contribution from a provincial political leader of the hon. 
member for Palliser's party, the contribution made to a 
comprehensive social security network which not only includes 
health, medicare and pharmacare but family and disability 
insurance.  The basis for a proper solution is available within 
the existing governmental services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the motion from the hon. member for Palliser is 
constructive because in a certain way I do not think we have 
really heard what the hepatitis C victims really want in this 
particular issue.  We have been told that this is the solution 
asked for but I would have rather thought that we would get a 
more nuanced approach such as I have suggested if they were 
consulted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bringing the representatives into the health ministers' meeting 
is not for the federal government alone to make the decision. 
However, I am sure the other governments would agree that 
bringing them in is a way to enlightenment of how the problem is 
viewed and to producing a compensation that is not going to be 
lawyers' compensation but may go well beyond that in the sense 
that it is really making sure the victims can live out their 
lives decently with their families and dependants. We can bring 
it to a solution in this particular way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to the meeting taking place on this basis and to 
the responses made in that context.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Nunziata (York South—Weston, Ind.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it seems that a prerequisite of the government's having 
any credibility whatsoever in attending a conference of health 
ministers is that the government has to accept the principle that 
all individuals who contracted hepatitis C as a result of the 
blood system should be compensated and should have access to 
compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the member if he agrees now, in light of the 
fact that his minister has agreed to attend a meeting, that all 
victims ought to be compensated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the question 
from the hon. member.  The problem here I think is the meaning of 
the term compensation.  I spent a good deal of my time making the 
distinction between a lawyer's one shot compensation and a 
compensation within the larger community, social security 
network.  This would cover not merely victims of hepatitis C but 
all victims of unattended, unexpected medical disasters.  We have 
had them before with thalidomide and we are going to get them 
again in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that context, I believe the minister would be in agreement 
with him.

Vancouver Quadra, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Foreign Affairs.  He made some very thoughtful and insightful 
comments and observations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if he could answer this question.  I was particularly 
interested in his comment that the solution is in the existing 
social security network.  I wonder if he could go on and 
elaborate more about that in terms of what we as a government and 
indeed all Canadians should be looking for with respect to the 
solution being, in part, in the social security network. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for that very thoughtful question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has always seemed to me that the solution is not limited to 
medical treatment, or hospitalization, or pharmacare, or in-house 
treatment, which I would regard as necessary parts of the 
package.  When I spoke of the larger social security network I 
meant members of victims' families and their dependants.  Their 
lifestyle is dramatically changed, just as it is for those who 
have contracted the disease.  The fear is there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are getting into the area of human resources.  Part of a 
comprehensive solution must involve the ministry of Human 
Resources Development.  It must involve an expanded and an 
accelerated view of disability pensions.  It might involve an 
ombudsman being appointed to accelerate these cases and to get 
them through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need that sort of comprehensiveness.  It is in the social 
security network.  It may need extra shortfall funds in 
particular cases.  It certainly is not going to get into the $3 
billion expenditure that some people feared when the original 
announcements were made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we can get into that larger perspective we have a better 
solution than what has emerged so far in the debates in the 
House.

the mind of one province does not an agreement make.  The NDP 
Government of British Columbia has been steadfast in refusing to 
budge on this issue.  At this date we do not know what the 
chairman of the committee of ministers, the minister of health 
for Saskatchewan, is going to say in response to that change of 
mind by the province of Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our minister, in response to Ontario's change, has agreed to 
meet once again.  There are some very good reasons for that.  The 
fact is that the decision which was brought to this House was the 
decision of 13 provincial and territorial governments.  That 
message has got to be made very clearly.  When our Minister of 
Health was standing to defend that decision, he defended an 
agreement of 13 territorial and provincial governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the last five weeks there has been a disease in this 
House.  It is a disease called political opportunism.  That 
disease has some symptoms that are clear.  The first one is 
selective memory loss.  You forget part of the story and only 
tell half the story, and that becomes the case.  The second 
symptom is failure to recognize where responsibility really lies. 
The third is, in many cases, a complete reversal of party 
policies in order to exploit this tragedy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can tell you, Mr. Speaker, that had it not been for the 
Minister of Health this issue would never have reached the table.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George—Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  While the Liberal 
member opposite was delivering his speech he made an accusatory 
statement against the Reform Party in which he said that we were 
exploiting the victims of hepatitis C— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I think the hon. member is engaging 
in debate.  I did not hear the hon. member make any reference to 
any particular party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My recollection is that he was referring to the debate in the 
House in general.  I did not hear an accusation and I certainly 
suggest the hon. member is raising a point of debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Julian Reed:</B>  I am sorry my hon. friend feels so 
sensitive about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Harris:</B>  When you lie you really take offence to 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The hon. member for Prince 
George—Bulkley Valley knows that he should be prudent in his 
choice of words.  I know he is not making an accusation, but I 
invite him to think about his comments and avoid that kind of 
comment in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Julian Reed:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have been called worse by 
better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point out that my minister brought this issue to the table 
when the previous government wanted to cover it up.  It did not 
want him to do anything because it knew it would be contentious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At first the provinces and territories would not engage in a 
dialogue on any kind of compensation.  Finally the minister got 
them together and they agreed on the package that he came back to 
the House with, which he has defended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest that the Minister of Health who has been 
castigated in this place for the last five weeks is a hero for 
doing that.  He is a hero for taking a position of leadership 
that previous governments would not take. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The selective memory loss of the opposition is simply a refusal 
to acknowledge that there were other governments involved in the 
agreement.  There were 13 provinces and territories involved in 
those decisions.  When governments began to hang the minister out 
to dry, starting with the premier of the province of Quebec and 
spreading from there, it was—I wonder why I stop speaking when 
the hon. member interjects.  I really should keep going. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon:</B>  I would be lost for words defending 
Rock too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Julian Reed:</B>  I will never be lost for words defending 
someone who has shown the courage that the minister has shown 
over the last five weeks defending the government against the 
disease of political opportunism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spoke about the reversal of policy.  The Reform Party must 
bear the brunt of responsibility for its reversal of policy.  The 
Reform Party uses this issue to try to look good on health care 
because it knows that the Reform approach to Canada's health care 
system is not popular.  It is strange to see the Reform Party 
suddenly talking about compassion when the sum total of its 
policy over the years has been anything but compassion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where was the compassion when the Reform Party said it would cut 
$3.5 billion from social assistance programs?  Where was the 
compassion when it said it would cut $3 billion from old age 
security and $5 billion from the employment insurance program? 
Where was the compassion when it said it would cut $3 billion 
from equalization payments to Quebec, Saskatchewan and Manitoba? 
Where was the compassion when it said it would dismantle the 
Canada pension plan and eliminate benefits for both disabled and 
pregnant women on maternity leave?  I point out that the 
maintenance of the Canada pension plan— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The hon. member should be careful if 
he is rising on a point of order.  I think I heard words that 
were quite unparliamentary from him.  Maybe he is raising a point 
of order about his own comments.  I invite him to be very careful 
in his choice of language.

your warning and your advice.  I will follow that advice, but I 
want the record to show that I find it very offensive for this 
member to put out the words that he is putting out which are so 
far from the truth they cannot be accepted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I am sorry, but I think the hon.

is stating his view.  I know members may disagree with the view, 
but I think it is a matter of debate and not a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Julian Reed:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would point out that the 
maintenance of the Canada pension plan will be one of the means 
by which people who are too ill to work, who are totally 
incapacitated, will be assisted.  The Canada pension plan is 
there for those people.  As modest as it is, it is there for 
those people at any age. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party wanted to dismantle the Canada pension plan. 
We all know that.  Today the Canada pension plan is there for 
those victims of hepatitis C who have lost their ability to work. 
It is there as a backstop for all of them.  Reformers wanted to do 
away with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will be voting for the NDP motion this afternoon.  We support 
it.  The vote is certainly free, as far as I am concerned, 
because I am perfectly content to vote for the motion.

the provincial and territorial governments.  The responsibility 
rests with them to get together and to come to some decisions 
that will allow us to move forward on this issue.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, first of all let me say to the member who has just 
spoken that we appreciate further indication of Liberal support 
for our motion today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to raise with the member his comments about the concerns 
many on this side of the House have raised about the health 
minister and his actions over the past five weeks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want the member to know that we are not singling out the 
health minister's actions over the past five weeks as shameful. 
We have said shame on all members who voted against a policy last 
week calling for fair and full compensation.  We have said shame 
on government policy that actually set up a two tier system of 
benefits for hepatitis C victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have said shame on a government that has failed to recognize 
responsibility for regulatory failure, as happened in the past 
when it came to thalidomide and HIV. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the member if he and his colleagues are now 
prepared to take Justice Krever's recommendation seriously and 
take to the next federal, provincial and territorial ministers' 
meeting a proposal whereby they accept full responsibility for 
the failure of the blood system and look at the option presented 
by Justice Krever in terms of no fault insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Julian Reed:</B>  Mr. Speaker, as the hon. member knows 
the blood system and the processing of blood was in the hands of 
the provinces and the Red Cross.  There was responsibility there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to come to a successful conclusion on this issue every 
province and territory had to be included.  They are part of the 
answer and their unanimity is absolutely necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I share the feeling of concern for all victims.  There is not a 
member of this House who does not.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is if we are going to come to some successful agreement 
and conclusion on it, it has to involve not just the federal 
government by itself but also all of the provinces and 
territories.  Quite frankly in this case there is no other 
choice. 
<P><A NAME="LINK74"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George—Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is quite a chore to sit and listen to the hon. 
member across deliver, and I am trying to think of the word for 
it but I guess it was a diatribe on how the Liberal government 
and particularly his hero the Minister of Health were the ones 
that were the leaders in getting compensation for the hep C 
victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member forgot that the Minister of Health only obtained 
compensation for half of them.  What about the other half?  That 
has been the question in this House for the last two or three 
weeks.  What about the ones that were so conveniently forgotten 
by this disgraced Liberal health minister and his colleagues? We 
watched the Minister of Health sink deeper and deeper into the 
pit of disgrace and we wondered whether he would have the courage 
to show his head again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just the other day when the provincial governments were talking 
about how they wanted to take a second look at the forgotten hep 
C victims, the Minister of Health and the Prime Minister had the 
audacity to condemn the provincial health ministers for the 
compassion they were showing to the forgotten hep C victims. That 
was disgraceful.  The Minister of Health had the gall to label 
their compassion as the lowest form of cynicism. The actions by 
the Minister of Health and the Liberal Party toward these hep C 
victims is, in a word, reprehensible. They should be ashamed of 
themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Julian Reed:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we have just seen an 
example of the disease of selective memory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>About three minutes ago I finished an exchange with a member of 
the NDP and pointed out that there were 13 governments involved, 
the provinces and territories.  The Reform Party would dearly 
love to load all the responsibility on to a minister who 
courageously got the provinces and the territories together to 
work out some sort of agreement.  They came to an agreement and 
the minister defended that agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been some changes made in the minds of some of the 
provinces.  That has opened a window of opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Resuming debate.  The hon. member for 
Surrey Central. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I heard the speech from 
the member from the other side.  He was talking about where the 
compassion was.  He was asking a question of the official 
opposition during his speech.  I would like to ask the hon. 
member— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  You are on debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal:</B>  Mr. Speaker, no, I am not on a speech. 
I would like to ask a question of the hon. member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I am sorry, the time for questions 
and comments has expired.  We are at the point of resuming 
debate.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Nunziata (York South—Weston, Ind.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I assume I have 20 minutes to speak, if I could just 
confirm that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  As long as you are not sharing your time 
with another member of your party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Nunziata:</B>  I do not have another independent 
member to share it with so I will use the 20 minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I think it is time for a reality check.  The 
previous Liberal speaker was accusing opposition parties of a 
reversal of policy.  Mr. Speaker, I do not want to use the words 
hypocrite or hypocrisy because I know it might offend your 
parliamentary sensibilities, but we are talking about a party 
that has mastered the art of reversing its policies.

</I></B></P><P align=left>All I need mention is the GST.  It was a party that fought 
against the GST and a party that embraced it once it came to 
power.  It was a party that fought against free trade and then 
embraced it once it came to power.  Now it is a party that 
claimed the file was closed and barely 24 hours after making that 
assertion, all of a sudden the file is open.  When one speaks of 
a reversal of policy and when one is making that statement from 
the government benches, one ought to be looking in the mirror. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member went on to refer to the health minister as his hero. 
I am sure he ought to be aware of the phrase worshipping false 
idols. He said he was courageous and had it not been for the 
Minister of Health, there would not have been any compensation 
whatsoever, suggesting that the provincial health ministers had 
to be browbeaten into accepting the fact that $1.1 billion ought 
to be put on the table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that the Government of Canada through the health 
minister recognized legal liability. What the Minister of Health 
was agreeing to was not compassionate compensation; he was 
agreeing to damages.  He was accepting liability.  That was the 
major thrust of his submissions in the House week after week.  He 
was saying that there was liability, culpability between 1986 and 
1990 and for that reason he was making available damages or 
money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To suggest that it was the Minister of Health who led the way to 
provide compensation is pure nonsense.  He was simply recognizing 
that in a court of law the Government of Canada would have been 
found grossly negligent if not criminally negligent as a result 
of the tainted blood system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is time the Liberal backbenchers stopped 
regurgitating the talking points that have been provided to them 
by the Prime Minister's office and started using their own 
judgment and intelligence in making their arguments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that the right and just thing would have been to 
compensate or to provide compensation, to make it available to 
all those innocent victims who suffered as a result of tainted 
blood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member refers to a reversal of policy.  I would suggest that 
the spectacle we saw last week was a reversal of principle of the 
Liberal Party of Canada.  It is a party that has prided itself 
over the years as the party of justice, a party of fair play, a 
party of equity, a party that goes to bat for the disabled, the 
disadvantaged in our society, a party that goes to bat for the 
unemployed, goes to bat for the sick.  What we saw last week was 
a party that abandoned the sick and the dying in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Had it not been for the premier of the province of Ontario, had 
it not been for Mike Harris, the file would still be closed. Now 
the government and its members want to take credit for the fact 
that compensation will inevitably be made available to all who 
suffered as a result of the tainted blood system in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To this moment I have yet to hear a government member or the 
minister admit or accept the principle that all victims ought to 
be compensated.  We are still hearing this notion of culpability 
and fault.  They still have not accepted the fact that what is 
right and just is to make compensation available to all victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me if the government has any credibility at all it 
must accept as a prerequisite into walking into that meeting the 
principle that all victims ought to be compensated, that a 
compensation package should be made available for all victims. 
Unless and until the discredited Minister of Health or the 
discredited Prime Minister make that admission, the exercise they 
are about to embark upon will be nothing but a farce.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the arguments put forward by the government and the health 
minister as a basis for their position are now suspect.  How can 
the government pretend to have any credibility whatsoever?  After 
weeks and weeks of questioning, the minister has maintained that 
if compensation were available to all innocent victims it would 
bankrupt the health system in Canada.  They either believe it or 
they do not.  Yesterday they seemed to be embracing the opening 
made by the premier of Ontario.  In effect Premier Harris was 
saying that all victims ought to be compensated.  All of a sudden 
they have abandoned the argument that the health care system will 
be bankrupt as a result. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government and the health minister put forward another major 
argument, that if they compensate hepatitis C victims it would 
open the floodgates to all other individuals who become sick as a 
result of the health care system.  Once again that argument has 
been totally abandoned.  It seems that their credibility has been 
abandoned as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is critical that the meeting which is about to take place be 
an open meeting so Canadians can hear and see the arguments being 
put forward by the Government of Canada and the governments of 
each of the provinces and the territories.  For 10 men and women 
to lock themselves in the privacy of a room is undemocratic. 
There is no accountability.  That meeting of health ministers 
ought to be open in order to ensure there is integrity to the 
process. Canadians want to be able to see and hear the arguments 
being put forward by the federal health minister and the 
provincial health ministers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems that the motion put forward by the NDP will carry this 
afternoon and that the Hepatitis C Society of Canada will be 
present.  Not only should the Hepatitis C Society of Canada be 
permitted to attend the meeting, but all Canadians should have an 
opportunity to see what goes on at the meeting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the level of compensation, I would hope this 
government is not about to take away something that has already 
been provided to the victims between 1986 and 1990 in order to 
compensate those who contracted hepatitis C before 1986. To this 
day we do not know how the arbitrary figure of $1.1 billion was 
arrived at.  That dollar amount is on the table.  We do not know 
whether that amount is too generous or whether it is not enough. 
We do not know the arguments that led to the figure of $1.1 
billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we accept the position of the Government of Canada that there 
are an additional 40,000 to 60,000 victims who contracted 
hepatitis C prior to 1986, it seems that the entire package has 
to be improved threefold in order for it to be just and fair 
using the same principles or arguments that were used in coming 
up with the $1.1 billion figure.  If instead of 20,000 victims we 
now have 60,000 victims, then the compensation package ought to 
be $3.3 billion to be shared.  The lion's share ought to be borne 
by the Government of Canada because it was clearly the most 
responsible and the most negligent with respect to this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope when question period begins in a few minutes that the 
Minister of Health will agree that the figure that ought to be 
the starting point for negotiation ought to be $3.3 billion. 
Anything less than that will result in compensation dollars being 
taken away from those victims between 1986 and 1990. 
If they accept the principle that all victims should be treated 
equally, it seems to me that should be the starting point.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have another submission to make.  In listening to provincial 
premiers, provincial health ministers, the Prime Minister and the 
Minister of Health, it is almost as if there were two different 
sets of taxpayers in the country, provincial taxpayers and 
federal taxpayers.  There is only one taxpayer that pays both to 
the federal government and to the provincial government. Canadian 
taxpayers have said in overwhelming numbers that they support 
fair and just compensation to all victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of fighting interprovincial turf battles between the 
federal and provincial governments, surely both the federal and 
provincial governments ought to keep in mind that there is only 
one taxpayer and that taxpayers are prepared to compensate 
victims just as they were prepared, and rightly so, to compensate 
victims of the floods in Manitoba and the ice storms in Quebec 
and Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the Canadian way.  It is the right, just and 
compassionate thing to do.  It was not based on any negligence or 
any potential lawsuits with the Government of Canada named as a 
defendant.  It is because as Canadians we have earned an 
international reputation of being a compassionate people.  For 
that reason we send billions of dollars in foreign aid overseas 
to help others in the world who are destitute and hungry.  It is 
the right thing to do and the Canadian thing to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government was prepared to abandon its fellow 
Canadians, Canadians who are suffering terribly as a result of 
being poisoned by the blood system, Canadians who through no 
fault of their own will lead very difficult lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us put the matter in context.  I do not believe Canadians 
have yet to comprehend the magnitude of this tragedy.  Not only 
are we talking about tens of thousands of our fellow Canadians. 
The numbers range up to 60,000.  We are also dealing with their 
families and the devastation that this has caused to their loved 
ones, mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers, aunts and uncles. When 
we think of the magnitude of the tragedy, one in five will die as 
a result of being poisoned by the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hundreds of young Canadian children with lukemia went into 
hospitals and had their lukemia cured, only to find that they 
were poisoned by the blood system.  Their lives were put at risk 
because of a blood system that they trusted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a matter to be dealt with by the first ministers, the 
Prime Minister, the premiers and the leaders of the territories. 
This is an issue that is grave enough to be determined.  In terms 
of the health ministers, beginning with the Minister of Health in 
Ottawa and their credibility, Canadians do not trust them.  They 
do not believe them in terms of the positions they have taken, 
the arguments they have put forward and the rhetoric they have 
used. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This file ought to be taken over by the Prime Minister and the 
premiers to show the same leadership that Mike Harris has shown 
in Ontario, a man who is often vilified by Liberals opposite as a 
man lacking in compassion and understanding for disadvantaged 
people in society.  If only the Prime Minister and the Liberals 
opposite could show half the compassion and understanding that 
premier showed just a few days ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would conclude by saying that this meeting is about to take 
place.  It ought to be an open meeting so that we can see and 
hear firsthand the arguments being put forward by various levels 
of government. 
As a starting point the participants at this meeting have to 
agree that the compensation package on the table ought to be 
tripled to ensure the same level of compensation is available to 
all innocent victims.

question for my hon. friend.  It seems to me the Prime Minister 
has made two remarkable decisions in the last few weeks.  One was 
a remarkably callous decision based on legal doublespeak, and 
false legal doublespeak at that, not to compensate all hepatitis 
C victims but only the ones after 1986.  The second was a 
remarkably stubborn decision.  He was unable to admit that he was 
wrong in the decision on compensation, forcing his Liberal caucus 
to vote against their will in many cases against the Reform 
motion last week, to the extent that Gordon Gibson, who once 
worked in Mr. Trudeau's office and who is a long time Liberal, in 
his editorial this week spoke about the Prime Minister and his 
entourage and encapsulated them in one sentence:  “Little men, 
mean horizons.  But by God, they're in charge”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does my hon. friend not agree that what has happened is that the 
Liberals are now forced to wear this stinking carcass of this 
terrible decision?  They want to avoid the smell.  They are 
trying to get away from it.  Does he not agree that what is going 
on now is an exercise in damage control? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Nunziata:</B>  Mr. Speaker, regardless of what has 
happened and what may happen, one thing appears to be certain. 
Either as a result of being shamed into making the right decision 
or as a result of certain provincial governments recognizing that 
they were wrong at the outset, I believe we are on the path to a 
right and just decision with respect to this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of other concerns have been raised as a result of this 
issue.  In the 14 years I have been in parliament no other issue 
has torn members apart as this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It ought not to have been a confidence vote.  That is quite 
clear.  It was not a vote of confidence.  No one ever believed it 
to be a vote of confidence.  It was deemed to be a vote of 
confidence, only as a mechanism to coerce Liberal backbenchers 
into supporting the motion.  Could we imagine for a moment that, 
had the Reform motion carried, the Prime Minister would have 
walked down to visit the governor general to dissolve parliament? 
They would have gone into an election campaign and the theme 
would have been “We have abandoned the sick and the dying. The 
country is strong.  Vote for us”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is pure nonsense and everyone in the House knows it.  I 
hope that one of the other results of this debate is an 
accelerated push for parliamentary reform and more free votes in 
the House so that all members of parliament, especially when it 
comes to matters of conscience, are free to vote their conscience 
and not forced into toeing the party line.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
with close attention to the hon. member's speech.  There is one 
thing though that I would like to ask him about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is in fact, as far as I can tell, no evidence of how many 
real victims there are in this hepatitis C case.  We have numbers 
all the way from 6,000 to 60,000.  The government will choose to 
use the higher number to try to build an argument against it 
because of high cost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The numbers may in fact be a lot lower.  I was wondering whether 
the hon. member would care to comment on this point.  Perhaps, 
instead of talking about absolute numbers in terms of how much 
budgetary money should be available, we should simply set a 
principle that all should be treated equally and then find out 
how many there actually are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Nunziata:</B>  I suspect the government deliberately 
exaggerated the numbers to bolster its argument that the health 
care system would be bankrupt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conversation with Jeremy Beaty, head of the Hepatitis C 
Society of Canada, he too agrees that the numbers have been 
exaggerated. 
He believes the total number could be as low as 25,000 to 30,000 
Canadians.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me the government has not been forthright.  The 
government has not been honest with regard to the numbers because 
it simply wanted to, as I indicated, bolster its argument. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having made the argument now that 60,000 people were infected by 
the blood system, it seems to me that the level of compensation 
should be based on that number.  They came up with the figure of 
$1.1 billion and presumably the health minister agreed that was a 
fair amount.  I do not know how they picked that amount, not 
knowing the exact numbers and how they assessed every case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a lawyer, the Minister of Health ought to know that each case 
might in fact be treated differently in a court of law, depending 
on the extent of injury or harm caused to the individual.  We 
know that hepatitis C will affect people in different ways.  We 
know a certain percentage will die.  Others will lead relatively 
normal lives.  Fatigue may set in, extreme fatigue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A court when considering these matters and in setting the 
quantum of damages will determine the extent to which the 
individuals have been harmed as the result of negligence. 
<P><A NAME="LINK78"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (Charlotte, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want 
to ask the member what moral and intellectual leadership the 
present Minister of Health can bring to the table if and when the 
health ministers meet.  I think they have some positions which 
are completely untenable.  He has made some outrageous statements 
in the House, for example stating that the package could not be 
reopened because if it was it would bankrupt our treasuries.  In 
other words it would jeopardize health care in the country 
because we simply could not afford that package. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given that point of view, and the minister continues to support 
that point of view, what could constructively happen out of the 
meeting that is planned for the health ministers in the near 
future? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Nunziata:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I submit that it would be 
very difficult for the health minister to have any credibility 
whatsoever in attending these meetings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He has stated that the file is closed.  He has repeated day 
after day the arguments that the floodgates would open and that 
it would bankrupt the health care system in the country.  How 
could he conceivably attend a meeting of first ministers and have 
any credibility whatsoever after having stated those positions 
not only in the House of Commons but across the country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is to be any integrity to the process that is about to 
take place, first the process should be open so that all 
Canadians can see what is happening and, second, the current 
health minister ought not to be a participant at those hearings.

week the auditor general released his latest report on the 
government's financial statements and the finance minister and 
this government received a failing grade from the auditor general 
for the third year in a row. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why?  Because for the last three years the finance minister has 
cooked the books by retroactively allocating funds from the 
previous fiscal year to pay for upcoming spending programs. First 
came the HST buyout, then the innovation foundation and now the 
millennium scholarship foundation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the reason for this shoddy bookkeeping?  To keep 
Canadians from seeing a surplus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is the finance minister is afraid to show Canadians a 
surplus and afraid to show his own government members a surplus. 
He is conveniently delaying this debate of what to do with the 
surplus when he should be giving Canadians what they deserve now, 
fair compensation for all hepatitis C victims and a millennium 
tax break now, in 1998.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday, under pressure from the premiers, the health 
minister finally started to change his position toward the 
victims of hepatitis C.  After weeks of belligerence and excuses 
the minister has finally started to sound a bit conciliatory. 
But he still did not answer one critical question, so I would 
like to put that question to the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the Prime Minister now agree that all those who contracted 
hepatitis C through government negligence should be compensated? 
<P><A NAME="LINK115"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, when the hon. member talks about negligence that is 
where the responsibility lies.  The provincial ministers and the 
federal ministers chose the date of January 1986 because, 
according to scientific data, it was at that time that the 
government of the day could have started to do more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the question is in relation to responsibility, that was 
exactly what the package was all about.  What the Leader of the 
Opposition is talking about are those victims who were infected 
when there was no legal responsibility for any of the 
governments. 
<P><A NAME="LINK116"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister is still a big part of a problem. 
Federal-provincial negotiations on this subject are going to get 
nowhere unless the Prime Minister accepts this principle.  The 
principle is that all victims of hepatitis C who contracted that 
disease through government negligence should be compensated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can we get a straight answer from the Prime Minister?  Does he 
or does he not accept that principle? 
<P><A NAME="LINK117"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the Leader of the Opposition talks about negligence. 
This is when you come to the conclusion that it started in 1986. 
Before that, if he claims there was negligence, that is fine. 
Let us find out when the negligence occurred.  According to what 
we know at this time, and in the view of all the ministers around 
the table at the time of the agreement, negligence started in 
1986. 
<P><A NAME="LINK118"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, we have had a whole judicial inquiry into this and 
Justice Krever answered this question by saying that there was a 
way to detect this disease in the blood supply as early as 1981 
and that these people became ill because of government 
negligence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The victims, the premiers, the Prime Minister's own backbenchers 
are asking him to accept this principle.  I ask him one more 
time, does he accept the principle that all the victims of 
hepatitis C who contracted it through government negligence 
should be compensated? 
<P><A NAME="LINK119"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, if the Leader of the Opposition can establish clearly 
when negligence started, he knows that we would take 
responsibility.  We said that we were responsible from 1986 
because we could have tested for the hepatitis C virus at that 
time.  But the government of the day did not use the tests that 
were available in 1986.  Apparently before 1986 there was no 
negligence because there was no way for the government to find 
out. 
<P><A NAME="LINK120"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, this sounds 
like some kind of courtroom argument.  This is the way the 
government has taken this from day one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This question is not that tough for the Prime Minister.  It is 
not tough at all.  I think we will ask it until he answers it 
directly.  Does he agree with the principle, yes or no, that all 
victims of hepatitis C from tainted blood should be compensated? 
That is the question.  Yes or no? 
<P><A NAME="LINK121"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I think that the critic should talk to his leader, 
because the leader was asking us about negligence.  We said that 
when there is negligence there is responsibility.  All the 
governments have agreed that negligence started in 1986, not 
before that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK122"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not 
think any of them have read the Krever report.  The minister 
himself said there were four volumes and there are only three. 
In the Krever report it says that the screening test was 
available to Canadian regulators as early as 1981.  What did they 
do with it?  They ignored the test. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will ask again, does the Prime Minister agree with the 
principle that every one of these victims who got hepatitis C 
from tainted blood should be compensated, yes or no?

saying that fault began in 1981, so compensation should start 
then.  In essence he is agreeing with us, he is just drawing the 
line at a different place.  The member is saying that only after 
1981 victims should be compensated.  What about victims before 
1981?  Is the hon. member suggesting a two tier system for 
victims?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, over the last 
four years, federal transfer payments have been cut by 35% and 
frozen at $12.5 billion, and this does not take into account the 
additional $1.6 billion cost of paying for the treatment of 
hepatitis C victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the Prime Minister admit that no additional amount has been 
proposed to help share the costs of caring for hepatitis C 
victims, costs that the provinces will have to shoulder alone, 
and that the government is a bit quick to wash its hands of the 
matter? 
<P><A NAME="LINK125"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the federal government's responsibility with respect to transfer 
payments to the provinces is that programs for health, 
university and welfare are funded through the annual payments 
sent to them by the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the member says that the provinces are footing the whole 
bill, this is not the case, because the federal government is 
paying a very large portion of this amount through transfer 
payments we make to them for this purpose, in addition to 
equalization payments. 
<P><A NAME="LINK126"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, hepatitis C is 
a very special problem that requires a special solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The costs of compensation were shared because there is a shared 
responsibility.  When it comes to care, the provinces are on 
their own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the federal government not also responsible for sharing the 
costs of providing health care to hepatitis C victims? The 
federal government is getting off with a bill for only 30% of 
the costs. 
<P><A NAME="LINK127"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
health care for those suffering from this blood problem has been 
in existence for a long time. From the time they were infected, 
these people have been receiving treatment from the provincial 
governments, and in all cases the federal government is paying 
its traditional share, as I explained earlier. 
<P><A NAME="LINK128"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, according to 
Justice Krever, Ottawa bears the bulk of the responsibility in 
the hepatitis C affair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has the necessary funds for righting this 
wrong, because it has cut transfer payments to the provinces and 
is, when it comes down to it, footing only 30% of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the federal government continue to play this cat and 
mouse game with the provinces, when it is largely responsible 
for the problem, has the means to solve it, and is being called 
upon to do so by almost everyone? 
<P><A NAME="LINK129"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, first 
of all, as the Prime Minister has said, through the transfer 
payments we share in the costs of the health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, and a very important point, the hon. member needs to 
keep in mind that Justice Krever recommended that a victim 
compensation system be set up by the provinces. 
<P><A NAME="LINK130"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, while the 
Liberal MPs are looking for ways to spend the unexpected $4 
billion surplus, is it not obscene that the Minister of Health 
wants to add to the provinces' burden, when they are having a 
hard time maintaining the quality of health care, precisely 
because of federal cuts? 
<P><A NAME="LINK131"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as the 
Prime Minister has already said, every year we transfer $12.5

this is for is the health care system. 
<P><A NAME="LINK132"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
encouraging to see that the ministers of health will sit down 
with representatives of the victims of hepatitis C. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also encouraging to see that the provinces will contribute 
to the compensation of all the victims.  However, to ensure that 
all the governments take part, the next move is up to the 
federal government.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as 
we have said, we had a very firm agreement with the provinces, 
which we honoured. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At least one province has decided to break the agreement and so 
we will have to sit down again to see what sort of consensus we 
can reach, because, for a health system to work in Canada, the 
same services must be available to all citizens in all 
provinces.

<P><A NAME="LINK134"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
upcoming health ministers' meetings with hepatitis C victims will 
only be a success if the federal government is prepared to put 
more money on the table.  Otherwise we will have two classes of 
victims and an unacceptable Balkanization of compensation, as the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Health admitted 
earlier today in debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the Prime Minister now prepared to put new cash on the table 
to extend fair compensation to all victims of hepatitis C? 
<P><A NAME="LINK135"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Saint-Maurice, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, we will stick with the provinces.  The leader of the 
Reform Party introduced a notion of responsibility when he talked 
about negligence.  Did negligence start in 1986 or in 1981?  What 
about the victims before that?  That would be a third category. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important for the ministers to meet as soon as 
possible.  I think there will be a meeting next week to look at 
all aspects.  In order to have a good system in Canada we have to 
work to find a consensus between the provincial governments and 
the federal government.  It is exactly what happened with the 
accord we have— 
<P><A NAME="LINK136"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (Charlotte, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, given the 
outrageous and extreme positions taken by the health minister— 
and I guess we know what those are—unless he is willing to 
swallow himself whole, what moral and intellectual leadership can 
the minister possibly bring to the table when he convenes with 
the health ministers from across this country to re-examine the 
hepatitis C issue? 
<P><A NAME="LINK137"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I guess the best way of responding to that kind of question is to 
remind the member and the opposition parties that had it not been 
for this government, under the leadership of the Prime Minister, 
there would not be a single victim with compensation of any kind.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Diane St-Jacques (Shefford, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Minister of 
Health said yesterday in an interview, and I quote “We must now 
consider what is in the public interest”.  I wonder whose

however, that he is prepared to take part in a special meeting 
with the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of provinces have in fact promised to ensure that the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Saint-Maurice, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

Last Friday they all said they were sticking to the deal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the ministers were on the phone with the minister of health 
of Saskatchewan.  After that, through a press release, the 
minister from Ontario said she was not speaking on behalf of the 
province because the premier of Ontario pulled the rug from under 
her.  That is one provincial government that decided it would not 
respect the deal.  That is why we are calling another meeting to 
develop a new consensus. 
<P><A NAME="LINK142"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the provincial government in Ontario offered a couple hundred 
million dollars.  I think that is pretty substantial. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The health minister has said that abandoning victims was the 
right thing to do.  He felt that for a solid month.  He put every 
single obstacle imaginable in front of these victims. 
As recently as last night the health minister said “the file was 
closed, honest to God” it was closed.  He closed his mind, he 
closed his heart and the victims know it.  They do not trust him.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the finance minister.  Recently in <I>Canadian 
Business</I> magazine there is a report which points out that this 
finance minister continues to discriminate against single income 
two parent families.  They pay 20% more in taxes. They have 6% 
less they can contribute to their RRSP.  There is no recognition 
of the value of their parental care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why will the minister not stop his discriminatory practices to 
these Canadian families? 
<P><A NAME="LINK161"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, surely the hon. member knows that there is a spousal 
credit already built into the system.  There are benefits 
provided through the income tax system for families where only 
one parent is working.  At the same time, my colleague the 
Minister of Human Resources Development put a second $850 million 
into the child tax benefit.  The purpose of that is to help those 
families with low incomes and children at home. 
<P><A NAME="LINK162"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in

institutionalized child care and nothing to stay at home parents.

benefit was doubled.  Another $850 million is going directly to 
families with low incomes and children.  That is the kind of 
thing we are going to continue to do.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We are asking about single income families, not low income 
families.  In the finance minister's recent budget he increased 
the child care credit by $2,000.  However it does not allow

this credit.  When is this grossly unfair system of taxation

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

those earning below $50,000 who had their income tax reduced, are 
not Canadian families?  The 400,000 Canadians struck from the tax 
rolls, are they not Canadian families?  The volume of residential 
building permits increased in March, up 12%.  Are they not houses 
that are being built for families?  Mortgage rates are down. Does 
that not benefit families?  Everything this government does has 
benefited Canadian families.  That is why there is so much

</I></B></P><P align=left>What the hon. member is asking for is no public debate, no

</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week, less than a month after mergers were announced by 
banks in the United States, the banking committee of Congress 
started public hearings quickly.  Meanwhile in this country the 
minister is hiding behind an unelected task force that has no 
mandate to look into these specific mergers or the 30,000 jobs 
that are to be lost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of that, will the minister at least agree to an

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Fred Mifflin (Minister of Veterans Affairs and Secretary

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today on a point of order with regard to an 
incident that occurred today at the Standing Committee on Health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The standing committee adopted a motion restricting members from 
introducing motions in the official language of choice contrary 
to the rules of this House and the Official Languages Act. While 
I voluntarily agreed to submit a motion with the committee in 
both languages, I am concerned with the committee formalizing 
this as a requirement in its procedures.

<A HREF="#LINKT60"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Standing Order 65 outlines the procedure for moving motions.  It 
states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>All motions shall be in writing...before being debated or put 
from the Chair....it shall be read in English and in French by 
the Speaker, if he or she be familiar with both languages; if 
not, the Speaker shall read the motion in one language and direct 
the Clerk of the Table to read it in the other— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Standing Order 116 states that in a standing committee the 
standing orders shall apply.  Standing Order 116 lists some 
exceptions such as the election of the Speaker, seconding of 
motions and times of speaking.  However moving motions in the 
official language of choice is not an exception.  Moving motions 
in either official language is a right granted to members by the 
authority of this House and by law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Subsection 4(1) of the Official Languages Act reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>English and French are the official languages of Parliament, and 
everyone has the right to use either of those languages in any 
debates and other proceedings of Parliament. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This subsection defines the rights of members of parliament to 
speak and submit documents in their language of choice in 
parliamentary proceedings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Commissioner of Official Languages in his report to 
parliament in 1996 recommended that “the Speaker of the House 
advise committee chairs, referring particularly to subsection 
4(1) of the Official Languages Act, that language should not be 
an obstacle to members of Parliament in the performance of their 
duties”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I would like to remind you of two important rulings 
with regard to committees and the standing orders of the House. 
On June 20, 1994 and November 7, 1996 the Speaker ruled: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>While it is a tradition of this House that committees are masters 
of their own proceedings, they cannot establish procedures which 
go beyond the powers conferred upon them by the House. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, the committee by adopting a procedure restricting 
members from introducing a motion in the official language of 
their choice has established a procedure which goes beyond the 
powers conferred upon it by the House.  This committee is in 
breach of the standing orders and the law. 
<P><A NAME="LINK221"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I would like to comment on a similar complaint that was referred 
to the Commissioner of Official Languages in February 1996 on 
this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that case a joint chairman of the Standing Committee on 
Official Languages refused to accept a motion that was introduced 
in English only.  The chair based his ruling on a resolution 
adopted by the committee requiring documents distributed to 
committee members be in both languages. The member complaining 
argued that this should not apply to motions. The Commissioner of 
Official Languages studied this case and concluded: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—the joint chair explained her decision solely on the basis that 
the motions were submitted in only one language....the joint 
chair referred only to the unilingual nature of the text 
submitted by the complainant. 
</UL></UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We find that by citing language as the only reason for not 
considering the complainant's motions, the joint chair's decision 
limited the complainant's right to perform his parliamentary 
duties in his own language and consequently was contrary to 
subsection 4(1) of the act. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my understanding that this very thing happened today in 
the Standing Committee on Health.  The committee made a decision 
that limited a member's right to perform his parliamentary duties 
in his own language. 
The Commissioner of Official Languages established members rights 
under the law.  I want to ensure that members rights are also 
protected under the law of parliament.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would argue that this grievance may go beyond a simple point 
of order and may very well be a breach of the member's 
parliamentary privilege in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I would urge you to do as the Commissioner of 
Official Languages has done and lay down the law to all committee 
chairmen on this issue in the House.  Language should not be an 
obstacle to members of parliament in the performance of their 
duties.  They should have the right to speak, the right to submit 
their documents in the language of their choice in parliamentary 
proceedings. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK222"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
listened attentively to the arguments presented by my colleagues 
in the Reform Party and I must say that they seem to be right, 
at first glance. Language must indeed not be an obstacle to 
performing one's duties as a parliamentarian.  Language must 
never constitute an obstacle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That said, however, certain practices have been established in 
certain committees and, according to what I have been told, the 
Standing Committee on Health has adopted a procedure which 
requires motions to be tabled a minimum of 48 hours in advance, 
precisely in order for them to be presented to the committee 
members in both official languages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My understanding of the facts is, therefore, the following: MPs 
who are on the membership of this committee are not in any way 
limited in their ability to perform their duties within the 
committee, because they may submit a motion in their language of 
choice.  They merely need to do so in sufficient time to enable 
all members of the committee to also perform their duties within 
the committee in a fully informed manner, by having the motion 
to be examined available to them in their language. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, I respectfully submit that my interpretation is that 
the rights of MPs on this committee have not in any way been 
restricted by the procedure adopted by the committee, since any 
MP on the committee may indeed present a motion in his or her 
language of choice, but must do so in sufficient time to enable 
all members of the committee to also perform their duties within 
the committee in a fully informed manner, by having the motion 
to be examined available to them in their language also. 
<P><A NAME="LINK223"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would simply like to make what I 
think is an important point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House leader of the official opposition tells us that the 
presentation of documents from a third party should be handled 
in the same way as a motion from a member.  I think that there 
have traditionally been differences in the way the two are 
handled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recognize the point made by the hon. member for Esquimalt—Juan 
de Fuca, who said earlier that he wanted to present a motion in 
the language of his choice.  That is his own very particular 
issue.  But I do not think it is the same as presenting briefs 
from witnesses. 
If I draw a comparison with the House of Commons, a 
parliamentarian may present a motion in the language of his 
choice but, when he tables a document, the House equivalent of a 
brief, he may of course only do so if it is in both languages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My preliminary observation, therefore, is that the two 
situations are different.  One is regularly permitted in the 
House, and the other is not.  The Chair might perhaps wish to 
apply the practice in the House to parliamentary committees. 
That is what I wished to add.

<P><A NAME="LINK224"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, just 
to clarify.  Looking at the House leader's notes, he specifically 
talked about the decision of the official languages commissioner 
talking specifically about motions.  I believe the House leader 
on the government side is correct.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a difference between the submission of documents, which 
I would not argue about when there is adequate time to prepare 
them and to have them translated, and what we are dealing with 
today, which is the ability to place a motion.  A motion comes 
during the give and take of debate which is what we are 
specifically referring to today.  Specifically what the official 
languages commissioner was referring to is the ability to put 
forward motions.  I would not disagree with documents and so on, 
but because motions are usually given verbally, if you are 
unilingual you have no choice but to deliver the motion in either 
French or English, in the language you are accustomed to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  First, we are talking about motions, not 
briefs.  Generally speaking, we would like the committees to 
solve their own problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, it goes without saying that members of this House are 
free to operate in either of the official languages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to apprise myself of a little more information on this 
subject before I make a decision.  I will do that and then come

Minister gave in question period today to a question from the

poll which showed that 75% of Canadians thought the Reform Party 
was acting out of partisan motives rather than compassion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the Prime Minister to table the document from which

he was quoting from a particular document.  I do not know where

tabled in the House of Commons.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly there were members who were led to believe that the 
compensation package would be extended to all those who 
contracted hepatitis C as a result of the blood system.  On that 
basis they voted with the government.  They toed the party line 
and did as they were told.  However, much to their chagrin, 24

that sense we must look positively at the approach of the 
premier of Ontario who, in reversing his previous stance, has 
decided to put up to $200 million into the fund. 
That in itself has provoked the idea of a new meeting of the 
federal, provincial and territorial ministers.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Nunziata (York South—Weston, Ind.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I have listened very carefully to the debate today and 
to question period and I have yet to hear from any government 
member or from the minister whether they accept the fact that all 
those who contracted hepatitis C because of the blood system will 
be compensated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that is not the position of the Government of Canada, and it 
seems to me that it ought to be a prerequisite to attending any 
meeting of ministers, then why is it attending the meeting?  Why 
is the Minister of Health agreeing to go to the meeting?  Does he 
intend to go to the meeting with cap in hand? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mike Harris, the premier of the province of Ontario, was 
challenged to put up or shut up.  He put up, up to $200 million. 
I suppose it is now up to the Prime Minister to put up or shut 
up.  How much more money is the Government of Canada prepared to 
put into the package? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It keeps boasting about the $800 million that it has already put 
into the package.  We all know the reason the federal government 
agreed to pony up $800 million.  It is not because of a sense of 
compassion for the victims, it is because of legal liability. 
That was very clear listening to the Minister of Health, given 
his Bay Street background.  He was not writing the cheque because 
of compassion, he was writing the cheque because he knew that if 
the money was not put on the table the courts would have found in 
favour of the plaintiffs and the government would have been 
required to put up the money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the hon. member, for whom I have considerable respect, 
agree that the time has come to accept the principle that all 
those who contracted hepatitis C because of the blood system, 
through no fault of their own, ought to be compensated? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think the Prime 
Minister and the Minister of Health have made the position of the 
government extremely clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have said that a new development has occurred.  A 
provincial premier has changed the whole nature of the previous 
agreement by saying now that his province, Ontario, a large 
province, is prepared to contribute as much as $200 million 
toward seeking a new solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Health has confirmed that since this has 
happened a new reality has emerged which will lead to a new 
meeting of the ministers of health to look at a different 
consensus.  If a broader consensus emerges, especially in the 
light of the motion from the member for Palliser, which includes 
representatives from the Hepatitis C Society of Canada, all the 
better.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it has 
been brought to my attention today that there are victims who 
became infected after 1990 as well.  The government has said yes 
to those between 1986 and 1990.  It was not until today that I 
was informed from Ontario that there are those infected after 
1990. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prior to 1986 no one in Canada was allowed to bank their blood 
for their use.  They had no option at all.  They had to take what 
the government gave them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I pray the government is going to look after all victims prior 
to 1986 and after 1990.  I pray that is going to be addressed. 
Is that correct? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will repeat what I 
said before.  The government is looking at this motion today in a 
very positive way.  The fact that the federal Minister of Health 
has suggested a meeting of the ministers to look for a new 
consensus in light of the development in Ontario bodes well for 
the future.  The future will tell.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to speak after the interim leader of the 
Conservative party.  My remarks will address some of the concerns 
she raised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I read a letter that appeared in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> last 
Saturday which is relevant to this debate.  The headline is “Why 
the hepatitis C decision is correct”: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those who continue to argue for financial compensation for those 
who acquired hepatitis C through blood transfusions prior to 1986 
are advocating government compensation for what was at that time 
a known but unpreventable risk.  This is without precedent and 
could lead to endless requests for compensation from individuals 
who have experienced a wide variety of adverse effects of medical 
treatments for which there were no risk free alternatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that prior to 1986, the risk of post-transfusion 
non-A, non-B hepatitis was well established, but there was no 
way to reduce that risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Screening for hepatitis B had been in place since the early 
1970s, but post-transfusion hepatitis continued to occur.  This 
entity was called non-A, non-B hepatitis until 1989 when 
hepatitis C was first described. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This part of the letter is especially important: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1986 the United States and some European countries introduced 
surrogate testing of donated blood, whereby blood was tested for 
antibody to hepatitis B core antigen.  Donated blood with the 
presence of antibody to hepatitis B core antigen was not used. 
We now know that the use of surrogate tests would have prevented 
70 per cent of cases of transfusional hepatitis C.  It is for 
this reason that the federal and provincial governments are 
offering financial compensation for those infected from blood 
products between 1986 and 1990. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must not loose site of the fact that blood transfusion is 
often a life saving treatment and that many of those who acquired 
hepatitis C from transfusions prior to 1986 are alive today only 
because they received this blood.  Furthermore, the majority of 
individuals with chronic hepatitis C are asymptomatic and over 
two-thirds will never develop serious liver disease. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Public policy must be based on sound underlying principles. 
Compensation for preventable harm is a given, but financial 
compensation from the public purse for a known but unpreventable 
complication of medical treatment for one particular illness sets 
a dangerous precedent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must not allow our genuine concern for those who acquired 
hepatitis C from blood transfusions to obscure rational public 
policy.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This letter was signed by Stephen D. Shafran, MD, division of 
infectious diseases, department of medicine, University of 
Alberta. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of things that deserve our attention in this 
letter, not the least of them being that Dr. Shafran points out 
that between 1986 and 1990 there was good reason why the 
government should be held accountable.  It did not apply a 
screening process that was in use in the United States and in 
Europe. After 1990 obviously it applied it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very interesting that the Leader of the Opposition today 
starts talking in question period about compensating for 
negligence.  Until now the debate has been about compensating all 
victims regardless of government negligence, all victims who got 
hepatitis C from the blood supply regardless of whether the 
screening test was in place or whether it could have been in 
place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we are all quite agreed that compensation would be 
proper as long as there is recognized liability on the part of 
the government.  If that recognized liability goes back to 1981 
and it is agreed that it should go back to 1981 then it would be 
appropriate to compensate those people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I suggest that regardless of the meeting that is going 
to occur a little later this week it may be very difficult to 
argue that blood supply officials were negligent if they did not 
introduce a screening process not in use in the United States or 
in Europe until 1986. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, there is the dilemma. Is a medical agency 
negligent if it does not introduce a test as soon as it is 
available anywhere in the world?  I suggest there may be a 
problem there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The interim leader of the Conservative Party expressed concern 
about the people who acquired hepatitis C after 1990.  As she can 
see from this letter clearly, even with the test in place, it was 
not 100% successful.  Thirty per cent of the people who took 
blood products from the blood supply system, even after the test 
was in place, acquired hepatitis C. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a risk that existed and that risk was not as a result 
of negligence on the part of any government official.  The 
question then becomes is it then good public policy to award a 
cash payout. It is not compensation if there is no negligence. Is 
it good public policy to award a cash payout to anyone who gets 
sick as a result of some form of medical treatment? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A very dangerous precedent is in the process of being set if we 
decide to compensate those after 1990.  I note that the Leader of 
the Opposition did not suggest that.  He has changed his tune. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He has recognized that negligence is the only justifiable reason 
for compensation. He has avoided the whole issue of post-1990 
sufferers of hepatitis C. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we give money to people who become injured as a result of an 
unpreventable risk in the health system, where will it end? 
Hospitals now have the occurrence of super bugs.  Despite every 
effort on the part of hospitals, occasionally patients come into 
the hospital and get sick by infections that are basically hard 
to detect and difficult to control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What if a surgeon who is expert in his field, who is extremely 
competent and who has all the support imaginable, slips and a 
person gets injured, sick or even dies as a result of a 
non-negligence occurrence in the hospital? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are in danger of setting a very dangerous precedent.  The 
letter I read is from a person who is not a politician but an 
expert in the field of medicine and certainly should be accepted 
for knowing what he is talking about.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened carefully to the hon. member's comments and I 
have some concerns and questions.  I am very concerned that we 
are engaging in false debate on the issue of compensation for all 
victims. 
I would hope that on a day like today we could put to rest this 
notion that we are setting a dangerous precedent.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I call on the member to clearly distinguish between medical 
mishap and regulatory failure as is the case with hepatitis C and 
was the case with thalidomide and HIV for which the federal 
government took responsibility.  We are simply asking the 
government to do what is right and just and required under law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important for the member to acknowledge that we are 
not talking about a test that was suddenly being used in 1986 or 
only available in 1986.  Justice Krever is very clear about this 
test, surrogate test, the ALT test, being available well before 
1986. He mentions in his report that in 1982 the New York Blood 
Centre began routine ALT testing of all donations.  The head of 
the New York blood program actually said it is the only thing we 
have to identify donors who are at high risk of transmitting this 
type of disease. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The evidence is clear.  Testing was available.  It was a 
question of our regulatory authority, the federal minister and 
the department, applying the law and ensuring that a test was put 
in place.  They failed to do so, thereby putting the health and 
lives of many Canadians at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the member now prepared to look at the evidence at hand and 
recognize that it is a false argument to refer to the period of 
1986 to 1990 as the period of liability and to look at the 
negligence of the federal government for this whole issue because 
of the failure to carry out its responsibilities? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member obviously agrees 
entirely with the letter and my comments because she concurs that 
this is an issue of mishap.  If a mishap is deemed to have 
occurred even prior to 1986 then compensation is in order. 
However, there is considerable debate, as we see from the letter 
writer, whether an agency— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order. The member is clearly misrepresenting what I had just 
said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  With respect, that 
is not a point of order but a point of debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think the member was 
concerned that my reply was so excellent that she felt she had to 
interrupt it because she did not have a rebuttal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is considerable debate about whether an agency can be held 
as committing a mishap or having been negligent if a process 
appears in the medical community at a certain time and that 
agency does not implement it until other countries got involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no doubt that after 1986 we should have done it. Before 
1986 there is a doubt and if it is deemed by the appropriate 
authorities that a mishap has occurred before 1986, I think 
compensation is 100% in order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about after 1990 as raised by the interim leader of the 
Conservative Party?  Is she proposing that because there is no 
mishap after 1990 there should be no cash payout for any of those 
who acquired hepatitis C after 1990 and 30% of those who received 
the blood transfusions and were exposed to hepatitis C did 
acquire it?

member for Wentworth—Burlington will know that I have a fair bit 
of respect for him and for his work as a member of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Canadians go to a hospital and receive medical treatment 
they put a lot of faith and trust in the system, and the system 
failed them. It is clear the system failed as early as 1981.  The 
blood system failed Canadians.  I have not had the misfortune of 
having to be operated on and in need of a blood transfusion.  I 
would be horrified to think that might have happened to me or to 
somebody in my family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member not agree that the blood system really let 
Canadians down and they ought to be compensated going back to 
when that happened in 1981?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is simply between a 
mishap due to negligence or a mishap due to an act of God if you 
will.  If negligence can be proven prior to 1986 there is no 
doubt that compensation is in order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I submit to the hon. member that what we want to avoid is the 
type of situation which occurs in the United States where people 
sue a doctor or a hospital regardless of negligence.  As soon as 
the mishap occurs a lawsuit occurs.  We do not want that to 
happen in our system. After all, our system cannot be risk free. 
If we go to the hospital for any cure, we are going to run a 
certain amount of risk.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want 
to say a few words on this and share my time with a member from 
New Brunswick, if I may. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to see the government announce earlier today that 
it would be supporting this opposition day motion. Indeed it is 
rare in the House of Commons to have the government stand up and 
vote in favour of a motion of an opposition party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased we made some progress and that the government wants 
to at least bring to the table the representatives of the 
Hepatitis C Society when the minister meets with his provincial 
counterparts later on this week.  I maintain that is a step in a 
positive direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all remember last week after the vote took place in the House 
the minister went out and faced the television cameras.  He 
looked the camera lens in the eye and he said “The file is 
closed”. Thanks to the Canadian people, the file is not closed. 
The file is open and I think we are going to see several changes 
made in the original position of the federal minister and his 
provincial counterparts. That is a good thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to applaud public reaction, public pressure and public 
opinion for forcing the government to reopen the file.  It shows 
that the democratic system can work when there is concerted 
public pressure and public opinion.  When there is people power 
it can force a majority government to reopen the file and do 
something one day it said it was not going to do the previous 
week.  That is a very good and positive thing about how this 
institution sometimes can work on behalf of ordinary people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The logjam was broken when the premier of Ontario, Mike Harris, 
announced yesterday that his government would compensate all 
sufferers of hepatitis C in terms of the provincial amount of 
that compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important that we do not have two tiers of 
settlements and two tiers of health care in this country.  It is 
important that the federal minister take the leadership now, 
reopen the package and make sure that all people who suffer from 
hepatitis C are compensated in a fair, compassionate and just 
way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That should be done for a number of reasons. First of all the 
Canadian people have asked that we do it.  They have shown 
compassion.  There are past precedents for doing this. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The situation in the Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean two years ago comes to 
mind.  There was a great flood in this part of the province of 
Quebec.  The federal government provided support for the people 
of Lac-Saint-Jean.  The same was true in the case of the people of 
southern Manitoba.  I refer to the Red River, which flooded last 
year as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same was true for last January's ice storm, in which the 
provinces of Quebec, New Brunswick and Ontario, and the Ottawa 
region in particular, were hard hit. 
The federal government was compassionate and provided assistance 
to the disaster victims, as it has done on a number of occasions 
in this country. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was also the compensation for the victims of thalidomide 
and victims of HIV.  The thalidomide case took a long time before 
it wound through the courts, but again there was compensation for 
all the victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am saying here is that once again we have had a 
regulatory failure and the federal government should be willing 
to take the leadership in making sure that there is fair 
compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make one other point before I sit down and I think it 
is the most important one of all.  The federal government has the 
obligation to provide the lion's share of the compensation.  I 
say that for a couple of reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been massive cutbacks in social programs in terms of 
cutbacks from the federal government to the provinces in the last 
few years.  Last year there was a cutback of $6.5 billion in 
transfers from the federal government to the provinces. 
That cutback is in effect this year and next year, $6.5 billion 
each and every year.  That is less money for the provinces for 
health care and education and welfare programs that would have 
been there had it not been for the Minister of Finance cutting 
back in a cold and callous way in his budget a year or so ago.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of that the federal government has an obligation to fund 
the lion's share.  I am sure the hon. member from Mississauga 
would agree with that, to fund the lion's share of the 
compensation for hepatitis C victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of these cutbacks, the federal government has a surplus 
of several billion dollars this year.  The federal government can 
afford to compensate the victims of hepatitis C. It has that 
surplus because it has been cutting back in transfers to the 
provinces, cutting back in Saskatchewan, Manitoba, the Atlantic 
provinces, Quebec, all the provinces. I maintain the government 
has an obligation to provide the funding for the compensation of 
the other victims. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the Government of Quebec, which said so last week. 
As did British Columbia and Ontario, before it changed its 
position and decided to compensate the victims in its own 
province. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The money is there for the victims of hepatitis C and the 
federal government should lead the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of funding, when medicare first became a reality in 
this country in 1967, there was an agreement that the federal 
government would fund 50% of the cost of health care in this 
country, 50 cents on the dollar.  What is it today?  Today the 
federal government pays not 50 cents on the dollar, but 13 cents 
on the dollar.  It has gone from 50 cents on the dollar to 13. 
That is a shameful record for the Liberal Party of Canada that 
once prided itself as being progressive and compassionate and 
forward thinking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact the father of the current Minister of Finance was the 
Minister of Health back in the 1960s when national medicare 
became a reality in this country after the provincial leadership 
of the CCF in Saskatchewan with Tommy Douglas and Premier Woodrow 
Lloyd. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say that is a shameful record and it is no wonder the member 
from Mississauga is now hanging his head in shame over that 
legacy of the Liberal Party.  The Liberals are much more 
conservative than Brian Mulroney and the Tories and the hon. 
member for Mississauga knows that.  That is why he is hanging his 
head in shame.  He does not dare get to his feet and respond to 
an argument of that sort because the figures speak for 
themselves: 1967, 50 cents on the dollar; 1997, 30 years later, 
13 cents on the dollar.  Mulroney would not have even dreamed of 
doing that, and that is exactly the legacy the Liberal Party has 
left Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the sufferers of hepatitis C want to see who the culprits 
are, they should look in the eyeballs of the Minister of Finance, 
the Prime Minister and the Minister of Health.  Those are the 
people who refuse to provide adequate funding to people who are 
suffering from a disease through no fault of their own, suffering 
from a disease because of the fault of regulators who allowed 
contaminated blood to go out into the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I make that appeal through you to the minister and 
the government across the way, that they start once again 
adequately funding the health care system in this country.  What 
a better place to start than to pay the lion's share, the 
overwhelming share of the cost to compensate these victims who

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Nunziata (York South—Weston, Ind.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, does the hon. member agree that this meeting of the 
health ministers that is about to take place ought to take place 
in a public fashion as opposed to the health ministers getting 
together behind closed doors? Does he not agree that Canadians 
and in particular victims of hepatitis C have a right to see who 
is showing true leadership, who in fact has genuine compassion 
when it comes to assisting those that are sick and disabled? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased that it appears the motion put forward by his 
colleague will carry later on this afternoon.  It appears that 
the Liberal government will be supporting the motion.  Would the 
hon. member go one step further and agree that the meeting should 
be open to the media so that all Canadians can see exactly what 
is happening? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can the hon. member explain how in the first place $1.1 billion 
was put on the table? 
What mathematical calculation was used?  How was $1.1 billion 
arrived at?  Is it simply that amount divided by 22,000 or can he 
explain?  Is there any explanation as to how that amount was 
arrived at in the first place?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think the answer to 
the second question is that there was a lot of guesswork in 
coming to the $1.1 billion.  I do not think they know for sure 
how many victims they are going to compensate with that $1.1 
billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member knows the federal government is to pay $800 million 
of that and the provinces $300 million of that, and that division 
came of course because of negotiations.  But the $1.1 billion is 
just a guess, I assume, from what I have heard and may or may not 
be accurate.  Indeed that money will now have to be increased to 
compensate all victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to comment on the first part of what the member 
said.  I am pleased the House is going to support the motion 
today.  I think the House should also be saying to the ministers 
of health, let us televise those hearings.  Let us have those 
hearings in public.  We did that in some of the constitutional 
process which led to Charlottetown, the member may recall. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no reason the hearings cannot be televised.  The 
victims of hepatitis C could see exactly where every minister 
stands, where every province stands, where the federal government 
stands.  Just as important, the Canadian people could see the 
response of their governments.  Let us negotiate in public.  Let 
us have a transparent process.  Let us open up the democratic 
process in this country so we have more accountability and more 
visibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would certainly favour any motion anyone puts to that effect 
in the House.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague the member for 
Qu'Appelle for his very important comments on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In particular he clarified our position in light of the comments 
by the previous Liberal speaker, the member for 
Wentworth—Burlington, who has tried to blur the lines on this 
issue and to engage in false debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased the member for Qu'Appelle was clear about the fact 
that we are talking about federal regulatory failure for which 
this government has absolute responsibility, and medical mishap 
for which we have other processes in place to respond.  I 
appreciate the fact that he clarified that in our estimation 
blood injury as we are dealing with now is an injury arising from 
dereliction of duty of a very specific and unique nature 
pertaining very much to the federal government's role as 
regulator. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ask the member if it is not the case that the Food and 
Drugs Act was set up to provide minute to minute control of 
emergency health hazards.  Is it not the case that the federal 
government as regulator was and is the only body, the only 
organization in the blood system that could single-handedly cause 
a safety feature like the hepatitis C testing to be implemented 
in response to the very serious issues we are dealing with? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the answer is yes.  The 
buck stops where the buck stops.  According to the law in this 
country it stops with the federal regulators.  I think the member 
for Winnipeg North Centre has summed it up very well.

am pleased to rise to address this topic today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a new member of Parliament, I learn something new every day. 
Some days are very sad, when we see how the government treats 
people afflicted with hepatitis C. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I never thought that we would be debating for days and months 
simply to bring justice to people across the country who are 
sick.  We really have to ask ourselves where this country is at. 
We cannot always say we are proud of our country, because so 
long as we have governments like this one, there will be days we 
are ashamed of what it does.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member, I am embarrassed to admit my association with the 
House.  Canadians often do not make a distinction and lump us 
all together.  But I think it important today to clear that up 
and try to explain to those listening who the people are that 
are prepared to make this country's citizens suffer.  Obviously 
we are talking about the Liberals.  They are the ones who have 
made things difficult and are refusing to recognize that there 
are indeed people who are very ill and that some have even died. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They refuse to accept that they have a responsibility. 
Yet clearly they do.  That is why we are introducing another 
motion today to continue debate on this topic, in an attempt to 
obtain justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Often, those watching us on television wonder, during the 
debate, what the topic is.  For their benefit, I am going to 
read the motion: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House urge the government to press for the invitation 
of representatives of the Hepatitis C Society of Canada to the 
upcoming meeting of federal, provincial and territorial Health 
Ministers in order to provide advice on how to address the 
financial needs of all those who contracted Hepatitis C from the 
federally regulated blood system. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that the important thing to remember is that it was 
federally regulated. 
This means that the government has a very great responsibility 
in this matter.  We are facing a crisis today.  It is a crisis 
for those who are ill, for families who have lost loved ones, 
for children who are suffering.  We are here, in good health, 
debating on their behalf, but imagine the situation in which 
they find themselves today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are we introducing this motion today?  Because the initial 
agreement satisfied no one.  The victims were not at the 
bargaining table to present their arguments and set the record 
straight.  Nobody knows better than those living with hepatitis 
C what the illness is like.  Even those of us taking part in the 
debate today to obtain justice for them cannot put ourselves in 
their shoes.  We can only imagine what it is like, but it is 
very difficult. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we saw this week, some provinces—Quebec, Ontario, British 
Columbia and even Manitoba—found their heart at one point.  We 
must remember that, at one point, neither the provinces nor the 
federal government had a heart.  They had only wallets.  They 
had lost their hearts and were not looking beyond their 
billfolds.  At some point it is time to put away the wallet and 
see that justice is done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the problem in this country at the moment.  The federal 
government often has heart when issues concern the country's 
multimillionaires and the banks.  In such cases, the Minister of 
Finance has a heart, which goes out to the major corporations. 
I think it is time the Minister of Finance put his two feet flat 
on the ground and began to think about reality and the type of 
country he is creating today.  He is building a country we are 
not proud of, and it is time he stopped. 
It is time the people in this country—it is the voters who will 
do it—put a stop to current policies, whereby the rich get 
richer and the poor get poorer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are in opposition and we are doing the best we can.  We have 
not done too badly in the past month, either.  If we look how 
far we have come in this matter, we may be proud of ourselves. 
However, a number of Liberals must surely be hanging their heads 
pretty low, especially those who were elected on principles of 
defending the public and working on behalf of the poor.  These 
same people support the government one vote at a time.  Then 
they try to convince us that they voted according to their 
conscience.  It frightens me even more when I hear them say they 
voted according to their conscience.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week, I brought some students down with me, and when they 
saw what was going on last week, when the government forced all 
its MPs to vote the same way, they said that the one thing they 
had learned during the week was that there is no democracy in 
this country.  It is sad to see 16 or 17 year olds with such an 
attitude. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is even sadder is that they are right to think this way. 
The federal government is the main regulatory authority where 
blood and blood products are concerned. It is, in large part, 
the one at fault. 
The provinces are already assuming the health care costs of all 
victims, regardless of the date they received the tainted blood, 
at an estimated $80,000 each. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With all the cuts the provinces have suffered at the hands of 
the federal government, $3.5 billion, they are still going to 
give money to the victims.  They have already given $300 
million, or $85,000 per victim, and some provinces are already 
prepared to do more than that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our government often claims it has no money for this country's 
sick, elderly and poor, and that we ought to be finally 
understanding this, since the situation has gone on for a number 
of years.  On the other hand, the auditor general discovered a 
surplus of $2.5 billion, which was kept from the hepatitis C 
victims.  This is a sad state of affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I would like to say that today, at last, the 
government has decided to support our motion. 
I trust it will support it with its heart and is not just trying 
to redeem itself a bit in the eyes of the MPs it forced to vote 
against last week's motion.  I trust that they will support the 
motion with their heart and not for political reasons, for I see 
a big difference between the two.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a 
very difficult question for the member from New Brunswick. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with her statement, but I want to ask a question that I 
think is very important for those of us in small provinces like 
Saskatchewan or Manitoba.  The federal government cut social 
programs by $6.5 billion last year. I am thinking of health and 
education, among others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member comes from a small province, New Brunswick, with an 
unemployment rate, if memory serves, of close to 13% or 14% and 
budget problems up until last year, or the year before that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are annual cuts of $6.5 billion a big problem for a small

Is it a problem for her province's health system?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Angela Vautour:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is indeed difficult for a province like New Brunswick, which 
has a high rate of unemployment.  If we look at my riding alone, 
an unemployment rate of 14% would be good, but it is more like 
16%, 17% or 18%, and it keeps going up, while cuts to health 
care programs continue unabated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, the federal government cannot expect New Brunswick to 
come up with millions and millions of dollars.  It is just not 
going to happen.  That is why the responsibility must lie with 
the federal government. 
It is a federally regulated system and the federal government 
must assume its responsibilities and not shift the bulk of the 
responsibility onto the backs of the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the federal minister sits down with all provincial health 
ministers, he will have to take the situation of the rich 
provinces and the poor provinces into consideration, because not 
everyone has $200 million to throw into the pot.

<P><A NAME="LINK246"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
thank my colleague for her comments.  I re-emphasize what the 
member for Qu'Appelle mentioned regarding whether the province of 
New Brunswick would be able to come across with additional moneys 
if the federal government fails in its responsibility to 
compensate the victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Angela Vautour:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will repeat what I 
said.  If the government is expecting New Brunswick to find $200 
million overnight, it will not happen.  I have no doubt.  I know 
what kind of situation we are living in.  We must not forget that 
we have a Liberal government in New Brunswick which is doing as 
much damage as the federal government is doing.  It is not a nice 
scenario.  I do not see any improvement until at least the next 
provincial election. 
<P><A NAME="LINK247"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Nunziata (York South—Weston, Ind.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, Canadians still do not understand how the federal 
government and the provincial governments arrived at $1.1. 
billion.  There is a huge discrepancy in terms of the actual 
numbers of victims.  Somehow the federal government ended up 
putting $800 million on the table and the provinces $300 million. 
We do not know on what basis that formula was arrived at.  I 
remind the House that there is only one taxpayer in this country, 
Canadians from coast to coast.  They pay their taxes both to the 
provincial government and the federal government.  Canadians have 
made it clear they want all victims compensated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of the significant development yesterday where the 
premier of Ontario agreed to inject an additional $200 million 
into the compensation package, would the hon. member agree that 
in order to maintain any semblance of credibility the federal 
government has to come to the meeting not just with an open mind, 
not just with an open heart but also with an open wallet given 
the excellent fiscal situation the federal government finds 
itself in?  It tends to boast every day about how well— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Angela Vautour:</B>  Mr. Speaker, absolutely.  If the 
Minister of Health did not get the okay from the Minister of 
Finance there would be no need to sit down at the table.  We know 
he is the one running the show in this country.  There is money 
on the table from some provinces, at least one province.  I hope 
if he is going there to find a settlement for the neglected sick 
affected by hepatitis C, I suggest he just sit at home.  There is 
a need for money.  This is not a meeting where we will sit down 
and look at each other.  There has to be a serious discussion and 
a package out of this at the end.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have sat here day after day listening to attempts to make it 
seem like our government is working according to a purely legal 
approach, that it is just tossing people out on the street with 
nowhere to go for medical help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have observed that we have one of the very best health care 
systems in the world.  I am sick and tired of partisan 
opportunists trying to make it appear as though our government 
has no social safety net, like we are an uncaring society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is especially galling coming from the opposition party whose 
bluebook advocates the gutting of the Canadian medicare system. 
Also galling is the myth that they have helped propagate, that 
Canada is behind other countries in terms of how we are dealing 
with hepatitis C. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I stand here today to ensure that the truth is not hidden within 
the lines of political rhetoric and partisan excess.  Of course 
we have all heard of Ireland's approach to its own particular 
circumstances.  For partisan critics Ireland's program is the one 
they highlight, the one against which all comparisons are made. 
However this single example is not one which can really be 
compared to our own.  This is a different society with different 
structures, processes and pressures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ireland created a social program.  While I do not know the 
extent to which it underwent consultation and consideration in 
that country, I do know that the full implications have not been 
fully discussed in our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How else do we compare ourselves to Ireland?  Is its society so 
similar to our own?  Is it the same size?  Does it have the same 
democratic structure?  Does it have the same history?  Does our 
supreme court refer to Ireland to see what it has done on issues 
of law?  The answer is a definite no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When do we copy other countries' policies?  Should we adopt, for 
instance, the U.S. style of health care as advocated by the 
opposition parties?  Do we follow the human rights practices of 
other countries? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The answer to all of those questions is no.  At the same time we 
should look to see where practices that do fit our own 
circumstances might exist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we have to consider other countries then I suggest we should 
take a look at what other major industrial countries have done. 
By that I mean the G-7 or the G-8 as we now include Russia. Among 
these countries nobody has followed Ireland's approach, nobody. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at Italy which has only given some very limited help 
to hemophiliacs.  It has excluded everybody else. Can we really 
say the people abroad get the same kind of care we get here in 
Canada?  That is really where it ends.  Nobody else has even come 
close to providing the compensation offer that we are providing 
in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we should now make it a matter of record perhaps to 
compare it to some other countries.  What has Russia done? 
Nothing that we know of.  What has the United Kingdom done?  It 
has defended itself in court and it is defending itself in court 
without acknowledging any type of responsibility outside that 
court.  The same goes for France, Japan and Germany.  Germany is 
conducting all legal claims through the court system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there is the United States where we understand there are 
very few lawsuits.  Why is that?  That is because in 1986 it used 
surrogate testing on a national basis and we did not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today Canada has acted in a reasonable, responsible and clear 
way that even brought people into the picture who did not have 
lawsuits.  We did so because that fits our rationale.  Is that a 
purely legalistic approach?  Has anybody else in the G-8 done 
this?  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us go beyond those nations for the moment.  Let us go beyond 
those countries against which Canada is most frequently compared 
and look at New Zealand.  New Zealand does not compensate those 
with hepatitis C.  It used to but only through its no fault 
system for accidents. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1620"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT75"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now a large number of people have been left out by changes made 
in 1992.  Why did they make changes that restrict access to this 
deteriorating program?  They made them because New Zealand's no 
fault system is hurting as is its health care system.  Is this an 
example we really want to follow? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People with hepatitis C are now left out of that system.  They 
are suing their government.  Should we be following the path of a 
nation that might eventually be following ours?  Its newspapers 
report that Canada's approach might provide direction as to how 
it will deal with this problem.  We should not be copying New 
Zealand.  We should be learning from its experience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, there is Australia.  Australia has settled its 
litigation out of court.  We do not know exactly what has 
happened because there the agreement is secret.  What we do know 
is that it settled cases that came about because it failed to use 
surrogate tests.  This does sound awfully familiar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know it settled its cases without the Australian public 
knowing the conditions of the settlement.  We also know it did 
not include people who had no court claim.  It hedged its bets. 
Its rationale was purely legal.  That is the approach that fits 
its public environment, culture and history.  It suited its 
particular circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have gone beyond that.  Nobody can say that we took this 
legal approach because, as I said, our national approach to 
hepatitis C includes people who although they did not file a 
court case were affected at the same time as the rest.  They were 
affected during a time when Canada's blood system should have 
performed better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No other comparable country has included so many people as this 
country has.  No other country has been as responsible as we 
have.  That is the international record on this matter.  Canada 
is a leader in its approach.  It is not a blind follower. 
<P><A NAME="LINK249"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it does not 
matter what Canada has done.  Even though we are a leader it 
still is not enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has not been much mention about the territories and the 
the vastness of the space there.  There are a lot of people in 
both Yukon and Northwest Territories who have been affected by 
hepatitis C.  In Yukon there is one hospital and health care cuts 
have really hurt.  People who need to get from Old Crow into 
Whitehorse have to pay a $1,000 plane fare or try to find an ice 
road in the winter to get to the hospital.  If they need 
treatment that cannot be done in Yukon; they have to be flown to 
Vancouver. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of my constituents who has hepatitis C is not being 
compensated and is still struggling to work.  It cost her $15,000 
in lost wages to be able to go to Vancouver, which is a three day 
drive from Yukon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our health minister is saying that if we have a solid health 
care system in place these people will be taken care of.  They 
will not be taken care of because our health care has been 
dismantled by the Liberal Party.  The individuals who are sick 
and are struggling to keep working will not get the care they 
need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Aileen Carroll:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. opposition

</I></B></P><P align=left>The geography of the territories is such, and I know full well 
having visited there, that it is very difficult for anyone who is 
ill to cope with distance, time and conditions.  This does not 
change under this set of circumstances but is in play day in day 
out and a part of the geography and difficulties of that land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been a need to reduce transfer payments.  While that 
was done it was stopped at $11.2 billion and restored to $12 
billion.  There are many different causes for the changes that 
have come about, many by the provincial and territorial decisions 
that have been made when addressing their systems of delivery. 
There are choices in that regard in addition to coping with all 
we have had to do to put our books in order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not see anything particularly different in this set of 
circumstances other than what exists when relating to health care 
delivery in the territories.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I listened 
with incredulity to the hon. member comparing Canada to other 
countries.  Naturally she did not want to be compared to Ireland 
but she did want Canada to be compared to Russia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since we are talking about being compared to other countries, 
does the hon. member agree the actions the Prime Minister took in 
forcing his backbenchers to vote with the government, making this 
a confidence motion, which was a sham to begin with, and forcing 
the backbench to vote with the government undermined what little 
faith Canadians had in the House? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been laid bare for all to see.  There is no real 
democracy in this place.  There is no real opportunity.  These 
debates do not mean very much when at the end of the day the 
Prime Minister will crack the whip and tell his backbench how to 
vote.  They will jump and dance to his tune.  I would like the 
hon. member to respond to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Aileen Carroll:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will respond to the 
opposition member's inquiry with regard to the workings of 
government in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is frequently a difficult and onerous task to decision make. 
It falls upon the shoulders of government to do so.  That 
essentially is the difference between governing and sitting on 
the opposition side of the House.  We exhibit courage.  Many 
times we have to make decisions that are difficult to make. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do so knowing that we were chosen by the people of Canada to 
undertake that role, to be their government and to stand up for 
what we have to under extreme conditions.  That is why we have 
members across the House who are free to shoot from every 
conceivable corner on every different item from which they wish 
to shoot, having no responsibility whatsoever for their partisan 
excess.  That is the difference with governing.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> It is my duty, pursuant to 
Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the questions to be 
raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows: the 
hon. member for Winnipeg North Centre, Hepatitis C; the hon.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I too am happy to have the opportunity to put some comments on 
the record to perhaps challenge some of the misinformation and 
myths that have been coming from the opposite side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to start by saying that I came to a revelation this 
morning when I picked up the Toronto <I>Star</I> and read an 
article by Thomas Walkom.  Thomas is an editorial writer, an 
opinion writer for the <I>Star</I>.  I worked across the hall from 
him when I was at Queen's Park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I generally find him to be philosophically on the side of the 
left wing in the entire country, certainly provincially.  While I 
very seldom agreed with Mr. Walkom, I always respected his 
writing ability and his ability to see through what the issue was 
all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to share some thoughts.  We talk about the victims, the 
deal, that it is not good enough, that we should spend more and 
if we spend too much it will hurt health care.  We talk about all 
these different issues on all sides of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However I think Thomas Walkom really summed up what this debate 
and this issue are all about aside from crass politics and 
manipulation of some tragic victims.  He says “Most of all, it 
is about what societies are willing to do for all of those, not 
just hepatitis C victims, who suffer crippling illnesses”.  He 
goes on to say “If negligence alone is to be the criterion then 
federal health minister Allan Rock was on solid ground when he 
talked of limiting compensation to those victims infected between 
1986 and 1990”. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1630"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT77"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The theory, Thomas says, albeit it developed with the advantages 
of 20:20 hindsight, was that Canada erred in not following the 
U.S. lead, which I hear my U.S. supportive friends in the Reform 
Party talking about all the time.  He goes on to say that once 
Canada did start to test the liability ended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think this is really the debate that has to happen. Thomas 
Walkom says that what we should be talking about is a 
comprehensive public, no-fault, universal disability insurance 
helping those who for whatever reason find themselves levelled by 
any debilitating illness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That does not necessarily mean that we would simply support 
that.  If we think about the debate of that issue I suggest the 
costs of a complete no-fault health insurance disability plan 
would be quite astronomical, but we should debate it.  It should 
be a public debate, no question.  I hear members opposite saying 
that the negotiations that are about to take place over this 
issue should be held in public.  The member for York—South 
Weston says we should have it with the public.  That is a 
terrific idea because then we would know what people agreed to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion by the NDP is a good motion and.  It says that the 
House urge the government to press for the invitation of 
representatives of the hepatitis C society to be a part of the 
negotiations.  They would be witnesses.  That would be 
interesting if we had impartial witnesses at the last round of 
negotiations. We would know what the Minister of Health for the 
province of Quebec said at the table.  We would know what the 
minister of health, the Hon. Elizabeth Witmer, said.  I have 
great respect for her. I worked closely with her in the Ontario 
legislature.  We were both critics of the NDP government which 
was a rather easy job to do. I got to know Elizabeth and I have 
great respect for her. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it was on television, all the better.  We would know what was 
being said.  What do we have here?  We have a deal that would 
never have surfaced if not for the leadership of the federal 
Minister of Health.  The former minister of health for the 
province of Ontario, the hon. Jim Wilson, said see you in court. 
That was his response. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do members think Reform Party members would offer in terms 
of compensation?  Imagine their bleeding hearts?  I do not even 
know if they would go so far as to say see you in court. They 
would say let 'em eat cake.  That is exactly what they would say. 
We know what Reformers would offer as compassion if they had the 
responsibility to government this place.  It would be nothing. 
The hypocrisy that we have seen over this issue has no bounds. 
It is absolutely astounding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hear from members opposite that we should listen to the 
people.  I have talked to residents.  I have had a couple of 
calls.  I had about 400 calls on the seal hunt issue, but I have 
had a couple of calls on this issue from very seriously concerned 
people, some of them ill, some of them family members of people 
who are ill, some of them just trying to understand. When I 
return those calls they do understand the impact of a universal 
no-fault health care plan that would simply provide compensation 
for all victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I made a statement in the House a few months ago about Kyle 
Martin.  Kyle Martin was a five year old boy whose father took 
him to the emergency at Credit Valley hospital.  Kyle had a 
fever.  He was very uncomfortable.  They spent several hours in 
emergency until finally a doctor got around to seeing them.

<A HREF="#LINKT78"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members opposite would just blame the federal government for 
something like that, but in our province they have made choices. 
In fact, they have just recognized that they had made damaging 
choices because they poured more money back into the health care 
system for emergencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we want a universal health care system, let me tell members 
what would happen.  Kyle was diagnosed.  Once they got to look at 
him after several hours, they realized they had a serious crisis 
on their hands.  They ordered a helicopter to take him to the 
sick children's hospital.  Twenty-four hours later Kyle Martin 
was dead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I talked to his father.  Some members in this House, and I thank 
them publicly, have contributed to the Kyle Martin fund to help a 
doctor at the sick children's hospital in his research into 
streptococcus and what causes it and how it can be treated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is the message to the Martin family.  What do you say to a 
mother and father who have lost their five year old son?  Do we 
turn around and simply say federal taxpayers are going to 
compensate them for that loss?  Or do we say they have access to 
the courts, a right to sue and should sue the hospital and the 
attending physician and whomever their lawyers advise them to 
sue? A court case will occur, a decision will be rendered, and if 
they win there is insurance in place to cover that kind of thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we want to do is wipe out the court system entirely in this 
country and go to a broad based no-fault system.  I do not know 
who is going to pay for that.  I do not know how we are going to 
fund it and make it sustainable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think this motion should be supported and nobody needed to 
whip me to vote for the Minister of Health. Let me say that to 
the member for York South—Weston.  I wish I had another 10 
minutes to talk about that particular problem and how he likes to 
play politics with victims and games he plays like this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is nobody needed to whip me.  I support the Minister of 
Health in this.  He is the only politician who has shown true 
leadership from the start in this country.  Now that the 
provinces have come to their senses, we will go back and cut a 
deal that will be fair for all concerned. 
<P><A NAME="LINK252"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Nunziata (York South—Weston, Ind.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I could not help but 
chuckle when the hon. member puffed out his chest and said he was 
not whipped, he did the right thing.  Let him go back to his 
constituency in Ontario and I will challenge him to a public 
debate in his riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who was he representing when he stood up and he turned 
his back on the sick and the dying in this country?  Who 
was he representing?  The reality is he was just propping up his 
Minister of Health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He stands up and says that had it not been for the Minister of 
Health, earlier referred to by one of his colleagues as his hero, 
there would not have been money on the table.  He knows that the 
only reason the federal government ponied up money was the 
Minister of Health had a legal opinion that said if we do not 
compensate those victims between 1986 and 1990, we will be forced 
to do so by the courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the reality and I wish the hon. member would stop 
talking from his talking points and start looking at the reality. 
He knows the reality is that the only reason the money was there 
was legal liability.  It was not compensation based on 
compassion.  The minister was looking at legal liability and 
damages and what he tried to do was contain the damage. But 
having said that, he inflicted political damage on himself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only because the Conservative premier in the province of Ontario 
has agreed to come forward with an additional $200 million, now 
the minister and the member have had to swallow themselves whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I point out to the hon. 
member that this young lady happened to be delivering the talking 
points.  I did not even have them when I spoke. I was not 
referring to them.  I was speaking from here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting.  Every time somebody gets up and says 
something the hon. member from York South—Weston does not agree 
with, he rises with his chest puffed out, or maybe that is the 
normal size of it.  He rises in this place and challenges 
everyone in the House to a debate. 
I suspect it is because he has nothing else to do, being the 
leader, caucus, cabinet and entire representative of a party of 
one.  We do not need lectures from that member.  To use the 
analogy of a hockey team, he is one who would play on our hockey 
team and consistently shoot the puck into our own net. How long 
would he be kept on the ice?  How long would he even be allowed 
to sit on the bench?  He would be booted off and told to go have 
a nice day.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to ask a question of the hon. member across the way 
with his hockey analogies and what not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have really sunk low in the House when the Liberals are 
comparing our economic situation and our health system to that of 
Russia, a country that has gone through an economic and political 
meltdown. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals say we have the best health care system in the 
world.  Who are they kidding when they dare to compare it to 
Russia?  They say that our compensation on hep C is better than 
what the Russian people are getting.  What type of comparison is 
that?  That is stooping as low as they can go to draw an analogy 
between what Russia has done for hep C victims and what Canada 
can do for hep C victims.  The difference is we have not had an 
economic and political meltdown.  We have a budget surplus. These 
are things Russia could only dream of in decades. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, they had the audacity to talk about this not being a 
solution that the lawyers came up with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, as usual the Reform Party 
is about one speaker too late.  I think the hon member was 
referring to a former speaker's remarks.  I did not make any 
comment with regard to Russia.  But let me make a comment with 
regard to the Reform Party, the oh so pompous men and women of 
compassion who are going to solve all the problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where was the same Reform compassion when its members said they 
would cut $3.5 billion from social assistance, $3 billion from 
old age security and $5 billion from the employment insurance 
program?  Where was their compassion when they said they would 
cut $3 billion from provincial equalization payments and where 
was their compassion when they said they would dismantle the 
Canada pension plan and ignore the future of Canadians?  That is 
not a party of compassion.  That is a party that is misleading 
the Canadian people on this issue and many— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Resuming debate. 
<P><A NAME="LINK254"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
listened to the hon. members for Mississauga West and 
Barrie—Simcoe—Bradford who were referring to people in the 
opposition as opportunists. Actually we are fighting for those 
people who we feel within our hearts should be treated equally. 
Because we stand in the House and fight for those people who are 
not being treated equally I cannot believe anyone would say that 
all those who do that are opportunists.  Not in this case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the hon. member from the Reform Party just stated, some 
compared Canada with Russia or Germany.  I do not know if the 
hon. member has been to Germany, but I have been to Germany. I 
was invited there by the German government to look at 
unification.  I was asked to go to Romania as well.  Canada is 
known to be the best country in the world in which to live.  All 
those countries look to us and they would expect Canada to take a 
leadership role in treating our people equally. They would not 
expect to ever see Canada have a two tier system for people with 
hepatitis C. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can imagine that around the world people have been watching us 
and wondering what has happened to us. Talk about opportunists, 
when the Liberals were in opposition they fought the GST. 
They fought the free trade agreement.  They signed the NAFTA 
agreement so fast after they got elected that we could not even 
blink.  Talk about opportunists.  The opportunists are over there 
on the government side.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe there is anyone in this House who has not made 
some mistake in their life.  Once a person admits that they have 
made a mistake and correct it, they become much taller and more 
respected.  None of us is perfect.  The Liberals have made a 
mistake.  The Minister of Health has made a mistake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister told the provinces to put their money where 
their mouth is.  One province has already said “ We are going to 
put our money where our mouth is”, and that is the province of 
Ontario.  I want to thank the province of Ontario very much for 
taking the leadership role.  I give credit also to Mr. Johnson in 
Quebec.  At least he said that everyone should be equal.  Now Mr. 
Filmon is saying the same thing from out west.  Everyone should 
be equal.  I know some of them will have a difficult time finding 
the money at the provincial level, but somehow we have to come up 
with a formula that is equal for everyone, not just for those 
from 1986 to 1990. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say to the member from the NDP who brought forward 
this motion that, yes, we support the motion.  We thank him for 
the motion.  We do feel that representatives of the Hepatitis C 
Society of Canada should be at the meetings.  They are the ones 
who can discuss this and they are the ones who can bring forth 
points.  They can tell them it comes not just from the heart. 
They are the ones who are suffering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They should have been at the table the first round.  That is 
where they should have been.  I think if they had been at that 
table we would not be where we are at today.  We would not be 
having this kind of debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Minister of Health does have a heart—and sometimes I 
question it in this House—how could he look at those people with 
hepatitis C and say that we have a two tier system?  “Sorry, you 
got this in December 1985, but we are only going to look after 
people beginning January 1986”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was pleased to see the actions taken by the Government of 
Ontario yesterday which compelled the Minister of Health to 
reopen the file.  He said it was closed.  You will recall, Mr. 
Speaker, the minister did say “This file is closed.  We're not 
going to do another thing”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All along, all we have wanted on this side of the House is for 
him to do the right thing for the people who are sick through no 
fault of their own.  He refused, but he is saying now that he 
will open the file.  He will open the door, but we realize today 
in listening to government members that he is just going to open 
the door a crack.  He is not opening the door all the way.  I 
cannot believe it.  I am hearing members speak today and things 
are not changing in their minds.  One member got up and said it 
should still be just for those from 1986 to 1990.  The Liberals 
are still saying the same thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are going to continue to push the Minister of Health to start 
showing some real responsibility on this issue by committing to a 
deal that will include all of those innocent victims when he goes 
into this meeting with the provincial ministers and their 
territorial counterparts.  There are, according to him, 20,000 to 
40,000 Canadians left outside.  But our critic, the member for 
Charlotte, today said that no one knows the figure.  Some people 
say it is 6,000 people.  Some people say it is 10,000.  But the 
minister keeps saying it is 40,000 and it could be 60,000.  He 
has absolutely no idea how many Canadians have been left outside 
this compensation package, none whatsoever.  The government does 
not know how many. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague, the member for Charlotte, pointed out a couple of 
weeks ago that the Minister of Health admitted the government 
does not know, yet the Minister of Health still refers to 40,000 
to 60,000 people.

or her own blood for their own use.  The government says it has 
no responsibility, but the law of the land was that no one could 
bank their own blood for their own use.  People had to take 
whatever was given to them.  Therefore the government does have 
a responsibility and a big one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We on this side of the House, in my party, cannot support an 
unjust policy that would leave these people out in the cold 
because of reasons that do not hold up against the tests of 
compassion, fairness and justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not sit in this seat and try to be an opportunist.  I came 
here to fight for what is right for all Canadians from coast to 
coast and I will continue to do so.  I will continue to get up 
here, as will our critic and all of my colleagues in the PC 
Party, to fight for these people who, unfortunately, through the 
system we had in place became very ill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a great deal of respect for my colleagues on the 
government side and for a lot of other people, but I am surprised 
to hear them try to portray the image that what they were doing 
was right, fair and just.  It was not just, but we are going to 
fight to make sure that justice comes for all.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
out of all the members in this place, I want to say that the 
member for Saint John is one whose opinion I respect.  I believe 
her when she says she is here to fight for the things that she 
believes in.  I do not doubt her sincerity whatsoever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I would ask her if she would not mind making a call to 
the leader of the Ontario Conservative Party to suggest that the 
next time he makes a deal or sends his minister of health out to 
make a deal that he try to live by the deal.  Tell him that he 
should not sign a deal if he is not happy with it.  He should not 
come on board one day and make a deal and then go to a press 
conference and change everything.  It is not fair to anybody 
involved.  I am sure the member agrees with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have a great deal of 
respect for the member for Mississauga West, as well.  However, 
he and I were not in that room.  We did not hear what the 
Minister of Health put on the table.  We did not hear the 
discussion that took place between the provincial and territorial 
ministers of health and the federal Minister of Health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be very surprised if they were not told by the federal 
Minister of Health “This is the deal and this is the only deal 
that the federal government is going to enter into, and there 
will be no one compensated unless you enter into my deal”.  That 
is how I see the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as I am concerned, it was wrong.  If the premier of 
Ontario had enough compassion to stand up and say “What I have 
signed is wrong”, then I have to say he becomes the tallest

somehow in a cynical way using this issue to take political 
advantage of the Liberals, I think it has been very clear from 
the beginning that all the opposition parties gave the health 
minister and the Prime Minister an opportunity to back down, to 
back out, to change their position, to change their mind. 
However, they chose to ignore that.  They chose to draw a hard 
line in the sand and say “No, this is the way it is going to 
be”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the hon. member, is it not playing crass politics to 
start pointing fingers at the opposition now, saying that we are 
somehow playing politics with this horrendous situation where 
people trusted our blood supply and were poisoned as result?  Is 
this not crass politics on the part of the Liberal Party to be 
pointing fingers at the opposition when in fact it has had every 
opportunity to back down gracefully and it would not do so? 
Would the hon. member respond to that?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne:</B>  Yes, Mr. Speaker, I agree with the 
hon. member.  Certainly it is politics.  Talk about calling us 
opportunists.  I would have to say the opportunists sit on the 
government side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It really bothers me.  I do not think there has ever been a 
subject in this House of Commons that has bothered me more than 
this one.  Our job here as the opposition is to bring in checks 
and balances so that whatever is brought to the floor of the 
House by the government is what is best for Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case we are talking about people out there who are 
hurting because they are ill due to no fault of their own; no 
fault whatsoever.  If that is the only reply the government can 
give, pointing fingers at us and saying we are playing politics, 
I say thank God we are speaking out and thank God we are doing 
what is right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is because of what has been done here and what has been done 
in Ontario that this will finally be corrected.  It is because of 
what we have done on this side of the House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK257"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is most difficult to follow my illustrious leader in such a 
passionate debate on an issue that certainly exudes much passion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Mississauga West I hope would also pay me as much 
respect as he does my leader, for in fact the message that is 
brought by our caucus and by our party is the same message, one 
of fairness, equality and compassion for a group of individuals 
who through no fault of their own have found themselves in a very 
untenable situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue facing us is one of fairness and equality.  These are 
not faceless people who have been infected by hepatitis C.  These 
are our neighbours, our friends and, in some cases, our family. 
They are people who we walk beside on the street, people we sit 
beside in restaurants and people we work beside.  These are 
people who, through no fault of their own, received a tainted 
blood transfusion which came from an organization and a 
government that guaranteed the blood supply was safe.  However, 
that guarantee was not there and these people are suffering the 
consequences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was at the gas pumps in my constituency just last week when an 
individual walked up to me, knowing who I was, and introduced 
himself, saying that he was one of the victims who was infected 
by hepatitis C. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They come to us from all walks of life.  They come to us to tell 
us their stories, stories that wrench our hearts, if in fact 
there is any compassion in our hearts.  It has not been seen on 
the other side of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard excuses.  The Minister of Health has stood in this 
House for the last five weeks and extolled the excuses of 
government.  The Minister of Health said “I am sorry, there will 
be a cut-off date”, and that arbitrary cut-off date will be 
January 1, 1986.  Anybody before that arbitrary cut-off date is 
going to be thrown out like bathwater. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What would happen if it were your family, Mr. Speaker, or your 
friends who were infected in December 1985, one month prior to 
this arbitrary cut-off date?  Those individuals do not matter to 
this government.  Those individuals do no matter as Canadian 
citizens because they did not fall within that magic timeframe 
beginning January 1, 1986. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are instances of tainted blood causing hepatitis C after 
1990, but that does not matter because the arbitrary date of 1990 
that has been developed by the Minister of Health is the date 
that is going to stand for those individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That arbitrary date was struck by the Minister of Health.  Make 
no mistake about that.  His excuse is that there were tests that 
could have been used between the years of 1986 and 1990.  The 
government's position is an excuse and that is all it is. 
When the government sat down with the provinces to negotiate—and 
I use that term very loosely—this federal-provincial deal an 
arbitrary decision was made.  The Minister of Health stood in the 
House and said it was not about money. 
He stood here and said that the issue of compensation is not 
about money.  I would suggest that probably is not the complete 
truth.  The minister also stood here and said that it would 
bankrupt the health care system.  We cannot have it both ways. It 
is not about money.  It is about compassion.  It is about 
fairness.

<A HREF="#LINKT83"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my leader indicated, when they negotiated, had we been flies 
on the wall, I am sure the negotiation would have gone something 
like this: “We will put in <I>x</I> dollars and the provinces 
will put in <I>x</I> dollars.  If you do not like the deal we will 
remove our money from the federal side of the table”.  That is 
not negotiation, that is bullying.  When the provinces are 
bullied into signing a deal like that and then the government 
stands in the House and gives another excuse that the agreement 
was signed by all 10 provinces so it has to be a good deal, it 
does not have to be a good deal. It was bullying on behalf of the 
federal government because of money.  Make no mistake about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there is the other excuse.  There have only been a few of 
them and they have been parroted here for the last five weeks. 
The other excuse from the Minister of Health when he stood up was 
that it would jeopardize the universality of medicare as we know 
it in Canada.  Not true. The universality of medicare in Canada 
today as we know it, would continue even if and when a 
compensation package is extended to cover those individuals not 
covered under this particular package. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A precedent has already been set.  It is the 1991 settlement to 
victims who contracted HIV through the blood system.  Those 
individuals extended beyond that particular date.  It extended to 
anyone who was affected by HIV.  The precedent is there and our 
country's medicare system is still there and is still alive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are the excuses.  Let us talk about the real issues 
concerning hepatitis C.  The real issue is that the Minister of 
Health fears class action suits, as well he should.  There are 
class action suits which are filed now by a number of 
organizations.  The Minister of Health, Minister of Justice and 
the Minister of Finance will be hoisted by their own petards when 
those class action suits get to the courts because of the 
following reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the compensation and the class action suit is medically 
sound.  It is medically sound because we know that these people 
were infected by tainted blood.  It is a legally compelling 
argument.  I defy the government to defend an arbitrary date of 
January 1, 1986 from a class action suit.  It is not going to 
happen.  We know full well that the class action suit is going to 
be successful.  We know that it is financially sound.  The 
Minister of Health and the Minister of Finance could get together 
and put a fair compensation package together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should not do it but I will talk about some of those other 
areas of waste by the government in its first and second terms. I 
remember half a billion dollars at the stroke of a pen was wasted 
when the government decided it was not going to go with the 
EH-101s, but that was okay because that was political.  This is 
compassion.  That is not okay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there was the Pearson airport fiasco.  Somewhere in the 
area of $750 million was wasted by the government on that 
particular political issue.  But that was politics, that was 
okay.  When it comes to compassion, there is no $750 million for 
the victims of hepatitis C. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I talked about it not being a precedent.  This is not a 
precedent. We have had it in the past with those infected with 
HIV through the blood system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Politically transparent.  This is total transparent politically. 
We have a government that bullied the provinces into making a 
negotiated settlement.  We have a government that forced its 
members to vote against a motion that its members wanted to 
support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see constantly day in and day out in this House a Minister of 
Health who is unable to sell to his finance minister and his 
cabinet a package that should be sold.  He stands up and uses the 
excuse that 10 provinces have signed it so it must be good. He 
uses the excuse that the medicare system cannot support this type 
of compensation package. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Politically unsound. We see the reports now on how the 
government is being affected by this particular negotiated 
settlement. 
We see the transparency politically when now the provinces are 
coming out and saying that it is not a good deal negotiated with 
the federal government.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see the provinces.  In the province of Ontario we talk about 
Premier Harris walking tall.  He does walk tall.  Premier Filmon 
walks tall.  We see B.C. coming out now and saying that it is not 
a good deal, that it wants fairness and equity for everybody. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the minister and the government keep the tenet that this 
must be a good deal because 10 provinces have agreed to it?  Ten 
provinces did not agree to the government cutting transfer 
payments to the provinces. Not one province said that it was 
really happy to have its health care in transfer payments which 
were cut by this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did not see any member of the government front benches stand 
and say that it cannot be a good deal because no province likes 
it.  They stood up and said that they were going to do it anyway. 
They had the responsibility of leadership.  They had the 
responsibility to put in place a fair and equitable package for 
everybody.  They failed and they failed miserably.  They failed 
their leadership opportunity to stand up and do what was right. 
Even the majority of backbenchers on the government side want 
that fair package. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to see the government support this motion to have 
open negotiations with the provinces, to have the hepatitis C 
victims available so that they can make sure that the right and 
honourable decision is made at those reopened negotiations. 
<P><A NAME="LINK258"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime 
Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, what the hon. member should not 
forget is that the decision the government announced was the 
collective view of all the health ministers of all political 
colours.  That fact cannot be escaped from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From 1986 to 1990 it is my understanding that at the time, the 
position taken by all the provinces including those headed by 
Tory premiers was that throughout the compensation negotiations, 
compensation should be open only to victims who became infected 
through government inaction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the hon. member will be pleased to see progress, I should 
remind him that the member for Winnipeg North—St. Paul took up 
this issue as early as in 1990. At the time the Tory government 
did not move on the issue, although I must compliment it on the 
HIV compensation, which I also presented to the then Minister of 
Health in the Tory government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to recognize that the current Minister of Health was the 
first to advance the idea of compensation for patients with 
hepatitis C from the system.  He has succeeded certainly to a 
great extent. Certainly we have to address those people who have 
taken ill with hepatitis C even before 1986. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ministers of health from across the country will be meeting. 
Let us give them an opportunity to discuss the new plan. 
Hopefully it will address the very issues we all would like to 
have addressed, that is, to show that we look after those victims 
in a compassionate fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the comments 
of the member from Winnipeg.  I understand that the member was 
involved in 1993 on the health committee and in fact wrote a 
minority report suggesting that there should be a review of the 
blood supply.  We have that review.  We have the Krever report 
and the Krever report is not being followed by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Krever report specifically said that there should be 
compensation and it should be fair and equitable to all victims 
of hepatitis C.  You cannot have it both ways, one side of the 
government saying we should have the review on the Krever report 
and having another on the opposite side saying that it is the 
responsibility of the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not the responsibility of the provinces.  The 
responsibility lies with the federal government and the Minister 
of Health and no one else.  The Minister of Health has every 
right to provide leadership in this situation.  He stands there 
and hides behind the skirts of the provinces saying that when 
there are 10 provinces and a federal government negotiating the 
deal it has to be a good deal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Health and the government had every right and 
every honourable requirement to go out and do the right thing, to 
make this negotiated settlement fair for everybody.  Do not hide 
behind the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now the provinces are finally coming forward after the bullying 
tactics on a negotiated settlement and saying that what they have 
done is wrong.  If it is wrong, the government should live up to 
that responsibility.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I just 
received an interesting letter.  It is dated today and is from 
the premier of Ontario.  I would like to paraphrase a couple of 
the comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ontario is committed to treating pre 1986 victims on the same 
basis as 1986 to 1990 victims.  The premier says “I urge the 
federal government to make the same commitment”.  The letter is 
addressed to the Prime Minister of Canada.  “The Prime 
Minister's commitment will allow officials from both our 
governments to determine not whether but how to get assistance 
into the hands of Ontario victims as quickly as possible”.  He 
goes on to say that for the sake of the victims that is why the 
province is doing this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a very interesting and provocative letter. Does my 
colleague from the Tory party agree with the very interesting 
letter from the premier of Ontario? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I know that is a 
rhetorical question but I will give an answer regardless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Absolutely.  And remember it is the premier of a Conservative 
government in Ontario who in fact has shown that there is 
compassion.  I particularly like what Mr. Harris said with 
respect to the same commitment prior to 1986, this arbitrary 
line.  Anybody pre 1986 will be treated in the same fashion as 
anybody post 1986.  This is only fair and compassionate.  I 
congratulate Premier Harris for writing the letter to the Prime 
Minister.  I just hope that the Prime Minister will listen. 
<P><A NAME="LINK260"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Kitchener—Waterloo, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, in speaking in favour of the motion, if we get away from 
all the finger pointing and where the blame lies and if we step 
back and look at it, the process is working pretty well. It is 
working well because there is supposed to be opposition input in 
the process and we are having it.  It is working well because 
what happened in terms of the province of Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole thing would be a moot point if it was not for the 
Minister of Health who brought the file forward.  Whatever one 
might believe about the Minister of Health, the fact is he took 
the file forward, he got agreement with the provinces and now we 
are into debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I met with victims of the hepatitis C group in my riding as 
recently as last Friday.  I have been having a number of meetings 
with them.  We actually observed what was happening.  We were 
talking about how the developments of the past week were going to 
move the issue forward.  I believe that is happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When one votes on a matter of confidence, one votes confidence 
in one's government.  Of course our parliamentary system 
functions because there are votes of confidence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing in the system and certainly on this side of the House 
there is always the right of a member to try to change government 
decisions and government policy.  There are a fair number of 
people in the caucus on this side of the House who are into it. 
In all the discussions we have been having, I can only say that 
the people with whom I have been meeting over the weeks as to 
what we could be doing and should be doing, those people who are 
suffering from hepatitis C are getting a better deal because of 
what has transpired not just in this Chamber but what has also 
transpired in the province of Ontario.

forcing more and more students into severe debt.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite what we heard in the throne speech and the budget about 
increases in help for students, the stark reality for thousands 
of students is very severe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion attempts to rectify this injustice but also to 
highlight Liberal hypocrisy and to make the link explicit between 
the drive to privatize post-secondary education and the sense of 
an increased hopelessness that there is among students who are 
now graduating into unemployment and some even into poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should also be made clear that as the government retreats 
from its commitment and public funding of post-secondary 
education what is really going on in the country and what the 
Liberal government has allowed to happen is that the banks are 
moving in.  More and more students are forced to borrow more and 
more money directly from banks to fund their education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to be clear that banks are not publicly accountable 
organizations.  They have as their main interest a maximization 
of profit and certainly not the well-being of students.  Yet 
students are being left to the mercy of the big banks that are 
now involved in the Canada student loan program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The strategy on the part of the Liberals has eroded public 
funding for post-secondary education to the point where it is now 
completely within the private sector domain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the motion New Democrats are continuing to press the point 
and to pressure the government for the Liberals to recognize the 
extent and jeopardy students are now in with this debt crisis. 
We want the government to listen to what students are saying.  We 
want members of the House to defend public education and to say 
that we have to take much stronger measures to make sure there is 
not the severe student debt that we have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to Human Resources Development Canada, 45% of new jobs 
by the year 2000 will require post-secondary education.  This 
means that for many young people attending university or college 
it is not an option if they want to find work.  It is now simply 
a fact of life that if they want to have a better chance at 
finding employment they a need to have post-secondary education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think there is a member in the House who would disagree 
with that reality.  Despite this fact and that the Liberals say 
they are committed to youth, the Liberal government is continuing 
to throw barriers in the way of young people who are struggling 
to develop the skills and talents necessary to get ahead in a 
cut-throat global economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1995 the Liberal government has cut $1.5 billion from 
federal funding for post-secondary education in terms of 
transfers to the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the last 10 years tuition fees have climbed by 240%, one of 
of the steepest criteria increases in inflation.  Last year alone 
tuition fees rose by almost 12% nationally, increasing at a rate 
seven times the rate of inflation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Things are so severe in the country that it is probably shocking 
for most Canadians to learn that tuition fees in Canada have 
reached a national average of $3,100, which surpasses the average 
tuition fees at publicly funded universities in the United 
States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997 there are many surveys but the particular one done in 
the maritimes, a survey of high school students asking them why 
they were not going to university, indicated that 40% of the 
students responding said they were not going on to post-secondary 
education because they simply could not afford it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The average student debt is now $25,000.  That is up from 
$13,000 in 1993 when the Liberals took power.  Bankruptcies for 
students trying to pay off their loans are also at record levels, 
having increased by 700% since 1989. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently there are something like 130,000 who are in default, 
not because those students want to be in default, not because 
they do not want to pay back their Canada students loans but 
simply because the cost of post-secondary education has become so 
onerous and so severe, particularly for low income students, that 
more of our students are falling into default and falling into 
bankruptcy. 
The number of bankrupt graduates is now estimated to be 37,000. 
One missing payment determines default.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to look at the background of how this incredible, 
shocking situation has come about, particularly in light of what 
we heard in the budget that everything is glowing and doing well 
for students.  As we can see the facts present a very different 
kind of reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995 the Liberal government gave financial institutions much 
broader responsibility in the area of student financial 
assistance. Before that time student loans, even though they were 
assessed through banks, were fully guaranteed by the government. 
But at that critical time in 1995 the federal government ceased 
to guarantee students and, even worse, it paid 
the bank a 5% risk premium on all loans to participating lenders. 
It was the government's way of saying that students are not to be 
trusted and it was the government's way of saying that the banks 
can maximize their profits at the expense of students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result there is wide scale evidence that some banks are 
being incredibly over zealous in pursuing students who are either 
late in paying or who are incapable of paying their loans because 
they are on low income and they cannot find work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As soon as the student defaults their file is deferred to a 
collection agency which is charged with the task of harassing, 
degrading and browbeating a young person into submission. That is 
what our program has come to in terms of Canada student loans, a 
program of harassment and degradation of students who are simply 
trying to get through school. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regrettably in this last budget the Liberal government announced 
another giant leap toward privatization.  Very deep within the 
budget legislation currently in the committee is a clause which 
would give banks more power to refuse Canada student loans to 
individual students.  The clause allows the cabinet outside of 
the scrutiny of the House to determine which students do not 
deserve access to loans. The implications of this are staggering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is this the first step toward giving banks total control over 
eligibility guidelines?  How far are we away from banks being 
able to determine which areas of study have a better return than 
others, that is, how profitable is an education in arts?  I think 
there is growing information from student organizations about 
their concern around privatization and corporatization and this 
move toward the banks influencing criteria and circumstances in 
which students will now get loans is cause for great concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Student loans are not commercial loans, although 
they are increasingly being treated as such.  By handing student 
loans over to the banks the loans become potential revenue 
generators rather than social investments.  It means that students 
are forced to contend with very unreasonable rates.  In many cases 
there are students who are paying 11% to 12% interest on student 
loans, far above the prime rate.  Even though the banks will if 
they are pushed lower the rates, students are not necessarily 
informed of  this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very serious part of the privatization in that it 
forces individual students to deal with very bureaucratic banking 
structures that have no interest of the student at heart and a 
lot of students simply are not aware of their rights when they go 
through the banking system to know what they can access. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also a problem with the inflexibility of renegotiation. 
Many students who sincerely wish to repay their student loans are 
forced to default because the banks refuse to renegotiate when 
the borrower's financial situation changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bottom line is that the banks are unaccountable to the 
public. Banks and collection agencies can be very intimidating 
and when they deal with an individual, that individual has no 
sense of advocacy or resources to help them get through the 
system. When students are faced with this they have nowhere to 
turn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have many examples in my own riding and I know from having 
spoken with other members in the House that there are many other 
examples as well across Canada where students are actually 
harassed and intimidated by collection agencies.  I had one young 
woman in my riding who was a student and had a loan. 
For various circumstances, she had to go on social assistance. 
She is now being harassed by a collection agency for the 
repayment of her loan even though it is completely impractical 
and impossible for her to do so.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what the privatization of Canada's student loans has 
meant in a very real sense.  That is what it means when we have 
turned the power over to the banks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of privatization goes even further.  It is not just 
Canada student loans.  We are seeing increasingly a trend of CEOs 
and shareholders of Canada's biggest banks who already sit on the 
board of governors of many of Canada's universities and colleges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Privatizing student loans furthers their influence in shaping 
the direction of post-secondary education in this country.  The 
Canadian Federation of Students has done quite a lot of research 
on this matter to unmask corporate rule on campuses across the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Their document says that privatization is essentially the 
retreat of public funding as well as public ownership, control 
and regulation from the post-secondary education system to be 
replaced by private dollars, private ownership, private controls 
and no regulation of things such as tuition fees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They go on to say that corporatization is a term used to 
describe the influence of business interests in shaping many 
aspects of post-secondary education systems, including the 
setting of tuition fee levels, determining what gets taught in a 
course and by whom, which supplies get used for a course or 
program or which programs receive funding and which are cut. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We only have to look across Canada at post-secondary 
institutions such as Simon Fraser University, the University of 
Calgary, the University of Regina, the University of Toronto, 
McGill University or Concordia University to see this growing 
trend, a very alarming trend of increasing privatization and 
corporatization and an influence of these unaccountable 
organizations on the criteria, the courses the setting of fees in 
post-secondary education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question that trend and alarming increase is 
directly related to the retreat by the federal government of the 
public funding of our universities and colleges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In presenting this motion today, the NDP wants to be very clear 
that we stand staunchly in defence of and to protect our public 
education system.  We believe as New Democrats that we are not 
going to let the federal government forget about student debt and 
the student debt crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of creating scholarship programs, the millennium fund, 
which duplicate existing scholarship programs and do nothing to 
help students in need, we have repeatedly and we will continue to 
call on the federal government to take steps that would not defer 
student debt but reduce student debt.  We think the key way to do 
that is by increasing funding to post-secondary education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the time the millennium fund begins in the year 2000, $3.1 
billion will have been cut out from post-secondary education. The 
amount of funds in the millennium fund at about $250 million a 
year for 10 years will not even come close to compensating what 
we have lost as a result of Liberal government policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this motion today we are calling on the government to stand 
up for public education, to restore the funding to this year's 
cut of $550 million and, more than that, to follow the lead of a 
province like British Columbia which has been working hard to 
make post-secondary education more accessible by instituting a 
freeze on tuition fees as a first step to making education 
accessible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want this federal government to follow the lead of British 
Columbia and to say that post-secondary education is a priority, 
that it must be accessible and that education is not just a 
privilege for those who can afford it.  Post-secondary education 
is a right that has to be accessible to all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we in the NDP are calling for is a national grant program 
to assist first and second year students.  This must be done in 
consultation with the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we have had enough of the kind of unilateral actions we 
have seen in this House around post-secondary education. The 
millennium fund was introduced with absolutely no consultation 
with stakeholders, with provinces or anyone who has an interest 
in this matter. 
It was an arbitrary measure that was taken by the government with 
no consultation and no information provided.

<A HREF="#LINKT94"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that in establishing a national grant program it has 
to be done as part of a new federalism where the provinces are 
clearly involved in that.  The federal government must take the 
leadership to establish accessibility as a new national standard. 
The issue of accessibility must be tied to the funding that comes 
from the federal government and the funds that flow to provincial 
governments.  That is what needs to be done in Canada. That is 
what needs to be done by the Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we have seen in this last budget, we are going in exactly the 
opposite direction.  We have seen a gutting of funds for 
post-secondary education and we have seen more targeting toward 
individual students based on some the government deems have needs 
and others who are now left behind.  This is completely the wrong 
kind of approach. We need to restore confidence in the funding of 
those institutions so that institutions are not forced to 
increase tuition fees year after year and then we begin to see 
student debt go up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other measure we are putting forward in terms of the 
privatization of Canada student loans and what has taken place 
since 1995 is to establish a program of real service to students. 
In the human resource development committee we had 
representatives of student organizations come before us.  They 
told us story after story.  I know from my riding of Vancouver 
East that students have no resources or information to help them 
get through an incredible bureaucratic maze and through the banks 
around Canada student loans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If you live outside the Ottawa-Hull area and you have a problem 
with a Canada student loan your only resource is to call long 
distance to Hull, Quebec or go on the Internet.  The availability 
of local resources and local service to help students with their 
individual cases is non-existent. That is something that must be 
changed by stopping this privatization of Canada student loans 
and ensuring there is direct service through Human Resources 
Development Canada for Canada student loans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question that the millennium fund and the Canada 
student loan program could be easily administered through Human 
Resources Development Canada.  There is absolutely no objective 
reason why this program has to be privatized other than to 
provide more gravy and more profits to the banks which are now 
living off the misery of students in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the coming months the members of the New Democratic caucus 
will continue to work very hard with other members of the House 
and with student organizations and post-secondary education 
organizations to make sure that young people from low and middle 
income families do not have to mortgage their future to attend 
university or college. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are really fed up with the kind of hypocrisy that we have 
heard in the House where we are told repeatedly that this 
government is interested in the plight of young people, youth 
unemployment and student debt while we have seen measures 
introduced to increase the bankruptcy laws to make it more 
difficult for students to declare bankruptcy.  We are seeing the 
eligibility criteria change and student debt continuing to rise. 
We are committed to working against that and to bringing 
accountability to the government to ensure that there is adequate 
funding for post-secondary education.

opportunity to debate the motion brought forward by the hon. 
member for Vancouver East. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Debate on the hon. member's motion is timely.  Today the 
Minister of Human Resources Development tabled the government's 
response to the first report of the Standing Committee on Human 
Resources Development and the Status of Persons with 
Disabilities.  The response is entitled “Ensuring Opportunities: 
Access to Post-Secondary Education”.  It is a comprehensive 
document.  It addresses among other things many of the 
recommendations presented by the standing committee in its report 
last December. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The standing committee's report provided the government with 
very helpful advice. 
I am pleased that many of the committee's recommendations were 
incorporated and included in our February budget.  We are now in 
the process of working on their implementation.

<A HREF="#LINKT95"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada student loans program is a model of federal, 
provincial and territorial partnership.  We have been successful 
in reaching a consensus on the Canada student loans program 
policy through the diligent work of all stakeholders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have had personal experience since 1993 in helping many of the 
officials, as well as successive ministers on this really 
important issue, having travelled throughout the whole of Canada 
to every province and territory to engage students and their 
advocates, as well as some of their instructors and officials 
from institutions of higher learning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last November the first ever national stakeholders working 
session on student financial assistance brought together 
representatives of student groups, educational institutions, 
banks and credit unions, as well as representatives from the 
provinces and territories.  Working together we identified 
priorities and followed up with changes in the February 1998 
budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are continuing the process of improving the Canada student 
loans program by pursuing harmonization, which students, 
financial institutions and provinces have told us is a priority 
for them, working toward a single loan under the one 
student/one loan concept.  Under this concept a student would 
receive one loan, rather than a separate loan from the federal 
government and another from the provincial or territorial 
government as the system stands now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The discussions surrounding harmonization are continuing to 
progress.  The hon. member will be pleased to know that this 
single loan proposal will improve access to the Canada student 
loans program, provide better service to Canadian students, 
simplify administration, make communication with borrowers more 
effective and avoid duplication and overlap. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the hon. member would like more details on this proposal I 
would invite her to pick up a copy of <I>Ensuring 
Opportunities</I>.  In fact, I will deliver one to her. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the meantime the February budget has enabled us to improve 
the Canada student loans program so we can offer further help to 
individuals who are encountering difficulties in repaying their 
student loans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has become apparent through consultations that income 
contingent repayment is not supported by most stakeholders.  They 
prefer other options to help students manage debt.  Reforms to 
the Canada student loans program include:  tax relief for 
interest on student loans, interest relief extended to more 
graduates, an extended repayment period for those who need it, an 
extended interest relief period for individuals who continue to 
face financial difficulty, and a reduction in the loan principal 
for individuals who still face financial difficulty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the Canadian opportunities strategy we are expanding by 9% 
family income thresholds that determine interest relief 
eligibility.  This will enable some 50,000 more borrowers to 
become eligible for the program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, we are making interest relief available for a maximum 
of 30 months over the life of the loan, not just within the first 
five years of repayment.  Beginning in 1999 interest relief will 
become graduated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also our debt reduction and repayment initiative under 
the Canadian opportunities strategy.  Effective this year the 
Government of Canada will, in some circumstances, reduce the 
principal of a borrower's loan to make payments more affordable. 
The principal will be reduced if the borrower's annual payments 
exceed, on average, 15% of the individual's income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the implementation of the federal student grant 
program, the hon. member for Vancouver East proposes that the 
government implement a federal student grant program.  The Canada 
Millennium Scholarship Foundation will be awarding 100,000 
scholarships every year for 10 years beginning in the year 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These scholarships will average $3,000 each and will help 
hundreds of thousands of low to middle income students of all 
ages.  It is very comprehensive, very accessible and very 
flexible.  It reaches not just those in university, but also 
those who wish to go to technical institutes or trade schools. 
It also has a high mobility factor.  Students do not have to 
study in the province in which they reside.  Students will be 
able to study almost anywhere in Canada. 
This is the way we engender and create a bit of tolerance and 
understanding; an accepting of other cultures, geography and 
other ways of life.

</I></B></P><P align=left><I>Ensuring Opportunities</I> reiterates the government's 
commitment to grants as presented in the Canadian opportunities 
strategy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has responded to that recommendation through the 
Canadian opportunities strategy.  Beginning this August an annual 
Canada study grant of up to $3,000 will be available to full and 
part time Canada student loan program recipients with dependants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The grant will provide non-repayable aid to over 25,000 
high-need students with dependants.  This is extremely important 
as it will enable these individuals to continue their 
post-secondary education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are now providing a Canada education savings grant.  This 
grant will give families an even greater incentive to save for 
their children's education through registered education savings 
plans.  The grant will pay 20% on the first $2,000 in annual 
contributions for children up to age 18. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last part of the hon. member's motion calls for establishing 
accessibility as a new national standard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Accessibility is the fundamental principle of the Canada student 
loans program.  It is the driving force behind the program and 
fundamental to the success of the Canada student loans program 
since its inception in 1964.  However, the standing committee 
recommended that the government work with its provincial and 
territorial partners to ensure access, fairness and 
predictability in any upcoming changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member will be pleased to know that <I>Ensuring 
Opportunities</I> states “Harmonization discussions with the 
provinces will be based on a series of mutually agreed 
principles, including those of access and fairness and, to the 
extent possible, predictability”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the direction in which we are moving.  The legislative 
authority already exists under section 18 of the Canada Student 
Financial Assistance Act.  It authorizes the minister, with the 
approval of the governor in council, to enter into agreements 
with the provinces to harmonize student loans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But to address any fears that the Government of Canada's 
jurisdiction might be undermined, hon. members should note that, 
other than fee for service arrangements, harmonization agreements 
will not transfer responsibilities or resources to provincial or 
territorial governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the reasons I have outlined, I cannot support the hon. 
member's motion.  I encourage her and other hon. members to read 
<I>Ensuring Opportunities</I>.  It is a well thought out response 
to the recommendations of the standing committee.  In 
collaboration with our provincial and territorial partners we 
will move forward to implement its provisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada's commitment to post-secondary 
education and all its various provisions, grants and loan 
programs is a very real one.  We understand the plight of the 
single mother with dependants who has taken on the opportunity of 
furthering her education.  We also understand the opportunities 
for persons with disabilities who want to develop some labour 
force attachment and higher education.  We understand that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We understand that it is not a one size fits all program that we 
are proposing.  What we are proposing is a program to deal with 
the real world.  There are many complications, many different 
series of events and circumstances that have to be addressed and 
we feel these measures have done that.  In some way they have 
reached those people who are most in need.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In my assessment the government moved toward privatizing Canada 
student loans because it had a bad track record on defaults. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the period 1990-91, 25.78% of student loans had default 
problems.  In the 1991-92 fiscal year 27.23% of student loans had 
default problems.  In fiscal year 1992-93, 28.84% had default 
problems.  Notice that each year the figure is going up.  In 
1993-94, 29.79% of student loans had default problems.  In fiscal 
year 1994-95, 31.1% of student loans had default problems. 
According to our numbers 1995 is the last year for which these 
figures are available.  The amount of student loans with default 
problems crept up each year during the period 1990 to 1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a combination of problems.  There is some form of 
remission, or there is some form of granting, or there is some 
form of actual bankruptcy, or there is some form of late payment. 
There are probably other scenarios that wind up in a default 
complication. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not talking pennies.  They are pretty substantial sums of 
money.  Last year it was estimated that student loans in Canada 
would cost about $643 million.  That was the estimate, but the 
government exceeded that.  As a result more people qualified and 
it wound up costing taxpayers $743 million.  That is just for one 
year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As of last year there were outstanding loan guarantees of up to 
$3.5 billion.  We are talking about some pretty substantial assets. 
If we are dealing with close to $4 billion in outstanding 
assets on student loans we cannot treat this lightly.  If the 
government did not do a good job from 1990 to 1995 in terms of 
the stats we have seen, maybe privatizing student loans is a 
worthwhile option to explore. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has loaned this money and it has turned the loans 
over to the private institutions, the banks, because it was not 
doing a good job.  Thirty per cent of the loans were going into 
default with the government looking after them, so the government 
finally got them out of its back pocket and gave them to the 
banks to see if they could do a better job.  In order for the 
banks to pick up this responsibility they wanted a 5% premium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government gave out $743 million in loans last year.  It was 
projected that the premium would be $16 million.  However, 
because the government went way over budget with the loans, the 
premium rose to $29.4 million.  Last year the Government of 
Canada paid the banks in Canada roughly $30 million to look after 
Canada student loans.  That is based on approximately $700 
million that was given out in student loans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is looking to loan this money out, but by paying 
the premium to the banks it is hoping to have the banks pick up 
the problems of chasing people who default on their loans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is one of the problems associated with post-secondary 
education in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another problem underpins everything.  It is one thing to have a 
loan, but if the borrower cannot find a job when they graduate 
they have a real problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember a party either in the 1993 or the 1997 election. 
If I remember correctly it campaigned on jobs, jobs, jobs.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me think now.  It was the Liberals.  That is who it was. 
They campaigned on jobs, jobs, jobs.  But those students who got 
those loans, loans, loans came out of the universities and 
post-secondary institutions and they could not find those jobs, 
jobs, jobs.  They had debt, debt, debt.  As a result we have all 
sorts of massive default, default, default.  There is a serious 
problem on our hands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could go ahead and as the NDP says allow the government to 
take over the student loans programs again but that would not 
solve the problem.  The real underpinning problem is that there 
is a lack of jobs for students when they come out of 
post-secondary institutions.  That is the real problem.  There 
has not been a delivery on the jobs front.  That is why they are 
having problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If students after their post-secondary education step into jobs, 
they do not have problems repaying their student loans.  As a 
matter of fact, students in this country only pay a little over 
10%, and one of the figures in a Diane Francis article is about 
11% of their education.  The government covers close to 80% of 
their education costs and there is the private sector funding 
which is arranged through alumni associations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When everything is taken in, students are not paying that much. 
They are paying around 15% at tops 20%, or a sixth of the cost of 
their education.  If they are able to get a subsidy of 
five-sixths for their education, as long as they are able to find 
a job, repaying the student loan is not a problem. The problem is 
that there are no jobs for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals say they are going to promise jobs and it does not 
happen.  The NDP says we should have the government look after 
student loans.  Unfortunately the government has an abysmal 
record on student loans.  Students are therefore left between a 
rock and a hard place.  And there comes the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the second aspect of Motion No. 132, the NDP wants to reject 
proposals for income contingent loan repayment. Let me give a 
thumbnail sketch for the folks at home and all those Liberals 
across the way because I know they are paying attention. 
Education is a big priority for all of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An income contingent loan would allow students when they come 
out of an educational institution and if they get a job right 
away, the ability to link their salary to their ability to repay 
their student loan. If students find work when they graduate, 
they repay the student loan. On the other hand if they cannot 
find work, or they find only part time work, then they link the 
amount of money they are making to the loan repayment.  As a 
result they may not be making full repayment, but they are making 
a partial repayment.  This is better than what we have right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now it is a simple on and off switch.  If a student 
graduates and is able to pay, they pay the full shot whether or 
not it makes sense according to their budget.  If they come out 
and cannot afford the full amount but can afford a partial amount 
of the student loan, rather than being able to pay that partial 
amount, it automatically defaults because of the on and off 
switch mechanism with regard to student loans.  They do not pay 
any of it.  That is not fair to the taxpayer and it is not fair 
to the students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result, income contingent student loans would allow 
students who have the ability to pay, to pay.  Those who do not 
have the ability to pay would be able to push repayment on to a 
later period of time when they finally find work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the ways to make sure the loan is repaid is to take the 
income out of an income tax refund if they have one.  I have 
encountered examples of students who are not fairly reporting 
their income to the financial institution holding the loan, or in 
some way are trying to skirt the process.  If it is linked to 
their social insurance number, we get rid of the default problems 
and make sure that the loans are being repaid. Therefore with 
income contingent student loans we take care of both problems.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a student cannot find a job promised to them by the Liberals, 
then they are not having to make full repayments.  If defaults 
are a problem, and the NDP is not going to be able to explain 
that the government cannot do a decent job of collecting on 
student loans that are legitimately owed by students to the 
government or to the banks if they may be privatized, then a 
system is set up where it is linked to social insurance numbers 
and these things can actually be traced. There is less of a 
problem for students who are honestly repaying their student 
loans and we can actually get repayment from those who are 
defaulting sometimes in spurious circumstances.  That addresses 
two of the big problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to address the lack of spending priorities.  You 
will have to help me out again, Mr. Speaker. There was a party 
which campaigned in 1993 and in 1997.  It said it was the party 
of health care and it said it was the party of education.  Its 
members said that those two things were fairly sacred social 
institutions and we would have to almost torture them for them to 
in any way impact the funding for programs in health care and 
education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember who it was.  It was the Liberals.  They said they 
were not going to cut health care and education but they actually 
did.  It was massive amounts of money.  In education alone it was 
$1.5 billion.  They cut huge amounts of money out of education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about the money we spend on foreign aid?  Are students not 
more important? What about subsidies to profitable corporations, 
the CBC?  I could go on, Mr. Speaker, you know I could. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any event income contingent student loans are the way to go.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak to this motion by the 
member for Vancouver East. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion, we are hearing a real heartfelt cry.  This is 
what people have come to recognize in Canada, in every 
anglophone province, everywhere except Quebec, where the system 
of loans was established in the 1960s and has remained 
unchanged.  In Quebec, we have established a recognized scheme 
for providing students with financial assistance, which includes 
loans and bursaries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think today's motion is well placed because for the past week 
the Standing Committee on Finance has been hearing from people, 
including representatives from Quebec, who report that the best 
financial assistance system in Canada is the one set up by the 
Government of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been honed into the tool it is today, following action to 
encourage the participation of students, administrators, 
officials from educational institutions and representatives of 
the unions, so that it is based on the student's financial need 
and excludes the notion of merit, making it the envy of all of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member's cry may be summarized as follows:  Is there  no 
way to change the way the system works in the rest of Canada to 
permit it to become more effective? 
This is quite understandable, since a student graduating in any 
of the other nine provinces owes an average of $25,000, while 
the figure for a Quebec graduate is $11,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is this so?  Because we have a system of loans and of 
bursaries, and if a student who already has loans receives a 
bursary, this does not increase his debt load.  As well, the 
Government of Quebec has made a choice to keep university 
tuition as low as possible.  It has taken steps to invest in the 
educational system so that people, regardless of their financial 
situation, are able to gain access to it and to receive an 
education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my impression that this was more or less the objective of 
the hon. member's motion. 
Unfortunately, we cannot really support a motion like hers, 
because there are some very concrete examples, in the Canadian 
system, that show if we agreed to national standards across 
Canada, there would be horror stories like the millennium 
scholarships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The decision was made to create a system of scholarships. There 
are no grants or bursaries in the other provinces of Canada, so 
we can see why this would make sense for them.  But the decision 
was made that these scholarships would be awarded on merit and 
administered by a private foundation at arm's length from the 
government.

<A HREF="#LINKT100"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These scholarships will probably be awarded partially according 
to financial need, but also on merit or other criteria  which 
the foundation will set and over which the government will have 
no say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This continues the trend of disengagement which has been going 
on in the federal government for some years, setting up agencies 
that are less and less under parliamentary control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the motion, where there is reference to accessibility as a 
new national standard for post-secondary education, I believe 
that where the problem lies with relation to student funding for 
academic fees and living expenses has nothing to do with a 
national standard. 
The proof is that, since 1964, we have simultaneously developed 
two different models corresponding to a certain extent, I 
believe, to the kind of society that people wanted.  Quebec's 
model leaves students less indebted on completing their studies 
than students in the rest of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A choice was made. As as people of my generation know, there 
were several successive battles by students' federations, which 
led strikes and protest movements to come up with the present 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The consensus in Quebec today is that the millennium 
scholarships are unacceptable for Quebeckers. 
I am not just talking about Quebeckers in the sovereignist 
movement, but about the Centrale de l'enseignement du Québec, 
the Confédération des syndicats nationaux, the Conférence des 
recteurs et des principaux des universités du Québec, the 
Fédération des cégeps, the Fédération des commissions scolaires, 
the Fédération étudiante collégiale du Québec, the Fédération 
étudiante universitaire du Québec, the Fédération québécoise des 
professeurs d'université and the Fédération des travailleurs et 
travailleuses du Québec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the economic stakeholders who appeared before the committee 
when we were looking at Bill C-36, which dealt with the 
millennium scholarships, came to tell us that the model proposed 
in Bill C-36 is not acceptable to Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We built a system, made sure it was effective, that the 
framework and delivery systems were good, and suddenly someone 
has installed a parallel system. 
They tell us “If it was costing you 3% or 4% in administration 
expenses, we don't care; we are going to introduce another 
system that will cost the same”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a Canada that talks about eliminating overlap, building a 
duplicate system is unacceptable.  Things have been running fine 
for several years and now there are two parallel models. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the Government of Canada could have done was to amend the 
legislation on loans and introduce financial assistance 
legislation that would incorporate the concepts of loans and 
scholarships and that would contain particular concepts 
acceptable to Canada's nine provinces. 
If it were to include the notion of merit, we could have put it 
within this model.  The other provinces of Canada so desiring 
could make this choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, Quebec came up with a different model.  Student 
associations told us that to include the notion of merit would 
be to fly in the face of the studies done and various consensus 
reached. We are not talking about consensus among student 
associations, but one that included essentially all the members 
of the current coalition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, although the motion is made in good faith and its objective 
honourable, Quebeckers oppose the inclusion of a national 
standard in this sector.  The federal government is trying every 
trick to get round the existing system. 
To officially and formally include the concept of a national 
standard would amount to delivering oneself bound and gagged to 
the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It did not want to allow Quebec to exercise its right to opt out 
and to be able to say, under current legislation, that the money 
for the millennium scholarship would be paid to Quebec, which 
would incorporate it in the system.  To avoid that, rather than 
amending the legislation on loans, the government decided to 
create a whole structure, a separate foundation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the arguments raised, the foundation has nothing to 
do with the jurisdiction over education.  It will be 
administered, not by government, but by a private foundation. 
All manner of aberrations are therefore being created, which 
will end up with a very negative outcome. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can hardly wait to hear what the auditor general will have to 
say about the federal government's decision to invest billions 
in a foundation with which it will be at arm's length, and which 
the auditor general cannot scrutinize in order to report to the 
House that it is or is not being properly administered.  No, a 
foundation is being set up that will be fully autonomous and 
independent, and yet will be funded with public money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec today finds itself faced with a lack of understanding 
by a federal government that is unable to understand that Quebec 
has developed a different system which must be respected, and 
unable to understand that financial assistance to students is 
part of our jurisdiction over education.  Those who try to make 
this a dichotomy, splitting financial aid away from education, 
are out of touch with reality.  When curricula and the workings 
of an educational system are being determined, aspects such as 
accessibility must also be addressed. Thus the funding of 
institutions and of students—both living costs and tuition 
fees—cannot be separated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member does, I must admit, show good intentions.  I 
hope that the government will see reason and change the Canada 
Loan system accordingly.  There is, however, no way Quebec will 
ever accept having the changes made at its expense. 
There is no question of Quebec accepting any national 
educational standards.  This is one of the areas of jurisdiction 
that is the most dear to us, and we will brook no interference 
by the federal government in this area.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to support the motion.  Education should be the foundation of our 
country and of our future.  Unfortunately that is not what is 
happening and it is not what we are facing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I would like to contrast here is Yukon, which is not a rich 
jurisdiction by any means.  It is very poverty stricken in a lot 
of instances and has boom and bust cycles.  For decades it has 
provided $5,000 a year for five years to any student who 
graduates from a Yukon high school.  They can use that money to 
attend any institution as long it is accredited and as long as 
they are accepted.  It is a recognition of how valuable education 
is and how we need to support it in our young so that they can 
take their place in society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I contrast that to the proposed millennium scholarship fund 
which will not be available for another two years.  It will 
provide $3,000 a year for a very few number of students based on 
merit.  We do not know whom they will be.  It will not be 
administered by the government.  We will not have any say in it. 
I am glad there is some recognition and that some amount of money 
will be there, but it does not form a foundation of an education 
system, certainly not one for a country that wants to move into 
the future with strength. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have seen happening is the gutting of our post-secondary 
funding with a cut of $550 million.  I know the only college in 
Yukon is in Whitehorse and it has had to cut courses.  HRDC is no 
longer buying seats for people to be trained in so there is 
another cut there, causing even more suffering and downgrading of 
courses that are available to educated and trained students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada student loans have been privatized.  Students are 
graduating with huge debts and into unemployment with no hope of 
paying off the debts they incurred for their education in order 
to benefit not just themselves but their communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where the government has moved out, the banks have moved in. 
The difference is that the banks have no concern for the 
education of our students or the development of our country. 
They are not accountable to the public.  They do not have to 
report to us. 
They are not concerned with educating our artists, our musicians, 
our scientists, our economists, our carpenters, our electricians, 
our humanitarians or our doctors.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This Liberal agenda erodes and destroys publicly funded and 
supported post-secondary education in more ways than one.  By the 
year 2000, 45% of new jobs will require a post-secondary 
education, but at the same time in the past 10 years tuition has 
gone up by 240%.  Most people who do not go to university who 
could, or do not go to college who could, do not do it because 
they cannot afford it.  They will never be able to afford it on a 
minimum wage job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Debt per student has risen from $13,000 in 1993 when the 
Liberals came into power up to around $25,000.  In the maritimes 
I am told it is even more than that, well over $30,000 worth of 
debt.  With tuition that is $3,000 per year on average per 
student, what kind of summer jobs will bring in enough money for 
students to pay their tuition, pay their living, pay their books 
and work to educate themselves?   How do banks treat students who 
have incurred this debt?  One missed payment equals a default. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An elderly first nations man called my office in Yukon because 
he cannot pay his debt.  He has phoned every day.  It is not that 
he is trying to avoid paying his debt or trying to avoid work. He 
takes any kind of work he can get, any little scrap of work he 
can get to make a living. He is often forced on to welfare, of 
which he is very ashamed.  He bought one small filing cabinet and 
was hounded.  He got it at a garage sale and was hounded because 
he bought it.  He does not even have a bed.  He sleeps on a 
foamy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He is afraid to answer his phone.  He is driven to distraction, 
and this is a man who was put through the residential school 
system by this very same government.  He pulled himself through 
that.  He educated himself.  He wants to work and he does work 
when he can, but he is hounded every day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995 the Liberals gave the banks responsibility for the 
loans.  Where they used to be fully guaranteed by the government 
they no longer are.  The last budget provides a clause giving 
banks more power to refuse student loans.  This clause goes on 
outside the scrutiny of the House of Commons.  Will the banks 
determine who studies, what is profitable to study, and where 
students buy their products from?

</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no doubt we have been through five very hard weeks. 
What is clear from this past month and more is that there is no 
consensus in the House, among provincial governments or in the 
Canadian population as a whole, for a limited compensation 
package that creates two classes of victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is clear is that this deal has not withstood the test of 
time.  It is not in the tradition of how we solve problems.  It 
is not in keeping with our values as Canadians.  It is not how we 
respond individually or collectively when people in our midst are 
in need.  We know what will not work.  That is clear now.  We 
have to look to the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make four points to the federal government as it 
begins this new phase in the history of the whole matter of blood 
injured Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, we urge that the federal government go to the table of 
federal-provincial-territorial ministers prepared to show 
leadership with the message that nothing short of compassionate 
relief for all blood injured Canadians will do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, we urge the federal government to go to the table 
acknowledging its own federal responsibility, acknowledging that 
blood injured Canadians have been the victims of a regulatory 
failure.  This is a unique situation requiring federal 
responsibility and action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, we must go to the table with additional funds and not 
empty pockets.  We must acknowledge that the lion's share of 
responsibility for financial compensation rests on the shoulders 
of the federal government.  That should be clear more than ever 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, we must go with open minds and hearts prepared to listen 
and hear the voices of those who have been affected so directly 
and so deeply by this tragedy in our history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I pay tribute to all victims of this devastating period 
in our history, pay tribute to all representatives of the 
hepatitis c society and the hemophilia society who have had the 
courage and the persistence to keep these issues before us.  They 
have overcome great obstacles and much adversity to keep 
reminding us about the very serious issues before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember how much hope they had after Krever tabled his report 
and how much hurt they felt when the limited compensation package 
was announced.  They have found much inner strength to be able to 
fight yet again for what only can be considered basic justice and 
decency in society today. 
<P><A NAME="LINK287"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member opposite will 
already acknowledge that the federal government has demonstrated 
enormous leadership on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Had it not been for the leadership of the federal government and 
the current minister, we would not even be discussing the package 
that I know the member opposite accepts.  She wants to extend it. 
She accepts the package and she would give credit to the federal 
Minister of Health and his leadership for bringing it about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the question of accepting responsibility for a regulatory 
failure, she probably means that the system somehow collapsed. 
She would probably want to acknowledge that this is a shared 
responsibility, that the delivery of the blood supply system was 
essentially a provincial matter as delegated through the Red 
Cross. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We already know what has happened to the Red Cross.  It exists 
no more.  It suffered for its responsibility.  The provincial 
governments have been brought to the table to acknowledge the 
ramifications that flow from their own responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding the question of increased funds, this again falls into 
the area of shared responsibilities.  As we speak today, the 
situation is a little different from what it was yesterday or 
when the member asked her question about a month ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question of funds has always been mitigated by numbers that 
people have accepted or not accepted.  As I said before, the 
leadership of the federal Minister of Health in this regard has 
been exemplary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is because of the issues he put before us on the table in 
parameters that all could understand and appreciate that we have 
a package to serve the immediate and long term needs of a 
substantial number of people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most important, he is dedicating federal resources and 
scientific resources to solving the long term problems associated 
with this terrible disease.  I think for that he should be 
complimented.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>HEPATITIS C 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK289"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (Charlotte, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to 
pick up where my counterpart from the NDP left off. 
It is on the hepatitis C question.  We have spent the day on this 
issue and I think we will spend many more days on this issue 
because it is not resolved satisfactorily in the eyes of the 
Canadian people.  Up to now it has not been resolved because we 
do have a number of victims left outside the compensation 
package.  That is the point I am going to make tonight. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1915"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT104"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously what the government has done is come up with a 
compensation package that covers only those victims within the 
time frame of 1986 to 1990.  That is a flawed position simply 
because it leaves people outside the package.  The question then 
becomes what happens if someone was infected on December 31, 
1985. They would be left out. But if it happens to be a day 
later, January 1, 1986, they would be compensated under the plan 
as it now exists.  That is absolutely wrong.  There is no logic 
to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is telling us that a test did not exist.  We have 
heard that numerous times from the Minister of Health, from the 
parliamentary secretary and from the Prime Minister. But that is 
flawed logic. That is not the case.  A test did exist and was 
being exercised and conducted in the United States and Germany as 
two examples of jurisdictions that did use the test which would 
test for what is now known as hepatitis C.  Let us not forget 
that.  That is the logic that the government falls back on.  It 
is flawed logic.  A test did exist and we have said that over and 
over in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada did not ascribe to that test until 
1986, but the test was available. The test was fairly accurate. 
The test would have alleviated a lot of hardship on the part of a 
lot of Canadians who are now infected by hepatitis C if the 
government had used that test. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other difficulty I have with the government's position, and 
this again is flawed logic, is it is saying it cannot compensate 
the victims outside of this package of 1986 to 1990 because there 
are too many of them.  The minister suggests that it would 
actually bankrupt the Canada health system, the medicare system 
as we now know it.  In other words, the government could not 
possibly pay for this many people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the <I>Globe and Mail</I> today a figure has been proposed, as 
has been suggested by hepatitis C groups for a long time, that 
the real numbers are not 60,000 victims but a mere 6,000 and 
possibly 10,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point is the government can afford to compensate all 
victims. 
<P><A NAME="LINK290"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, we can talk about whether a test 
existed. But there was no test that was generally accepted in any 
jurisdiction.  It was only when that test was generally accepted 
and available in a jurisdiction like ours but was not applied 
that governments failed in their responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On whether the government refused to do something, that 
statement ignores the way the system worked.  What the member 
would do in his honesty is indicate that the Red Cross, the 
distributor of blood and blood supplies, and the provinces which 
had responsibility for the administration of the blood system 
unfortunately recognized too late that their decisions not to 
implement those tests were a cause of greater risk than the 
benefit they had assumed.

<A HREF="#LINKT105"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the member also acknowledges in his argument that there is a 
need for parameters in which to consider any kind of compensation 
for damages incurred.  Under those circumstances if what he is 
saying to us is that the parameters he wants to put forward are 
more legitimate than the procedures and parameters he refuses to 
recognize, then I think the member should say what those 
parameters might be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When all is said and done I think the member opposite will 
consider what has been accomplished by the federal government's 
initiative in this regard.  We have a package on the table that 
brings together all the partners who were in a position where 
they could have avoided a wrong. They are assuming responsibility 
in the short term through a compensation package and in the long 
term through a series of procedures put in place to address the 
needs of victims who will live with this unfortunate and 
regrettable tragedy forever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the member thinks about this for a moment then he will join 
with me and others in complimenting the federal Minister of 
Health for his foresight and his dynamic energy on this issue.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>MULTINATIONAL AGREEMENT ON INVESTMENT 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK292"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
multinational agreement on investment is a bad deal for the 
people in my riding of Halifax West and it is a bad deal for Nova 
Scotians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On February 13, I challenged both the Deputy Prime Minister and 
the Minister of Industry about the impact of this mega deal. 
Neither was willing to tell the real story to Canadians.  This 
deal has been cooked up by the cream of the financial elite, by 
some super rich people and mega corporations, many making more in 
a year than some entire third world countries.  This agreement 
would arm Goliath with missiles while handcuffing and 
blindfolding David. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mega corporations did not elect this government, people did. But 
the MAI which this government is so keen on will protect those 
mega corporations at the expense of the taxpayers who elected 
this government.  The MAI would tie the hands of our own 
government.  It would elevate the special status of investors at 
the expense of our environment, labour standards and public 
safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should be taking the lead by working to forge international 
agreements which include at their root the banning of child and 
forced labour, the protection of our threatened environment for 
our children, the banning of discrimination which hurts those who 
have the most to lose and free collective bargaining with equal 
footing for all partners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the North American Free Trade Agreement Ethyl Corporation 
in the United States was enabled to sue the Canadian government 
for $350 million for banning the dangerous and toxic substance 
MMT from gasoline.  Ethyl Corporation wants Canadian taxpayers to 
foot the bill for over one third of a billion dollars simply 
because we want to ban a toxic substance and the NAFTA paves the 
way for this type of corporate rule over the voter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If NAFTA is a leaky dory then the MAI is the <I>Titanic</I> going 
down. NAFTA has provisions for six months notice of termination 
while the MAI would bind Canadian parliaments for 20 years.  If 
the MAI were passed today it would tie the hands of this elected 
government and the ones after that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Voters would have as much chance of eluding the 20 year storm 
clouds of the MAI as our Atlantic fisheries have of becoming 
healthy again under this Liberal government.  This agreement 
would pave the way for huge multinational corporations to sue 
Canadians through our government for doing no more wrong than 
taking measures to protect ourselves.  We could be prevented from 
confronting threats to our children's health that we do not even 
know of yet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Corporations that are not elected would be able to use MAI 
muscle to protect their short term profit margins by preventing 
our elected governments from successfully taking legislative 
steps to protect our health, culture, democracy and working 
conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would my constituents be given similar rights to protect us from 
the impact of the operation of these corporations?  No.  On one 
hand, could the Sierra Club use provisions of the MAI to prevent 
deadly chemicals from eating holes in the ozone?  No.  On the 
other hand, could multinational corporations find ammunition with 
the MAI to continue working to produce these chemicals?  Yes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This new corporate stealth rule is like creating a whole level 
of super government without any voters and without any 
accountability.  The MAI is all about providing 20 years of 
protection for this new corporate rule.  Fortunately many 
political leaders are now showing common sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In March of this year European parliamentarians from 15 nations 
voted an overwhelming 437 to 8 against these undemocratic 
negotiations. 
Just last week the ministers of 29 OECD countries announced they 
have decided not to sign or set a new deadline for this much 
criticized agreement.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Our Liberal government still seems to be deep in the pockets of 
large corporations.  We must remember that large corporations did 
so much to bankroll the election of the Liberal government. 
However, the government now has the choice of saying yes to the 
people Halifax West and to Nova Scotians and no to the selfish 
interests of the super rich. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the government which choice it will make.  The MAI is now 
sleeping, thanks to the work of those who opposed it.  Let us 
ensure that the government does not wake it up. 
<P><A NAME="LINK293"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Julian Reed (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for 
International Trade, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, my friend's 
information base for the words he is using today is almost a year 
old.  It comes off a draft on the Internet last May.  The 
suppositions that arise from that draft have little relationship 
to any proposed multilateral agreement on investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an agreement that Canada is pursuing vigorously because it 
protects small and medium size business.  That is the basic 
reason.  The concept of some megacorporations coming in with a 
big foot and determining policy would have happened 30 years ago. 
Canada now has 54 bilateral investment agreements around the 
world.  No one has taken us over.  No one has interfered with our 
health care system, our education system or the way we deal with 
aboriginal people.  Canada is the master of its own house.  A 
multilateral agreement on investment will simply enhance that in 
years to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to protect our investors in other countries.  They are 
mostly small and medium size business.  They cannot afford a 
battery of lawyers to follow them around in litigation in the 
jungle out there.  We need rules.  We accept rules.  We try to 
persuade other countries to go along with understandable rules so 
that all of us can benefit from the commerce that results. 
<P><A NAME="LINK294"></A></P>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>MULTILATERAL AGREEMENT ON INVESTMENT 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK295"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Graham (Toronto Centre—Rosedale, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I too rise on the question of the multilateral 
investment agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the member from Halifax that the agreement raises 
important issues, but I certainly do not see them in the light 
that he raised them.  I agree with the parliamentary secretary 
when he says he appears to be working somewhere about a year out 
of date and with a lot of rhetoric that is not borne out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had a very interesting meeting in my riding recently in 
conjunction with the member for St. Paul's.  It brought a great 
deal of intense discussion and a lot of interested citizens to 
this issue because it raises very important issues of global 
governance.  I think these are issues that the government is 
seeking to address in a way that is important.  I think it 
behoves us as members to look at it seriously.  It raises very 
important issues.  That is why the constituents of my riding and 
the member for St. Paul's riding came.  We discussed this and 
heard issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to bear in mind two points.  The first is that the 
minister addressed this issue when he asked the subcommittee of 
the committee on trade to look at the issue.  The committee on 
trade came back to the minister and said that foreign investment 
agreements could be very useful to Canada and Canadians because 
they could further our investments abroad and at the same further 
job creation here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However they must be looked at in a certain light.  It must be 
guaranteed that we protect our culture.  We must ensure that our 
environment is protected, that measures are not to be restrained 
in protecting our environment.  We would like to see core ILO 
labour standards inserted in such an agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That makes a lot of sense.  Here is an opportunity not to dump 
on the agreement but an opportunity to make it better for 
Canadians and to make it better for labour standards as well as 
investment.  What a wonderful opportunity.  Let us not miss it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The subcommittee also said health measures, educational and 
social services clearly must be exempt from any such agreement 
because they are not appropriate matters for foreign investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did the minister do?  He picked up this report by the 
committee and subsequently filed in the House a response to the 
report.  In his response he states that specifically the 
government's response addresses in detail each recommendation 
made by the subcommittee and agrees with all of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister is to be congratulated.  For the first time we saw 
an international agreement being negotiated brought before a 
parliamentary committee prior to the negotiations being 
completed. 
This was not for us to ratify after.  This was something on which 
members of Parliament from all parties, including the party of 
the member for Halifax, had an opportunity to have some input, to 
the point where the minister has gone to the meetings. We know 
now from the newspaper reports what has taken place at those 
meetings.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even Madam Barlow was quoted in the newspaper the other day as 
saying she was pleased that this government had stood up to what 
it said it would do.  She was impressed by the fact that our 
negotiators had stuck to the instructions which were given to 
them to deal with this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given this and given the fact that this matter is now as we all 
know pushed off until the fall, I wonder if the parliamentary 
secretary could comment as to where he thinks it might go come 
the fall.  Is there any likelihood as has been suggested by some 
that this might get involved in the discussions at the WTO as 
well, so that we have a comprehensive approach to this very 
important issue? 
<P><A NAME="LINK296"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Julian Reed (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for 
International Trade, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
commend my hon. colleague for the comments he has made about the 
minister's response to the committee's work on MAI.  I point out 
that it has now been acknowledged by the Council of Canadians and 
by the Canadian Council of the Arts as a matter of fact that our 
minister has made the whole process transparent for the first 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Negotiations over the last 35 or 40 years were always conducted 
very quietly.  It was not because they were private, not because 
they were close to the vest, but because nobody was really 
interested in them, not until the Internet came along.  Now the 
Minister for International Trade has realized that the time has 
come to open up these negotiations and make them painfully 
transparent so that everybody can be bored by them as they go 
along over the months and years. Some people are interested and 
they deserve to know exactly what is happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should point out that the minister has also made it clear that 
there are reservations which are unassailable.  The provisions on 
the protection of culture, education, aboriginal concerns, our 
health care, social system and so on, Canada will continue to be 
master of its own house regardless of what happens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just briefly, I point out that because talks have now been set 
back until October of this year, that does not mean that they are 
finished or over.  They will resume at that time and Canada will 
continue to make vigorous representations.

<P><A NAME="LINK298"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac—Mégantic, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
April 28, I asked the Minister of Human Resources Development a 
question about employees of the BC mine in Black Lake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the information we have obtained from the placement 
committee, few or very few of these former employees are using 
active measures, with the result that only a small portion of 
the $3 million set aside for this envelope will apparently be 
used. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am requesting, on behalf of these former employees, 
several of whom are no longer receiving EI, is that the unused 
portion be put into the pool created by LAB Chrysotile and the 
Government of Quebec so that these employees, whose average age 
is over 52, can retire. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, the best way of saving our jobs in the asbestos 
industry is to sell this product, which is unique in the world 
and has exceptional qualities.  Almost two years ago, France 
announced its intention to ban asbestos on its territory.  The 
entire region foresaw a domino effect and to keep this move in 
asbestos producing countries from having an effect in the 
Thetford region, we unanimously requested that a complaint be 
filed with the WTO against France, with respect to the 
agreements signed with other member countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All asbestos producers, the Government of Quebec, all unions, 
the Bloc Quebecois, the council of mayors of the Asbestos RCM, 
all were unanimous in calling for a complaint to be filed with 
the WTO.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Even a highly placed public servant—mark his name well—François 
Filion of International Trade, made the following statement at 
Thetford Mines on March 18, 1998. “For the federal government, 
it is not a question of whether or not we will be complaining to 
the WTO on France's asbestos ban, but only of when we will be 
doing so”.  Now it is one minute to midnight.  Time is of the 
essence. The Government of Canada should waste no time in filing 
a proper complaint within the next few days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have one question for the Government of Canada.  Why does 
Canada not put the same effort into defending asbestos it would 
to defend the interests of Sherritt in the Toronto region, 
western Canadian wheat sales, the Pacific salmon or the famous 
turbot war in the Atlantic, in which Brian Tobin led the battle 
against Spain?  Is it because the asbestos mines are located 
exclusively in Quebec?  I am convinced that, if Quebec were a 
sovereign country, it would have filed a complaint long ago 
against the WTO, and we would have won our case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I repeat, is the government going to continue to delay until 
asbestos is banned everywhere in the world, before it lifts a 
finger?  The time for diplomacy is past. 
Jacques Roy could not deliver the goods, so now the Prime 
Minister should advise his ministers involved in this matter to 
act as promptly as possible.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Byrne (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Natural Resources, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the 
opportunity to respond to my colleague's intervention.  He raised 
the point in discussions about BC mines in Quebec that immediate 
action similar to that pursued by the then Minister of Fisheries 
and Oceans and now premier of Newfoundland, the hon. Brian Tobin, 
would be appropriate in this case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point out to the hon. member that it was the Bloc Quebecois 
which later in discussions with the European Community 
specifically said that was inappropriate action and that if the 
opportunity were to arise and a sovereign Quebec were to be 
established, those would not be the actions of the nation state 
of Quebec, that they would proceed with negotiations first. 
Therefore, I would like my hon. friend and colleague to clarify 
and state for the record, as we all know in this House, that is 
not the position of the Bloc Quebecois on other issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member may agree with me that the proper resolution of 
this matter is in further discussions.  A referral to the World 
Trade Organization at this point in time is very premature 
because discussions are ongoing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member raised the point that active measures were not 
being used.  I simply point out to my colleague that $3 million 
has been set aside for active measures for the approximately 300 
miners who are affected and there has been substantial uptake of 
those initiatives.  Of the 307 affected workers, 40 have found 
work at one of the other two mines run by Lab Chrysotile, the 
Bell mine and the Lac d'Amiante mine.  About 10 workers have 
retired and another 40 to 50 have expressed interest in continued 
training.

want to tell the affected workers that the Government of Canada 
is on their side and we will continue to work on their labour 
market adjustment.
