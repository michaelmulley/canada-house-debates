the holiday season is drawing near and I would like to extend to 
Canadians my very best wishes for a very happy holiday season.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Next year might bring the separation of Quebec, and this is 
why I would like to take this opportunity to tell Quebecers that 
Canada is a great country and that their presence in 
Confederation is extremely important because of the cultural 
dimension Quebec brings, and especially because of what the 
Quebec people mean to Canada.
<P>
	I hope that next year will bring the welcome news that Canada 
will remain united and that this unity will not be challenged 
again.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Canada must remain united. Anglophones, francophones and 
allophones must all work together in a harmonious country as 
Canadians. We cannot erase years of history and camaraderie 
between provinces. Canada must keep its state of Confederation 
with its ten provinces and two territories. Our strength is in 
unity, not in separation.
<P>
	Today we are also celebrating the 30th anniversary of the 
Canadian flag. May it continue to be our symbol of unity and 
harmony.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>]

	Happy New Year to all.

	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, after 10 
successive weekly increases, the central bank rate set by the 
Bank of Canada went up 71 basis points yesterday. With this 
decision, the Bank of Canada will slow consumption and 
investment, and will paralyze the housing market, a sector 
crucial for the creation of jobs, especially at a time when the 
reduction of unemployment is a major concern of Canadians and 
Quebecers.
<P>
	Unfortunately the employment crisis is not a priority in 
Ottawa. The government does not have the courage to seriously 
tackle government spending in order to reduce the deficit and 
the debt which are responsible for these pressures on interest 
rates. There is no job creation policy and the Bank of Canada is 
allowed to maintain an anti-inflationary monetary policy which 
undermines the economic recovery.
<P>
	Meanwhile interest rates are going up and the unemployed 
remain without jobs.

	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, a couple of months ago I watched in amazement as the 
government caved in to pressure from the Bloc and Parti 
Quebecois when it agreed to pay $34 million to Quebec for the 
1993 referendum. The decision was based almost solely on the 
word of the most distrusted Prime Minister in Canadian history.
<P>
	For the past month I have been even more amazed as the Bloc 
and its PQ allies try to force the renegotiation of a signed deal on 
the military college at Saint-Jean. This is  not some vague 
verbal guarantee from a former politician; it is a signed agree-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9054"> 9054 </A></B>
<P>
ment. The Bloc and PQ are being totally hypocritical in their 
demand. The government must not acquiesce to this absurd 
request.
<P>
	The government has finally agreed to Reform's request that 
British Columbia be treated equally as regards Royal Roads. Let 
us hope that we have now seen the end of this charade.

	<B>Mr. Roger Gallaway (Sarnia-Lambton, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as consumers many Canadians believe that their home 
cable rates are set by the CRTC.
<P>
	Due to the complexities of the cable companies' sales 
vocabulary, the truth is that basic cable rates are controlled but 
that extended cable rates float at whatever the local supplier 
demands. Certainly I am not opposed to open market pricing if 
the market is truly open.
<P>
	Let me invite all present or who are watching today to call 
their local cable companies to request the basic cable service as 
defined by the CRTC and not extended cable service as defined 
by their local cable companies. Next, try to find another cable 
carrier in your neighbourhood to give a competing bid.
<P>
	After you have realized that the marketplace limits that type 
of competition, get out your chequebook because you are about 
to pay for six new channels that have been authorized by the 
CRTC. This is an open market with no choice. Pay up or look for 
the rabbit ears.

during this Christmas season my thoughts are with the families 
and friends of those who perished in the tragic bombing of the 
Air India flight 182 on June 23, 1985.
<P>
	This will be the 10th Christmas since that tragic day on which 
329 passengers and crew lost their lives as a result of the bomb 
blast aboard the airliner just 120 miles west of Ireland. Although 
some arrests have been made, this terrible crime remains 
shrouded in mystery.
<P>
	As the families and loved ones of those who perished aboard 
Air India flight 182 face their 10th Christmas since this tragedy, 
I ask all members to join with me in expressing our deep sorrow 
at their loss which continues today.

	<B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the former Yugoslav republic, FYROM, in Skopje 
seeks international recognition as the republic of Macedonia.
<P>
	Only thirteen states, seven from the former Soviet Union and 
east Europe and three Asian communist states have recognized 
the Skopje republic as that. Twenty-six other states have 
recognized Skopje only as FYROM and another twenty-two 
have recognized Skopje as FYROM but without diplomatic 
relations. The remaining 124 members of the United Nations 
including Canada have not recognized Skopje in any form or 
opened diplomatic relations.

	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the former ruling party, which is left with only two 
members in this House and 53 senators, has managed to make 
the government backtrack on the issue of the Pearson airport 
privatization cancellation. Both parties, which have mutual 
friends working for the Pearson Development Corporation, 
agreed to let the consortium sue for up to $80 million in possible 
compensation.
<P>
	But worse still, we did not get to the bottom of this scandal 
and taxpayers will never know why the government is getting 
ready to squeeze all this money out of them for the benefit of its 
cronies. In view of the vast amount of public funds wasted in this 
ugly mess, the government must get to the bottom of it and set up 
a royal commission of inquiry to examine all the aspects of the 
deal which are still unclear.
<P>
	The way this government is handling this issue reveals quite 
clearly the strange kind of ethics which can be found in both the 
Liberal Party and the cabinet.

	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise today to present my first instalment of the 
Liberals copy Reform awards.
<P>
	Just when we thought the only two types of Liberals in Ottawa 
were the appointed and the disappointed, the hon. member for 
Durham restored our faith in the political process. In a letter to

<B><A NAME="9055"> 9055 </A></B>
<P>
the Ottawa <I>Citizen</I> the member supported Reform common 
sense policies when he proposed two solutions for Governor 
General appointments.
<P>
	Remember our leader was booed in the House when he 
suggested this very idea. The first was to submit a list of names 
to the House of Commons to allow all Canadians through their 
MPs to have a voice in the selection. The second solution was a 
vote by all people of Canada in a general election.
<P>
	It gives all Reformers a feeling of great pride when we hear 
Liberals choosing to quote the PM from Calgary Southwest and 
not the PM of Canada.

One would think educational institutions in our multicultural 
society would be the last place where racism would exist. This is 
not the case.
<P>
	Three weeks ago Mahendra Gupta, a teacher at Toronto's 
Humberside Collegiate, was deliberately pushed down a flight 
of stairs at the school. He was later found unconscious at the 
bottom of a concrete stairwell.
<P>
	It was a cold and calculated attack. School officials were 
aware of racist correspondence sent to five non-white teachers 
but chose not to inform students and staff.
<P>
	Racism still permeates the Toronto school board. According 
to Rick Kollins, a Toronto board superintendent, the attack was 
``not a good news story but a sign of moving in the right 
direction''.
<P>
	Years of inaction and window dressing by the Toronto school 
board have resulted in a teacher being racially attacked and the 
attack is perceived as a positive development by senior officials. 
It is not.

	<B>Mr. John Richardson (Perth-Wellington-Waterloo,

Canada's national English language theatre, on the conclusion 
of its 1994 season. All 10 plays enjoyed outstanding critical 
reviews and for the first time since 1990 the season was a 
financial success.
<P>
	The festival realized in excess of $17 million in box office 
receipts, $3.5 million through fund raising and received only 
$900,000 in federal grants. In return, the theatre generates $150 
million worth of business in the community and generates $25 
million in taxes.
<P>
	I wish all those associated with the Stratford Festival another 
successful season. I encourage all members of the House to join 
with us in 1995 when, in the words of the festival's artistic 
director Richard Monette, the Stratford adventure continues.

	<B>Ms. Hedy Fry (Vancouver Centre, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
stand to recognize a jewel in the crown of western Canada, 
situated in part in my riding: the port of Vancouver.
<P>
	Vancouver stands as the gateway to the Asia-Pacific. The port 
of Vancouver is the guardian of that gateway, serving the 
western regions as a point of entry and departure of all goods to 
the Pacific.
<P>
	The port of Vancouver is the largest port on the west coast of 
North America. Its annual throughput is approximately 70 
million tonnes.
<P>
	As a fully self-supporting crown corporation the port serves 
all of B.C. and western Canada. It supports 9,000 jobs in the 
lower mainland as well as another 62,000 employees from the 
rest of Canada who produce, transport and process the goods 
that move through the port. The port's cargoes exceed $38 
billion annually.
<P>
<B>(1410) </B>
<P>
	As the sleeping tiger of Asia awakens, the port of Vancouver 
has the unique opportunity to become the hub of trade for the 
northwest. The U.S. ports of Oregon and Seattle vie for the 
prize. Perhaps all western Canadian provinces should claim 
ownership and mould it to become the Pacific jewel that it can 
be.

	<B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Lincoln, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, our 
government must be committed to assisting innovative small 
and medium sized enterprises. An industry which may help us to 
meet our objectives is the venture capital industry which 
searches out businesses that are young, innovative and operating 
in a growth market.
<P>
	The FBDB recently concluded a baseline survey of 259 
companies which secured venture capital financing. Despite the 
effects of the recent recession these venture backed companies 
still increased the number of people they employed at an annual 
compounded rate of 40 per cent.
<P>
	The global economy is becoming increasingly specialized. 
High tech firms once considered the wave of the future are here 
today. In order that Canada not be left behind it is essential that 
the government assist in creating a positive environment for the 
venture capital industry to support small and medium sized 
businesses which will have a positive impact on our economy as 
a whole. The venture capital investment industry is an important 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9056"> 9056 </A></B>
<P>
means by which we can support young companies while 
ensuring that Canada remains competitive in the global market.
<P>
	Clearly the venture capital industry provides a great potential. 
As our government is committed to rejuvenating the economy 
this is one vehicle that should lead the way.

	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the Minister of Canadian Heritage gave 
us another demonstration of his now infamous lack of courage. 
Following the decision by Rogers Cable to change access to its 
French-language channels TV5 and Météo Média, and to cancel 
Musique Plus, as of tomorrow, the minister avoided his 
responsibilities.
<P>
	Obviously, the heritage minister understood nothing 
yesterday, neither the question he was asked, nor what is at 
stake. Francophones in several regions are outraged by Rogers' 
decision. These channels are an important part of their cultural 
environment, especially among young people.
<P>
	We hope that the Pontius Pilate of cable television and 
francophones outside Quebec will emerge from his torpor and 
take action so that Rogers and all the other cable television 
companies do not reduce their services in French.

	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Bill C-22, a bill denying the rights of Canadians to due 
process before the courts, is coming back again. This time it is 
the Liberals in the other place who are trying to find an eleventh 
hour solution to the mess which the Liberals in the House now 
find themselves in.
<P>
	Our Liberals are in trouble due to their insistence on using the 
Pearson airport as a smoke screen to hide the real issue: the rule 
of law. They are trying to rewrite the rules of this land to suit 
their own purposes. This is a precedent we cannot allow to 
occur. If it does, what can we expect next? Expropriations 
without compensation, a change in the basic concept of innocent 
until proven guilty?
<P>
	The government needs a conscience. This is often portrayed 
as a small person sitting on a shoulder. In the case of the Liberals 
their conscience is sitting on this side of the House.
<P>
	I offered the Minister of Transport a solution to this mess back 
in October but he did not even respond to it.
<P>
	The Reform Party has been consistent on the issue. It is nice to 
see the Liberals finally agreeing not only with us, but the

	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask the government to maintain its 
presence in rural Canada through the operation and ownership of 
federal buildings in these small communities.
<P>
	In my own constituency at least three communities, the town 
of Wilke, the town of St. Walberg and the village of Loon Lake, 
have federal buildings on their main streets that currently house 
the post office. On several occasions over the last four years 
these buildings have been offered for sale by the department of 
public works but no buyers have been found.
<P>
	It appears that the federal government wishes to jeopardize 
postal services in these small communities by selling off the 
buildings that house those post offices giving Canada Post the 
opportunity to relocate into retail franchises.
<P>
	The public works department and Canada Post have the same 
minister. I call on him to support rural Canada.

	<B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Hamilton West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
government is committed to the elimination of all forms of 
violence in our society.
<P>
<B>(1415) </B>
<P>
	In particular, members on this side of the House are truly 
concerned about the incidence of violence against women which 
has often been dismissed as unsubstantiated and exaggerated.
<P>
	The recent ruling of the Supreme Court of Canada admitting 
drunkenness as an allowable defence for a man accused of 
sexually assaulting a 65-year old woman is an indication of the 
insensitivity that currently exists in the country.
<P>
	Furthermore, as recently as last week in reference to the 
incidence of male violence against women the member for 
Lisgar-Marquette stated they were always taught at home as 
kids that when they went to get the cattle out of the pasture not to 
wear red because it would infuriate the bull in the pasture.
<P>
	I fail to see the connection between violence against women 
and the herding techniques of the Reform Party member 
opposite.
<P>
	It is my hope we will all work toward eliminating this type of 
insensitivity in our society.

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, for the 
past 14 months the Minister of Finance has promised he will 
reduce the deficit. We are still waiting.
<P>
	Disappointed by his failure to act, the financial community 
and investors are becoming increasingly concerned about the 
government's failure to reduce the deficit. In fact, in a situation 
where we can expect the U.S. economy to start overheating, 
failure to reduce the deficit will always cause interest rates to 
rise in Canada.
<P>
	Will the Minister of Finance admit that his weak-kneed 
approach to fighting the deficit and the miscalculations in his 
own budget plan are increasing concern in the financial 
community and among foreign investors, and that his failure to 
act is largely responsible for the rise in interest rates in this 
country?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I am certainly 
prepared to admit that this year, we will reach our goals as far as 
the deficit is concerned, the first time in ten years the federal 
government has done so.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
minister is a deficit expert. Everybody knows that. We all know 
the figures.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier:</B> Would the minister agree that scepticism in 
the financial community has increased considerably since 
Liberal members announced that the government would 
probably be unable to reach its goal of 3 per cent of GDP, which 
they feel justifies a general tax increase, ostensibly temporary, a 
proposal the Minister of Finance is still considering?
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, if there is any 
scepticism on the financial markets about a government that 
refuses to deal with its problems, it most certainly concerns the 
provincial government in Quebec, the PQ, the Bloc Quebecois 
headquarters. Ever since they came to power, they have refused 
to admit that they have a financial problem and that both levels 
of government will have to work together to deal with that 
problem.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I cannot 
believe what we just heard. For the past 14 months, the Minister 
of Finance has been talking about the Government of Quebec. 
With a $40 billion deficit, rising interest rates and his policies 
that have been a complete failure, he talks to us about the 
Government of Quebec. I cannot believe it.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Wake up.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier:</B> Mr. Speaker, look at them carrying on. And 
they talk about the Government of Quebec.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Wonderful Wednesday. The hon. member will 
please put his carefully wrought question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier:</B> Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for this advance 
appreciation of my question. Would the Minister of Finance 
admit that by merely coasting along on our economic recovery 
instead of stimulating job creation as he should have done, he 
has heightened the lack of confidence in the financial 
community which no longer believes his promises to reduce the 
deficit?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9058"> 9058 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, in the last quarter, 
we experienced 4.6 per cent growth, and in the quarter before 
that, 6.4 per cent. This year, 400,000 jobs were created. Last 
month, 95,000 jobs were created in Canada, a record for this 
country. Congratulations to my colleagues.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would remind the Minister of Finance that one month 
after he tabled his first budget, Canada's rating was 
downgraded, while, so far, Goldman Sachs and Moody's say that 
Quebec's credit rating will be maintained.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> There.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> The Minister of Finance continues to ignore the 
proposals and recommendations made by various stakeholders, 
including the official opposition, to reduce the deficit. His 
inaction has earned him very poor marks in the eyes of the 
financial community as this session ends.
<P>
	Will the Minister of Finance not recognize that before 
contemplating further tax increases, he should make it a priority 
to recover the bulk of the $6.6 billion in unpaid taxes owed to the 
federal treasury?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member 
for Roberval asked us to make cuts. Now, I will ask the Bloc 
Quebecois finance critic for the fifteenth time, where does the 
Bloc suggest that we cut? We have yet to receive a single note or 
suggestion. Really! Family trusts? I am waiting for the finance 
committee report. I think that you submitted your opposition 
yesterday. But where, where really, should we cut? Make 
suggestions. Be constructive.
<P>
	As for Goldman Sachs, the firm has made a favourable report 
because its people have said that the people of Quebec were 
obviously going to vote to remain within a united Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we did submit proposals to the minister. As a matter of 
fact, when will he admit that, had he put a stop to unjustified tax 
shelters as we suggested, collected outstanding tax accounts as 
we suggested, stimulated employment as we suggested, in a 
word, had he taken aggressive action to cut spending over the 
past year-a year wasted-he would not now be facing a 
credibility gap, this confidence crisis, and an upward swing in 
interest rates that will affect everyone in Canada.
<P>
<B>(1425) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we are now 
enjoying the highest economic growth of any of the G-7  
countries. We are enjoying the highest economic growth of 
almost any of the OECD countries. We are creating jobs. We are 
reinvesting in the economy. We have the best productivity 
record of almost any of the industrial countries. Our exports are 
up. I have been told about 10 times that our exports are up.
<P>
	Let it be very clear that this has been a very good year for the 
Canadian economy.
<P>
	Interest rates are up. They are up because of inflation in the 
United States. They are up for a number of reasons. The single 
most important reason for the increase in interest rates this week 
is the international financial community has said that one of the 
major provinces of the country, Quebec, refuses to face up to its 
deficit problems.
<P>
	I call upon it to do its job.

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Bank of Canada rate rose three quarters of a per 
cent yesterday to over 7 per cent, driving up consumer loan 
rates. Since April the interest rate increases have added about 
$200 a month to payments on a mortgage of $100,000.
<P>
	As the finance minister knows, our national house is 
mortgaged to the tune of $542 billion, on which we make 
payments of approximately $3.3 billion a month in interest 
alone.
<P>
	Could the minister tell us what impact these interest rate 
increases over the past year are having on the national 
mortgage? Could he give us a precise dollar figure on how much 
these interest rate increases are costing the federal treasury 
since the government took office?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a matter of 
public record and was set out in the House of Commons finance 
committee. Each one per cent increase in interest rates costs the 
nation $1.7 billion on an annual basis.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, when the average Canadian is faced with a $200 a 
month increase in mortgage payments, he or she has only one 
real option and that is to cut spending in other areas of 
expenditure. When it comes to meeting increased mortgage 
payments on the national house we hear, to our dismay, that the 
ministry is now considering getting the money from tax 
increases on gasoline, on personal incomes and on corporate 
incomes.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9059"> 9059 </A></B>
<P>
	Will the minister please tell us that these rumours are utterly 
unfounded, that there is no truth to the fact, and that he has no 
intention of taking more money out of taxpayers' pockets in 
order to meet his increased mortgage payments?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have responded 
to this question on numerous occasions by simply saying that the 
government will make its position known in the budget. We are 
in the consultation process. We are waiting for constructive 
suggestions from Canadians and from the two opposition 
parties.
<P>
	We are waiting for the Reform Party to complete its 
suggestions for areas in which we should make cuts. For 
instance, the person in the Reform Party who was concerned 
with social policy-that is an oxymoron-the member for 
Calgary North, said she would cut some $16 billion or $17 
billion out of social policy spending.
<P>
	We are waiting for the Reform Party to give us its constructive 
suggestions. We will make our position known in the budget.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the blunt truth of the matter is if the minister cuts 
spending the way he should, special interests in the country will 
squeal like stuck pigs. If he tries to fix the deficit with tax 
increases he will injure the economic interests and prospects of 
every man, woman and child in the country. He is going to take 
heat either way.
<P>
<B>(1430 ) </B>
<P>
	Why does he not take the political heat for doing the right 
thing rather than the wrong thing and declare that he will fight 
the deficit only through spending reductions? Why do you not 
take the heat, through you, Mr. Speaker, for doing the right thing 
rather than the wrong thing?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> We are prepared to take the 
heat, through you, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (LaSalle-Émard):</B> In fact we would much 
prefer to do it that way.
<P>
	We understand the bulk of the actions that have to be taken 
must be taken on the spending side. We understand that 
Canadians have to live within their means and that they expect 
their governments to do the same. We are going to do that.
<P>
	We also have had the benefit of a very well thought out report 
by the House of Commons finance committee in which members 
on all sides of the House participated. That is an important part 
of the consultation process. We intend to take that into account 
and we will give our answer when we bring down the budget.

	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ): </B>Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs.
<P>
	With just 10 days before Christmas, time is running out on the 
issue of the Royal Military College in Saint-Jean for the 
teachers, their families and the whole Saint-Jean community. 
All stakeholders have agreed to discuss the merits of the 
proposal from the mayor of Saint-Jean, which provides for the 
gradual conversion of the military college into a civilian 
educational institution. The only holdout is the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs.
<P>
	Can the minister promise today in this House to resume 
discussions on the basis of the proposal from the mayor of 
Saint-Jean, which provides for a three-year transition period?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy 
Council for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
and Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): 
</B>Mr. Speaker, I spoke to the mayor of Saint-Jean yesterday at 
lunchtime and it is clear that we can come to an agreement. The 
only obstacle is that the Parti Quebecois has not yet agreed on 
the basis of negotiations. I hope to be notified in the coming 
days. As soon as I am notified, we will resume negotiations.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Quebec's Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs acceded 
yesterday to the minister's objective of demilitarizing the 
college. As the minister said to us yesterday, let us stop fooling 
around.
<P>
	Will the minister, in the interest of the Saint-Jean community, 
resume negotiations on the basis of the proposal from the mayor 
of Saint-Jean, yes or no?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy 
Council for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
and Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): 
</B>Mr. Speaker, we must indeed stop fooling around, so the Quebec 
minister, who says one thing on Monday and another thing on 
Tuesday, should confirm her position to me in writing before I 
can take action.

his response to a question yesterday when he responded that it 
was his responsibility to decide on the best way to release the 
report.
<P>
	Does the minister believe that the best way to release the

	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is 
for the Minister of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	Eastern Quebec's main social, community and labour 
organizations have asked the federal government to take 
seasonal workers into consideration, rather than let them down, 
in its social program reform. According to the minister's 
estimates, close to two thirds of unemployed people who would 
be considered frequent UI users are seasonal workers.
<P>
	Will the minister recognize that, since seasonal workers 
represent close to two thirds of those whom he defines as 
frequent users, his project to implement a two-tier UI system 
would essentially target these workers?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, about two months ago I 
established a special working group to look at the way seasonal 
workers could be impacted by the various proposals.
<P>
	The member knows that in the green book we do not just 
present one proposal; we present a variety of proposals about 
how we can change the unemployment insurance form.
<P>
	The special working group has been going across the country. 
It has met with several hundred representatives of various 
working groups, union groups and business groups. I have met 
with its representatives and they are doing a very effective job of 
making a proper assessment of how we can be very considerate 
and very sensitive to the issue of seasonal workers.
<P>
	Ten years ago only about 14 per cent of unemployment 
insurance funds were drawn down by those who were frequent 
users. Today it is over 40 per cent. It shows a very fundamental 
change in the way unemployment insurance is being used. It is 
time Canadians have the honesty and the responsibility for 
taking a look at those changes.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, does the 
minister recognize that regions which depend on industries such 
as forestry, fishing and tourism, such as eastern Quebec, will be 
the main victims of his reform and will become second class 
regions with second class jobless?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member uses 
words like victim and so on. It shows that he has not read the 
proposals.
<P>
	One of the most serious issues facing Canadians is helping 
those who are affected by frequent unemployment or affected by 
long periods of unemployment to have better training, better 
support, better off season adjustment programs so they can get 
longer term employment.
<P>
	The whole thrust of the green paper is employability. Get 
more work for longer periods for more people. That is the whole 
point of the reform.
<P>
	By using that kind of provocative language all the member is 
doing is stirring up reaction as opposed to helping Canadians 
understand the kinds of choices they can make. I would suggest 
that he stop doing it.

	<B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of National Revenue.
<P>
	To comply with the new regulation that takes effect on 
January 16, 145 of the 269 customs brokers who operate in 
Canada have applied to Reed Stenhouse, a Toronto company, for 
the surety bond required by Revenue Canada. As of today, 32 of 
these customs brokers have been denied bonds, in other words, 
they have been put out of business. Another twenty or so have 
yet to receive a reply.
<P>
	Does the minister realize that this new policy of requiring 
customs brokers to obtain high surety bonds has already resulted 
in the loss of at least 250 jobs, and that the losses will be much 
more substantial if he persists on this course?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of National Revenue, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in my view the figures provided by the hon. 
member are not accurate. Certainly his projections for the future 
are inaccurate.
<P>
	Over the last four years there have been 15 failures of customs 
brokers leading to very substantial problems for their clients. 
Their clients of course are the ordinary importers of Canada.
<P>
	The problem that arises under these circumstances is that the 
clients are liable for a second time for money they paid to the 
customs broker. It is vital that we deal with this problem. We 
must create a fair system of mutual insurance so that the client 
of the customs broker can be protected. This is what we are 
attempting to do.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, should the 
minister not demonstrate the most elementary common sense 
and reconsider this decision, if he wishes to see these businesses 
and the hundreds of jobs they represent survive?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of National Revenue, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I can certainly accept the representation of 
the hon. member to review it. It is not a policy which is yet 
finally determined. We are examining it at the present time and 
we will make a decision shortly.
<P>
	I should point out that the concern I expressed in the House a 
moment or two ago is a very real one. We must make sure that 
the customs system in Canada does not result in some importers 
paying double the amount because of the failure of the agent that 
they employ as a customs broker.

Mr. Speaker, the Liberal red book said that the Tory government 
``made a practice of choosing political friends'' in making 
appointments. It went on to say that the Prime Minister would 
fill positions ``on the basis of competence''. My question is for 
the Secretary of State for Veterans Affairs.

appointments to the Veterans Appeal Board?

Speaker, competence.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I could not hear the answer.
<P>
	The answer did not include that several of the 1994 
appointments to the Veterans Appeal Board have been long time 
friends of the Liberal Party, including failed Liberal candidates 
and former Liberal MPs including René Cousineau, Patricia 
Landers and Una MacLean Evans who supported the Prime 
Minister in his bid for the Liberal leadership race in 1990. The 
Liberal list goes on and on. The major criteria appear to be that 
one must be a Liberal to get these $86,000 a year plums.

	My supplementary question is for the Prime Minister. When 
will the government live up to its red book promise and put an 
end to these blatant partisan patronage appointments?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have looked at the list of order in council 
appointments. We have made more than 650. I checked and I do 
not know more than 40 of them. I have not done very well 
regarding Liberals because I know only 40 of them.
<P>
	The others I did not know but they were recommended and 
chosen. I hope that the day has not come in Canada where 
because some day one has the good fortune of offering one's 
services to serve Canada as a member of Parliament that one will 
disqualify oneself forever to serve on a board anywhere in the 
land.

	<B>Mr. Paul Mercier (Blainville-Deux-Montagnes, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Transport.
<P>
	Several decisions by the National Transportation Agency 
allowing CN and CP to abandon lines in Quebec will be 
implemented in 1995. The Quebec economic development 
professionals' association is concerned about the devastating 
impact of these decisions on regional development in Quebec 
and urges the minister to review these decisions by the agency.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, we understand very well the concerns expressed by my 
hon. colleague. However, he certainly understands that a 
minister cannot easily bypass the decisions made by a 
quasi-judicial agency. That would not be acceptable.
<P>
	In response to these concerns, we asked CN and CP, whenever 
the National Transportation Agency allows them to abandon rail 
lines, not to remove this infrastructure because we want to look 
for ways to maintain services in these regions. It is important not 
only in Quebec but across the country. We will try to maintain a 
moratorium on rail line removal until a national policy is in 
place.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Mercier (Blainville-Deux-Montagnes, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, does the minister not agree that he should review the 
National Transportation Agency's decisions on the basis not 
only of cost effectiveness but also of the impact of line 
abandonment on regional economic development? Should he 
not facilitate the takeover of some segments by local or regional 
organizations?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the question posed and even the suggestions contained 
in the remarks of my hon. colleague are very valid. I believe it is 
very important to make sure that we all understand the 
contribution that rail makes to regional development. The work 
of the Nault commission in looking at the commercialization of 
CN, the decision of the government to reject the unsolicited bid 
from CP, and our commitment to announce a national rail policy 
in 1995 reflects the kinds of concerns that were raised by the 
hon. member.
<P>
<B>(1450) </B>
<P>
	We will attempt to make sure that by encouraging CN and CP 
to leave the rail infrastructure in place, even though they have 
had the right to abandon it on the basis of a decision from the 
National Transportation Agency, it will help to address the 
concerns that were raised.
<P>
	I expect that all members on both sides of the House will want 
to make a contribution to the exercise that is under way now,

	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, automated weather observation systems are being 
installed at airports across the country to replace human 
observers. This is the same technology that is being used with 
automated lighthouses. I would have no problem with this as a 
cost saving measure if the system worked, but it does not.
<P>
	Why is the Minister of Transport prepared to jeopardize 
aviation and marine safety with unreliable technology that is 
being asked to do a job it was never designed for?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is not unusual for the hon. member to mix apples and 
oranges but the fact is that the destaffing of lighthouses is based 
on technology that has been used around the world. For 
example, in the United States of America there is one staffed 
lighthouse remaining and it is a historic site at Boston harbour.
<P>
	With respect to the AWOS concern, which is a very legitimate 
concern, I reassure the member, members of the House, and the 
travelling public in general that Transport Canada has reacted to 
the concerns raised by the aviation community. We are making 
certain that services are adequate. We have to deal in the light of 
the fact that the Air Transportation Association of Canada, the 
Canadian Professional Airline Association, the airlines 
themselves, would never fly into airports where there was not an 
adequate level of safety available to them.
<P>
	As important as the question is, I would not want to leave the 
impression raised by the hon. member's question that somehow 
there is an unsafe situation in the aviation industry in Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it happens that several airlines now refuse to fly into 
airports as alternates that use the AWOS system.
<P>
	Transport Canada recently agreed to put human weather 
observers back into Dorval and Edmonton municipal airports. 
This causes one to wonder why the safety of Canadians using 
those airports are more important than the safety of those using 
one of the 48 other AWOS sites and those of the coastal marine 
and aviation users.
<P>
	Will the minister agree to cancel destaffing of aviation 
weather observers and light stations until AWOS systems can be 
proven to work and are accepted by marine and aviation users?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the best measure is the support being provided by the 
aviation industry to the initiatives we are taking. I take 
exception to the hon. member's comment that some airlines are 
refusing to fly into specific areas where there are AWOS 
installations.
<P>
	I hear the hon. member saying ``speak to Canadian Airlines''. 
The hon. member used to be an air traffic controller so we know 
the system is already working better because he is here.
<P>
	The representative from Canadian Airlines who made the 
complaint about the AWOS happens to be a meteorologist. 
Again, we are trying to do the very best we can. I do not think it 
helps the situation in any way to suggest that the system in 
Canada is unsafe. We have the safest navigation system in the 
world.

my question is for the Minister responsible for Public Service 
Renewal.
<P>
	Almost daily there are rumours about thousands of cuts in the 
public service. These speculative reports leave the impression 
more of a demolition derby than a renewal of the public service.
<P>
	What exactly is the minister doing to keep our government's

treating the public service with respect, and to treating federal

<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy 
Council for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs

Mr. Speaker, the hon. member and myself would agree that we 
had and we still have one of the finest public services in the 
world and that we have to maintain its quality in order for it to be 
able to perform well in the future.
<P>
	The government has given a pledge that it would reduce 
involuntary layoffs to an absolute minimum and it will keep that 
pledge.
<P>
	In the program review we are looking at all the programs to 
make government more efficient in order to cut costs. There is 
no doubt that government will have to be downsized. However 
in that process we are always keeping in mind that the public 
service has to be kept efficient and able to perform its job. It has 
to be kept in a spirit that will permit it to respond to the 
challenges that it faces. We will do that.

	<B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Terrebonne, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of the Environment. In his recent 
report, the Auditor General mentions that after spending $26.6 
million, the federal government has still not solved an issue 
related to unproductive rent payments, this after 20 years. Those 
payments concern a Vancouver lot rented by the federal 
government, and more specifically by the Department of 
Environment, where an environmental centre was to be built. 
However, the project was abandoned in 1976.
<P>
	Can the minister tell us what action plan her department has to 
solve this issue, since this useless lot costs taxpayers $4.4 
million a year?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very glad that the

ministry I made arrangements to inform the band that future 
payments after this fiscal year should cease and desist.
<P>
	We have begun negotiations and in fact expect to conclude an 
agreement very shortly where in fact there will be no further 
federal payments made for this land. In a year we have solved

	<B>Mr. Paul E. Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Justice.
<P>
	On November 29 he produced four orders in council 
concerning prohibited weapons. Two court decisions should 
require the minister to lay these orders before the House at least 
30 sitting days before their effective date. His date of January 1 
would not even be close.
<P>
	Will the minister explain to the House why he has not 
complied with the law, section 116 of the Criminal Code?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the orders in council to 
which the hon. member refers were made not under section 116 
of the code, which does indeed require the procedure he has 
described, but rather under section 84 of the code which does 
not.
<P>
	Although there is a judicial decision of a trial court which 
holds that it is necessary even under section 84 to lay the 
regulations before the House, that decision is under appeal to the 
appellate division of the court in Alberta. We have every 
confidence that judgment was wrong in that respect and that we 
will succeed in the appeal.
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="INTERESTRATES">INTEREST RATES</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Audrey McLaughlin (Yukon, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Finance. It is with regard to the 
very unwelcome Christmas present that Canadians got with an 
increase in interest rates.
<P>
	Increasing interest rates have affected, as the minister himself 
said today, charges on the debt and deficit. They influence 
consumer confidence, farmers and small business. The 
government has been telling Canadians what they must cut back 
on. Would the minister consider a public review of monetary 
policy in the country and a review of the mandate of the Bank of 
Canada?
<P>
	Would the minister commit to undertaking such a public 
review before the budget of that mandate of the Bank of Canada 
and the interest rate policy?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, approximately 
one to two months after we first took office, the Government of 
Canada and the Bank of Canada entered into an agreement 
whereby we set the inflation targets which is very important in 
terms of monetary policy in the country and in terms of keeping 
inflation low.
<P>
	As you know, Mr. Speaker, keeping inflation low is a major 
asset toward the economic recovery of the country. What is 
crucial, if we are going to get interest rates low, is that we get the 
fundamentals right and that is job creation, investment in 
productivity, low inflation and the kinds of things we are now 
seeing within the Canadian economy.
<P>
<B>(1500 ) </B>
<P>
	We live in an interdependent world. No country is isolated 
from the effects of that. Getting the fundamentals right and the 
economy strong and cleaning up the finances of the country are 
by far the best ways of keeping interest rates low.

	<B>Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Don Valley North, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Human Resources 
Development. Every year on the job accidents cost the 
government and the economy about $10 billion. In these times 
of fiscal restraint it is important to find ways to cut costs.
<P>
	What action is the minister taking to eliminate waste and cut 
on the job accidents which currently total about $10 billion a 
year?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for a question which I think is both important and timely. We 
have noticed over the last several years there has been a trend 
line downward in the level of  occupational accidents and the 
level of compensation claims. We recognize that with a whole 
new series 
<P>

<B><A NAME="9065"> 9065 </A></B>
<P>
and new kinds of industrial and office based hazards growing, 
we are going to have to do more.
<P>
	One thing we did immediately was establish a 1-800 number 
that works out of the Centre for Occupational Health and Safety 
in the city of Hamilton to provide instantaneous information for 
all users of industrial kinds so they can find out what kinds of 
solutions and programs are necessary.
<P>
	One of the most important initiatives under the new labour 
side agreement under NAFTA is that we have now started a 
series of major conferences on occupational safety dealing with 
petrochemicals, construction and electronics so we can begin to 
share the knowledge and information of the three countries and 
begin to provide new standards.
<P>
	It is important, especially when we get into new office space 
hazards, ergonomics and other areas, that we begin to enlist the 
co-operation of business, labour and all levels of government to 
provide a new regime of occupational safety in the country.

<P>
	I would ask the minister to clarify this point. Is the air traffic 
control system safer because I am here in the House fighting 
against his unreasonable measures, or was it a direct personal 
attack on my abilities, in which case he must withdraw-

	<B>Hon. Sheila Finestone (Secretary of State 
(Multiculturalism) (Status of Women), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have just tabled the letter I sent to the following groups: the 
Chinese Canadian National Council, the German Canadian 
Congress, the Canadian Jewish Congress, the National 
Association of Canadians of Origins in India, the National 
Congress of Chinese Canadians, the National Congress of 
Italian Canadians, the Ukrainian Canadian Congress and the 
Canadian Ukrainian Civil Liberties Association.
<P>
	The letter conveys the government's decision on redress. This 
is not a decision the government has taken easily, but it is one 
that after much discussion reflects a commitment to building a 
more fair and equitable society.
<P>
	In the letter I wrote that as Canadians we are proud that our 
citizens trace their origins to every part of the world. Together 
we have built this country on the principles of fairness, 
generosity and compassion. Our history records the remarkable 
success we have achieved by applying those principles.
<P>
	Our history also records that at times we have strayed from 
them. There have been episodes that have caused suffering to 
people.

<P>
	In the crisis atmosphere of war, some Canadian ethnocultural 
communities found their loyalty questioned, their freedom 
restrained and their lives disrupted.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In the past Canada enforced some immigration practices that 
were at odds with our shared commitment to human justice. 
Canadians wish those episodes had never happened. We wish 
those practices had never occurred. We wish we could rewrite 
history. We wish we could relive the past. We cannot.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We can and we must learn from the past. We must ensure that 
future generations do not repeat the errors of the past.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Seeking to heal the wounds caused by the actions of previous 
governments, six ethnocultural communities have requested 
redress and compensation totalling hundreds of millions of 
dollars. The government understands the strong feelings 
underlying these requests. We share the desire to heal those 
wounds.
<P>
	The issue is whether the best way to do this is to attempt to 
address the past or to invest in the future. We believe our only 
choice lies in using limited government resources to create a 
more equitable society now and a better future for generations to 
come.
<P>
	Therefore the government will not grant financial 
compensation for the requests made. We believe our obligation 
lies in acting to prevent these wrongs from recurring. The 
government will continue to take concrete measures to 
strengthen the fabric of Canadian life by combating racism, 
prejudice and discrimination through education, information 
and the promotion of the values of fairness.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We have already made progress. The Canadian Charter of 
Rights and Freedoms now guarantees equal protection and 
benefit of the law without discrimination. Through the Canadian 
Multiculturalism Act, we are committed to the full and equitable 
participation of individuals and communities of all origins in 
shaping Canada's destiny.
<P>
	By passing the Canadian Human Rights Act and upholding the 
international convention on the elimination of all forms of racial 
discrimination, we have taken another step in entrenching the 
principle of equality.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The letter goes on to say a further major step forward is the 
establishment of the Canadian race relations foundation. The 
government will proclaim the act establishing the foundation in 
the spring of 1995. The foundation, first proposed a decade ago, 
will play a  fundamental role in moving toward the elimination 
of racial discrimination in Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We honour the contribution of all those communities whose 
members, often in the face of hardship, persevered in building 
our country.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Together we must ensure that all Canadians can face the future 
with pride in Canada, in our values and in their own heritage. We 
are a nation of inclusion. Our task is to strive together to 
guarantee that the actions of the country match the principles of 
its people.

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, first 
of all, I would like to point out to the secretary of state that we 
received a copy of her statement barely an hour and a half ago. 
We think that is unreasonably short notice and the government 
has a strange way of proceeding, to say the least.
<P>
	Be that as it may, I am pleased to speak today on this 
important matter. Indeed, it is wrong to minimize the suffering 
of several Canadian cultural communities caused by Canada's 
reprehensible behaviour towards them, as was the case in the 
climate of crisis due to the war.
<P>
	Canada shamefully deviated from the principles of justice, 
compassion and generosity which always guided its behaviour 
towards all its citizens from all over the world who have 
contributed greatly to its enrichment.
<P>
	The government's decision not to pay financial compensation 
to the cultural communities that asked for redress is totally 
irresponsible. Instead of excusing the past, the government must 
face the truth. Some members of these communities were 
incarcerated in makeshift camps, the property of some was 
seized, others lost their jobs; in short, their most basic rights 
were literally violated.
<P>
	What is the government's response to them? We are sorry for 
the past and we must now get on with the future. What a 
response.
<P>
	Does the government realize that many people still live today 
with the scars from what happened then? What message is the 
government giving all those affected by what Canada did? That 
the country does not face up to its responsibilities and hides 
behind pious platitudes.
<P>
	On the contrary, the Bloc Quebecois thinks that there should 
be fair financial compensation for all those citizens who were 
considered to be outright enemies of Canada. The government 
must make fair financial restitution to these people and 
communities. The desire of the leaders of these communities for 
real 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9067"> 9067 </A></B>
<P>
restitution must be respected. The government must 
immediately go back on its decision.
<P>
	On behalf of all members of the Bloc Quebecois, I wish to 
repeat how important we consider the cultural communities in 
Canada and Quebec to be; their contribution to our societies 
points the way to the collective development of us all.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
this fall I had the privilege of speaking at a symposium in Banff 
hosted by the Ukrainian Canadian Civil Liberties Association. 
Members of the association were asking the government to 
recognize injustices that had been taken against their group 
during World War I.
<P>
	In the early 1900s thousands of people came to Canada from 
all over the world. Many of these settlers had come from 
Austria-Hungary, fleeing their oppressive government. When 
the first world war broke out these people were declared aliens 
and were made to report weekly to the government. Failure to do 
so resulted in arrest and deportation to labour camps.
<P>
	Unfortunately this treatment was not limited to people from 
Austria-Hungary. As the minister explained, people from 
various ethnic backgrounds were treated in a similar fashion and 
the only reason they were treated so poorly was their 
membership in a group, in these cases an ethnic group.
<P>
	I am elated to see the Liberals following the lead established 
by the Reform Party. They recognize as we do that Canada has 
never entered a war spontaneously or without great 
consideration. Canadians prefer peace and mediation to the 
horrors and atrocities of war. Further, Canadians cherish the 
equal rights of all individuals in society and recognize that they 
should not be compromised.
<P>
	It is not possible to determine who has been negatively 
affected by these government decisions or exactly by how much. 
Giving money to these groups to redress the mistakes of the past 
would not fix those mistakes. We do need to look to today and to 
the future to ensure that the rights of Canadians are not unjustly 
compromised. The secretary of state has suggested that she will 
proclaim the Canadian race relations foundation in order for the 
government to avoid making the same mistakes again.
<P>
	Unfortunately the Canadian race relations foundation will not 
meet this noble goal. The Canadian race relations foundation 
will cost $24 million just in an initial capital output and it is 
suggested that its yearly operating costs will be several millions 
of dollars.
<P>
<B>(1515 ) </B>
<P>
	However it is not just because of costs alone that we oppose 
the foundation. We have some of the same concerns expressed 
by the Liberals when they were in opposition. Let me remind the 
House of some of their earlier criticisms.
<P>
	The member for Winnipeg North suggested that the 
foundation should not exist because the responsibility for the 
program could be accomplished elsewhere. He stated: ``Social 
harmony cannot be created by posters, proclamations or literary 
contests or even by co-operation between business and 
government or direct government action. The real challenge is 
in the hearts and minds of each of us as individuals''.
<P>
	This foundation will have over 30 GIC appointments; yet 
another opportunity for patronage at its worst.
<P>
	The member for Eglinton-Lawrence stated: ``One of the 
most important questions is: How do we finance some of the 
philosophies the minister says this foundation addresses?''
<P>
	The member for Scarborough-Agincourt when in opposition 
also criticized the foundation. He said the foundation ``gives the 
minister a great impact on the direction taken by this 
organization and could lead to it becoming nothing more than a 
mouthpiece for government policy. It could lead to the 
assumption that the foundation is more of a political 
organization than one of a proactive association for the needs of 
the furtherance of race relations''. He continued to say that ``the 
funds available for this foundation will act only as a vehicle for 
the government of the day to put out its policies and to place into 
position people who are supporting it. Probably it will be the 
president of the foundation, somebody who has raised funds for 
the government''.
<P>
	This foundation is required by law to be housed in Toronto. 
The Liberals criticized this fact as well. Winnipeg is the most 
multicultural city in Canada yet it has been given no 
consideration as a possible site.
<P>
	The motherhood ideology of multiculturalism and 
anti-racism is noble. However support for the programs caring 
for the policies is already in place. Consider the efforts and 
positive results accomplished by the Canadian Human Rights 
Commission. This in conjunction with programs in the 
Department of Citizenship and Immigration and the Charter of 
Rights and Freedoms has taken Canada a long way toward 
reaching the goals of a tolerant society.

	<B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Terrebonne, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
my pleasure to present this petition signed by 1,200 students of a 
secondary school in my riding. It asks one thing only: that the 
government keep its promise. And I am keeping my promise to 
the students of this school to present their petition in the House 
and to read it.
<P>
	I will be brief. These students tell us that every day on earth 
40,000 children die of starvation and illness, and that at the 
world summit for children the leaders of this country promised 
to reduce the number of children who leave this earth 
prematurely. These students also ask the government-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> As the member knows I of course 
accept his good faith, but has the petition been deemed 
admissible?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Sauvageau:</B> It has been accepted and approved.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Fine.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Sauvageau:</B> Our whip taught us well Mr. Speaker, and we 
respect the rules on tabling documents in this House.
<P>
	The students also told us that every year, on this planet earth, 
countless numbers of women die giving birth to children. The 
government undertook to reduce the number of such mortalities.
<P>
	The government also undertook to help children in war-torn 
countries, to help children who wanted a normal education, and 
to respect the work done by children.
<P>
	For all these promises made by the government, I present this 
petition, signed by 1,200 students of the École polyvalente 
Paul-Arseneau.

These petitioners from 28 organizations object to the use of 
voice mail in serving seniors. This much criticized technolohy is 
definitely not suited to seniors.
<P>
	Indeed, seniors are entitled to proper service, especially when 
they have inquiries to make about income security. I agree with 
them and together, we call upon Parliament to kindly ask the

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cummins:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. On 
September 28 I put a question on the Order Paper to the Minister 
of Fisheries and Oceans concerning the possible conflict of 
interest of members appointed to the Fraser River Sockeye 
Review Board. The board has started public hearings and I have 
yet to receive a reply.
<P>
	The chair of the review board is a public servant who serves at 
the sufferance of the government. At least two board members 
have proposals before government departments. One board 
member is actively promoting his proposal in the hearings. At 
least two board members sit on various department of fisheries 
advisory boards.
<P>
	It is vital for the minister to respond to this question on the 
independence of his inquiry. My question deserves an 
immediate answer.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Mr. Speaker, there are many deserving 
questions on the Order Paper and I know that ministers are 
working assiduously to provide competent accurate and full 
answers to all the questions.
<P>
	I know that the minister of fisheries will have heard the 
representations of the hon. member today and I am optimistic 
that soon we will have an answer for him.
<P>
	Perhaps we could go back to my original point on Starred 
Questions Nos. 97, 98, and 100, please. The answers are as 
follows.
<P>
	The information held by the Department of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development on the band council's expenditures is 
contained in the financial statements supplied by the band. The 
information is confidential financial information from a third 
party and as such cannot be disclosed without the band's consent 
under the terms of section 20 of the Access to Information Act.
<P>
	With respect to Starred Question No. 98, I should advise that 
the answer is identical to that in No. 97.
<P>
	With respect to Starred Question No. 100 the answer is as 
follows.
<P>
	It is not possible for us to verify the percentage of 13.6 per 
cent. The band's budget increased in part as a result of the 
introduction in 1991 of the new funding formula for the 
economic development program.
<P>
	The band's funding for social assistance also increased as a 
result of the band taking over the delivery of social assistance to 
all beneficiaries on reserve in 1992. Moreover the funding for 
the post-secondary program has also increased.
<P>
	I ask that the remaining questions stand.

	<B>Mrs. Brown (Calgary Southeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a 
point of order. In viewing the motions on the Order Paper this

read: ``That Bill C-53 be amended in clause 7'' and not clause 4 
as it is reported. I would like the assurance that this will be 
corrected in <I>Hansard</I>.

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to have the opportunity today to discuss the 
amendments moved by my colleague from 
Rimouski-Témiscouata and myself concerning Bill C-53, on 
the Department of Canadian Heritage.
<P>
	I do so with pleasure, because the amendments proposed by 
the official opposition well reflect one of Quebec's traditional 
demands from the government in Ottawa. Indeed, the very 
essence of the proposed amendments-and we make no mystery 
of it-is the recognition of Quebec's cultural specificity and 
identity.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	In so doing, we propose that the federal government and the 
House of Commons at the very least recognize the fields in 
which Quebec has exclusive jurisdiction. Once it has recognized 
them, we ask that it respect them.
<P>
	Bill C-53 as written is seriously deficient, first of all, because 
it fails to recognize the existence of more than one national 
identity on Canadian territory. We refer in  particular to clauses 
4 and 5 concerning Canadian identity, Canadian values, 
Canadian culture and Canadian heritage.
<P>
	I have already had the opportunity several times in this House 
to express my opinion that no unified Canadian culture exists, 
since efforts are still being made to define, discover and grasp it. 
We also note a glaring omission in the bill. Indeed, no mention is 
made of the Quebec and native cultures and identities. Why? For 
what secret reason is the government systematically ignoring 
those very real and important cultures? Is it to eliminate them? 
Is it to better promote a new product, as though this was a mere 
marketing strategy? There has to be a reason. Maybe some day 
we, mere mortals, will be worthy of that knowledge.
<P>
	The vast majority of Quebecers do not agree with this 
legislation. Let me quote some testimony heard by the Standing 
Committee on Canadian Heritage.
<P>
	I will quote officials from Quebec organizations which 
represent a very large number of people, because their opinions 
carry more weight. I will start with the Mouvement Québec 
français, whose members are the Montreal Teachers Alliance, 
the Association québécoise des professeurs de français, the 
Centrale de l'enseignement du Québec, the Confederation of 
National Trade Unions, the Fédération des travailleurs du 
Québec, the Mouvement national des Québécois, the Société 
Saint-Jean-Baptiste de Montréal, the Union des artistes, the 
Union des écrivains québécois and, last but not least, the Union 
des producteurs agricoles.
<P>
	Together, these groups represent a very large segment of the 
Quebec population. Here is what their spokesman, Guy 
Bouthillier, had to say:
<P>
	``In this bill, everything related to culture is labelled under the 
heading Canadian identity. Indeed, nowhere is there any 
reference to Quebec and its culture. From the federal 
government's point of view, there are only one culture and one 
identity: the Canadian ones. This will come as a surprise only to 
those who still believed that there was some basis-as well as 
some honesty on the part of those who oppose that notion-for 
the concept of a distinct society. This bill will at least have the 
merit of dissipating any lingering illusion. Beyond the fine 
rhetoric, there is the written word, the legislation, which will 
prevail in the end''.
<P>
	Needless to say, the Mouvement Québec français rejects this 
legislation.
<P>
	François Rocher, an associate professor of political science at 
Carleton University in Ontario, said this: ``The government's 
approach is part of an unfinished process to build a national 
identity by denying existing realities in Canada''.
<P>
	He went on to say that the only option that would be both 
acceptable to Quebec and potentially beneficial to the other 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9075"> 9075 </A></B>
<P>
provinces of Canada would be to revert to the duality 
concept-at least in the case of Quebec-and to accept the 
political consequences of such a decision.
<P>
	I may add that Professor Rocher submitted his analysis of the 
bill in his professional capacity and not as someone representing 
a nationalist organization from Quebec.
<P>
	On the other hand, one of the best known organizations in 
Quebec is the Saint-Jean-Baptiste Society of Montreal, also a 
member of the Mouvement Québec français, as I mentioned 
earlier.
<P>
	In their brief, they said, among other things, that they were 
firmly opposed to Canadian multiculturalism and to legislation 
that would enshrine intrusions by the Government of Canada 
into Quebec's cultural life. The culture of the people of Quebec 
must not be subordinated to the priorities of the culture of 
another people, the people of Canada. This bill is centralist in 
design and a threat to Quebec's distinct identity. It was a bill that 
would be forced down people's throats, over the almost 
unanimous objections of Quebecers to a concentration of 
authority over cultural matters in Ottawa and to a view of 
national identity that was designed to submerge Quebec's 
identity, according to the brief. It is all there, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
	It is clear that all intervenors from Quebec who examined this 
bill condemned the centralist vision underlying the federal 
government's intentions. The problem is not new. It has been 
with us for a long time. What surprises me is that these people 
are still willing to come to Ottawa to express their views as 
Quebecers. After years of struggle, one would expect them to 
stop trying. However, they are anxious for their friends in 
Canada to understand the differences that make Quebec distinct, 
a distinctness that will soon be expressed in a new status for 
Quebec, that of a sovereign state.
<P>
	I want to take this opportunity to thank these people for 
spending all this time and effort to attend the committee's 
hearings. I want them to know their efforts were greatly 
appreciated.
<P>
	I also want to mention the entirely unacceptable attitude of 
some committee members who consistently stayed away when 
witnesses from Quebec testified before the committee, which 
merely confirms the general lack of interest for Quebec's 
concerns. This attitude is reflected in the wording of the bill and 
has always been present in relations between Quebec and 
Ottawa. It is not just a lack of courtesy. It reflects a complete 
lack of interest and consideration. This is very sad.
<P>
	Members from Canada had a chance to become better 
acquainted with their future neighbour. They did not take 
advantage of this opportunity and as a result may not understand 
that the purpose of our amendments is the very basis of our 
determined opposition on this bill. Another perfect example of 
the two solitudes, although the Minister of Canadian Heritage 
denied this when he appeared before our committee.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to speak at report stage to Bill C-53. I have proposed 
14 amendments and present these as common sense changes. We 
are told the bill is a simple housekeeping matter, but I suggest 
this is not the case. The bill should not be passed in its present 
form and the amendments suggested will improve it.
<P>
	The first glaring omission is the requirement by the 
department to submit an annual report. We have heard all the 
rhetoric from the Liberal side of the House on how accountable 
it is to Canadians, yet despite this it has neglected to include a 
clause requiring the department to explain its actions to 
Canadians.
<P>
	The Auditor General has made it clear that Canadians and 
members of Parliament require more access to information 
about the operations of government than what was presently 
received. In light of this it is hard to understand why the 
government has chosen to move in a direction away from 
reporting of this kind.
<P>
	We have heard in response to our concerns on this issue that 
information on the departments may be included in the 
estimates. However, this is unacceptable for a number of 
reasons. First, the estimates are prepared to outline in general 
terms the proposed spending priorities of the department, 
whereas an annual report provides information about how the 
money was spent. This is an important difference.
<P>
	Second, an annual report will include a description of the 
plans and priorities for the future and an evaluation of whether 
former plans and priorities have been met. Such information is 
not contained in the estimates.
<P>
	Third, the only assurance the House has that information 
which was formerly contained in the annual reports will be 
included in the estimates is a promise from the 
government-cold comfort indeed.
<P>
	The bill is meant to streamline government and to get rid of 
bureaucratic redundancies. However consider the following. 
The inclusion of parks, natural marine conservation areas, 
historic canals and copyright create an array of confusion and 
wasted money.
<P>
	During the review of the bill at committee we heard testimony 
regarding parks. The managing director of the association for 
mountain parks protection and enjoyment provided for the 
committee a balanced review of parks. His presentation did not 
promote a vision from either of the extremes on the issue. He did 
not promote a tree hugger approach to parks, which advocates a 
zero usage mandate for parks. Nor did he promote an 
industrialist approach, which advocates unsustainable parks 
use. The position suggested was one of compromise between 
industry and sustainability. He said: ``Many Canadians have 
questioned why the government moved Parks Canada from the 
Department 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9076"> 9076 </A></B>
<P>
of the Environment to a new and seemingly unfocused 
Department of Canadian Heritage. Over the previous 14 years 
Parks Canada had established a firm position within the DOE as 
the leader  and innovator in matters affecting the environment. I 
have proposed an amendment which will delete from the bill all 
references to Parks Canada. This will allow us to move it to DOE 
where it belongs''.
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
	The same arguments can be made for natural marine 
conservation areas. Why should the Department of Canadian 
Heritage be responsible for natural marine conservation areas? 
It makes no sense. Presently transport looks after historic 
canals. I fail to understand why we are going to pass a bill that 
will add jurisdictional headaches, in this case specifically to 
canals. Again this is needless, wasteful duplication.
<P>
	I have also proposed amendments which would have the effect 
of deleting from the bill the references to copyright which it now 
contains. As the American model demonstrates, the last thing 
that artists need is a bloated bureaucracy which fights over 
jurisdiction for copyright responsibilities. The most effective 
assistance to artists is to take the responsibility for copyright 
and to lay it squarely within one department. In this instance I 
believe that department to be industry.
<P>
	Bill C-53 gives the minister jurisdictional powers over the 
promotion of greater understanding of human rights, 
fundamental freedoms, related values and multiculturalism. No 
one would disagree with the nobility of the intent behind these 
statements, just as no one would disagree with the statement that 
racism is bad.
<P>
	However, our concern remains with the number of ministers 
responsible for these programs. Presently they are covered by 
immigration, justice, health, heritage and who knows how many 
others. This kind of administrative overlap is wasteful and 
needless.
<P>
	We have proposed an amendment which would transfer to the 
regions responsibility for national languages. When reviewing 
the bill at committee we heard a number of witnesses who 
criticized the federal government's language policy. The 
Liberals did not call a single witness to defend the policy. This 
can only be because it is so hard to find someone to defend it.
<P>
	Regarding language policy, we recommend the bill include a 
clause which would read the minister has jurisdiction over the 
promotion of language policies centred first on freedom of 
speech, second on recognition of the French language in Quebec 
and the English language in other provinces; third on 
recognition of bilingualism in key federal institutions such as 
the Parliament of Canada and the Supreme Court of Canada; and 
fourth, on recognition of bilingualism where the number of 
citizens is sufficient to warrant the provision of services in both 
official languages.
<P>
	The Prime Minister has stated that in order to help bring the 
deficit down he wishes to replace duplication within the 
provinces. The amendment will do just that. It recognizes that 
the primary responsibility for languages should remain in the 
regions and the provinces.
<P>
	Members of my party have been pointing out the wasteful 
spending of special interest grants since we arrived in this House 
and for seven years before our arrival. Clause 7(a) of the bill 
gives the minister the authority to issue grants, contributions 
and endowments.
<P>
	The amendment I present finally puts an end to the special 
interest funding that Canadians have come to resent. The only 
people who defend these grants are those who receive them. 
Surely their opinions should be questionable because of an 
obvious conflict of interest. When we ask Canadians who do not 
receive these grants how they feel about them their answers are 
always the same. They do not understand why their tax dollars 
should be spent on small groups of people with narrow agendas, 
especially when that money could be spent in better ways like 
reducing the deficit and debt and to help protect programs such 
as health care.
<P>
	Finally, the government has put in the bill clause 8 which will 
give the Minister of Canadian Heritage the unilateral authority 
to raise revenues by arbitrarily raising fees for services or 
facilities. According to the Financial Administration Act, the 
minister must take such decisions to cabinet. Such a 
requirement is the minimal process to be followed for the 
accountability and transparency of fee increases. Now with 
clause 8 of the bill, the minister will be able to raise any fees he 
chooses. He must only consult with the relevant party. What 
does that mean?
<P>
	Our amendments bring a nominal level of accountability to 
government. I seek the support of the House to the changes we 
recommend.
<P>
<B>(1605) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> If 
we are proposing this many amendments, Mr. Speaker, it is 
chiefly because the bill, as it stands, is really unacceptable to us.
<P>
	I would like to address in particular the amendment we have 
proposed on copyrights, as we would like to have copyright 
throughout federal jurisdiction brought under the Department of 
Canadian Heritage. We feel this amendment is essential for the 
following reason: shared responsibility for copyright by the two 
departments causes undue delay in reviewing the Copyright Act.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9077"> 9077 </A></B>
<P>
	When they testified before us last Monday, representatives 
of the artists' union told us that they have been waiting for 
politicians to get around to amending the Copyright Act for 
eight years.
<P>
	On December 22, 1993, the director general of the Montreal 
artists' union, Mr. Demers, wrote the Prime Minister to tell him 
that this sharing of responsibility by two departments has led to 
a two-headed vision, which has resulted in objectives that were 
more often than not contradictory. The Copyright Act is the only 
legislation protecting the rights of creative artists. We believe 
that it should be designed around this priority. Since it is in the 
interest of creative artists that consumers have unrestricted 
access to their works, the Department of Canadian Heritage will 
certainly not lose sight of their unique interests. We need only 
review existing legislation in other countries to see that 
protecting the rights of creative artists in no way impedes the 
circulation of their works, quite the contrary.
<P>
	Another reason for presenting this amendment is that the 
Department of Industry is mandated to look after the interests of 
consumers and corporations, a responsibility that interferes 
with the interests of creative artists. The cultural industry is like 
any other industry, according to the Department of Industry.
<P>
	During the proceedings of the industry committee, the 
director general of corporate governance at the Department of 
Industry, David Tobin, testified as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Our view, of course, is that cultural groups are exactly that. They are a 
cultural industry and we recognize them as that. There are employment and 
financial considerations. They are adding value to it. When you ask whether 
we treat them differently, I would argue that we consult with them, we share 
information with them, and we discuss their concerns. I do not think we 
treat them any differently.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This raises a doubt in my mind: what will happen in the next 
rounds of negotiations if we are unable to really defend our 
cultural industries, if we do not see them at the outset as clearly 
different from other industries? What will happen then with the 
GATT agreements we had such a hard time securing, at the very 
last minute this time around.
<P>
	Another reason is that the industry minister does have legal 
responsibility for copyright matters. They tried several times to 
convince us that the responsibility was shared between the two 
departments, that the two ministers would address the issue, and 
that the Department of Industry works with the Department of 
Canadian Heritage. The deputy minister who testified on behalf 
of the Department of Canadian Heritage said that they were 100 
per cent responsible for drafting the bills.
<P>
	Some responsible individuals with the same mandate at the 
Department of Industry told the industry committee that their 
goal-as Mr. Finckenstein stated-was to consolidate the four 
old departments into a single one and to combine the four old 
laws into a single one. That was to create the Department of 
Industry. This bill  reflects the situation that prevailed under the 
old legislation.
<P>
	The old legislation included the Copyright Act, which came 
under the Department of Consumer and Corporate Affairs; 
responsibility for it has now been given to the Department of 
Industry. Let me say that the old Department of 
Communications Act does not contain a single reference to 
copyright. The only law which refers to it is the Department of 
Consumer and Corporate Affairs Act. We now find this same 
reference in the Department of Industry Act.
<P>
	This clearly suggests that the Department of Canadian 
Heritage will have no jurisdiction over copyright, despite what 
we may have been told and what the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage himself may have said.
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	Another reason is that the heritage department's mandate is to 
promote cultural development. We saw that very clearly in the 
brief from the Union des artistes, which said: ``Since the role of 
this department is to look after identity, values, cultural 
development and heritage, we think that it is logical, fitting and 
obvious that this department defends and promotes the rights of 
those without whom the above concepts are meaningless''.
<P>
	Surprisingly, during the election campaign which brought it 
to power, the Liberal Party answered a questionnaire from the 
Canadian Conference of the Arts, dated October 4. Two 
questions drew my attention because the answers were 
particularly interesting.
<P>
	The Liberal Party was asked if it would make it a priority to 
revise the Copyright Act so that this law would really defend the 
financial and moral rights of writers. The Liberal Party 
answered that revising the Copyright Act would be a priority for 
it. ``We will ensure above all that writers reap the just rewards of 
their work at the same time as we facilitate access to material 
protected by copyright. Liberals understand the importance of 
copyright. That is why, when we reorganize the administrative 
structure'', which we are now doing with this bill, ``we will 
review the Conservatives' decision to divide jurisdiction over 
copyright between two departments''.
<P>
	I am really sad to see the Liberal Party, which had made a 
formal commitment to establish a single department and to 
correct the mistake made by the Conservatives, perpetuate that 
mistake through Bill C-53. I am sad to see that it gives priority 
to the industry rather than to creators. Soon, Canada will no 
longer be a place for creators, because the industry will have 
taken precedence over creativity.
<P>
	Another reason why the government should accept the 
amendment which we propose is expressed, once again, by the 
Canadian Conference of the Arts: ``The cultural sector has a 
long experience of the paralysis resulting from the sharing of 
responsibility in key sectors. Suffice it to mention the dead end 
in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9078"> 9078 </A></B>
<P>
which the copyright  legislation is stuck, precisely because of 
this fragmentation of jurisdiction''.
<P>
	As recently as yesterday, we saw an example of the difference 
between two departments can be and perhaps what a minister 
with clout can do. When we pressured the heritage minister on 
broadcasting and cable television companies, he said: ``I cannot 
intervene''. However, when major companies asked the 
government to order the CRTC to review the decision to approve 
a $2 increase, the government said: ``Yes, that decision will be 
reviewed''. Not because that decision is costly for the poor, but 
because it affects major companies. That is the problem: When 
it comes to defending real causes, the Liberal Party does not 
deliver. It does not fulfill the promises it made on cultural 
development and copyrights.
<P>
	I deplore this situation and I hope that, before the end of the 
debate, the government will have the courage to postpone the 
passing of this bill, which really does not benefit Canadian 
culture and creative artists. I also hope that the minister, who 
probably hears our plea somewhere, will take these factors into 
consideration for the future of Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Eugène Bellemare (Carleton-Gloucester, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I was surprised and even disappointed to hear the 
motions presented by the hon. member for Calgary Southeast, 
who calls herself a Canadian first but, at the first opportunity, is 
not averse to lashing out at French Canadian minorities.
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	Bill C-53, an Act to establish the Department of Canadian 
Heritage and to amend and repeal certain other Acts, says in 
clause 4(<I>g</I>), which the hon. member for Calgary Southeast 
would like to redraft in her image, that the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage wants to see ``the advancement of the equality of status 
and use of English and French and the enhancement and 
development of English and French linguistic minority 
communities in Canada''.
<P>
	The hon. member for Calgary Southeast proposes that lines 23 
to 27 be replaced with the following: ``<I>(g)</I> the promotion of 
language policies centred: (i) on freedom of speech''. I wonder 
whether the hon. member for Calgary Southeast realizes what 
she is saying. Freedom of speech is not about the language you 
speak but the ideas you want to share with others. She does not 
even understand the principle of the freedom of speech to which 
people are entitled in Canada.
<P>
	Second, she recommends the following: ``on recognition of 
the French language in Quebec and the English language in the 
other provinces''. This is horrifying, coming from a person who 
calls herself a Canadian but would like to see only Quebec as 
French speaking and the other provinces, and I say the other 
provinces and not the rest of Canada, as English-speaking.
<P>
	As a French speaking member from Ontario, a fourth 
generation franco Ontarian, I say to the hon. member, through 
the Chair, that her proposals are an affront and an insult. As a 
French Canadian and a francophone, do I not have the right to 
speak my own language and receive services in that language? 
You would take away these rights. It is utterly despicable to want 
to take away those rights, and to tell anglophones in Quebec: 
From now on, you will have to speak French if you want services 
or whatever.
<P>
	I would ask the hon. member's colleague to repeat what he 
just said. Was that a racist comment, sir? Would you repeat what 
you said?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Order. I did not hear the remarks. Dear 
colleagues, this is a very important debate. If all members could 
just keep their cool and their comments to themselves, this 
would benefit us all, as Canadians.
<P>
	I give the floor back to the hon. member for 
Carleton-Gloucester.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellemare:</B> Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for this reminder. I 
can assure you that it is rather difficult to keep your cool when 
your language rights are violated, when you are told that you 
will no longer be allowed to speak your language, except in the 
stables or in the privacy of your own home, in the shed or while 
mowing the lawn. From now on, I would not be allowed to speak 
French in my province of Ontario that is so dear to me or to 
request certain services in French when travelling to Calgary. I 
regret to say that the hon. member is far from kind.
<P>
	Her third suggestion deals with ``recognition of bilingualism 
in key federal institutions, such as the Parliament of Canada and 
the Supreme Court of Canada''. She and her colleagues from the 
Reform Party, whom I have observed, especially on the official 
languages committee, do not understand the first thing about the 
Official Languages Act, nor do they understand what 
bilingualism is about.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	They do not understand what bilingualism is about. They 
confuse official languages and bilingualism. They are under the 
impression that laws are made here to force anglophones to 
speak French for example. That is not it. The hon. member, on 
the other hand, would like to force me to become, if possible, 
unilingual and speak English only. There is nothing wrong with 
being a unilingual English speaking member of Parliament, but 
personally, as a franco Ontarian, I would rather be francophone, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9079"> 9079 </A></B>
<P>
franco Ontarian and bilingual, and have respect for English 
Canadians as well as French Canadians.
<P>
	Bilingualism, dear lady, is for people who put themselves at 
the service of others.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I think it was pointed out at least five 
times that members should address their remarks to the chair. 
We would then avoid problems like this. I would ask the hon. 
member to address his comments to the chair, please.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellemare:</B> Mr. Speaker, you are right, I will address my 
remarks to you, but I will refer to the hon. member. I know that 
to the hon. member, who probably does not understand French 
and certainly does not speak it, the word ``madam'' may sound 
very negative and even derogatory. I wanted to pay her a 
compliment, but she does not want me to. Perhaps she is not a 
lady. I do not know, but I do know that she is an elected member.
<P>
	So from now on I will refer to her as the hon. member for 
Calgary Southeast, who is against bilingualism and against 
francophones outside Quebec. Bilingualism is for those who 
want to serve the country. Bilingualism is for those who want to 
serve the people of their country. Bilingualism is for those who 
want to do business with other countries, English speaking 
countries and French-speaking countries alike.
<P>
	There are about one billion anglophones and francophones 
around the globe. One billion. People who become bilingual are 
an asset to Canada, but dear lady-excuse me, the hon. member 
for Calgary Southeast-is not interested in principles or in 
Canadian history. I am sure that she does not spend her evenings 
reading about Jacques Cartier, Champlain or Montcalm. She 
thinks that Canadian history started when she was born and that 
regulations should always be based on financial considerations. 
She does not give a hoot about anglophone minorities in Quebec 
and francophone minorities outside Quebec. I find her remarks 
totally deplorable and un-Canadian.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hugh Hanrahan (Edmonton-Strathcona, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to stand before the House and discuss 
the report stage of Bill C-53.
<P>
	Bill C-53, as I mentioned during the first and second reading, 
is riddled with problems which are quite evident if we look at the 
number of motions that have been put forward by the Reform 
Party and the Bloc Quebecois. Because of time constraints, I 
will attempt to keep my comments extremely brief and focus 
solely on the motions before us.
<P>
	Motion No. 2 deals with the removal of clause 4 in section 
2(a). While I am in no way against ``the promotion of the greater 
understanding of human rights, fundamental freedoms and 
related values''. I am against the idea of having more than one 
minister responsible for these issues. In fact I wholeheartedly 
believe that the Department of Justice is better suited to ensure 
the noble intentions of this clause.
<P>
<B>(1625 ) </B>
<P>
	Passage of Motion No. 3 would result in the elimination of 
multiculturalism from the bill. I believe that the continued 
funding of programs like this will ensure a Liberal defeat in the 
next election. Canadians want less government, not more. They 
want to see the government manage its allocation of revenues 
and stop running up astronomical debts and deficits.
<P>
	In short, what they are looking for is a government to priorize 
its spending programs to ensure that everyone is maximizing the 
benefits from his or her tax dollars.
<P>
	Government funded multiculturalism programs do nothing to 
address this fundamental attitude toward government spending 
and programs. In fact, the Liberals seem more content to raise 
Canadian taxes than they are to control spending. We have a 
spending problem in Canada, not a revenue problem. Therefore 
not only is multiculturalism financially unsound but in fact it is 
politically unsound as well.
<P>
	As a member of the standing committee on heritage I have had 
the pleasure of listening to witnesses describe the multicultural 
funded programs as a poor way to promote culture. Moreover, I 
have heard and talked to many Canadians who believe that 
multiculturalism does nothing but make us all hyphenated 
Canadians focusing on what separates and not what binds us 
together. Its day has come and gone and it is time that the 
Liberals face up to this fact.
<P>
	Motions 5 and 21 deal with an issue that is also of great 
concern to the Reform Party. I am speaking of overlap and 
duplication. Why should one department oversee areas which 
should be under another portfolio such as national parks and 
marine conservation areas, or even historical canals. It should 
be our goal as parliamentarians to do everything in our power to 
decrease the amount of bureaucracy and administer services in 
each department by themselves.
<P>
	Motions 5 and 21 will be a step in the right direction. They 
will allow parks and conservation to go back to the Department 
of the Environment and historic canals to return to 
transportation.
<P>
	Historical canals belong to the department of transportation 
for the simple reason that they are administered by and are 
subject to the regulations of the department of transportation. A 
perfect example would be the Ottawa canal. It is a historical 
canal yet it is still in use and therefore subject to the rules and 
regulations of the department of transportation. Therefore why 
is it in the department of heritage?
<P>
	Motion No. 6 has been clearly stated and illustrated in the 
Reform Party's blue book policies. Essentially we believe that 
there is no need for the official bilingualism policy. We feel 
there should be a policy based on territorial bilingualism where 
bilingual services will be maintained and supported where 
numbers warrant. That is the reason we have recognized the 
need for bilingualism especially in key federal institutions such 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9080"> 9080 </A></B>
<P>
as  Parliament and the Supreme Court which are explicitly 
outlined in Motion No. 6.
<P>
	Clause 7(a) of Bill C-53 is of extreme concern to me as it 
allows the ministers to facilitate the implementation of any 
program and the minister also to provide financial assistance in 
the form of grants, contributions and endowments to any person. 
The concern arises from the idea that the minister may at his or 
her discretion provide financial assistance in the form of grants, 
contributions and endowments. Where are the checks and 
balances? Where is the accountability? Where is the financial 
control? Where is the openness and transparency?
<P>
	Another concern relates to the fact that the minister could be 
allowed to implement other programs, such as multicultural 
programs, unilaterally. This would not only be unacceptable to 
me, to the Reform Party, my constituents, but also to a majority 
of Canadians.
<P>
	Motion No. 12 would alleviate this concern as far as it relates 
to clause 7. Directly related to clause 7(a), clause 8 should be 
eliminated. Clause 8 deals directly with the notion that the 
minister can fix fees and charges which the minister considers 
appropriate. Again, what happened to accountability and 
openness or checks and balances?
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	Prior to the bill the minister was responsible and subject to 
any regulations that Treasury Board made. After Bill C-53, the 
minister may or may not be subject to these regulations as set 
out by Treasury Board. It is unclear and therefore it should be 
removed.
<P>
	Although for the most part Treasury Board is no more than a 
rubber stamp in terms of approval for rate increases or fees or 
changes, there is still an institutional check on the powers of the 
ministry.
<P>
	Motions Nos. 14, 15, 16, 18 and 19 alleviate the concerns 
which the Reform Party has outlined in clause 8 regarding the 
accountability and powers of a minister.
<P>
	The last motion I would like to discuss briefly is Motion No. 
20. It deals with the inclusion of an annual report which would 
be brought before Parliament outlining the expenditures and 
revenues of the department of heritage. I speak in support of this 
motion because I believe in accountability, openness and 
fairness.
<P>
	An annual report would help not only parliamentarians but 
also Canadians to understand where, why and how much funding 
was allocated to ensure the best accountability possible. 
Although I have heard that part III of the estimates will be 
improved to accommodate the lack of an annual report, I believe 
it is still in the best interests of Canadians to have an annual 
report simply because it would be more accessible and clearer 
than the estimates.
<P>
	I appreciate this opportunity and I hope that all members of 
the House listened carefully to why these motions should be 
supported. I look for them to support these motions when the 
time comes for a vote.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Tony Ianno (Trinity-Spadina, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to voice my concern and to basically state that I do 
not believe this motion should be adopted.
<P>
	The main reason is, as we have discussed in committee, that 
the Multiculturalism Act is really a Canadian reality. What we 
are dealing with here is an opportunity for us as an institution, as 
a government to ensure that Canadians and those coming from 
abroad continue to understand the differences that make up this 
country.
<P>
	I think multiculturalism helps on the basis of trying to reduce 
the barriers that exist between us. There are many aspects to 
multiculturalism that are a new reality in the global sense. That 
is from an entrepreneurial perspective and business 
opportunities. I think that when we take into account that the 
world is becoming smaller with satellites and 
telecommunications, faxes et cetera, there is an opportunity to 
encourage our businesses to do more trade which is the 
fundamental aspect of growth that we in this country are looking 
forward to.
<P>
	This act and the Minister of Heritage will continue to increase 
the understanding of our realism, the Canadian identity as it 
exists today. We also have to continue to strengthen the cohesion 
that exists in this country and reduce the lack of understanding 
that sometimes exists in different regions.
<P>
	If we take into account the rich human resources and the 
opportunities that exist for increasing that trade, we will see 
more Canadians working and we will reduce our deficit 
problems as the member across stated.
<P>
	I also believe that multiculturalism policy is an eloquent 
testimony to our commitment to uphold the values of equity and 
fairness. It is a visionary statement about the kind of society we 
are all working to achieve, one in which each Canadian can 
realize his or her potential, economically, socially, politically 
and culturally. Multiculturalism is appropriately part of the 
department of heritage because it is a fundamental characteristic 
of our Canadian identity.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	Therefore I believe the motion should not be adopted.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
October 3, I spoke on Bill C-53 in this House and I rise today to 
denounce the mandate which the Department of Canadian 
Heritage is about to give itself. It is unacceptable for me and for 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9081"> 9081 </A></B>
<P>
all Quebecers that this new department's mandate makes no 
reference to Quebec as a society or to its cultural and linguistic 
specificity.
<P>
	Why does the Liberal government again stubbornly persist in 
wanting to deny the existence of Quebec, its language rights and 
its cultural specificity? How can the federal government claim 
that it wants to promote Canadian identity and intentionally 
omit from its bill any reference to Quebec culture?
<P>
	Therefore I will support the amendments moved by my 
colleague from Rimouski-Témiscouata to include in Bill C-53 
references to the specific nature of Quebec's culture, language 
and identity.
<P>
	I will continue in the same vein by demonstrating to this 
House that this new department's mandate is to assimilate 
Quebec culture, no more or less.
<P>
	Let us take the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation as a 
specific case in point supporting my argument.
<P>
	The Broadcasting Act says that the CBC's programming 
should seek to be of equivalent quality in French and in English.
<P>
	On this subject the law is clear: French and English must be 
treated as equivalent.
<P>
	Let me give you another quotation, this time from part of 
CRTC decision 87-140, in connection with a public hearing of 
the Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications 
Commission on January 21, 1994 concerning the licence 
renewals of the English and French networks.
<P>
	Among the long term objectives which the CRTC set for the 
CBC is the following: to achieve a fair and equitable balance in 
production, distribution and scheduling of regional and network 
programs on both networks, English and French.
<P>
	The CBC's mandate is clear since it is dictated by the CRTC's 
directives and the Broadcasting Act. The French and English 
networks must be equally productive and have the same rate of 
programming.
<P>
	The two quotes which I just read to you clearly show the 
federal government's apparent intentions. These views are 
clearly reflected in the act, as well as in the guidelines published 
by the Crown corporation responsible for the monitoring and 
renewal of licences for television and broadcasting in Canada.
<P>
	The federal government says that it seeks to promote the use 
of French in Canada. However, the daily reality does not support 
that claim; in fact, it shows just the opposite.
<P>
	The government cannot merely tell us about its good 
intentions: It must also act. It is nice to claim equal status for 
French and English, but that claim must be supported. These are 
mere statements of intention with no real basis.
<P>
	On July 27, 1994, the CRTC approved the budget allocation of 
the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, in an internal 
document entitled CRTC Decision 94-437. That document 
clearly indicates that the CBC allocates 63 per cent of its TV 
network budget to the English language network, and only 37 
per cent to the French language network, this for the term of its 
next licence.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	Moreover, the CRTC feels that the CBC is in the best position 
to decide how to allocate its funds. Thus, the CRTC is satisfied 
that the corporation's decisions do not violate the legislation.
<P>
	If you look at the overall programming costs for the two 
networks, you will see that the proportion for the French 
language network is now below 40 per cent, its level of six years 
ago.
<P>
	Furthermore, in 1970, there was no difference at all between 
the two networks. I think this proves that the federal government 
is gradually limiting the scope of its duties and obligations to 
accommodate a not so subtle policy of assimilation.
<P>
	The Broadcasting Act and the CRTC required the corporation 
to give equal treatment to both networks. Furthermore, both the 
legislation and the CRTC specify that production of 
programming should be equivalent for the English and French 
networks.
<P>
	However, when it is time to share financial resources, the 
French network gets half the funding that goes to the English 
network.
<P>
	This reduction in financing for the French network reflects 
Ottawa's lack of vision, which has been very harmful to the 
development and vitality of the country's francophone 
communities. This is a typical example of the federal 
government's policy of ignoring reality.
<P>
	In fact it reflects the policy of cultural and linguistic 
assimilation favoured by the federal government: legislate fair 
and equal treatment for English and French, while this is not 
followed through in the allocation of financial resources.
<P>
	I will give a few examples of the corporation's 
disproportionate allocation of financing.
<P>
	In 1992 the average investment per hour of programming was 
$37,496 on the English network and $18,390 on the French 
network. In other words, half as much.
<P>
	The average cost of news bulletins was $18,000 on the 
English network and $7,000 on the French network. Less than 
half.
<P>
	The average cost of drama programs was $90,000 on the 
English network and $68,800 on the French network.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9082"> 9082 </A></B>
<P>
	I realize that the Minister of Canadian Heritage and the 
President of the CBC, Mr. Manera, will try to justify what is 
being done by his crown corporation by saying that Canada has 
three times as many anglophones as francophones. However, 
the tv ratings for the French network are three times as high 
as for the English network.
<P>
	In fact, ratings for the English network vary from 11 per cent 
to 13 per cent during prime time. The Chairman of the CRTC, 
Keith Spicer, even referred to recent figures below 10 per cent. 
Ratings for the French network, however vary between 30 per 
cent and 38 per cent.
<P>
	In other words, the French network reaches the same number 
of Canadians as the English network. So why are financial 
resources not allocated accordingly? Why is the French network 
at such a disadvantage when it manages to reach the same 
number of viewers as the English network?
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	I would like the heritage minister to be able to reply to these 
questions, because this looks like a policy of assimilation 
designed to bring about the death of Canada's other cultural 
community.
<P>
	Is it the goal of the federal government to destroy the 
stronghold of the French language in North America? In any 
event, that is what I think and what the assimilation rate that 
grows from one census to the next would seem to indicate. Is this 
the federal government's covert policy of ignoring reality?
<P>
	This is an unacceptable situation, especially when Canadian 
legislation stipulates clearly that the treatment must be 
equivalent. Not more, not less, but equivalent.
<P>
	How, then, can the federal government continue to claim that 
it guarantees the equal treatment and use of French in its federal 
institutions when there are examples such as those of the CBC 
and the CRTC?
<P>
	These facts reinforce the findings of the Official Languages 
Committee. The annual report on official languages 
demonstrates beyond any reasonable doubt that Canadian 
heritage organizations are in fact agents for assimilating rather 
than protecting the French speaking citizens of this country.
<P>
	The Minister of Canadian Heritage must deliver the goods to 
the French speaking community in Quebec and elsewhere in this 
country. The federal Liberal government has the responsibility 
to guarantee the rights of the cultural minority in this country, 
especially when they are clearly enshrined in its legislation.
<P>
	I would like to take the opportunity available to me today to 
denounce the Department of Canadian Heritage, the Canadian 
Broadcasting Corporation and the CRTC. This department and 
these crown corporations are giving credence to decisions that 
are contrary to the rights of French-speaking communities in 
Quebec and elsewhere  in this country. The federal government 
has no right to sanction these decisions by the CBC and the 
CRTC.
<P>
	The federal government and this new Department of Canadian 
Heritage deny the cultural identity of Quebec and work against 
it.
<P>
	I therefore salute this democratic exercise to which we have 
been called by the Government of Quebec, in the form of the 
draft bill on Quebec sovereignty.
<P>
	This draft bill sets out the political plan that the Government 
of Quebec recommends in order to resolve, for once and for all, 
the constitutional problem in which Quebec has been mired for 
too many years. I think that it is the only way we have left to 
promote the full development of the people of Quebec.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It is my duty, pursuant to Standing 
Order 38, to inform the House that the questions to be raised 
tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows: the hon. 
member for Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans-MIL Davie 
Shipyard; the hon. member for Gaspé-Fisheries; the hon. 
member for Bourassa-Immigration; the hon. member for 
Châteauguay-MIL Davie Shipyard; the hon. member for 
Chambly-Customs Brokers.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Godfrey (Don Valley West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am rising to discuss Motion No. 5, which deals with national 
parks. According to the amendment the effect would be to drop 
all references in the legislation to national parks, historic canals 
and national marine areas.
<P>
	I suppose the question arises: Why should we include national 
parks under Canadian heritage? For those of us who have been 
interested in the park system it is interesting to note that over the 
years national parks have been located in different ministries.
<P>
	The first place they were to be found after their creation in the 
1880s was in what might be described as the predecessor to the 
Ministry of Natural Resources. This indicates that parks in those 
days were seen to have not only a natural component but also an 
economic component. They were seen as part of Canada's 
natural resources.
<P>
	A subsequent reorganization of government meant that parks 
found themselves suddenly with Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development. This new vision of parks suggested that they were 
to be seen somehow as up there, out there, out of sight, out of 
mind to some degree. That was because they were in remote 
places often in the north, often in places where the aboriginal 
populations could be found. Of course that ignored the reality 
that there were parks close to centres of habitation, such as the 
Rocky Mountain parks.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9083"> 9083 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	After that the parks structures found themselves in the 
Minister of the Environment which seemed to make sense. The 
theme there was one of protection rather than human use. It put 
the stress on not interfering with the parks which took away the 
notion of an economic connection with parks.
<P>
	Now finally with Canadian heritage the circle is to some 
extent complete. This latest reorganization of government 
recognizes that parks have different characteristics all of which 
have to be recognized. They are natural preserves and need 
protection, but they are also cultural sites. They are also 
economic sites for activity, for tourism for example.
<P>
	By putting them into a new ministry this bill tries to recognize 
the complex way in which we now look at parks. In this bill we 
recognize that history, culture and nature are intertwined in 
some fundamental way. This is simply to pick up on what is 
happening internationally under conventions such as that of 
UNESCO concerning the protection of the world cultural and 
natural heritage. In UNESCO's eyes cultural and natural 
heritage are inevitably linked and so they are in ours.
<P>
	Parks are also a crucial element of our national identity. They 
go with the vision that Canadians have of themselves wherever 
they live, of being in some close harmony with nature, some 
respect of nature and some awe of nature. It was Margaret 
Atwood who once described the common theme of Canadian 
literature, si c'était en anglais ou en français, as survival in the 
face of nature, survival in the face of difficult forces.
<P>
	Those who are concerned that by having parks taken away 
from the Department of the Environment should rest assured 
that the environmental concerns will not be diminished by 
having them in Canadian heritage. They will continue to be 
respected. It will continue to be the case in our international 
agreements, such as under UNESCO that parks will be fully 
protected.
<P>
	The reason that parks are being put in Canadian heritage is to 
respect their role as part of our system of values, part of our 
history, part of our culture, part of what it is to be a Canadian.
<P>
	As I mentioned earlier, there is an appropriate return to where 
we first saw parks because there are economic reasons as well to 
link together national parks and national historic sites. That is 
because tourism of all sorts is of continuing and indeed growing 
importance for this government. As members of this House will 
recall, we have a major $7 billion tourist deficit and parks have 
their role to play in correcting that, as do national historic sites.
<P>
	These are terrific assets, our parks and historic sites. It makes 
sense for them to be kept together. We think that indeed for those 
who worry about the environment having parks located in the 
Department of Canadian Heritage simply means there is one 
more environmental voice at the cabinet table.
<P>
	It is also the case that it is a commitment of this government to 
complete the national parks system, that system which was so 
much expanded in the 1970s by our present Prime Minister. To 
this we are adding a new kind of park under water parks, the 
national marine conservation areas which this amendment 
would have us locate in some other place. These are the parks of 
the future; these are the parks which respect our complex marine 
life. They too belong in the same package with the national 
parks and national historic sites.
<P>
	Finally, it seems to us that having subjected the national parks 
system to so many reorganizations and having had it put in so 
many different places over time that Parks Canada has done well 
in the new Department of Canadian Heritage. It has found a new 
place to call home. It would be both counterproductive and 
extraordinarily disruptive to move it yet again after a mere year 
and a half.
<P>
	For those reasons we are opposed to this amendment. We 
think that national parks and indeed canals and national marine 
conservation areas belong properly with the Department of 
Canadian Heritage.

	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think you might find unanimous 
consent for the following motion. I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That 15 members, three staff and three interpreters from the Standing 
Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food be allowed to hold hearings in 
relation to the committee's study on the future of Canadian agriculture in St.

Lethbridge, Saskatoon, Winnipeg, London, St. Catharines, Brockville and

	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is there unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> No, Mr. Speaker, I will not give unanimous 
consent. I believe there is some disagreement among the

<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Terrebonne, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise in this House to speak on Bill C-53. Before 
getting to my opening remarks, I would like to start by giving a 
definition of bilingualism. This is my own personal definition 
but one that I believe is shared by many Quebecers. This is for 
the hon. member for Carleton-Gloucester who talked about 
bilingualism and its importance. He has used this term over and 
over.
<P>
	I think that, for a Quebecer, bilingualism simply means that a 
French-speaking Quebecer learns English. We are not so sure 
that it works both ways. As far as we are concerned, for us, it 
means learning English, and for the English, being able to 
understand us. There are of course exceptions, colleagues whom 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9084"> 9084 </A></B>
<P>
I wish to congratulate, in this House, on our committee and 
around us.
<P>
	The importance of the multicultural dimension of Canadian 
unity has been mentioned. Not so long ago, we had the 
opportunity to travel to western Canada with the environment 
committee. Much to my surprise, be it in Winnipeg, 
Edmonton-and I call this to the attention of the hon. member 
for St. Boniface, champion of the French fact-or Vancouver, 
we were unable to find French-language newspapers in the 
hotel, airport or convenience store. Nowhere in Edmonton, 
Winnipeg and Vancouver was I able to buy <I>Le Devoir</I> or <I>La 
Presse</I>. But you could get <I>USA Today</I> and magazines from New 
York City. There were all sorts of magazines and newspapers but 
none in French. And we are told that the French fact is very well 
championed just about everywhere. I have my doubts about that.
<P>
	The amendment to clause 4, presented by my colleague from 
Rimouski-Témiscouata, would simply recognize Quebec's 
identity in Bill C-53. It is an essential clause. It is indeed 
essential to recognize that Canada was built by two founding 
peoples, a fact that this bill denies. That is why we cannot 
support it. These two founding peoples are the francophones and 
anglophones of this country.
<P>
	I do not think that a single Liberal member would knowingly 
contest the fact that Canada was built by two founding peoples. 
This is what the Minister of Canadian Heritage is simply 
denying with this bill. That is why we are opposed to it.
<P>
	I therefore urge the minister to recognize the two founding 
nations and to accept every amendment proposed by the hon. 
member for Rimouski-Témiscouata, which recognizes 
Quebec's identity, so that every motion should include the word 
``Quebec'' or ``the identity of Quebec''. Otherwise, we cannot 
approve Bill C-53, as it denies an obvious reality in this country.
<P>
	If I may, I would like to read from the report of a Canadian 
royal commission that was written a number of years ago. This 
is a rather long excerpt, but I will tell you afterwards when it was 
written and by which royal commission, and you will see that the 
problem goes back a long way.
<P>
<B>(1700) </B>
<P>
	Here is the excerpt. The dominant majority in politics-like 
the federal government and the anglophones-often takes its 
advantages for granted and does not appreciate the 
disadvantages suffered by the minority, especially when this 
minority enjoys or appears to enjoy some degree of cultural 
freedom. However, the minority, as long as it regards its 
collective life as an entity, may want control over it and look 
beyond cultural freedom. It then questions its political status. It 
feels that its future and cultural development are somewhat 
precarious and perhaps limited in a political environment 
dominated by the other group forming the majority. As a result, 
it leans towards greater constitutional autonomy. Ideally, the 
minority wants this autonomy for the whole  community but, 
when this objective cannot be reached, it may focus its efforts on 
a narrower political stage where it would be in the majority.
<P>
	We think about sovereignty. It is personal. This excerpt is 
from the 1967 Laurendeau-Dunton report on bilingualism and 
biculturalism.
<P>
	The recognition of the French fact, of francophone minority 
rights goes back to at least 1967. One francophone and one 
anglophone on the same royal commission signed this report 
recognizing minority rights. It is therefore imperative to 
recognize these rights.
<P>
	According to the brief submitted by the Société 
Saint-Jean-Baptiste, it is important to see how this conclusion 
has evolved over the years, how political parties have learned to 
live with the findings of the Royal Commission on Bilingualism 
and Biculturalism. I am talking about biculturalism and not 
multiculturalism.
<P>
	Twenty-five years later, in 1991, another look at this issue of 
culture and the French fact in Quebec and Canada led to the 
following conclusion: The two levels of government also 
compete on the last element of the analysis, culture, resulting in 
overspending, conflict and inefficiency.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Come on.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Sauvageau:</B> Sorry, Mr. Speaker, for going on and on 
about the French fact, but it is important to us, although you may 
be tired of hearing about it.
<P>
	The federal government has played a major role in cultural 
life through several institutions: the National Archives, 
National Gallery, CBC, Canada Council for arts and research, 
National Film Board. Some fields of exclusive federal 
jurisdiction have major repercussions on Quebec's cultural 
sector, for example, in communications. Given the importance 
of culture to the development of Quebec's identity, we could not 
overemphasize the urgency of taking back jurisdiction in this 
field. Quebec must exercise exclusive jurisdiction in all areas 
related to culture and communications.
<P>
	This conclusion comes from the report of the constitutional 
committee of the Liberal Party of Quebec, not the Parti 
Quebecois, but the Liberal Party of Quebec, in 1991, on page 32 
of the report entitled ``a Quebec that is free to make its own 
choices''.
<P>
	Twenty-five years later, we in Quebec have not deviated very 
far from the position that Quebec culture, to be well defended, 
must first of all exist and second be managed solely and 
exclusively in Quebec.
<P>
	Does this date from 1967? No. Long before that, royal 
institutions recognized this distinction between the French fact 
and the English fact in North America. Let us review some 
constitutional history. In 1791, the Constitution Act recognized 
Upper and Lower Canada. Since 1791, a distinct society of 
French-speaking people in North America has been recognized.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9085"> 9085 </A></B>
<P>
	Why did the crown agree to divide the territory then? To 
please the Loyalists? Why were the Napoleonic Code, the 
seigneurial system, the French fact and the Catholic religion 
recognized? Quite simply, because there was a distinct society 
in North America then. It still exists and it is found mainly in 
Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1705) </B>
<P>
	Later, in 1840, they tried to bury that minority with the Union 
Act. They tried to bury it when anglophones formed a majority. 
Following the Durham report, they thought that if the two 
colonies, Upper and Lower Canada, were joined, francophones 
would be in a minority situation and would quickly disappear. 
Therefore the problem of the French fact would be solved.
<P>
	Luckily for us, we are still here to take care of ourselves. In 
1867, we managed to create a province, Quebec, primarily to 
protect our rights. However, this bill would eliminate 
everything for which we fought in the past.
<P>
	Throughout their history, francophones have preserved their 
distinct society in North America, and that must be clearly 
recognized. As my colleague mentioned earlier, a member of a 
group represented by the Société nationale des Québécois de 
l'Outaouais came to talk to us. He gave examples of how 
francophones were treated unfairly, here in this country. The 
financing of Radio-Canada is one such example.
<P>
	As the Société nationale des Québécois de l'Outaouais said, 
``Radio-Canada is another example of cultural discrimination 
by the federal government. If the two languages and the two 
cultures are truly on an equal footing, and if Canada is bilingual 
and bicultural, the two networks should receive equal financing. 
Yet, the French language network receives 37 per cent, 
compared to 63 per cent for the English language network. To 
justify this discrepancy, the CRTC said, on January 21, 1994, 
when the TV licences of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation 
were renewed, that if the allocation of money were based on 
demographics, the ratio would be three to one in favour of the 
English language network''.
<P>
	The figures support the CRTC decision to allocate 63 and 37 
per cent respectively to the two networks. However, if you take 
the ratings into consideration, you will see that they are 
comparable. Radio-Canada is indeed treated unfairly.
<P>
	I conclude with a quote from a great Quebec historian, Denis 
Monière, who submitted a brief to the committee. I trust I can 
quote him verbatim in the House. He said: ``The establishment 
of the Department of Canadian Heritage, which is the most 
thorough and perverse Canadian imposture, follows the 
numerous attempts made since 1867 to deny the existence of a 
people which is distinct from the Canadian people and which 
refuses to be integrated into an alienating entity. This project 
reflects a Canadian cultural imperialism bent on eradicating 
Quebec's national identity and following a  long tradition 
inspired by the Durham report. Since that report, all those who 
believed in a bicultural Canada were proven wrong by Canadian 
history, and misled French Canadians besides''.
<P>
	For all the reasons which I have tried to express without being 
put off, we oppose Bill C-53.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pagtakhan:</B> I rise on a point of order, Mr. Speaker. 
Earlier this afternoon the member for Calgary Southeast stated: 
``We have some of the same concerns expressed by the Liberals 
when they were in opposition. Let me remind you, Mr. Speaker, 
of some of their earlier criticisms. The member for Winnipeg 
North suggested that the foundation, referring to the Canadian 
Race Relations Foundation''-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> This is a perfectly legitimate debate 
and there is time for the member to debate. From what I have 
heard thus far it is not a point of order. If the member wishes to 
debate he is perfectly free to sit down and rise again on debate. Is 
the hon. member for Winnipeg North on debate?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Winnipeg North, Lib.):</B> Yes, Mr. 
Speaker. The member for Calgary Southeast said: ``The member 
for Winnipeg North suggested that the foundation'', referring to 
the Canadian Race Relations Foundation, ``should not exist 
because the responsibility for the program should be 
accomplished elsewhere''.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	For the record of the House I would like to state that on May 
29, 1990, to which the member was referring, I stated on page 
12020 of <I>Hansard</I> with reference to the Canadian Race 
Relations Foundation:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I support this bill, which is to contribute to the elimination of racism and 
all forms of racial discrimination in Canadian society.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	On the following page I said again:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I support this Canadian Race Relations Foundation based on the preamble 
that we will support and reaffirm our support for the international 
convention on the elimination of all forms of racial discrimination; that we 
will henceforth reaffirm our belief and support in the Canadian Charter of 
Rights and Freedoms; that the Canadian Multiculturalism Act would assume 
greater and greater meaning.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The record speaks for itself. What the member for Calgary 
Southeast did was not only take my statement out of context but 
misrepresented my statements. Therefore to me it was a 
dishonourable thing.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9086"> 9086 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The Chair is having great difficulty. 
Having ruled that the member was not speaking on a point of 
order but on debate, the Chair therefore is hoisted on the same 
petard.
<P>
	The hon. member for Calgary Southeast has already spoken 
on this matter and does not therefore have the right to speak 
further.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order. The hon. 
member for Winnipeg North called my colleague a 
dishonourable member. I would ask that he withdraw that 
statement from the House.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I listened carefully to the hon. member 
for Winnipeg North and I think the member said that what was 
done was a dishonourable thing. The thing was dishonourable, 
not the member. Perhaps the member for Winnipeg North would 
like to clarify that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pagtakhan:</B> Mr. Speaker, if I said dishonourable 
member, I would withdraw it. What she did in her speech was 
dishonourable.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would suggest that what the 
hon. member for Winnipeg North is insinuating is that the hon. 
member is dishonourable, and that is wrong. He can couch it in 
different words but he is actually referring to the member. I 
would ask that he withdraw that statement.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pagtakhan:</B> Mr. Speaker, never in my mind is the 
member dishonourable. I regret that she said it but the statement 
was made and it is with pain that I received the statement. 
Therefore, to that extent I would like you to consider that the 
statement lacks honour.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I wonder if the hon. whip of the 
government wishes to make any intervention on this matter.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, I know that in the cut and thrust of 
debate we sometimes make references to one another which are 
unfortunate. I do believe that the hon. member meant that the 
statements were unacceptable. I hope it was not a reflection on 
the hon. member. I am sure she is most honourable, as all other 
members are.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It is virtually Christmas Eve. I am 
sorry we are reduced to this. We are obliged to call each other 
hon. members every time we refer to each other. Because that 
particular word is used so often in this House, I would invite the 
hon. member for Winnipeg North to reflect on what the effects 
of his comments here this afternoon have amounted to.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pagtakhan:</B> Mr. Speaker, I acknowledge that the member 
for Calgary Southeast is honourable.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Does the hon. House leader of the 
Reform Party have any further intervention?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for 
Winnipeg North for clarifying that for us. I appreciate it.

	The House resumed from November 17 consideration of the 
motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it certainly is gratifying to know that the spirit of 
Christmas has fallen upon this House. It was interesting 
listening to the debate this afternoon.
<P>
	Earlier this year Information Commissioner John Grace 
included in his annual report 43 recommendations to close 
loopholes in the 10 year old Access to Information Act. Mr. 
Grace stated: ``The first decade has shown that the government 
bent on secrecy can certainly diminish the effectiveness of the 
access law''.
<P>
	Mr. Grace goes on to say that he wants the new government to 
have the self-confidence to be scrutinized and the fortitude to be 
forthright.
<P>
	Motion No. 304 gives the Liberal government that golden 
opportunity to take this first crucial step toward restoring 
Canada's faith. At the top of page 92 of the red book which starts 
by talking of initiatives to ``restore the confidence in the 
institutions of government'', it certainly seems like the Liberal 
government in the spirit of this motion would have to agree with 
Motion No. 304.
<P>
	The information commissioner's recommendation No. 43 
states that the access act be extended to all federal government 
institutions including special operating agencies, crown 
corporations and wholly owned subsidiaries, any institutions to 
which the federal government appoints a majority of governing 
body members, the Senate, the House of Commons, the Library 
of Parliament and all officers of Parliament.
<P>
	During debate on motion 304 of November 17, I was listening 
very carefully to the member for St. Paul's. He made a couple of 
comments in his address to the House that I would like to repeat.
<P>
	He said: ``At the time of the act''-it was passed in 
1982-``there was careful consideration to which institutions 
should be included in the coverage of the act and which should 
not''. Later in his address he went on to say: ``We cannot assume 
that these were frivolous decisions as to who was included and 
who was excluded''. I thought to myself it was worthy of doing 
some research on. Was it carefully thought out?
<P>
	We went to the Library of Parliament to see if we could find 
out some information about those debates and the reasons why 
some corporations were excluded and some were not. An article 
from the <I>Hill Times</I> printed March 17, 1994 is headed: 
``Parliament's exemption from information access act 
perplexing''.
<P>
	The reporter went back to the key people who were involved 
in the drafting of the act in the late 1970s and the early 1980s. 
Strangely enough, all of the people who were contacted said that 
they could not recall an actual reason for the exclusions. Then 
the reporter went back to the person who should really have all 
the information on this, the man responsible for drafting Bill 
C-43, Liberal minister Francis Fox. He was posed the question, 
why were these exemptions made? How did he respond? ``You 
got me''. That is what he said. He did not know.
<P>
	We wanted to dig a little deeper into this. We went to Robert 
Auger, the Privy Council adviser to Mr. Fox and posed the same 
question. What was the reason for these exemptions? He said: 
``It is some kind of philosophical assumption that nobody 
questioned''. Nobody has ever questioned this. That comes back 
to the debate of November 17 and the comments from the 
member for St. Paul's. I am certain that he did not intend to 
mislead this House.
<P>
	Certainly the testimony I have presented today would indicate 
that there was not careful consideration at the time. At least we 
should ask questions and maybe even assume that some of these 
decisions were frivolous and without basis.
<P>
	Crown corporations have not been open to public scrutiny and 
this continues to fuel the fire of voter cynicism. Canadians are 
demanding accountability. They want open government. Is there 
anything wrong with accountability and open government? It is 
high time that the government takes action.
<P>
	Why are crown corporations exempt from the Access to 
Information Act? Let us look at a couple of them. In the case of 
the CBC and Atomic Energy of Canada Limited, there are 
concerns that competitors would be able to gain an advantage in 
their respective markets through access requests.
<P>
	These crown corporations continue to exist because they are 
financed by the Canadian taxpayer, not because they are profit 
making players in the competitive marketplace. This is a pretty 
strong argument for wanting accountability and access to 
information on how these corporations are operated. The 
taxpayers want to know how their hard earned dollars are being 
spent. Provisions  could be made that could protect 
commercially viable information. Therefore that argument is 
also put to rest.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9090"> 9090 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1735) </B>
<P>
	There have been numerous examples of the need for public 
access to information on crown corporations. Earlier this year 
the National Arts Centre spent $250,000 on a proposal to submit 
an application for a performing arts television network. If it had 
not been for the Auditor General's report, Canadians would have 
been kept in the dark about this ridiculously expensive 
proposition. The Auditor General said: ``The activities of and 
the expenses incurred for this broadcasting project are beyond 
the objects and powers of this corporation''.
<P>
	In addition the Auditor General obtained legal opinions 
supporting the view that a performing arts network was outside 
the NAC's mandate. If the National Arts Centre had not been 
exempt from access to information, a private citizen might have 
been able to come forward with this information, an elected 
official of the House, or maybe even a journalist would have 
easily exposed this ludicrous proposal before some $250,000 
taxpayer dollars were spent needlessly.
<P>
	Canadians currently pay for half of the NAC's annual 
operating budget of $40 million. Do they not have the right to 
ask certain questions about the operations? The Canadian 
Broadcasting Corporation is financed by Canadians to the tune 
of $1.1 billion, and yet it operates under the same veil of secrecy 
as the other crown corporations. Access to information would 
allow Canadians to question just how that $1.1 billion is spent. 
Canadians have the right to know.
<P>
	Again I would remind the House that provisions could be 
made to protect the commercially viable information that needs 
to be protected.
<P>
	According to CBC staffers, costs of production are kept 
secret, even within its own organization, to avoid jealousies 
among producers whose shows are given different budgets and 
to keep writers and others from knowing how little of the pie 
they actually receive. It is a shame.
<P>
	Instead of going to Parliament the Auditor General's report on 
the CBC will be submitted to the CBC's board of directors and 
made public if and when the board sees fit. The true owners are 
being deprived of this information on the CBC. Who would they 
be? The people of Canada.
<P>
	Access to information would eliminate this cat and mouse 
game. Again I would like to reiterate this because it is 
important. Provisions could be made to ensure commercially 
viable and valuable information would be protected.
<P>
	Perhaps a crown corporation should file an access to 
information request just to find out for themselves what access 
to information really means. When information is kept secret, 
bureaucrats and politicians could be tempted to do things that 
they would not do if they were made  public. The more 
information available to Canadians the better off the country 
will be.
<P>
	I will give some more examples of the kinds of abuses that I 
am talking about. There have been abuses throughout history. 
Perhaps the most famous was that of the Aberdeen Marina, the 
Hong Kong club where Canada's foreign offices spent some 
$773,000 on memberships for 34 diplomats and family 
members. That was back in the early 1980s. Or maybe it was the 
so-called bridge to nowhere. Members may recall the $2.1 
million structure erected in the riding of a federal Conservative 
cabinet minister. The only problem with the project was that the 
bridge when built was not connected to any road.
<P>
	A more recent example, and we may never have the answer to 
this one, is much taxpayers paid to chauffeur, entertain and put 
Haitian leader Jean Bertrand Aristide in hotels during his recent 
six day visit to Ottawa in January.
<P>
<B>(1740 ) </B>
<P>
	A local Ottawa newspaper reported that it requested the 
information under access to information. It was refused by 
foreign affairs which claimed Aristide's hotel bill was too 
sensitive and could lead to squabbling among other foreign 
visitors because they may receive lesser treatment. Do the 
taxpayers of Canada not have the right to know this 
information? I think they do.
<P>
	The Liberal government red book talks of initiatives to restore 
confidence in the institutions of government. Gosh, that sounds 
good. According to my research, the government should do so 
soon. It has an opportunity right now. Freedom of information 
builds faith like few other policies build faith in the Government 
of Canada. It slows the build-up of dirty laundry that a future 
government will only be too happy to wash.
<P>
	My Liberal colleagues could well learn from the information 
commissioner's scathing criticism of the Mulroney 
government's attempt to put roadblocks in the way of citizens 
trying to find out about how the government made decisions and 
what those were.
<P>
	The final piece of evidence that I have today is from a 
gentleman by the name of John G. McCamus who was involved 
as a witness in the second reading of Bill C-43 in 1980. He said: 
``As many critics of the bill have observed, there is one highly 
visible category of federal agencies which have not been 
included in the schedule-the federal crown corporations 
engaged in the supply of goods and services. The exclusion of 
commercial crown corporations from the access scheme is, in a 
word, indefensible''.
<P>
	In closing, Motion No. 304 is about openness and 
accountability. The government owes it to all Canadians to have 
the self-confidence to be scrutinized and the fortitude to be 
forth-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9091"> 9091 </A></B>
<P>
right. The passage of Motion No. 304 will help to regain the 
public confidence in this institution.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
always a privilege and an honour for me to represent the people 
in my riding of Shefford, who elected me in the last federal 
election and who expect a high degree of integrity from us.
<P>
	It is my opinion that the Access to Information Act should be 
extended to all government institutions, as tabled in Motion No. 
304 by the member for Red Deer. The purpose of this motion is 
to make the whole Canadian federal administration more 
accessible and open.
<P>
	This transparency is necessary if we are to win back the 
confidence of the taxpayers, particularly in this period of 
economic austerity, when the federal government is preparing to 
make cuts in a multitude of social programs, when, at the same 
time, the heads of Crown agencies are getting rich on taxpayers' 
money and enjoying privileges beyond the reach of the average 
Canadian, and when this same government is making thousands 
of partisan appointments, with no public control.
<P>
	Nevertheless, in his Speech from the Throne last January 18, 
the Prime Minister stated that integrity and public trust in the 
institutions of government were essential. In addition, he said, 
and I quote: ``The Government is committed to enhancing the 
credibility of Parliament. Changes will be proposed to the rules 
of the House of Commons to provide Members of Parliament a 
greater opportunity to contribute to the development of public 
policy and legislation''.
<P>
	The time has now come for the federal government to table 
legislation designed to ensure that its institutions and Crown 
agencies excluded from the Access to Information Act are more 
transparent.
<P>
<B>(1745) </B>
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois particularly wants to stress the need for 
federal institutions such as the Senate and Crown corporations 
to be transparent. The public should be able to scrutinize the 
actions of these bodies which are undemocratic because 
non-elected and more likely than not using taxpayers money.
<P>
	For the sake of democracy and to make the current system 
more transparent, the Bloc Quebecois can only concur in the 
March 1987 report of the Standing Committee on Justice and the 
Solicitor General, which recommended that the Access to 
Information Act apply to all federal institutions, including 
administrative tribunals, the Senate and the House of Commons.
<P>
	This committee recommended at the time that the Access to 
Information Act and the Privacy Act apply to all 53 parent 
Crown corporations and their 127 wholly owned subsidiaries. 
These corporations and their subsidiaries had assets tens of 
billions of dollars in assets over which the public has absolutely 
no control.
<P>
	On the other hand, these recommendations did not apply to 
other corporations, including 140 subsidiaries that were not 
wholly owned by Crown corporations and 26 joint ventures and 
mixed enterprises, of which the capital stock is jointly held by 
the federal government and other levels of government or 
organizations.
<P>
	The report of the Standing Committee on Justice and the 
Solicitor General states that there are certainly other entities 
with no capital stock for which the federal government has the 
right to appoint, directly or through a Crown corporation, one or 
more persons to the board of directors or similar body, with the 
public being systematically excluded from the process, except 
to foot the bill.
<P>
	Canadians pay for all that. Therefore, they have a right to 
know. Since these are theoretically Crown corporations, the 
taxpayers of Quebec and Canada are entitled to and should know 
how these corporations are administered. That is why they must 
be subject to public scrutiny.
<P>
	I would like to ask a question in this House: Why are some 
Crown corporations subject to the Access to Information Act 
while others are not, when they all receive public funds?
<P>
	The burden of proof rests on the federal government. The 
Liberals-yes, the Liberals-must keep their word and restore 
trust in public institutions.
<P>
	You will tell me that we all want to see positive changes and 
ensure that our political institutions and Crown corporations 
operate with honesty and integrity.
<P>
	I know for a fact that these issues were raised by the Liberals 
when they were in opposition. Now that they are in power, I hope 
that some of them will remember the importance of making 
public institutions more open, accountable and honest.
<P>
	Quebecers and Canadians have never been so disillusioned 
with federal institutions, public administration, politicians and 
the public sector.
<P>
	The people must be able to trust those in power. Obviously, 
they have little confidence in the federal government, while the 
credibility of public institutions is steadily eroding.
<P>
	This disaffection may be attributable to several factors: some 
elected officials committed indiscretions while others governed 
arrogantly, it must be said.
<P>
<B>(1750) </B>
<P>
	Citizens are unhappy because they are not really consulted, 
because their views are ignored, because public affairs are dealt 
with behind closed doors as soon as they become crucial.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9092"> 9092 </A></B>
<P>
	Quebecers and the people in the rest of Canada are 
disappointed and unhappy with the poor quality of many public 
services, given government overspending and the tax burden 
imposed on them.
<P>
	Although Quebecers and the people in the rest of Canada 
attach great importance to social programs and our democratic 
heritage, they are annoyed by the apparent confusion among the 
various public powers. Likewise, duplication in federal 
government services is unacceptable to all our taxpayers.
<P>
	I agree with the essential part of the motion proposed by my 
colleague from Red Deer, that all publicly financed government 
institutions should be subject to the Access to Information Act.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Finlay (Oxford, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, everything to 
my hon. colleagues in the opposition, particularly in the third 
party, seems simple and very easily fixed. I suggest that this 
shows a lack of imagination and a lack of understanding of the 
complexity and sensitivity of much that we in government have 
to deal with.
<P>
	My hon. colleague from Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt 
leaves the impression that everything that is secret is somehow 
evil, that nothing which is personal or concerns individual 
Canadians is or should be confidential.
<P>
	I would remind him that even public boards like boards of 
education and municipal councils at the local level deal with 
personnel, legal and property matters in camera and not in 
public.
<P>
	However, I would like to congratulate the hon. member for 
Red Deer for putting this motion forward at a time when 
Canadians are losing trust in their political institutions, or were. 
All of us must be active in finding ways to promote more open 
and accountable government.
<P>
	However, in searching out these various ways to promote 
more open and accountable government, we must recognize that 
our institutions face a variety of other challenges equally 
important to Canadians.
<P>
	For example, Canadians want government to cost less, to be 
more efficient and to operate in a more business like manner. In 
come cases it may be necessary to balance the value of openness 
with these other values.
<P>
	Although I find the objectives behind this motion laudable I 
cannot support this motion for three reasons. First, we must be 
concerned about the impact this motion will have on the 
competitive position of crown corporations. I do not say the 
impact is great or small, merely that before adopting this motion 
I would want to hear directly from those crown corporations on 
this issue.
<P>
	Second, in times of fiscal restraint we must stop and ask what 
will this motion cost the taxpayers? How will those costs be 
paid? The fact is that processing access requests requires an 
access to information bureaucracy and costs money.
<P>
	The third reason I cannot support this motion is that it fails to 
distinguish between different kinds of crown agencies and 
different institutions of Parliament.
<P>
	The motion is too broadly worded and as such disagrees with 
the findings of the 1986 parliamentary committee report ``Open 
and Shut'' and with the most recent report of the information 
commissioner.
<P>
	Returning to my first reason for opposing this motion, I am 
not convinced it has struck the proper balance between the 
competing values of open and accountable government on the 
one hand and smaller, more efficient government on the other.
<P>
	The motion asks that crown agencies be subject to the scrutiny 
of the Access to Information Act. There are presently more than 
130 crown agencies subject to the act. I assume that the hon. 
member means by crown agencies those crown agencies not yet 
subject to the act. In particular, I assume he is referring at least 
in part to crown corporations.
<P>
<B>(1755) </B>
<P>
	It is with respect, particularly to crown corporations, that the 
balance between efficient, competitive business like crown 
agencies and open, accountable enterprises becomes most 
important.
<P>
	The basic question is whether crown corporations which have 
mandates to operate in a business like fashion, sometimes in 
competition with the private sector, should have to work under 
different rules than their competitors. If you believe that crown 
corporations should act like businesses, why would you impose 
a different set of rules on them?
<P>
	If you believe crown corporations should not be competing 
with the private sector at all, that is a completely different 
question. Subjecting crown corporations to the scrutiny of the 
Access to Information Act will not terminate the crown 
corporations if that is your goal. It will simply make them less 
competitive, more expensive and less efficient.
<P>
	I would not want to make a decision on the motion before the 
House until I know more about the implications. I am not 
prepared to support the motion at this time.
<P>
	Another reason why I do not support this motion is that we do 
not have enough information about what the potential cost to the 
taxpayer will be. The fact is processing access requests costs 
taxpayers money. The most recent report of the information 
commissioner says that the annual cost of processing access 
requests is $20 million and that the current fees are not designed 
to recover costs, but merely to deter trivial requests.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9093"> 9093 </A></B>
<P>
	Adding institutions to be covered by the Access to 
Information Act is saying that the government needs to spend 
more money. Where will this money come from? How much 
will it cost? Whatever it costs we know that it is a cost that 
private business does not have to incur and therefore will make 
crown corporations less competitive, at least to the extent of 
the cost of processing access requests.
<P>
	I do not say that the cost of processing access requests cannot 
be justified. The information commissioner says that $20 
million is a bargain for such an essential tool of public 
accountability. He may be right. All I am saying is that we 
should not adopt motions based on good intentions without first 
asking the basic questions of how much will it cost and who will 
pay.
<P>
	Also, I am reluctant to support this motion because of the 
report of the parliamentary committee that examined the Access 
to Information Act in 1986. Its report is called ``Open and 
Shut''. That committee considered a broad range of entities 
which might be made subject to the Access to Information Act. 
It concluded that it would not be appropriate for all crown 
agencies to be made subject to the act. It thought a definition of 
crown corporation should be developed and should be limited to 
corporations in which the crown has a controlling interest and 
which provide goods or services to the public on a commercial 
basis. It thought there should be special exemptions for the 
Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, mentioned significantly by 
my hon. colleague, in relation to program material.
<P>
	With respect to Parliament, the parliamentary committee was 
of the view that the offices of senators and members of the 
House of Commons should be excluded from scrutiny of the act. 
It said the relationship between such elected and appointed 
officials and the electorate is sometimes described as akin to 
solicitor-client privilege, and parliamentary privilege is 
involved. Therefore, the committee suggests their continued 
exclusion from the scope of the act.
<P>
	The committee thought that the Access to Information Act 
should not apply to the judicial branch of government and 
therefore not to the Federal Court, tax court, Supreme Court of 
Canada. Perhaps surprisingly, the committee thought the act 
should apply to administrative tribunals which perform 
quasi-judicial functions.
<P>
	The committee recognized that the federal government is 
involved in joint ventures with others, notably the provinces, 
and in those cases thought it would be best if there were 
negotiations with the provinces before making such joint 
ventures subject to the Access to Information Act.
<P>
	Here we have a parliamentary committee that studied the 
issues very carefully.
<P>
<B>(1800 ) </B>
<P>
	The considered conclusion was that it would go too far to 
include all crown agencies and at least in the case of the CBC it 
saw merit in examining the special circumstances of crown 
corporations that would become subject to the act. It saw merit 
in excluding courts, MPs' offices and federal-provincial joint 
organizations.
<P>
	I am not prepared to say that parliamentary committee was 
wrong in making these judgments. I think it goes too far to say in 
a sweeping statement that all of Parliament and all crown 
agencies should be subject to the Access to Information Act.
<P>
	In conclusion, I support a comprehensive, careful review of 
the Access to Information Act and I will support amendments 
aimed at improving access to government information. I may 
well support extending the application of the Access to 
Information Act to crown agencies not yet covered by the act, 
but I cannot in all conscience support a motion that fails to 
distinguish between various kinds of crown agencies that might 
make the correspondence I receive from my constituents 
automatically subject to the act and that is voted on without 
hearing from executives of crown agencies not presently subject 
to the act.
<P>
	I think the better approach is to take the Minister of Justice at 
his word that it is time for a review of the Access to Information 
Act. Let him draw upon all of the expertise we can acquire and 
use the full parliamentary procedures, including committee 
hearings, to produce the best set of amendments possible.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to begin my remarks by saying that committee would 
decide many of those things which the hon. member has just 
talked about.
<P>
	I am sure he, as a fine parliamentarian, is also aware that a 
private member cannot initiate a motion or a private member's 
bill which is going to cost the government more money. 
Therefore, I think it would be appropriate for the member to 
make sure that he gets on the record at some point that he well 
knows what the purpose, plan and policy of private member's 
motions and bills is.
<P>
	I would like to make a few comments about Motion M-304 
which my friend from Red Deer brought in. I think it is 
excellent, quite frankly, because the government has said it was 
going to do all kinds of things with access to information but 
here we are well over the one year birthday and precious little 
has happened again in that vein.
<P>
	Let me just refresh your memory, Mr. Speaker. I do not know 
where you were on July 11 but I was in the bush in Beaver River 
having a wonderful time getting some rest and relaxation. I do 
not get the Ottawa <I>Citizen</I> out there nor do I get Canada's 
national newspaper, the <I>Globe and Mail</I>. Nonetheless, let me 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9094"> 9094 </A></B>
<P>
look at some of the things that were going on while you and I 
were away from these hallowed halls on July 11.
<P>
	The Ottawa <I>Citizen</I>, July 11 stated: ``Justice Minister Allan 
Rock is promising an overhaul of the federal Access to 
Information Act so it is more in line with public expectations of 
openness in government''. We have read about openness in 
government in the red book and in any number of places. He 
thinks it is now out of date, very much in need of an overhaul. 
My friend just suggested that it certainly is in need of an 
overhaul, but when? When are we going to see any changes in 
this thing? We have been promised all kinds of legislation. We 
have had take note debates on just about every subject we could 
dream of and yet there is no action.
<P>
	We have been in the House now almost a year in this new 
session and we have seen precious little come forward in terms 
of tangible, get your teeth into it kind of legislation.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brushett:</B> You cannot keep up with the action.
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member across might be 
surprised at how I could keep up to the action.
<P>
	The justice minister says the present act reflects the state of 
the art as of the mid-1970s. We are not in the 1990s. Before he 
gets it together, dear knows, we will be into the next century and 
into the 2000s, I am not sure how we will say that. However, he 
says people's expectations of government are different. There is 
a need for more openness. For heaven's sake, that is absolutely 
right, the Ottawa <I>Citizen</I> is bang on.
<P>
	There is a word here that is going to go through my comments 
over and over again, a motif, and that is the word secrecy. If 
anything would disgust the Canadian public it is a government 
that sits in here and does not talk about secrecy but acts secrecy. 
That is really frustrating for people.
<P>
<B>(1805) </B>
<P>
	Members of this House are all aware of the need for accurate, 
complete and timely information. The Access to Information 
Act which was brought in on July 1, 1983 talked about openness 
and making sure that people had access to some information if 
they really needed it, not just for fun. It is time consuming for 
people to dig up information as well as expensive because you 
are paying people to dig up that information. The bottom line on 
that is what is the cost if we do not do it?
<P>
	If we ignore access to information, if we do not go ahead and 
process people's requests and have them accessible to the 
information that they really need, that people are demanding, 
what is the cost if we do not do it?
<P>
	I think there are some long term costs there that the hon. 
member might think about, especially when he is campaigning 
in the next election.
<P>
	We take this as a right of the Canadian people. Along with 
rights that we all have come responsibilities. We as 
parliamentarians have responsibilities to the Canadian public, 
after all it is paying our cheques.
<P>
	Many companies, crown corporations, the Gentleman Usher 
of the Black Rod, cabinet ministers' expenses, if the public is 
paying the bills, why should it not have some of this information 
at its fingertips? It seems ludicrous to me that we would say 
sorry, there are certain parts of the act that are exempt and so we 
do not have to tell you.
<P>
	If anything is going to frustrate people-and on a school 
board as well, as my hon. friend mentioned earlier-if anything 
frustrates the parent teacher association it is going to a meeting 
and demanding that they look at the minutes, because they are 
paying those bills too. When I was participating with school 
boards in my teaching career it would be ridiculous for people 
involved in the school system to say we do not think you should 
have access to that information.
<P>
	I taught in a small school in a small town and nothing would 
run you out of town faster than a parent teacher association or 
the parent advisory council saying ``what do you mean, you are 
not going to tell us? We are paying your salary and you had 
better let us know some of this information''.
<P>
	There should be few state secrets at any level.
<P>
	Speaking of secrecy, in the <I>Times Colonist</I> from November 
17, 1994, very fresh, a few weeks ago, the title of an article was 
``Weak Government's Lapse into Secrecy''. Freedom of 
information works great when things are going well for 
government but it is a different story when the going gets tough. 
That is for sure.
<P>
	This person says government information in the electronic 
age should be preserved as a national resource. Government 
should help people gain access to it and should be held in easily 
obtainable form. In other words, people should be able to have 
access to this with computers and the electronic highway and 
everything else that we have. There should be absolutely no 
reason for secrecy.
<P>
	The <I>Ottawa Citizen</I> on January 22, 1994 said that not only is it 
so secretive but that once you do crack through on that on access 
to information, if you are going to get any information out of it, 
it is slower than molasses in January, when this article was 
written. This person says that one of the most common 
complaints about access to information is that it is slow and 
getting slower. If there is anything we need in this bureaucracy it 
is not slow and getting slower. That is for sure.
<P>
	Ten years ago almost 79 per cent of requests were completed 
in 30 days or less, while 6.3 per cent took more than 60 days. 
Now only 57.5 per cent are completed in 30 days and 21.4 per 
cent take longer than 60 days. This looks vaguely familiar, what 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9095"> 9095 </A></B>
<P>
I see every day across the way, a government that says it is 
bringing in legislation on this and that and the next thing.
<P>
	I have been tallying what was an actual government 
sponsored, initiated, carried through to fruition bill in this 
House. It was not something from Kim Campbell that was held 
over and was going to be updated and change the name of 
departments and move ahead with this and that. The Tobacco 
Smuggling Act was something that this government could take 
credit for because it started it, carried through and finished it, 
whether it was good or bad is immaterial. Everything else was 
something left over.
<P>
	``Public information, political property'', from the <I>Globe and 
Mail</I>, Canada's national newspaper, July 5, 1994, when we were 
out of the House again. Public information, should it be public 
property? Of course. Is it? No. It belongs to the government and 
it keeps its claws and talons right into it. Heaven help anyone 
who tries to find out anything. From Toronto <I>Star</I> last January 
29: ``This law errs on the side of secrecy. When you get into 
thorny areas, it gets very cumbersome''.
<P>
<B>(1810) </B>
<P>
	If there are people who are finding this tedious, perhaps they 
could mention this to the hon. justice minister and he could 
perhaps get something through here. I would hate to think we 
were keeping anyone up.
<P>
	In 1983 the Liberals were the government and I was not here. 
The Toronto <I>Star</I> says: ``When the act was passed 33 statutes 
were exempted, cabinet discussions and tax information, for 
example, under section 24''.
<P>
	Under the Conservative government in 1986 the Liberals were 
here too: ``In 1986 a parliamentary justice committee said 
section 24 should be repealed because it was undemocratic''. 
Imagine such a thing in this institution.
<P>
	Let me finish by reading an article from November 18, just a 
few weeks ago. This was from the Ottawa <I>Citizen</I>: ``Canadians 
don't enjoy an open and accountable federal government''. It 
could not have been a Liberal that wrote that article surely, 
because they have told us for months now that they have an open 
and accountable government: ``Instead they are saddled with a 
bureaucratic culture only marginally less secretive than a 
decade ago'', we know who was in power a decade ago, ``when 
the principle of access to information held by government was 
first enshrined in a new federal law''.
<P>
	I do not want anyone to think we are making light of this, 
surely. Only some of the faces are a little different over there and 
you and I looked at them all in the last Parliament, Mr. Speaker. 
Unfortunately it seems many of those faces are the same. The 
names have changed. If anything shrouds this piece of 
legislation which has been in place for years now, if anything is 
going to send us on our Christmas recess and make it look like 
this place has not changed a bit, it is if this government is not 
really committed to changing the Access to Information Act.
<P>
	We welcome real, substantive changes to that. We look 
forward to 1995 and hope that we have far more substantive 
legislation in place that we can support.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure for me to speak on the motion from the member for Red 
Deer, since the very essence of this motion is in line with what 
the Bloc Quebecois has been asking for and I should say that it is 
also what my constituents in Chicoutimi expect.
<P>
	The objectives of the Bloc and the official opposition are clear 
and precise. We want greater transparency and openness in the 
management of public affairs and respect for the taxpayers' 
acquired right to know what the government is doing with public 
funds.
<P>
	This motion says that Parliament and crown agencies should 
be subject to scrutiny under the Access to Information Act. At 
present, the Access to Information Act, passed in 1982, gives 
access only to federal government documents. Under this law, 
therefore, government institutions must make their documents 
available.
<P>
	Nevertheless, there are exceptions. Some of the 112 federal 
crown corporations and several government agencies, including 
the House of Commons, the Senate, the Library of Parliament 
and officers of Parliament are not subject to this law.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois believes that the Access to Information 
Act must be extended to any government institution financed 
with public funds. In a democratic system like ours, public 
affairs must be run as openly as possible. That is what our 
constituents want. Openness, yes, but it is a word which 
frightens my colleagues opposite.
<P>
<B>(1815) </B>
<P>
	We see it in the way they have run the affairs of state for a 
little over a year. Need we mind you of their reticence and great 
lack of openness on many issues? First, on Bill C-52, 
concerning the Department of Public Works and Government 
Services, the Liberal government persists in blocking any 
amendment which would make this department's awarding of 
government contracts more open. It is hard for members of this 
Parliament to obtain relevant information on their riding from 
this department.
<P>
	Members of Parliament are the last to find out about the 
reorganizations going on in their riding. In Chicoutimi, a 
reorganization of post offices was announced to the public after 
the fact. Moreover, firms of consulting engineers or architects 
were never told why they could not bid on certain contracts.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9096"> 9096 </A></B>
<P>
	A public inquiry might shed some light on how these 
contracts are awarded, but I imagine they are reserved for 
friends of the regime. You will also remember this whole 
episode when the Minister of Canadian Heritage wrote to the 
CRTC about an application. Some said it was a lack of ethics, 
others talked about a lack of transparency, while others 
concluded that it was patronage. The government did not follow 
the principle of transparency, and was caught in the act. It is 
Bloc Quebecois members who dared to reveal that the Minister 
of Canadian Heritage got personally involved in issuing a 
broadcasting licence.
<P>
	And the Prime Minister did not even take any sanction against 
that minister, who had intervened. The Prime Minister even had 
the nerve to excuse his minister by saying that other Cabinet 
members had also been involved in similar patronage activities. 
The government also objected to the bill on public financing for 
political parties. That speaks volumes about their desire to 
ensure transparency. Past experience tells us that the main 
financial backers of political parties are usually the ones who 
get lucrative government contracts. These people are called 
friends of the regime.
<P>
	Then there are the reports of the Security Intelligence Review 
Committee, which are submitted to the Solicitor General. 
However, the solicitor refuses to let the parliamentary 
subcommittee on national security have access to these 
documents. Why was that subcommittee set up if it cannot have 
access to the reports tabled by the agency responsible for 
monitoring intelligence activity?
<P>
	Given this lack of transparency, which is becoming more and 
more prevalent, the Access to Information Act remains one of 
the only means for elected members of this House, and Canadian 
taxpayers, to obtain information on the operations of 
departments and government agencies, including crown 
corporations.
<P>
	Thanks to that act, MPs were able to have access to the 
findings contained in a SIRC report. SIRC concluded that the 
inquiries conducted by one of the branches of CSIS are not 
related to threats to Canada's security, as defined in the act but, 
rather, to threats to the security of private businesses. In 
conducting such inquiries, CSIS duplicates the operations of the 
federal and provincial police forces.
<P>
<B>(1820) </B>
<P>
	As my colleague from Bellechasse pointed out a few days ago 
in this House, it is unfortunate that parliamentarians are the last 
ones to be informed of such allegations. Without the Access to 
Information Act, this government would not reveal anything, 
either to the official opposition or the citizens of this country.
<P>
	This time around, the government cannot deny the public its 
right to scrutinize the management of public affairs, which are 
financed in large part through the taxes it pays.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois supports the objective of making the 
whole federal administration accessible and transparent, for the 
sake of fairness and equity.
<P>
	We have been elected by our fellow citizens; our mandate is to 
report to them on the activities and functions of the public 
administration.
<P>
	Moreover, the Access to Information Act should also apply to 
the Senate, an institution which is appointed, not elected.
<P>
	However, the act should not apply to government agencies 
and crown corporations which hold confidential information for 
the purpose of competition, insofar as that information is 
concerned, but the act should apply to them in the case of 
general information such as expenditures, budgets, trade 
practices and personnel management.
<P>
	In view of the many examples I have just listed, the Bloc 
Quebecois will vote in favour of this motion since it promotes 
more transparency. Let us hope that our friends opposite will 
know enough to take advantage of this opportunity.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it gives 
me pleasure to rise and speak in support of the motion in the 
name of the hon. member for Red Deer which reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the Parliament and Crown Agencies 
should be subject to scrutiny under the Access to Information Act.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This is a timely motion. Yesterday afternoon I attended the 
public accounts committee of which I am a member and 
regularly attend. We have been having problems getting some 
information from the government regarding a $2 billion loss this 
country has suffered. The taxpayers are out $2 billion and we 
have been trying to find out who actually caused the loss. Was it 
the Ministry of National Revenue? Was it the Minister of 
Finance, or was it the Department of Justice?
<P>
	Officials were in front of the committee and we were trying to 
determine who was responsible. Was it bad advice from 
lawyers? Was it bad decision making by revenue and finance?
<P>
	When the Minister of National Revenue was in front of the 
committee he gave a complete and detailed report. He said that 
the public accounts committee had every right to read the legal 
opinions which had been obtained from the Solicitor General's 
department on a particular case but we were not getting them. He 
was prepared to say we had every right to have them but as far as 
he was concerned we were not getting them.
<P>
	Now we are debating access to information. I think access to 
information is a fundamental part which goes to the very heart of 
democracy. We on behalf of the taxpayers should know and have 
every right to know. When the taxpayers lose $2 billion they 
have every right  to know who made the mistake. Therefore, 
<P>

<B><A NAME="9097"> 9097 </A></B>
<P>
access to information is more fundamental than most people 
think.
<P>
	Think of other situations. A couple of months ago we were all 
distressed to find out that the Commissioner of Official 
Languages was driving back and forth between Ottawa and 
Montreal in a chauffeured limousine courtesy of the federal 
government, just because he would rather live in Montreal than 
in Ottawa.
<P>
	Access to information would help us to find those things out 
earlier. It is the taxpayers' money. Not only is he being driven in 
a chauffeured limousine between Ottawa and Montreal because 
he likes to live in Montreal but works in Ottawa, but we have 
also given him an apartment that I think costs $15,600. We are 
paying that because he likes to live in Montreal but his job is in 
Ottawa and he needs a place to hang his hat while he is here. We 
find these things out.
<P>
<B>(1825) </B>
<P>
	The chairman of CN Rail needed a place to hang his hat too so 
he got a $300,000 interest free loan from CN. Who owns CN? 
The taxpayers. Does CN make a big profit? CN is subsidized. 
There is a major loss of millions of dollars of taxpayers' money 
but the chairman said: ``I am worth it. I do a good job for this 
organization. I need and should have a $300,000 interest free 
loan in order for me to do my job better''.
<P>
	I am sure many taxpayers would agree with the idea that they 
could do their job better if they had an interest free loan of 
$300,000 but they cannot have it. There is a Liberal member 
over there who suggests that perhaps he could also do his job 
better if he had a $300,000 interest free loan. Only one, his 
seatmate, disagrees but that is by the way.
<P>
	The point we are trying to make is that if we had the 
information, people would be a lot more careful about the way 
they spend taxpayers' money than they do. If it is secret they do 
not have to answer to anybody; just keep it under the table and 
everything will be fine.
<P>
	I looked at the Access to Information Act. I opened it up and 
looked at section 13. The subject in subsection 2 is that the head 
of a government institution shall refuse to disclose any record. 
This is the Access to Information Act. I thought that must be an 
aberration. Section 13 deals with information obtained in 
confidence, but that is okay. He could perhaps refuse that one.
<P>
	How about federal-provincial affairs under section 14? The 
head of a government institution may refuse to disclose any 
record requested under this act. How about section 15, 
international affairs and defence? The head of a government 
institution may refuse to disclose any record requested under 
this act.
<P>
	On it goes. Under section 16 on law enforcement and 
investigation, the head of a government institution may refuse to 
disclose any record requested under the act. In section 17 
concerning the safety of individuals, again may refuse to 
disclose.
<P>
	By the time we get through to section 24 we get to statutory 
prohibitions. Virtually every document is protected and not 
open to information, to scrutiny, nor to the taxpayers who pay 
millions of dollars for this organization. The House of 
Commons has a budget of $243 million. That does not include 
the Senate. That is for here. Think of the mountains of paper we 
produce, all secret.
<P>
	The Reform Party in the last election said to cut $300 million 
or $400 million out of subsidies to crown corporations. That 
gives an idea of how much money they are losing. It is in the 
billions every year and nobody has the right to find out how they 
are losing the money, what kind of service they are producing, or 
anything along those lines.
<P>
	Surely the taxpayer who is footing the bill has the right to 
know. That is all we are asking. It is not very much. They are 
forking out about 40 per cent of their income every year in 
income taxes and it is all secret. The government denies them 
access. It does not get back to them to say what it is doing with 
their money.
<P>
	The honourable thing to do would be for the government to 
support the motion. The member for Red Deer put this motion 
forward seriously thinking that we would take note of the fact 
that Canadians need to know and want to know and government 
will work a lot better if they do know.
<P>

<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 
deemed to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="FISHERIES">FISHERIES</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, do you want 
me to start right now? It is not on MIL Davie but on fisheries.
<P>
	Excuse my English. I was just trying to maintain a good 
relationship with my colleagues. I hope the people will forgive 
me. I want to reassure French speaking Canadians, I am not

<P>
being assimilated. I was just practising my English. After all, at 
least 15 per cent of my constituents are English.
<P>
	I am pleased to rise this evening to address a question I have 
asked in this House concerning the repatriation of fisheries 
management. This question was put to the Minister of Fisheries 
on December 6. As usual, I was not satisfied with the answer 
and, therefore, intend to ask the question again this evening.
<P>
	On November 16, I asked the Minister of Fisheries and 
Oceans whether or not he intended to make changes to 
administrative responsibilities regarding fisheries, as requested 
by the Quebec fisheries minister at the federal-provincial 
conference of fisheries ministers held in Victoria on November 
1.
<P>
	I also asked the minister if he intended do comply to this 
request along the lines of what Quebec is asking for.
<P>
	The minister's answer was very clear. On November 16, the 
Minister of Fisheries and Oceans indicated that he had been 
asked this question by several provinces weeks or even months 
earlier.
<P>
	The minister understood the demands made by the provinces 
in order to improve administration of this resource and to 
eliminate unnecessary overlap in the fisheries sector.
<P>
	Indeed, Quebec had reached this conclusion several decades 
earlier. Unfortunately, since another Liberal government was in 
power at the time, in 1983-84, it decided to repatriate 
management. Today, in 1994, we still have to enter into 
negotiations merely to recover what was taken from us.
<P>
	The minister went on to say that he intended to respond 
directly to reorganizing the fisheries sector and that he looked 
forward to continued good dialogue and discussion with all of 
the provinces. He even added, ``including Quebec''. You will 
understand why I was anxious. Finally, we had someone who 
was willing to take action.
<P>
	I raised the matter again on December 6. At that time, I asked 
the minister why he had not responded to the request from the 
Quebec government, because the Quebec government had 
expressed, through a letter, its desire to make official the claims 
that had been made at the federal-provincial conference.
<P>
	The minister responded to me in a way that I would qualify as 
boastful. I expected something else from a minister. He said that 
it was a shocking thing that fully 35 days had passed. But when a 
minister is getting ready to table a fisheries plan that will affect 
all the Atlantic provinces, I think that 35 days is a long wait.
<P>
	Thirty-five days of silence, it is a long time, when Quebec is 
putting forward a serious and important proposal, asking the 
minister to start the negotiations.
<P>
	My message is: Does the minister intend to table in this House 
a planned schedule for meeting with his provincial counterparts, 
and to inform the population of Quebec and Canada of it?
<P>
	He has been a minister for 14 months now, and nothing is

agenda to meet with his counterparts from Newfoundland, 
Quebec and British Columbia?

	<B>Ms. Susan Whelan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of National Revenue, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I agree with the hon. 
member for Gaspé that the issues raised by Minister Landry are 
serious and require careful consideration.
<P>
	He should also know that the whole question of federal and 
provincial roles and responsibilities and the management of 
marine fisheries is of key concern to the Minister of Fisheries 
and Oceans.
<P>
	Far from ignoring the Quebec government's proposal I can 
assure my hon. colleague that the questions raised by Quebec are 
being carefully analysed. I do not believe that the hon. member 
would expect an immediate response to a proposal that calls for 
a fundamental restructuring of federal and provincial roles and 
responsibilities in the marine fishery.
<P>
	I understand that the Quebec government is seeking increased 
responsibilities in marine fisheries management and has 
devoted a great deal of energy to formulate its proposal. 
However, given the multilateral nature of the Atlantic fishery 
and the federal government's responsibility to ensure the 
conservation of the resource, I believe that his request needs to 
be addressed in the context of multilateral discussions of 
fisheries.
<P>
	For example, it is essential that we strive to reach a 
federal-provincial consensus on historic shares that will meet 
the needs of all stakeholders before we can move on to consider 
specific proposals.
<P>
	The Minister of Fisheries and Oceans has also indicated that 
in order to consolidate the views of all stakeholders on licensing 
reform and processing capacity reduction he will be launching 
an Atlantic round table in early 1995.
<P>
	I trust that this series of round table consultations will offer an 
opportunity to the Quebec government as well as to the other 
Atlantic provinces to play a constructive role in the design of the 
fishery of the future.
<P>
	Finally, I would like to respond to the comments made to the 
Quebec government regarding overlap and duplication in 
federal and provincial programs and services. As part of the 
government wide program review exercised, the Department of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9099"> 9099 </A></B>
<P>
Fisheries and Oceans has undertaken a thorough review of its 
programs with a view to maximizing efficiencies and 
eliminating costly duplications.
<P>
	Extensive consultations have led to the establishment of 
important co-operative agreements in the fisheries sector which 
demonstrate that federal and provincial fisheries programs can 
harmonize without putting at risk local interests with tangible 
benefits to taxpayers and clients.
<P>
	The Ministry of Fisheries and Oceans remains firmly 
committed to the path we embarked on some months ago which 
is designed to achieve new efficiencies and forge new and 
productive partnerships of all the stakeholders in the fishery.

	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
November 24, I asked the Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration a question on an order to deport Mrs. Thérèse 
Sabadin and her two children to the Seychelles. Mrs. Sabadin 
had suffered physical violence and had received death threats 
from her husband, who was convicted and subsequently 
deported to the Seychelles.
<P>
	Although this was a very sad case, Mrs. Sabadin was deported 
with her two children to Barbados and then sent back to Canada. 
This involuntary trip was very expensive for Mrs. Sabadin.
<P>
	Finally, as a result of numerous representations by the Bloc 
Quebecois and several women's organizations, the minister 
agreed to allow Mrs. Sabadin's application for permanent 
residence to be processed in Canada.
<P>
	Mrs. Sabadin now has to wait several months before she can 
get a ministerial permit. Until then, she will have no status in 
this country and will not be able to work. Without official 
papers, she will also have trouble obtaining social assistance 
and will have to wait at least a year before she can get permanent 
residence status. To apply, Mrs. Sabadin had to pay $700, which 
she did not have, in administrative costs. She had already paid 
$650 for her initial application. Action réfugiés Montréal, a 
community organization, paid the fee on her behalf.
<P>
	In this House, I have often criticized these fees as arbitrary 
and unfair. Recently, even the Liberal member for Winnipeg 
North was critical of this abuse of people in need by the 
Department of Immigration.
<P>
	I would ask the minister to be more sensitive to the plight of 
women who claim refugee status on the grounds of fear of 
persecution because of their gender.
<P>
	It is now ten days until Christmas and two weeks before the 
end of 1994, and I want to take this opportunity to send my best 
wishes to my constituents in Montreal North, especially those of 
ethnic origin, the Italians, Haitians, Arabs, Latin Americans, 
and so forth.
<P>
<B>(1840) </B>
<P>
	I also want to send my best wishes for health, happiness and 
peace to all new Quebecers and new Canadians. Despite the 
feelings of hostility that are apparent in some sectors of public 
opinion, I believe that most people still support immigration and 
opening our doors to refugees fleeing persecution. To the 
thousands of immigrants and refugees in Canada and Quebec, I 
want to send a message of support, understanding, solidarity and 
hope.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Ms. Susan Whelan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of National Revenue, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration confirmed for the hon. member on 
November 24 in this House that this case was being reviewed by 
immigration officials.
<P>
	The minister had previously advised a colleague of the hon. 
member on November 17 that immigration officials conduct an 
additional review in cases where there may be new information 
that may or might alter a decision to remove a person.
<P>
	Such reviews may be conducted when in keeping with the 
authority delegated by the minister to managers, a manager of a 
Canada immigration centre determines that there might be 
additional information.
<P>
	In this particular case a manager in the CIC in Montreal 
granted a two week reprieve in this case to give the individual an 
opportunity for further review.
<P>
	I am pleased to advise the hon. member that the additional 
review has been completed and immigration officials have 
determined that the individual and her children should be 
allowed to remain on humanitarian and compassionate grounds. 
The individual and her counsel have been advised of this 
decision.

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CUSTOMSBROKERS">CUSTOMS BROKERS</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in reply to 
two questions I recently asked in this House about the new 
regulations increasing bonds to be posted by customs brokers, 
the Minister of National Revenue referred me to the Canadian 
Association of Customs Brokers which seemingly supported his 
approach in this matter.
<P>
	First of all, let me say to the minister that the picture is 
somewhat different from what he told us then. On November 24, 
the association held a meeting where 883 members gave their 
opinion on the advisability of these new regulations. The results 
of the vote were 803 against the regulations, 74 in favour and 6 
abstentions. Because larger brokerage firms have multiple vot-
<P>

<B><A NAME="9100"> 9100 </A></B>
<P>
ing rights, the final result was 135 against the regulations, 141 in 
favour and 7 abstentions.
<P>
	A study conducted by Brian Hull and Associates, a 
well-known economist from Ottawa, for the coalition of small 
and medium size brokers, shows that the new regulations unduly 
favour the larger brokerage firms. If they were to be subjected to 
the same standards as smaller brokers, they would see their 
security bill jump $1 million in one case, and between $150,000 
and $180,000 in other cases, while they now pay only $30,000 
for a maximum security of $10 million.
<P>
	We can see the advantage given to these larger brokerage 
firms by this new administrative policy. Does the minister know 
that small and medium size brokers, those who broker 20,000 
imports or less per year create 2,500 direct jobs in Canada and 
that their disappearance by a stroke of his pen would have a 
dramatic effect?
<P>
	Does the minister know that with these new standards only 19 
brokers would remain in Canada thanks to the privilege he 
would be giving them by instituting a ceiling of $10 million for 
the security they must post.
<P>
	Let me quote the conclusions of Mr. Hull's study.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The effect of this new ruling by Revenue Canada for account 
security and the disproportionate burden of its impact as 
between large and small firms is to place the Government of 
Canada in violation of the basic principles of conduct on which 
the Competition Act of Canada is founded.
<P>
<B>(1845 ) </B>
<P>
	The effect of the new formula is to, first, impede the 
efficiency and adaptability of the Canadian economy; second, 
restrict opportunities for Canadian competition in global 
markets, while discriminating on behalf of foreign competition; 
third, seriously impede the opportunity for small and medium 
sized enterprises to participate in the Canadian economy; and, 
fourth, to reduce the choice of competitive prices and services 
available to Canadians.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	A $10 million security on a monthly invoice of $250 million is 
only 4 per cent, while a $1.8 million security for smaller brokers 
is 100 per cent of their monthly invoice.
<P>
	Does the minister, who is trying so hard to protect importers, 
realize that large brokerage firms are just as likely as small ones 
to go bankrupt? I would even go so far as to say that large 
diversified companies, with interests in transportation, storage, 
handling, run a higher risk. Take real estate development, for 
example, Campeau Corporation, the Reichman brothers and 
others went under before all the smaller companies disappeared. 
In the insurance business, did some large companies not go 
bankrupt before many small ones?
<P>
	If the minister is really committed to protecting the public, 
here is my suggestion: First, he should go back to the formula 
where everyone had ten days to pay duties and taxes, the way it 
is in the United States and the way it was in Canada before these 
interim payments, which are at the root of all our problems, were 
instituted. He should keep security at 100 per cent of monthly 
billings and make all brokers, large and small, equally 
responsible.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Susan Whelan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of National Revenue, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the department is 
considering increasing the security requirement for obtaining 
release prior to payment of duties and taxes to 100 per cent of the 
average monthly invoice up to a maximum of $10 million. This 
action is being considered in direct response to the number of 
cases where brokers fail to deliver to Revenue Canada funds 
received from their clients, the importers.
<P>
	Since importers remain liable, they have had to pay a second 
time to the department. As most brokers' clients are small 
businesses the department needs to ensure increased security to 
protect them and the jobs of the more than one million 
Canadians they employ.
<P>
	Extensive consultations have been undertaken with the 
Canadian Society of Customs Brokers that negotiated a master 
bond program to make it easier for their members to meet the 
new security requirements. Discussions have also been 
undertaken with the Canadian Importers Association. Whatever 
is decided I do not believe any financially viable broker will be 
forced out of business.
<P>
	Brokers are already provided with the flexibility to arrange 
for some of their clients to post their own security or to deliver 
interim payments to the department. Although many brokers 
have few assets in their companies they may also restructure 
their financial arrangements by using personal assets to obtain 
security.
<P>
	A recent enhancement has been discussed that would assist 
both brokers and importers in obtaining security. The 
requirements for importers posting their own security, whether 
or not they use a broker, would be based on an amount equivalent 
to the duties and taxes payable on a monthly basis, less the goods 
and services tax.
<P>
	This enhancement could make it easier for brokers to arrange 
for some clients to obtain security and enable them to protect the 
remainder of their clients from the consequences of default. As 
well, the cost of doing business for most of the 8,000 importers 
who deal directly with the department would not increase.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="9101"> 9101 </A></B>
<P>
	In conclusion, this enhancement is being discussed with the 
Canadian Importers Association and the Canadian Society of 
Customs Brokers, both of whom are contributing positively to 
resolving this issue.

	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Before we adjourn this evening, I 
would like to say a few words on a more personal note.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Chief senior page, André Frechette, has now worked most 
capably in the House for forty-two and a half years. Imagine, 
forty-two and a half years of putting up with members of 
Parliament.
<P>

<P>
	Tomorrow our Speaker will, I believe, pay tribute to Mr. 
Frechette and his long years of capable service to the House. 
Unfortunately I cannot be here and I would like to do so now. 
Can you imagine how many thousands of services Mr. Frechette 
has done for so many hundreds of members over those many 
years? We are all deeply in your debt, sir.
<P>

	<B>Mr. Plamondon:</B> Mr. Speaker, all of us in the Bloc Quebecois 
wish to join you in extending our best wishes to Mr. Fréchette on 
his retirement and say how much we have appreciated his work 
here in the House. I have had that privilege for the past ten years, 
and I want to say that although we will miss you very much, you 
truly deserve a wonderful retirement.
<P>

	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Pursuant to Standing Order 38(5), a 
motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been 
adopted. Accordingly the House stands adjourned until 
tomorrow at 10 a.m.
