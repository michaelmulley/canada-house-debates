military purposes.

communities, on their children and, indeed, on all the people of 
the Americas.  They do not wish to have a treaty that is inspired

point out that this has been negotiated in secret for too long 
and that the right to know is fundamental in a democracy.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Question No. 15—<B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B> 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the recent Human Resources Development Canada, 
HRDC, investigations regarding shell fishermen, clam diggers and 
buyers in New Brunswick Southwest: (<I>a</I>) how many individuals 
were called in for interrogation; (<I>b</I>) were these interrogations 
conducted solely by HRDC officials or in conjunction with other 
agencies or departments; (<I>c</I>) were these investigations 
conducted as a result of violations of employment insurance 
regulations by clam diggers or clam buyers; (<I>d</I>) were the 
persons or principals interrogated advised by written or verbal 
communication identifying the specific infractions being 
investigated; (<I>e</I>) was supporting documentations from other 
government agencies and departments in addition to HDRC records 
of alleged abuse or fraud, disclosed to those individuals and 
principals being interviewed; (<I>f</I>) what are the names and the 
addresses of all persons and principals interrogated; (<I>g</I>) what 
are the names of the employees who carried out the interviews and 
what government department or agency employs them; (<I>h</I>) was a 
report of this investigation submitted to the regional director 
manager, investigation and control; (<I>i</I>) was there an internal 
departmental investigation done to determine any real or 
potential conflict of interest in regard to departmental 
officials assigned to these investigations; (<I>j</I>) was a report 
immediately forwarded from the regional director manager to the 
director, control programs, national headquarters; and (<I>k</I>) at 
what time and date was the minister first made aware ot fhe 
magnitude of the investigation? 
</UL>
<P><A NAME="LINK27"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of the Human Resources Development, 
Lib.):</B> Human Resources Development Canada, HRDC, is mandated to 
carry out investigations in relation to the employment insurance 
program. As part of the investigation HRDC officials conduct 
interviews, not interrogations, with clients. Investigators 
adhere to a strict code of conduct that respects the rights and 
dignity of clients. The policies and guidelines on the code of 
conduct to which investigators must adhere while conducting 
investigations are outlined in the investigation and control 
manual. This manual chapter has recently been updated. However it 
is still in draft format. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As this investigation is ongoing it would be inappropriate to 
provide specific information on this case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(a) HRDC investigators interview clients in accordance with our 
code of conduct. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(b) These interviews were carried out solely by HRDC personnel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(c) Although an investigation commences as a result of a 
suspicion of abuse, at that point it cannot be determined if a 
violation has been committed. Before making that determination 
HRDC investigators gather information and then interview clients 
to validate the information obtained. A conclusion on whether a 
violation has occurred can only be made once the investigation is 
completed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(d) All investigations must be carried out within high standards 
of professional behaviour. Our information to date indicates 
that this investigation, like others the department conducts 
every year, is being carried out with the high standards of 
behaviour the department expects of its employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(e) During the course of an interview supporting documentation 
received from other government agencies could be disclosed to an 
EI client if the information is specific to their case and the 
client is required to provide a response. It would be 
inappropriate to provide a specific answer to the question as the 
investigation is ongoing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(f) As per the Privacy Act, the Employment Insurance Act, and 
associated policies and procedures this information is 
confidential. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(g) This is an ongoing investigation and it would be 
inappropriate to release the names of the investigators. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(h) This investigation is not finalized. Therefore a report on 
the investigation has not yet been completed by the 
investigators. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many activities involved in conducting an 
investigation including completing reports. For instance, the 
investigator gathers information, verifies its accuracy by 
various means including contacting employers and claimants via 
mail, telephone or in person interviews. Payroll records may also 
be inspected to verify employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Upon completion of an investigation investigators are required 
to write a report. The steps taken, facts received and records of 
any interviews are documented in the report of investigation 
which is the HRDC departmental form used to report on an 
investigation. The report of investigation is then referred to an 
HRDC insurance officer to make a decision based on the 
recommendations and information gathered during the 
investigation. Additional reports are sometimes prepared for 
cases of a sensitive nature and are usually sent to the regional 
level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(i) The investigation and control code of conduct specifically 
directs all investigation staff to declare any real, potential or 
apparent conflict of interest. This is also the case for all 
public servants and members of the judiciary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(j) Our information indicates that the investigators have been 
taking the appropriate steps in these circumstances and there has 
not been a need for a report to the regional manager. Such a 
report might be required if it had been brought to the attention 
of a manager that the conflict of interest guidelines were not 
followed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(k) The issue was brought to the attention of the minister on 
February 6, 2001, following a reference to this investigation in 
the media. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not HRDC policy to inform the minister of every 
investigation that is undertaken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Question No. 16—<B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B> 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the HRDC investigation process: (<I>a</I>) why is 
regional discretion in regard to the department's caution 
statement permitted to be exercised by HRDC officials; (<I>b</I>) has 
the department carried out an internal investigation concerning 
the practice of using the HRDC official consent form to obtain 
statements from claimants; (<I>c</I>) what is the procedure used by 
the department to ensure the reliability and credibility of all 
third party reports used to initiate investigations; (<I>d</I>) are 
interrogations conducted with the use of audio or video equipment 
in order to determine the accuracy and validity of testimony 
provided and techniques used during interrogation by departmental 
officials; (<I>e</I>) has HRDC considered providing duty counsel to 
avoid, minimize or eliminate any charter of rights challenges; 
(<I>f</I>) has the minister been counselled by the department 
regarding section 2.20 of the HRDC document investigation and 
control manual and, if so, what measures and directives have been 
taken to correct the apparent contradictions between this 
document and subsection 41(5) of the Employment Insurance Act; 
(<I>g</I>) why does the claimant not receive a copy of the signed 
statement of declaration; (<I>h</I>) why does the investigation and 
control manual not emphasize the legal responsibility of 
providing the claimant with a copy of the signed statement of 
declaration; (<I>i</I>) what process does the department use to evaluate the 
investigation control officer's performance; and (<I>j</I>) what 
specific action has the minister initiated to address the issue 
of incompetence and inexperience, as noted in the department's 
prosecution program review report and the auditor general's 
report regarding the investigation control officer? 
</UL>
<P><A NAME="LINK28"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, 
Lib.):</B> (a) Most contacts between citizens and Investigation and 
control officers, investigators, are discussions that involve 
exchanging information to obtain clarification and explanations 
on their claims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The investigation and control manual clearly directs 
investigators to caution an individual prior to taking a 
statement when the investigator has reasonable grounds to believe 
that the individual has committed an offence that is likely  to 
lead to a prosecution. Less than 1% of all investigations lead to 
prosecution every year. These procedures are followed by 
investigators in human resource centres across Canada. The 
decision to caution a client is based solely on whether 
prosecution is a consideration, as opposed to the geographical 
location. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(b) Departmental officials consulted are unaware of such a form. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(c) An investigation can be initiated from a variety of sources 
including tips from third parties. These tips can be received 
verbally, in writing, by e-mail or by phone and they can be from 
known or unknown sources. Human Resources Development Canada, 
HRDC, has the responsibility to protect the integrity of the 
employment insurance, EI, fund and as such has an obligation to 
investigate alleged fraud and abuse. While looking into such tips 
HRDC personnel undertake many activities to verify the accuracy 
of information received. This is the case whether the source of 
the tip is known or unknown. This could include but is not 
limited to contacting employers to verify payroll and employment 
records, requests by mail or telephone to claimants, and in 
person interviews. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(d) HRDC personnel interview clients in accordance with 
guidelines set out in the departmental code of conduct. The 
policy for investigation and control does not require the audio 
or video recording of interviews, but it does not preclude it 
either. Clients can however request such recordings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(e) HRDC personnel adhere to the legal principles governing the 
cautioning of individuals and their rights to legal counsel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Investigators do not have the authority to arrest or detain 
individuals. Nevertheless, when it is anticipated that an 
investigation may lead to a prosecution, clients are informed of 
their right to retain and instruct counsel without delay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>HRDC personnel will provide clients with a reasonable 
opportunity to consult counsel and they will provide them with 
information on legal aid if appropriate. HRDC personnel will 
cease questioning if the client wishes to retain counsel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only 1% of all investigations lead to prosecution. In view of 
this, the department has not considered providing duty counsel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(f) The directives provided in section 2.20 must be read in 
conjunction with the preceding sections of this chapter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As stated in section 2.20 officials can direct claimants under 
subsection 41(5) of the Unemployment Insurance Act, now changed to 
subsection 50(5) of the Employment Insurance Act, to attend an 
interview to provide additional information on their claims. The 
form used for this purpose is called a direction to report. It is 
the client's responsibility to attend such an interview and 
provide information as required. Should they decide not to attend 
or to withhold information, their benefits could be affected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the purpose of the interview pertains to a more serious 
matter that could lead to a prosecution, investigators use 
different methods to communicate with claimants such as by 
telephone or by using the form appointment for interview. In 
these types of interviews clients are informed of their right to 
retain and instruct counsel without delay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has not been consulted on the procedures outlined 
in the manuals since they are in line with the authorities 
delegated to HRDC employees. HRDC policies and procedures are in 
accordance with the law and the charter of rights and freedoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The investigation and control directorate is currently updating 
its manual to ensure the instructions and procedures are simple 
and clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(g) HRDC does not use a departmental form specifically titled 
statement of declaration. The report of interview is the 
departmental form used by investigators to document the 
information obtained during the interview.  It is HRDC policy 
however that all clients are provided with a copy of the report 
of interview. All clients have a right to request a copy of their 
report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(h) The investigation and control manual directs investigators 
to provide copies of the report of interview to the client. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(i) The timeliness, accuracy, clarity of documentation and 
fairness in an investigation are some of the key elements that 
are considered in the assessment of the investigation and control 
officer's performance. These evaluations can be carried out in 
various ways including such activities as reviewing 
investigator's files and in person feedback sessions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To maintain a high level of skills in its workforce HRDC 
provides investigators with ongoing training and refresher 
courses including such subjects as investigative skills and 
interviewing skills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(j) The downsizing of federal government employees which took 
place during the 1990s has resulted in the loss of more 
experienced investigators. To help build expertise in its 
workforce HRDC has put in place national training programs, 
monitoring and quality management policies which ensure that its 
investigation and control officers conduct investigations in a 
professional, courteous and fair manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the reference to the auditor general's 
criticisms, his December 2000 report referred to the working 
relationship between HRDC and Canada Customs and Revenue Agency, 
CCRA, in dealing with abuse and fraud in the context of current 
investigations into the activities of certain farm labour 
contractors in the lower Fraser Valley in British Columbia. The 
concerns raised in this report were essentially with the role of 
CCRA rulings officers, their training, general knowledge of the 
case, their investigative experience, ability to use our 
information, et cetera. Both departments recognize the need for 
co-operation and communication and have been working together to 
improve the working relationship.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>PATENT ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK31">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from May 7 consideration of the motion that 
Bill S-17, an act to amend the Patent Act, be read the second 
time and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK32"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to indicate at this time that I will be sharing my 
time with my colleague from Vancouver East. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to rise today to continue the debate on Bill S-17, 
an act to amend the Patent Act.  I guess to continue the debate 
would be much along the lines of saying that it has become 
apparent that the New Democratic Party is the only party taking 
part in the debate, and that is truly disappointing.  When bills 
such as this come to the House it is important to have an 
opposition party that has a different perspective from the 
government's. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would raise the price of prescription drugs in Canada 
and take over $200 million from the pockets of Canadians. All 
opposition parties should be up in arms and the government should 
be hanging its head in shame.  However, on the first day of the 
debate on the bill, it became very clear that we were the only 
ones speaking out on the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Alliance industry critic, the hon. member from Peace River, 
was absolutely thrilled and praised the government.  He ran out 
of words on how great the bill was.  For a party that talks about 
keeping money in the pockets of Canadians, it is rather 
shameful that it is more keen on keeping profit with the name 
brand drug companies, making sick people pay more and putting stress 
on our health care system by increasing the cost of drugs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Alliance members, as in a good many cases, are all talk and 
no action.  Although they tell Canadians they will be there for 
them, they really are not.  They are there for corporations. They 
are not speaking out on behalf of Canadians on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those who do not realize exactly what the bill entails, Bill 
S-17 is an act to amend the Patent Act.  The major issue is that 
the bill came through the Senate. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1015"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is becoming very apparent that whenever the government feels 
great shame and wants to rush a bill through it introduces it in 
the Senate and has it sent over to the House of Commons.  There 
are crucial moments when it has to get the legislation through 
quickly.  We all know that because of World Trade Organization 
rulings the government has to deal with the bill or be in 
contravention of the WTO. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is intended to come into compliance with World Trade 
Organization rulings.  It is not intended to do what is best for 
Canadians, what is best for Canada or, for that matter, what is 
best for the people of the world.  The bill is intended to come 
into compliance with World Trade Organizations rulings to put 
more money in the pockets of name brand drug companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The WTO rulings require that Canada lengthen the term of patent 
protection on drugs from 17 years to 20 years.  It is not as if 
there has not been protection for patent drug companies.  The 
former Progressive Conservative government made sure that drug 
companies would make money.  Patent protection was increased 
under its reign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal Party, which was the opposition at that time, 
slammed the Tories for coming across with a terrible piece of 
legislation that increased patent protection.  Now that the 
Liberals are in government they are increasing it even more. This 
is much along the lines of the Tories being opposed to the GST 
and the Liberals when in opposition slamming the Tories on the 
GST.  There is no difference whatsoever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill will eliminate a stockpiling exception which permitted 
generic drug companies to stockpile an inventory of patented 
drugs in the last six month period leading up to the expiration 
of a patent so that they were ready to go to market as soon as 
the patent expired.  The generic companies were ready to put the 
drug on the market to provide some cost relief to patients and 
users of the health care system in Canada, the people we should 
be looking after. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of the elimination of the stockpiling exception 
generic drug manufacturers will no longer be able to build up 
their inventories before first going to market.  Patent holders 
will enjoy a whole lot sooner a period of de facto monopoly 
pricing after the normal expiration of the patent.  The Canadian 
health care system, government and individual insurance plans 
will have to pay more during that delay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the de facto period available to brand name drug 
companies they have put injunctions in place to delay even 
further generic drug companies coming on line.  If there was a 
risk of a normal industry patent being infringed upon, the 
company would have to go through a court process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of the notice of compliance regulations through the 
Minister of Health and the acceptance of generic drugs coming on 
the market, brand name drug companies have been given an 
additional time period whereby they do not have to go through the 
normal court process.  I will give the House a clear version of 
this point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Contrary to regular court procedures of settling patent 
litigation in all other Canadian industrial sectors, the notice 
of compliance regulations allow triggering an automatic 
injunction blocking the regulatory approval of Health Canada of 
generic drugs for 24 months, based on a simple claim of 
infringement regardless of the merits of the brands patent case 
and without compensation for any abuse to the generic 
manufacturer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In over 80% of cases decided since the 1998 amendments the 
courts confirmed that the block generics did not infringe on any 
valid patents.  On top of name brand drug companies now having an 
extended patent, because of the notice of compliance through the 
office of the Minister of Health an additional two months will be 
added for no reason whatsoever.  This will be done at the whim of 
brand name drug companies because they want to make more money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not greedy enough that they have extended patents or that 
before they put affordable drugs on the market they will see 
people die on the streets. 
It is not greedy enough that they put on an injunction.  We do 
not have regulations in place to make sure they cannot put 
injunctions in place.  We do not have regulations in place to 
make sure that they need to have just cause.  They just need to 
have a whim that it will infringe on them.  They do not have to 
go through the normal court process.  They just prolong the 
period of time when generic drugs can come on the market.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There are those who say that brand name drug companies are 
putting a lot of money into research.  Yes, they are putting some 
money into research, but they do not put the whole pool of money 
into research.  A lot of the research is done over long periods 
of time through other sectors of the industry.  There is 
historical research and development incorporated into the 
development of new drugs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not all done strictly by drug manufacturers, to say 
nothing of the fact that they have received government funds and 
the benefits from people being trained in universities.  It is 
not as if they have not benefited from the system in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same people who say that we have to support brand name drug 
companies because of all the research they do sing the praises of 
those companies.  Those same companies would not allow or tried 
to fight countries to prevent them from producing crucial AIDS 
medication.  They did not want generic treatments to be sold at 
affordable prices in third world countries.  We had to have a 
major world outcry over what those drug companies were doing. 
People infected with AIDS were literally dying by the thousands 
but the brand name drug companies still wanted their last bit of 
blood.  They wanted every last penny they could squeeze out of a 
dying population in a major epidemic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had a lot more that I could have said, but I see that my time 
is running out and there are a number of members who want to 
speak to this issue, certainly my colleague from Vancouver East 
and others.  I encourage members of the House to recognize that 
this is a serious issue in Canada and a cost to our health care 
system.  I suggest members show a whole lot more interest in what 
is beneficial for all Canadians and not just for drug companies. 
<P><A NAME="LINK33"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend Robinson (Burnaby—Douglas, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I have listened with interest to the eloquent comments of my 
colleague from Churchill, who is also our spokesperson on industry 
and primarily responsible for this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member has reviewed the quite appalling history of the 
Liberal Party on this issue.  I am one of those members who was 
actually in the House in 1987 when Bill C-22 was brought before 
it by the Conservative government of the day.  I recall vividly 
Liberal MPs viciously and vigorously opposing the legislation. 
They said it was a sellout to multinational drug companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  They were right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend Robinson:</B>  They were absolutely right, as my 
colleague says.  I recall in 1992 when Bill C-91 was brought 
before the House, again by a Conservative government.  The now 
Minister of Industry, the member from Newfoundland, was up on his 
hind legs spitting nails and demanding that the government stand 
up for seniors, for the poor, for provincial drug plans, and 
oppose the draconian legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What have we seen since then?  The liberals got into government and in 
one of the most pathetic scenes I have seen in many years the 
Minister of Industry turned himself inside out, grovelled in 
front of Brian Mulroney over in Davos, Switzerland, and said he 
was sorry and that Mr. Mulroney was right.  It was pathetic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member for Churchill like to comment on the record of 
the Liberal Party on this issue?  If there were some other 
comments that she was not able to get in, I would be glad to hear 
them as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Bev Desjarlais:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have seen the actions 
of the new Minister of Industry in the House and know his 
historical background with regard to the issue.  Yes, it is 
extremely pathetic.  There is absolutely nothing worse than a 
politician who says one thing prior to an election, who says one 
thing while in opposition, and then does something else. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1025"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That kind of attitude and that lack of principles result in 
people having no faith in a democracy and a parliamentary system. 
For the sake of getting elected they mislead and try to pretend 
they are there to do what is best for Canadians.  Then they get 
into government and tell Brian Mulroney that they are sorry, that 
he was right.  I guess it must have been the two Brians.  That 
must have been what did it.  It is disappointing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to reflect upon my colleague's comments when he mentioned 
Bill C-22 and Bill C-91.  The difference between when those bills 
came up and this one came up is that the government is sneaking 
this one through the Senate, allowing next to no discussion 
nationwide on the issue.  That is what is happening.  Now it is 
in a panic state, will impose closure and do whatever because 
that is the way the government operates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue is important to all Canadians, to seniors most 
definitely.  Some of the most vulnerable people have been faced 
with huge increases in energy costs and a lack of government 
funding in numerous areas.  It is extremely disheartening to see 
the government imposing an even greater expense on them.  It is 
absolutely unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I expect a good number of seniors to be around at the next 
election.  They are a stalwart bunch and they will weather the 
storm under the government.  I want them to remember, especially 
those seniors in Ontario, how the Liberal members voted on this 
bill. 
<P><A NAME="LINK34"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon Benoit (Lakeland, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I agree with the member's comments about the government 
making promises during campaigns and then not respecting those 
promises.  We saw it on the GST.  We saw it on the free trade 
deal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member also made some comments about the Canadian Alliance 
critic never having enough good words to say about the government 
on this issue.  I suggest that the Canadian Alliance critic was 
saying that because this was agreed to in NAFTA, in the free 
trade agreement, we can continue to have this special trade 
agreement and relationship with the Americans and we have to 
respect the agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member be willing to have Canadians in her 
constituency, thousands of them, lose their jobs because we do 
not respect the trade deal?  Is that what the member is 
suggesting should happen? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Bev Desjarlais:</B>  Mr. Speaker, absolutely not, but I 
do not think we should go into those negotiations on our knees, 
begging.  We have a great nation.  We have a great supply of 
resources.  We have everything to be proud of.  We do not have to 
grovel when we are in trade negotiations.  Nobody is opposed to 
trade agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Alliance Party is often saying that parliament should decide 
what is happening within the country.  Parliament should decide 
what happens, not trade agreements made by people who are not 
elected.  That is the issue. 
<P><A NAME="LINK35"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
wholeheartedly agree with the member for Churchill and the member 
for Burnaby—Douglas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Barely two weeks ago we were in Quebec City with 60,000, 70,000 
or maybe even 80,000 people marching for democracy.  They were 
trying to take down the wall and trying to be heard.  I think it 
is important to note that the central issue underlying that 
process was about defending our democratic system.  It was about 
defending the right of democratically elected parliaments, 
legislatures or even municipal governments, to uphold the public 
interest and to make decisions that benefit the public interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take note of what happened in Quebec City because the 
opposition to the FTAA is directly related to the debate we are 
having in the House today on Bill S-17 and the drug patent law. 
We have probably the clearest example of the tail wagging the 
dog. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the Government of Canada rushing around to change its 
legislation to meet what?  Is it something based on public debate 
and discourse in the country?  No.  It is something based on a 
World Trade Organization tribunal ruling.

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the evidence of what we are up against in the country 
as a result of the capitulation by the government to 
international trade agreements that are literally, as my 
colleague from Churchill said, bleeding away not just people's 
ability to access prescription drugs in a reasonable and 
affordable way, but bleeding away our ability to make decisions 
about our country, decisions that affect how Canadians live, our 
quality of life and in whose interests we speak in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I feel very strongly that I need to say loud and clear to 
Canadians that every single member of the New Democratic Party 
was in Quebec City marching for democracy and upholding the 
public interest, and we are in the House today to fight the bill. 
The NDP is the only party in parliament to do this, because we in 
our party understand that the bill is very wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard some of the history of the bill.  It is not just 
something that has popped up out of the blue in the last few 
months.  It goes back to 1987 and the glorious days of the 
Mulroney government, which started changing the laws to favour 
these massive pharmaceutical companies by changing the patent 
rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be very clear about this.  It is about creating 
legislation that favours the profit making interests of very 
large pharmaceutical companies at the expense of providing 
accessible, generic prescriptions and drugs to Canadians.  This 
is now taking place on a global scale. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That happened in 1987.  As has been so eloquently pointed out by 
my colleagues, it is very sad to see the hypocrisy that takes 
place.  The mighty Liberals who took on the Mulroney government 
in 1987 and again in 1992 seemed to understand that those laws, 
Bill C-22 and Bill C-91 in those days, were a great threat to our 
public health care system and to Canadians' accessibility to 
affordable drugs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where are the Liberals on this issue now?  They are not even 
neutral on the question.  They have completely come around 360° 
and are now peddling the interests of those same pharmaceutical 
companies that 10 years ago they were speaking against.  Then 
years ago they clearly outlined their concerns about this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few weeks ago before the summit of the Americas in Quebec 
City, I attended the foreign affairs committee meeting.  The 
witnesses who came forward spoke directly to the issue of 
intellectual property rights, as they are called, and the 
so-called rights of these companies to restrict access to the 
generic versions of their drugs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that committee I heard a man speak.  I forget his name.  He 
was very smooth.  He was the chief spokesperson for the 
pharmaceutical association.  He had the gall to say that trade 
agreements like the FTAA and the orders that come from the WTO, 
which prompted this legislation, improve the quality of life for 
all people around the globe, that intellectual property rights 
and trade agreements actually improve quality of life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I sat there thinking how far removed from the truth that was. If 
anyone needs evidence of that, we have only to look at what took 
place in South Africa, where 39 pharmaceutical companies were 
actually forced, through public pressure, to withdraw their 
claims against the South African government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Millions of people who live in sub-Saharan Africa are dying of 
HIV and AIDS.  Millions of people in Latin America or Central 
America and around the globe are desperately in need of essential 
medicines, not just in terms of HIV and AIDS but for things like 
TB or hepatitis C.  These people understand that these trade 
agreements are not about improving the quality of life for 
ordinary people.  They are not about improving the quality of 
life for poor people or people who are sick.  This is about 
conferring greater concentrated power to those multinational 
corporations and the government is allowing to happen through the 
bill.

<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we stand today in absolute opposition to what is 
taking place.  I would like to point out to Canadians that the 
consequences of what would happen because of the bill are very 
dire indeed.  What would the consequences be?  Extending the 
patent from the current 17 years, which is bad enough, to 20 
years, as well as prohibiting generic companies from stockpiling 
drugs, means that the most likely thing that would happen would 
undoubtedly be a dramatic increase in prescription and drug 
prices for Canadians.  There is no question about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As this debate continues and the issue continues to unfold, we 
in the New Democratic Party have a very great resolve to work 
with other organizations, the labour movement, the Council of 
Canadians, environmental groups and seniors' groups, who 
understand what is really at stake here.  We have a role to play 
in parliament in trying to defeat this kind of legislation, but 
we also have a role in working with a broader community and 
bringing pressure to bear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe one day we will get to the point where we have the kind of 
mobilization that took place in South Africa in defeating the 
multinational corporations who were seeking litigation to prevent 
people from accessing essential medicines.  Maybe one day we will 
see that type of challenge in Canada.  At the very least today, 
we have to stand in opposition to this legislation.  We think it 
is bad legislation and is nothing more than conferring greater 
concentrations of power and profit to fewer multinational 
corporations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely that cannot be in the public interest.  I defy any member 
of the House to stand up and tell us how this can be 
characterized as being in the public interest.  The evidence, 
going back to 1987 and 1992 and now to what has happened with the 
FTAA, tells us that the opposite is true, that this is a bad 
piece of legislation.  It must be defeated, as must these 
international trade agreements that undermine the ability of our 
governments to make the very kinds of decisions that would ensure 
this legislation would not go ahead.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I can certainly understand and 
support some of the comments the hon. member made with respect to 
ensuring that any agreements to be negotiated pass through the 
House and that the Canadian public should be made very aware of 
and be knowledgeable about what is being negotiated, how it is 
being negotiated and what the principles are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quite frankly, though, with respect to the other comments about 
trying to defeat the free trade agreement and trying to demolish 
free trade, what is the member thinking of? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Kofi Annan, the secretary general of the United Nations, and 
leaders of poverty groups in South and Central America and in 
Africa want trade.  They want the obstacles and the barriers to 
trade removed.  They said if there is one thing they want it is 
trade, not aid.  For heaven's sake, they said, remove the 
barriers to trade that prevent us from maximizing our potential. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Opposition to free trade is opposition to the poorest people of 
our hemisphere and in this world of ours.  It is opposition to 
them being able to get on their feet.  The alternative to free 
trade is a country like Albania or the former U.S.S.R.  I ask the 
member how can she justify being against free trade when the 
people behind the free trade agreements are trying to deal with 
fair labour laws and good environmental laws and trying to 
improve the lot of the poorest people in our hemisphere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I certainly appreciate and 
welcome the comments from the member for Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca. 
However the member knows full well that the issue here is not 
trade just as a word.  Trade has existed for thousands of years 
among peoples whether they were part of a nation or not.  Trade 
is a part of who we are as human beings.  The issue we are 
debating through this legislation and under things like the FTAA 
is the issue of the rules that are created around those trade 
agreements.

<A HREF="#LINKT8"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, there are rules that create such restrictive 
policies around intellectual property rights that we end up with 
a piece of legislation such as this which will actually deny 
people access to affordable drugs in Canada.  Surely that is what 
the debate is about.  Let us not send up smokescreens and say the 
NDP is against trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the hon. member has listened to any of the debates in the 
House he will know that the NDP has advanced a position on a 
policy of fair trade based on respecting the dignity and rights 
of all people.  The NDP has a policy of trade that respects the 
authority of parliament to make decisions in the public interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will say again that this piece of legislation is the complete 
opposite of that.  The House is debating the legislation because 
the WTO, and who the heck is that, has dictated that it shall be 
done.  Is that not wrong?  I believe it is. 
<P><A NAME="LINK37"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Brian Fitzpatrick (Prince Albert, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I did not intend to become involved in the debate, 
but I just cannot resist it.  In 1945 at the end of the second 
world war, two Asian countries made choices.  India made a choice 
to throw up barriers and be an island unto itself.  Another 
country had another option and that was to become a global 
trader.  That was Japan.  Since the destruction of Japan in 1945, 
the Japanese have made their economy the second biggest in the 
world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP member seems to suggest that there are no advantages to 
trade or competition.  Would anybody seriously say that the auto 
industry in North America is not better today because of Toyota 
or Honda and that the products we have in the automotive sector 
have not been improved because of that type of competition?  That 
really seriously ignores a lot of reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another area that was raised is the issue of intellectual 
property, which is what I will pose my question on.  In regard to 
drugs, I know of companies that have spent up to $600 million or 
$700 million on research into new drugs which were never 
approved. I invested in some of those companies.  I know what 
their stock was worth when it was over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am asking the member to explain how in the world we are going 
to get new breakthrough drugs that provide effective treatment 
for a lot of diseases if the people who are taking all the 
risks— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B>  The hon. member for 
Vancouver East. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will briefly respond. 
Perhaps the member did not listen to the whole debate.  I clearly 
articulated the position of the NDP, which is not that we are 
somehow opposed to all trade.  We are talking about the need to 
create trade deals that have fair rules attached to them.  That 
is the essential point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as the member's second point is concerned, unfortunately 
it seems like he has really bought the line of the pharmaceutical 
companies.  Yes, we need research to be done, but why do we need 
to create so many restrictions which allow them to monopolize an 
industry and create a scenario whereby people cannot afford to 
pay for their drugs?  This is the problem we face.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
this bill is very important to our party.  We have indicated to 
the government that we do not intend to hold up this debate for 
much longer, and we appreciate the government's co-operation in 
this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For us the bill and the issues that it raises with respect to 
trade agreements and drug pricing go to the heart of our 
objection to what has been going on in this country for the last 
10 to 15 years.  I guess it has been 14 years if we go back to 
1987 when the first bill on changing the drug patent legislation 
in Canada first came before the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left> At that time it was a Progressive Conservative government under 
the leadership of Prime Minister Brian Mulroney.  A bill was 
introduced to reduce and transform the way in which we had 
constituted our drug patent and drug pricing policies in this 
country.  Until that point, we had a policy which had been 
established some decades before whereby generic drug 
manufacturers could bring onto the market generic imitations of 
new brand name drugs after only two years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was one of the reasons why we had one of the most envied 
health care systems in the world, not just in terms of quality 
but also in terms of being able to keep costs down.  We did not 
have to pay these exorbitant brand name costs or at least we did 
not have to pay them for very long.  We only had to pay them for 
two years, then after that our health care system could begin to 
use and doctors could begin to prescribe these new generic 
replacements.  Of course the brand name drugs were still 
available and could still be used. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1987 we understood, and we still understand, as a prelude to 
the free trade agreement negotiations between Canada and the 
United States, the Conservative government at that time, in a 
very strange form of negotiation, made a big concession before it 
even got to the table by giving into the Americans on this 
particular issue.  It was not just to the Americans.  There were 
a great many French multinational drug companies and others that 
were involved.  We were very much against this at the time. We 
were against it again in 1992, when Bill C-91 was brought in. I 
believe the bill in 1987 was Bill C-22. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were against it then and today we are against Bill S-17 which 
is part of a sequence of bills that have progressively eliminated 
the ability of Canada to have its own independent drug patent and 
drug pricing policy.  The fact that we could not and cannot 
maintain a system that worked so well for Canada, which was the 
result of a political decision taken in this country many years 
ago, is for us transparently what is wrong with the free trade 
agreement.  The fact is the rights, privileges and profits of 
multinational drug companies come first.  The rights, the 
privileges and the health of Canadians insofar as their need for 
access to cheaper drugs and collectively in terms of their need 
for a health care system that is less costly rather than more 
costly comes second. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Property is put before the public interest in such a blatant way 
that even the Liberals when they were in opposition could see 
this.  Or did they?  We have spent a fair bit of time and 
appropriately so pointing out that the Liberals have changed 
their position. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1050"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT10"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However I maintain that at another level it is not so much that 
they changed their position, it was the fact that they were 
insincere in their opposition to Bill C-22 and Bill C-91 in the 
first place, in the same way they were insincere in their 
opposition to the free trade agreement, with the possible 
exception of their leader at the time in 1988, Mr. Turner, who I 
have come to the opinion was sincere in his opposition to the 
free trade agreement.  At the same time, he led a party that was 
full of people, some of whom later became Prime Minister and 
Minister of Finance, who were not opposed to the free trade 
agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe now that they were not genuinely opposed to Bill C-22 
and Bill C-91 at the time because they knew, as we know, that the 
Liberal Party ultimately would do the bidding of the big business 
community.  There are few businesses in this country and 
internationally that are bigger than the multinational drug 
companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not just that they do the bidding of these companies, the 
problem is now the bidding and the interests of these 
multinational drug companies is enshrined in international trade 
agreements, like the World Trade Organization.  Now these 
interests can be advanced without there being a political 
decision or without anybody having to take responsibility for it. 
Nowadays, all the drug companies have to do is invoke the WTO and 
no governing political party takes any responsibility for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals get up and say they have to respect our 
international obligations and that they have to respect the trade 
agreements that they have signed, never mind that, at least with 
respect to NAFTA and the WTO, it was the Liberals who signed 
Canada on to the NAFTA and the WTO.  Why did they sign these 
agreements if they were sincere in their opposition back in 1987 
and 1992?  Only they can answer that, and we look forward some 
day to an honest reckoning of just what happened along the road 
to corporate Damascus on the part of the Liberals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For us, although the bill implements a certain ruling of the WTO 
and is a smaller ruling than the larger ruling in the first 
place, it is all part and parcel of a trend in international and 
regional trade agreements that gives priority to the interests 
and the profits of big business, in this case large drug 
companies, over the interests of the Canadian people and of 
people all around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Look at the struggle that was fortunately just won in South 
Africa where the drug companies invoked their patent rights to 
prevent the distribution of medicines that treated the disease of 
AIDS. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I am at it, I asked a question in the House not so long 
ago.  It had to do with emerging therapies and treatments related 
to gene therapies.  I asked the Minister of Health what the 
government would do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many people in the medical community who are worried 
that the same thing that has been done with drugs by the kinds of 
things we are debating today will be done with these gene 
therapies, and that some time in the future any time we use a 
particular gene therapy we will have to pay a royalty to some big 
drug company that invented that gene therapy in the first place. 
This will become another burden on our health care system.  It 
will become another argument for privatization, more private 
sector money and more user fees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However I asked the question of the Minister of Health, and for 
me this was very symbolic, because I thought it was a health 
issue.  I thought that distributing cures, therapies and 
medicines is something over which the Minister of Health ought to 
have some kind of ultimate authority. 
Who rose in his place to answer my question or should I say who 
rose in his place to not answer my question?  It was the Minister 
of Industry.

<A HREF="#LINKT11"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not surprised that I did not get an answer.  I suppose I 
should not have been surprised that it was the Minister of 
Industry who got up and said that it was a very interesting 
question, blah, blah, blah. The fact that the government 
sees this as an industrial question really had already answered 
my question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a new territory.  It is fine if the Liberals wanted to 
say that perhaps drugs are history and maybe it should be dealt 
with by the WTO, but there is a whole new area that they must 
stand fast on, and that is to not allow these new gene therapies 
to be taken over by the philosophy that they are private or 
corporate property and should be distributed on the basis of what 
is in the best interests of the profit margins of the companies 
involved.  They could take a stand there if they did not want to 
go back and rewrite their own history.  They are not even willing 
to do that.  They see it as an industrial matter rather than a 
health matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all these reasons, we feel it is unfortunate that there 
seems to be this consensus in the House, a consensus of which we 
are not a part, and that this is something that is beyond 
criticism.  It reflects the political monoculture that has 
developed in the House of Commons among the Bloc, the Alliance, 
the Conservatives and the Liberals, all part of a seamless 
apology for corporate interests, with only the NDP standing here 
in our place saying that there has to be another way to look at 
drugs, at health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is there no other way of looking at drugs and health that will 
not put corporate interest first and people second?  We believe 
there is.  We think we had that before the Conservatives and then 
the Liberals moved to destroy the generic drug regime that we had 
in place.  We feel that we can have that again if we had 
governments around the world that were willing to stand up to 
corporate interest, instead of engaging in these acts of 
self-inflicted powerlessness by which they give up the power that 
they once had as governments to act in the public interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The governments give up their power to trade agreements.  Then 
when these trade agreements kick in years later and impose 
certain conditions on them, they do not know what to do as they 
are just living up to their international obligations.  They may 
be international obligations now, but they were political choices 
at one time that governments made and that the people had at one 
point but they no longer have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want a government that works for the day when those kinds of 
political choices return to parliament and the Canadian people so 
they can decide what kind of generic drug regime they want rather 
than leaving it in the hands of trade bureaucrats at the WTO who 
are lunching constantly with the drug manufacturers and not 
lunching with the people whose health care system will be 
drastically affected by their decisions.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dan McTeague (Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, unfortunately, I did not have the opportunity to take 
part in this debate lately. I was at the Standing Committee on 
Industry, Science and Technology, which is studying other issues. 
It will be impossible for me to make a long speech, of course, 
but I have a few questions for my colleague from 
Winnipeg—Transcona. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand the frustration of the member.  Of course the 
member will remember my work, not only in the House of Commons as 
a member who was elected in 1993, but also my role in 1995 on the 
Standing Committee on Scrutiny of Regulations when I 
single-handedly attempted to bring down the notice of compliance, 
which was not part and parcel of what the House of Commons had 
voted for, and the manner in which the industry committee had 
treated it in 1992 when we were dealing with Bill C-91. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot very well go back and change what has occurred, but I 
would like to ask two specific questions of the member on where I 
believe the House of Commons can act with some force and 
decisiveness. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1100"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I will deal with the supreme court decision of 1998 which 
dealt with patented medicines and notice of compliance 
regulations.  In that decision Justice Iacobucci said that 
section 55 of the Patent Act, which allows drug companies to 
claim an infringement and effectively maintain a 20 year patent 
period before allowing generic companies to make cheaper copies 
of new drugs, has been a question of contention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. justice suggested that 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be manifestly unjust to 
subject generic producers to such a draconian regime without at 
least permitting them to protect themselves by reducing the 
length of the injunction and initiating the NOC process as early 
as possible. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to hear the comments of the hon. member.  This is 
an issue we can address and it is certainly on the table in terms 
of the bill.  We know why Bill S-17 was concocted with respect to 
WTO. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, and the hon. member has touched on it with respect to 
South Africa, does he see an opportunity here for the government, 
in concert with parliamentarians, to allow a return to compulsory 
licensing to address the AIDS pandemic in Africa and other places 
around the world?  More specifically, could the government, 
guided by CIDA, allow a return to compulsory licensing in order 
to bring down drug costs?  That would be the Canadian way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the point the hon. member 
has made about the supreme court opinion is well taken.  I am 
sorry he was not able to persuade his own government to include 
something in the legislation to deal with that.  Perhaps that is 
what the hon. member has in mind for when the bill gets to 
committee.  Perhaps he will go to committee and argue for changes 
or additions to the bill that reflect what the supreme court had 
to say on the matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to South Africa, I am not sure what the hon. member 
means when he talks about acting through CIDA to return 
compulsory licensing.  However, I hope, and I am sure the drug 
companies do not hope it but I do, that the backing down of 
multinational drug companies with respect to South Africa and 
their willingness to overlook or transcend their immediate 
self-interest and patent rights to deal with the AIDS epidemic 
will become not only a legal but a moral precedent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such a moral precedent could instruct the international 
community, governments that participate in constructing 
international agreements and citizens around the world that if a 
sufficient moral argument is made we might someday reverse the 
way various trade agreements have entrenched property rights over 
the rights of the sick. 
<P><A NAME="LINK40"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is 
with pleasure today that I rise to speak to this important 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When applied to drug development and production, the whole 
notion of intellectual property protection becomes a very 
divisive issue that in many ways pits the right to patent 
protection and commercial opportunities for Canadians and 
Canadian pharmaceutical companies against the need for cost 
effective access to these technologies.

<A HREF="#LINKT13"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to recognize that without investment in research 
and development there would never be a debate on how best to 
enable important pharmaceutical developments to reach people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whatever public policy we put forward regarding intellectual 
property, patent protection and commercialization, we must be 
careful not to reduce incentives to the point where we stifle the 
development of leading edge drugs and treatments that ultimately 
benefit all Canadians.  At some point these technologies and 
pharmaceuticals become commodities and the generic industry plays 
a role in that as it occurs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This piece of legislation, like so many others passed by the 
Liberals, identifies and in some ways exemplifies the hypocrisy 
that pervades the government.  The government says the WTO ruling 
has no significant or sustained impact on drug costs.  It says 
the impact of the ruling over the eight year horizon is 
equivalent to less than 1% of pharmaceutical sales in a single 
year.  It says Canadians will continue to have access to 
affordable drugs at prices below those of the U.S. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These arguments sound eerily similar to those presented by the 
Conservative government in the early 1990s, arguments which were 
rejected by the opposition Liberals.  The current Minister of 
Industry and self-promotion was the Liberal opposition's key 
spokesperson against using patent and intellectual property 
protection as a vehicle for promoting a more successful Canadian 
pharmaceutical industry and greater economic growth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a 180° shift in the position of the Liberals.  It is 
completely consistent with their inconsistency on free trade, the 
GST and others issues.  I will quote the colourful language used 
at that time by the current Minister of Industry and 
self-promotion.  In the early 1990s he said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The citizens will need more than generic drugs to recover from 
the festering wounds which are about to be inflicted on the 
exposed ankles of Canada's poorest citizens when the Minister 
sinks his teeth in, past the bone, into the marrow and sucks the 
lifeblood out of Canada's poorest citizens with Bill C-22. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was the statement of the then Liberal opposition member who 
is now the Minister of Industry and self-promotion.  Was he 
referring to the minister at the time or to himself?  Could he 
look into the future and see that he would become a minister and 
eagerly embrace the policies he vociferously opposed in 
opposition? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Industry has stated on several occasions, and 
most recently at an economic conference in Davos, that he was 
wrong about the policies he espoused and opposed while in 
opposition and that the Conservative Party had been right. 
Perhaps through action he is now making the same admission.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is in some ways annoying and upsetting for Conservatives to 
see Liberals embrace policies they had opposed in opposition and 
then take credit for the results.  However we would prefer that 
they steal Conservative policies and take credit for the results 
than implement their own policies, which could in the long term 
have a far more negative impact on the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While it is important to point out their hypocrisy on these 
issues it is also important to credit them with extraordinary 
intellectual flexibility.  They are at least intelligent enough 
to swallow themselves whole and recognize that some policies 
introduced by the previous government have made their lives a 
heck of a lot easier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Woody Allen once said that 80% of life is just showing up.  For 
seven years the government has done just that but for probably 
closer to 90%.  For the Prime Minister it is probably 95%.  I am 
not talking about golf; I am talking about governing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must walk a fine line.  We must provide enough patent 
protection to allow the pharmaceutical industry and the emerging 
biotech industry to grow and prosper and develop new technologies 
which have such potential for the future of humankind.  However 
we must also ensure that new medicines and pharmaceuticals reach 
the public in the most cost effective and timely way.  It is a 
difficult balance to maintain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our current patent protection in Canada by and large strikes a 
reasonable balance.  Our policy is not working badly and has 
created economic growth in the leading edge, knowledge based 
industries of pharmaceuticals and biotechnology.  That being the 
case, we should be looking at ways to create a more effective 
balance between the two policy priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The <I>Economist</I> magazine about three years ago published a 
study conducted in the U.K. about a policy which could balance 
the need for patent protection with the importance of getting 
pharmaceuticals into the hands of those who need them in the most 
cost effective way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It involved an auctioning process whereby when pharmaceutical 
companies announced new drugs or medical treatments governments 
would have an opportunity to bid on them.   Governments would of 
course pay a significant price for the privilege by recognizing 
the public good of making pharmaceuticals more widely available. 
They would then make them available to the generics in order to 
provide lower cost access to the consumer.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We should at least consider doing it that way or investigate the 
matter as part of the debate in order to balance patent 
protection and economic opportunities for pharmaceutical 
companies and biotech companies while making these new 
pharmaceuticals available more expeditiously to the public. We 
should be engaging in a debate that would find ways to bring 
these two divergent interests together in a more realistic way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other aspect we have to consider is the emergence of 
Canada's biotechnology sector.  Around the world biotechnology is 
one of the key components of information technology within the 
knowledge based industries, which are becoming so important to 
our global competitiveness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has demonstrated some significant strengths on the 
biotech side which capitalizes on our post-secondary university 
infrastructure.  In Nova Scotia we have 11 degree granting 
institutions.  Those universities, which were at one point seen 
as a cost, are now in a knowledge based economy and seen as an 
asset. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If members looked at the symbiotic relationship between the 
small biotech companies and the big pharmaceutical companies, 
they would recognize that this is not simply an argument about 
big business and big pharmaceutical companies versus consumers. 
The notion that only the big pharmaceutical companies benefit 
from patent protection is a specious argument. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we were to reduce patent protection and take an aggressive 
approach that would reduce the incentives for pharmaceutical 
companies to develop new drugs and treatments, we would be 
significantly hurting the biotech companies.  They are, by and 
large, small companies and involve our post-secondary 
institutions across the country.  We must be very careful not to 
do something from a political perspective that would have a 
negative impact on Canada's competitiveness in biotechnology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must also consider a second argument.  How do we get new 
drugs or pharmaceuticals into the hands of Canadians faster?  If 
we cannot ensure an environment within which those new 
technologies can be developed in the first place, the second 
discussion is a moot one.  It would be a terrible step backward 
for the government to reduce, in any way, shape or form, the 
incentives we have in place to encourage the leading edge 
development of new pharmaceuticals and new advancements in 
biotechnology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some provinces have been more successful than others in terms of 
creating a critical mass of activities in these areas.  This is 
one of the areas where significant growth can be achieved in the 
future both on the biotech side and in pharmaceuticals.  We must 
focus on our medical schools and our undergraduate programs in 
terms of science and research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to see that the government has in fact recognized 
the error of its ways in the past.  It has embraced and continues 
to support and foster Progressive Conservative policies with the 
introduction of this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope we will have an opportunity in the future to discuss some 
of the other alternatives that could balance more effectively the 
needs of consumers and patients.  It is important to create a 
greater level of commercialization, intellectual property 
protection and opportunities in Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dan McTeague (Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I was interested in the member's comments about trying 
to find the balance between consumers and patents as well as the 
need to ensure that Canada remains competitive globally from the 
perspective and interest of intellectual property. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I too am somewhat confounded by how we have changed over the 
past few years.  I was also interested to hear many of the 
comments made by his Conservative colleagues in the Senate who 
also have demonstrated a rather interesting perspective that is 
far different from the enthusiasm that was expressed by his party 
and his colleagues.  Perhaps they are more sensitive now because 
of their age, being at the point where they may have to use some 
of these therapies and drugs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the hon. member will be sitting on the industry committee 
with me, will he take some of those enlightening comments from 
his Senate colleagues to the committee?  His Conservative 
colleagues in the Senate have sent a number of caution flags, 
particularly in the area of infringement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Infringement goes well beyond Canada's obligations to the WTO 
and beyond the question of honouring a lengthy drug patent regime 
that is competitive by any international standard.  Will he speak 
in the industry committee and in the House about the need to 
ensure that evidence brought forward on the basis of a claim of 
infringement be not based on any prima facie evidence that has to 
be brought before court?  Will the hon. member raise that issue 
and try to advocate it?  The opportunity to do that is now with 
Bill S-17. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the senators in our 
national caucus have advanced some important ideas on the 
legislation.  Certainly we should be discussing some of them in 
the industry committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would argue that some of our senators' aversions to stronger 
patent protection has very little to do with their age.  The fact 
is that once one is in the Senate aging ceases to a considerable 
extent and the quality of life issues there help preserve mental 
acuity, health and life for a lot longer.  The differences in age 
between some of our senators and some of the members of our 
elected caucus really do not play into this in real terms.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Canadian

eloquent speech.  I would like his response to a very important 
issue dealing with access to essential medication in developing 
countries.  This was brought up by the NDP and it is an important 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We just saw the recent court battle in South Africa over access 
to anti-HIV medications.  HIV is one of a series of diseases 
plaguing developing countries for which there are very simple, 
cheap and easily distributed drugs that could have a widespread 
and positive effect on the lives of these people.  The research 
based pharmaceutical companies have a program that enables 
developing countries to get access, but much more has to be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What can be done to enable Canada, perhaps CIDA, to work in 
partnership with the research based pharmaceutical companies and 
the generic companies in order to provide access in developing 
countries to essential, cheap medications that can have a 
profound effect on some of the terrible scourges that plague 
these countries, such as TB, kala azar, river blindness and 
malaria?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member has identified 
an area of public interest and public good that is 
extraordinarily important.  It is the availability of these 
pharmaceuticals in developing countries where the need is so 
great. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to find ways to balance the profit motivation of 
research based pharmaceuticals with the public good of having the 
drugs available to people in more cost effective and timely ways. 
That is where government can play a role.  If we look at the long 
term cost of treatment with leading edge pharmaceuticals versus 
not doing anything at all, it is a better investment to treat 
them.  The member, as a physician who has worked in developing 
countries, is absolutely right in suggesting that CIDA could play 
a role. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The governments of Canada, provincial and federal, could work 
together to play a role in ensuring that the profit motivation is 
not weakened for the research based pharmaceuticals to develop 
the new technologies.  Developing new drugs is a lot like mineral 
exploration.  A lot of holes are dug before hitting a vein of 
minerals.  No pun intended on the vein. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Drug research is expensive and not all research initiatives 
actually yield results.  We should not do anything to reduce the 
financial incentives that create opportunities in biotechnologies 
and pharmaceuticals but we should be addressing in a more 
innovative way the question of what role government has in 
ensuring the public good and by facilitating the public's access 
to the drugs in a cost effective and timely manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I proposed for consideration the notion of having governments 
purchase the technologies through an option process once the 
technologies are developed.  This is similar to a proposal 
published in the <I>Economist</I> about three years ago.  There 
was a study done on it and it is one area of debate that we 
should consider and be engaged in.  It would be a way to balance 
the profit motivation of private interests to ensure that we 
continue to develop the leading edge pharmaceuticals that we 
need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would also ensure that governments have a role in delivering 
new technologies and pharmaceuticals to the public whether they 
be here or in developing countries where the need, as the hon. 
member suggested, is absolutely critical.  We can make strong 
arguments in favour of a government role on the second part of 
the issue.  The priority should be, once the drugs are developed, 
to get the drugs to the people who need them the most whether 
they are in our country or in the developing world. 
<P><A NAME="LINK43"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
have to say that the member speaks this much in caucus as well. 
He rambles and goes on and on.  However, he does have an awful 
lot of intelligent things to say.  I would like to make two 
comments and have the hon. member for Kings—Hants respond. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He gave a scathing critique on the Minister of Industry 
regarding his flip flop on his position respecting the 
legislation.  Does the member believe that the Minister of 
Industry has actually had a philosophical mindset change, that he 
now embraces the legislation, or does he see it as a bit of 
political theatrics on the part of the minister?  I hope he can 
answer that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member talked about the need for huge capital investment in 
research and development. 
If the bill is not approved, is it his opinion that a lot of the 
research and development dollars that are in this country now 
would flee the country if companies did not have the patent 
protection that would be in place through this proposed 
legislation?

party says something nasty about you in this place, you are 
really limited in terms of your response.  Therefore I guess I 
will not even talk about the first part of that question and 
comment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the political question about the current Minister of Industry 
and self-promotion, I would argue that for the individual to have 
had a philosophical change in mindset would, first, require a 
philosophy and, second, a mind.  I have not seen a tremendous 
degree of evidence in support of either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of capital investment, I fear that if we reduce the 
incentives for leading edge, or in this case bleeding edge, 
development of pharmaceuticals and biotech in Canada, we will 
reduce and drive the much needed capital and investment from 
Canada.  It is not just taxes that redistribute investment.  It 
is also regulations, particularly in the areas of intellectual 
property and knowledge based economies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the hon. member is absolutely right.  We would be taking 
a huge risk of losing a lot of that investment, productivity, 
growth and opportunity for Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
a pleasure to take part in today's debate on Bill S-17, an act to 
amend the Patent Act. The objective of the bill is clearly to 
change our patent legislation in light of two recent WTO rulings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first ruling relates to the duration of patents before 
October 1, 1989, and the second concerns the provisions of the 
act on storage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1987, several important changes were made to the Patent Act. 
The duration of patent protection went from 17 years after patent 
registration to 20 years after the filing of the patent 
application. That change came into effect on October 1, 1989. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before the Uruguay round, multilateral trade negotiations on 
GATT did not cover intellectual property rights. The Uruguay 
round, which gave birth to the WTO, also produced the agreement 
on trade related aspects of intellectual property rights, which 
contains certain provisions on patent protection. Section 33, for 
example, says that the protection duration must not be less than 
20 years from the date the patent application was filed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a matter of fact, in 1992 the federal government undertook to 
amend the Patent Act by introducing in the House of Commons Bill 
C-91, an act to amend the Patent Act, 1992. This bill eliminated 
compulsory licensing for drugs. Compulsory licensing had been set 
up under the act. It authorized the licence owner, and only him, 
to produce, use and sell a patented invention before the patent 
expired. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill also created two exceptions to infringement of patent, 
a rule under which anyone who produced, used or sold a product 
protected by a valid patent without the consent of the patent 
owner could be sued for infringement of patent, by authorizing 
the use of a patent for certain purposes before it expired.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to provide members of the House with some 
background information. At the end of 1997, the European Union 
asked Canada to hold consultations as part of the dispute 
settlement procedures of the WTO, on the one hand because of the 
protection provided to pharmaceutical inventions under Patent 
Act, and on the other because of Canada's obligations under the 
TRIPS agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Specifically, the European Union was concerned about the 
exceptions regarding regulatory approval and storage. In early 
1999, the WTO created a special panel mandated to review the 
European Union challenge to these two exceptions under the 
agreement, with regard to intellectual property rights as they 
related to trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The European Union argued in this regard that the Patent Act and 
the regulations authorizing protection and storage of drugs 
without the consent of the owners of the patent during the six 
months prior to its expiry—this is section 55.2(2)—was an 
infringement of Canada's obligations under the TRIPS 
agreement—namely sections 28.1 and 33.1. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The European Union also argued that by applying to drug patent 
owners a less generous treatment than for other technological 
areas, Canada had ignored its obligations under section 27.1 of 
the TRIPS agreement, which provides for the granting of patents 
and the enjoyment of patent rights without discrimination based 
on technology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On this occasion, the European Union also indicated that the 
provisions of section 55.2(1) of the Patent Act authorizing a 
third party, without the consent of the patent holder, to use a 
patented invention during the term of the patent, in order to 
obtain regulatory approval for the sale of an equivalent product 
after the expiry of the patent, violated the provisions of 
section 28.1 of the agreement on TRIPS. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The WTO struck a special panel, which backed the European Union 
as far as the exception relating to storage contained in section 
55.2(2) of the Patent Act was concerned, deeming it to be 
incompatible with Canada's obligations under section 4 of the 
agreement on TRIPS. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada was to implement the panel's decision concerning the 
exception relating to storage by October 7, 2000 at the latest. 
The manufacturing and storage of patented medicines regulations 
were revoked in accordance with this decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In September 1999, a special WTO panel was struck to address a 
claim by the United States that the protected period conferred by 
a Canadian patent as the result of an application filed prior to 
October 1, 1989 was incompatible with the obligations under the 
agreement on TRIPS.  The same thing is happening today with the 
United States, as in the example of the softwood lumber agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the United States, under the agreement, the 
protection conferred by a patent is for a minimum of 20 years 
from the date the application was filed. Patents granted in 
connection with applications filed prior to October 1, 1989, 
those granted under the old legislation, with a duration of 17 
years from date of issue, would therefore be contrary to the 
agreement on TRIPS, if that period of 17 years from date of issue 
is shorter less than 20 years from date of filing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This argument applied to patents under the old legislation that 
were issued within three years of the date of filing. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1140"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT20"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of the position the United States has stated, Canada 
maintained that the patents granted under the old act enjoyed 
essentially the same protection as those granted under the new 
legislation, and that the provisions of the TRIPS agreement on 
the term of protection did not apply to patents granted before 
the coming into effect of the agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In October 2000, the WTO ruled in favour of the United States. 
It felt that the term of protection for patents granted under the 
old act was not compatible with the TRIPS agreement in the case 
of patents granted during the three years following the date that 
the request was made. I am referring to section 5. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-17 would amend the Patent Act to comply with the 
rulings issued by the WTO following the challenges by the 
Europeans and the Americans concerning certain provisions of the 
act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois supports these changes. It is clear that the 
protection of intellectual property must go along with 
technological and pharmaceutical advances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, it is unfortunate that Canada had to appear twice 
before the WTO's tribunal to solve this dispute, which is, after 
all, a minor one. There are much more fundamental issues with 
which the tribunal should be dealing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am thinking, among others, of the lumber issue where, even 
after registering several victories, Canada literally caved in to 
the Americans by imposing quotas on Canadian and Quebec lumber 
producers. The agreement on softwood lumber expired on March 31 
and we could again find ourselves before the WTO's tribunal, 
which will have to deal with this problem for the fourth time. 
Needless to say, this is a critical issue for our lumber 
producing regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister for International Trade ought to stand up to the 
Americans, in my opinion. Someone should give him something to 
make him strong enough to tell the Americans that the only 
possible solution, in the short and the long term, is a return to 
full free trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude by saying that the protection Canada must 
provide to researchers regarding their inventions must comply 
with international agreements. However, Canada could go even 
further, since it is lagging behind the United States and the 
European Union. Nevertheless, I will be pleased to support this 
bill. 
<P><A NAME="LINK45"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am very happy to speak after my hon. colleague from Jonquière 
who, as we know, has a profound interest in consumers and 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was saying to my colleague, the hon. member for 
Lac-Saint-Jean—Saguenay, who has been, in our party and to some 
extent in this parliament, a leader as far as the globalization 
issue is concerned, that if we were looking for an example of 
globalization affecting the national sovereignty of a state, we 
could take this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me explain. Canada signed a number of World Trade 
Organization, WTO, agreements, including one on the protection of 
intellectual property rights and trade. As we can understand, 
patents are linked to intellectual property. A patent is what 
somebody who has developed an invention applies for in order to 
have exclusivity for a number of years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>About a year ago, the WTO handed down a ruling concerning 
Canadian patents. This ruling followed a challenge by the United 
States about some form of unfair competition. The mechanisms in 
place within the WTO have played their role. There are appeal 
mechanisms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many references to these in the bill. My hon. 
colleague from Jonquière probably mentioned it already. The bill 
refers to the dispute settlement body, or DSB, of the WTO. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1145"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT21"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The dispute settlement body gave a ruling that was not in 
Canada's favour.  Two pieces of legislation were passed, Bill 
C-22 and another law we reviewed more recently, four years ago. 
The Canadian Patent Act provides for a five year review. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two types of patents.  The patents that existed prior 
to 1986 are protected for 17 years.  Those that date from after 
1986 are protected for 20 years, under the latest legislation we 
have passed.  I was a member of the committee reviewing the law, 
with the member for Témiscamingue, whose unfailing devotion to 
the brand name drug industry is well known. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ruling was given.  It came out that there are two types 
of patent in Canada: those protected for 17 years and those 
protected for 20 years.  This was seen to be inconsistent with a 
specific treaty signed under the WTO, the agreement on 
trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Arbitration followed, with the Americans calling for binding 
arbitration.  I hope the government House leader is listening, 
because I read the entire defence produced by the Government of 
Canada.  There was doubt as to Canada's ability to produce its 
legislation within a year, because it said it was not sure of 
having a parliamentary majority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That made me laugh. 
I told myself “We are now giving the opposition a power that it 
is usually not entitled to in other circumstances”. Anyway, the 
binding arbitration requested and obtained by the United States 
forces Canada to change the Canadian legislation by next August. 
The government has no other choice but to change the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member for Lac-Saint-Jean said, that is when 
globalization is impacting on us as parliamentarians. We have not 
freely decided to change the legislation, quite the opposite. 
When Canada set up the five year revision of the Patent Act in 
the industry committee, it had not chosen to make such a change. 
We have to recognize that globalization curtails parliamentary 
sovereignty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are of course settlement mechanisms. In this case we lost, 
but in others we win, and I accept that. I am not questioning the 
free trade agreement. That is not the point at all, but we have to 
understand the reality. The member for Lac-Saint-Jean raised the 
issue of MPs' privileges in the context of globalization. I am 
sure that when he addresses the issue in the future, he will give 
the example of the Patent Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand fully the whole issue of the research on brand name 
drugs as far as Quebec is concerned. There are two main types of 
research being conducted on drugs. There is research on brand 
name drugs. It involves cycles of up to five or ten years. The 
researchers working on brand name drugs were telling us that for 
each drug produced, marketed and authorized by Health Canada, the 
research cycle can cost up to $170 million. 
Quebec excels in the area of brand name drugs. It is one of its 
industrial clusters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another facet of this reality, if I can call it that, is the 
research on generic drugs, that part of research which takes the 
molecule once it exists and copies it according to very specific 
rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that in the coming years we as parliamentarians will 
have a debate on the cost of drugs. I support wholeheartedly the 
principle of a research infrastructure for brand name drugs.  I 
understand that when one invests $170 or $200 million, one 
expects a return on that investment; it is normal.  However, I 
hope that we will also take the consumer into account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the future, it will not suffice to ask ourselves as 
parliamentarians if we have an adequate research infrastructure. 
Whether or not the research infrastructure is adequate, if the 
drugs are not available to the consumers, we ought to be 
concerned and raise the questions.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning, I met with representatives of the generic drug 
industry. People know how I am. When people ask for a meeting, I 
always say yes.  That is the way I am.  I think parliamentarians 
should make themselves available.  Therefore this morning I had 
the pleasure of meeting representatives of the generic drugs 
industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I told them “This is not the right time to raise this issue. I 
believe that there must be a debate on the cost of drugs and that 
we must ask ourselves if we did not go too far in the protection 
provided to patent drugs. What should we do about generic drugs, 
notably with respect to the rules of procedural equity?” In this 
regard, the supreme court has handed down some rulings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, the Bloc Quebecois agrees with the need to set up a 
strong research infrastructure and to make patent drugs one of 
Quebec's major industrial clusters. Our position on this remains 
unchanged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in the next few years we will also have to think about 
access to drugs. When I met the representatives of the generic 
drug industry, I told them “You would be making a serious 
strategic mistake if you raised the issue of the regulatory 
framework authorizing a notice of compliance”. That is not the 
way to go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With a notice of compliance, as we know, when an industry makes 
the slightest allegation of patent infringement, we can interrupt 
the process for 24 months, during which the generic drug industry 
cannot sell the drug. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the issue here is a WTO ruling. In other words, even if 
there were not, in Canada, a debate between generic drugs and 
patent drugs, Bill S-17 would still be before us, because the WTO 
has handed down a ruling. 
This is binding arbitration, and in fact Canada has until August 
2001 to raise these issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As parliamentarians, we have missed an opportunity to raise an 
important issue. When the national forum on health tabled its 
report in 1997, it was already recommending dealing with the 
issue of access to drugs. As we speak, six provinces have created 
working groups on the reorganization of the health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, wherever we are—the NDP whip knows this—all the 
provinces are debating the reorganization of health care. This is 
understandable. This is the first time in the history of mankind 
that we are no longer talking about the old but the very old. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take the hon. member for Jonquière as an example. She 
does not smoke, she does not drink, she takes care of her health. 
If everything goes well in her life, if she does not have too 
much stress because of her colleagues, she has an excellent 
chance of living until the age of 100. This is the reality. 
Today, it is not uncommon in our communities for people to live 
to be quite old, and women live longer than men. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do women live longer than men? Because women are more in 
touch with their emotions. Women are more balanced when it comes 
to life and life's great values. Mr. Speaker, women will live 
longer than men, and I know you will personally be glad for this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have missed an opportunity that we will have to create in 
the next years, to deal with access to drugs. 
What services or range of services do we want to provide to our 
fellow citizens? How will we organize our health system? I 
sometimes have the opportunity to meet with medical association 
representatives and hospital directors, and I wonder if we are 
all aware of which budget item uses up most of the hospitals' 
resources. It is drugs. This is understandable. People live 
longer, but they also live longer with disabilities. People 
can be on medication for longer periods of time than ever before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of this, a question arises: do we want to stay with the 
same process of covered drug lists that we have at present, which 
are such a drain on government budgets, particularly provincial 
governments? After all, they are the ones who have to reimburse 
drug costs.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give members some statistics to think about. Out of 72 
new drugs approved by the Quebec government last year, more than 
50 were brand name drugs. By comparison, I think Ontario 
authorized some 40 new drugs. The number is approximate and 
just gives an idea of what is involved. Only ten were brand 
name drugs. Ontario, our next door neighbour, for the same 
available drugs, chose to approve fewer brand name drugs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, this raises questions. Again, the research 
infrastructure is important. 
Why would a pharmaceutical company do research at a cost of maybe 
$175 million if it is copied by a competitor? Conversely, if 
brand name drugs are so costly that whole segments of the 
population cannot afford them, there is also a problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see the balance that is needed and the debate that is coming. 
However, Bill S-17 is not what should trigger the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the Standing Committee on Health, we are currently examining 
the whole issue of human artificial reproduction technologies. 
Once this debate is over in January 2002, however, I myself may 
table a motion on the whole issue of access to drugs. I think 
this issue is extremely important for us, as parliamentarians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be tempted to stop here to let my colleagues debate the 
issue, but let me say once again that this bill points to the 
significant dilemma whereby the sovereignty of national states is 
eroded. It is the dilemma that arises when an organization, a 
multinational forum, has handed down a ruling that impacts on our 
capacity as parliamentarians to make decisions. In the end, this 
dilemma obviously impacts on the industry and then on consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-17, as such, will not fundamentally change anything for 
the industry. 
I will give a few statistics the Minister of Industry has so 
kindly made available, knowing that hon. members are just dying 
to have such information.  To give us some idea of the situation, 
as of January 2001, the number of patents issued under the old 
act was 138,000.  Of that total, some 53,500 were protected for 
less than 20 years.   Another 85,300 had 20 year protection under 
the latest provisions of the legislation we passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the people at Health Canada, the World Trade 
Organization ruling will not have any lasting effects on drug 
costs.  The impact of the ruling over the next eight 
years—understanding that patents without the 20 year protection 
will end in 2009—will be minimal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to departmental officials, this will be the equivalent 
in quantitative terms of less than 1% of one year's drug sales. 
There is not, therefore, any risk and we must keep telling the 
public they will continue to have access to affordable drugs 
according to the letter of Bill S-17. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like my colleagues to know that one of the things that 
makes our drug licensing system original is the fact that we have 
created a regulatory body called the Patented Medicine Prices 
Review Board.  Since the Progressive Conservatives brought in the 
Patent Act, this regulatory body has been in place to monitor the 
pricing structure of drugs.

<A HREF="#LINKT24"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A series of criteria is taken into account, and there is a 
series of drugs, drug A, B or C.  There is a controversy.  Some, 
like the Patented Medicine Prices Review Board, in its eighth 
report released in 1995, contend that, of the new drugs 
introduced onto the market, only 2.7% really have any new 
therapeutic value. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That said, the average cost of drugs must still be kept in mind. 
Drugs are too expensive—we agree on this—and we must put the 
consumer at the heart of our concerns. Yet when we compare 
ourselves with the United States, and that is what the Patented 
Medicine Prices Review Board found, the cost of patented 
medicines in Canada is, on average, 40% lower than in the United 
States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A formula of the Patented Medicine Prices Review Board has given 
us an advantage we may rightly be proud of.  Despite the fact 
that a debate needs to be held on access to drugs, still with the 
consumer at the heart of our concerns, when we compare ourselves 
with a country like the United States—the comparison is 
relevant, because we are North Americans and there are a number of 
subsidiaries in Canada, whose head offices are of course in the 
United states—the cost of drugs is 40% lower here than it is in 
the U.S. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would stop there, hoping that the debate is held and that we 
may always keep the best interest of consumers in mind and the 
need for Quebec, whose economic dynamism is a matter of record, 
to hold on to what it has done for a research infrastructure in 
connection with brand name drugs.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CANADA BUSINESS CORPORATIONS ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK48">&nbsp;</A>
<P><A NAME="LINK49"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Elinor Caplan (for the Minister of Industry)</B> moved 
that Bill S-11, an act to amend the Canada Business Corporations 
Act and the Canada Cooperatives Act and to amend other acts, be 
read the second time and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK50"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cannis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased today to have 
this opportunity to begin second reading debate on Bill S-11, the 
Canada Business Corporations Act and the Canada Cooperatives Act, 
and to say a few words about this piece of legislation.  I am 
sure all members of the House will agree this is a fundamental 
issue to the continued success of Canadian federally incorporated 
companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments and improvements found in Bill S-11 would further 
the ability of businesses, investors, shareholders and 
co-operative members to be in a position to respond quickly and 
creatively to rapid developments in the global marketplace.  They 
would be better positioned, if parliament provided them with the 
legal rules of the game that are sound, fair, efficient, 
consistent and, just as important, flexible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each Canadian business, no matter how small, should be given the 
right legal tools and legal framework to fully develop its 
marketplace opportunities.  Bill S-11 intends to provide for 
federally incorporated businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a ranking of just the top 500 companies in Canada, federally 
incorporated companies account for revenues in excess of half a 
trillion dollars.  The stakes, as we can see, are high, high for 
these companies and indeed high for our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that hon. members be aware of the lengths to 
which the government has gone over the past seven years to make 
sure that Bill S-11 is the result of the widest possible 
consultation and scrutiny.  As a result of this, we have before 
us legislation that will meet the current and evolving needs of 
business for many years to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me point out that in 1994 Industry Canada held initial 
consultations on corporate law reform and subsequently issued 
nine discussion papers.  This was followed by cross country 
consultations to discuss the policy recommendations contained in 
those discussion papers.  At the same time, the Senate banking, 
trade and commerce committee held its own 
hearings in cities right across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-11 was originally introduced in the other place as Bill 
S-19.  During the last parliament its banking, trade and commerce 
committee heard from numerous witnesses.  When the bill was 
reintroduced as Bill S-11, the committee held further meetings 
and heard from additional witnesses.  More recently in its 
studies of Bill S-19 and Bill S-11, the Senate committee held two 
rounds of hearings as well, one in the year 2000 and one this 
year.  The testimony of the expert witnesses resulted in a number 
of amendments that have significantly improved the legislation. 
The Senate study stage was taken into account and, based on this, 
a number of amendments to the original draft legislation were 
adopted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to take this opportunity right now to thank all the 
interveners who have assisted the government over the years and 
the members of the committee, particularly Senator Kirby, who was 
the former chair of the committee and Senator Kolber, the current 
chair of the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada Business Corporations Act is the principal federal 
corporate law in Canada.  It and the Canada Cooperatives Act are 
framework laws that establish basic rules for corporate 
governance, setting out the rights and obligations of directors, 
officers, shareholders and co-operative members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These acts are not overly regulatory.  They allow business 
corporations and co-operatives the flexibility to organize their 
affairs within a sound legislative structure.  They establish the 
recourse available to parties in the event of unlawful conduct. 
They are also self-enforcing, since disputes are largely settled 
through civil action rather than through regulatory enforcement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this point I would also like to emphasize that although most 
of my remarks today will refer specifically to the CBCA, many of 
the provisions in the bill would also apply to the Canada 
Cooperatives Act, which governs federally incorporated 
co-operatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members may recall that a new Canada Cooperatives Act was 
passed by parliament in 1998 and came into force on December 31, 
1999.  The bill would ensure that modifications to the CBCA, 
where they were equally valid for co-operatives, would be 
reflected in the Canada Cooperatives Act. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1210"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT26"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada Business Corporations Act, which is the main focus of 
Bill S-11, has not been amended for the last 26 years.  The 
amendments in Bill S-11 would update and modernize four core 
elements of the existing legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the bill would expand the rights of shareholders to 
communicate with one another and would encourage more shareholder 
participation in corporate decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the bill would help eliminate barriers to 
competitiveness, so that Canadian corporations could become more 
effective global players.  At the same time, it would help to 
attract international companies to establish a base in Canada for 
their international operations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, Bill S-11 would more reasonably define corporate 
responsibilities for the liabilities of directors, officers and 
shareholders.  This would promote fairness and reasonable risk 
taking, which is a necessity for growth and productivity in the 
global economic environment that we have today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the bill would eliminate duplication of regulation. We 
have reason to be proud of the Canada Business Corporations Act. 
It is not just that it serves the country well.  Canada is 
already recognized by countries around the world as having a 
leading edge corporate statute, one that links prosperity with 
sound, balanced rules for corporate governance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also helps set standards of legal, predictable, fair and 
accountable business practices in other countries that have come 
here for advice on setting up their own corporate governance 
frameworks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada Business Corporations Act is very sound legislation 
that has provided the legal framework for conducting business 
over the last quarter century.  The reforms to the existing act 
would modernize and strengthen this legal framework. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opportunities out there are great for our country.  However 
one thing we have to do is equip our fellow Canadians with the 
ground rules that only government can provide.  The Canadian 
entrepreneurs will provide the tools, the savvy and the 
entrepreneurial spirit and skills to reach out for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my closing remarks, the provisions in the bill are once again 
representative of the fulfilment of many commitments we have made 
in our red book.  They go beyond the pledges of the red book, in 
the economic statement last fall and in the Speech from the 
Throne.  In each of these government initiatives a commitment was 
made to foster innovation and enhance the competitive advantages 
of Canadian enterprises. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge all the members of the House to give speedy assent and 
passage to this most important piece of legislation, this 
marketplace framework legislation which, as I said earlier 
in my remarks, will help position Canadian companies to compete 
strongly internationally. 
<P><A NAME="LINK51"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. James Rajotte (Edmonton Southwest, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, at the beginning of my speech, I ask the House for 
unanimous consent to split my time with the hon. member for 
Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  In this case of the Canadian 
Alliance, the official opposition, it would have 40 minutes.  Is 
there unanimous consent that the 40 minutes will be split into 
two blocks of 20 minutes evenly, give or take, but that it would 
be a maximum of 40 minutes? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. James Rajotte:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I love it when the House 
gives unanimous consent.  It gives me a warm feeling inside. I 
rise today to speak on Bill S-11, an act to amend the Canada 
Business Corporations Act and the Canada Cooperatives Act.  This 
is the first time since 1975 that the Canada Business 
Corporations Act, otherwise known as CBCA, has been amended. Many 
of these changes are long overdue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-11 also contains amendments to the Canada Cooperatives 
Act.  It continues the reform process that recently led to a new 
statute governing co-operatives, which came into force on 
December 31, 1999. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1215"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT28"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT28"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1215

<A HREF="#LINKT27"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that time, however, some issues required further consultation 
and are now addressed in Bill S-11.  For the most part the 
changes to the CCA closely follow the amendments to the CBCA and 
harmonize the rules governing co-operatives with key elements of 
corporate law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CBCA is the main federal law governing corporations in 
Canada, including large, medium and small enterprises.  This act 
sets out the legal and regulatory framework for more than 155,000 
federally incorporated businesses.  In Canada corporations have 
the option of incorporating at the federal or the provincial 
level.  Almost half of the largest companies in Canada are 
incorporated under the CBCA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The previous act to amend the CBCA was tabled in the Senate 
during the last session of parliament and was known as Bill S-19. 
The bill was before the Senate committee on banking, trade and 
commerce when it died on the order paper due to the federal 
election.  Nonetheless, the members of the Senate committee heard 
from 35 witnesses between April and the end of June 2000 and they 
should be commended for their work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-11 is substantially the same as Bill S-19 but 
incorporates recommendations suggested by stakeholders such as 
the Canadian Bar Association, the coalition for CBCA reform, the 
Canadian Co-operative Association and the task force of the 
churches on corporate responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments seek to modernize the Canada Business 
Corporations Act in four areas by:  first, recognizing the global 
nature of the marketplace; second, clarifying the responsibility 
of corporate directors and officers; third, reducing 
federal-provincial duplication; and fourth, expanding shareholder 
rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an immense understatement to say that business has changed 
fundamentally since the mid-1970s and it is high time that the 
Canada Business Corporations Act reflected the transformation to 
the global economy.  We support these changes in principle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CBCA currently requires that a majority of directors on a 
federally incorporated board and on each committee be resident 
Canadians.  Canada is the only G-7 country that imposes such 
antiquated residency requirements on its businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-11 would reduce the residency requirement to 25% for 
boards and entirely eliminate the requirement for board 
committees.  This change is long overdue and should help Canadian 
companies compete as global players.  However, I must say it is 
characteristic of the Liberal government that sacred cow sectors 
such as book publishing, telecommunications, transportation and 
Petro-Canada would be exempt from this reduction.  We question 
the rationale as to why these businesses are not permitted to 
enjoy the flexibility to appoint directors based on their 
qualifications and not on where they live. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another welcome change is the amendment that would allow foreign 
subsidiaries of Canadian corporations to acquire shares in their 
parent corporations under limited and clearly defined 
circumstances.  This is mainly for the purpose of acquiring or 
merging with foreign corporations.  These amendments will allow 
Canadian federally incorporated companies to compete with foreign 
multinationals while expanding globally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With an eye to allowing directors to take appropriate risks in 
their decision making, Bill S-11 would replace the good faith 
reliance defence for directors with a due diligence one and would 
allow corporations to pay for defence investigation costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To clarify responsibilities of corporate officers and directors, 
Bill S-11 replaces the current joint and several liability regime 
with one of modified proportionate liability.  This change would 
mean that every defendant found responsible for a financial loss 
stemming from an error, omission or misstatement in financial 
information would be liable only for the portion of the damages 
that corresponds with his or her degree of responsibility. 
However, joint and several liability would continue to apply in 
cases of fraud and to designated categories of plaintiffs such as 
the crown, charitable organizations, unsecured creditors and 
small investors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-11 also clarifies that when the directors' powers are 
transferred to shareholders under a unanimous shareholders' 
agreement, the associated liability and defences are also 
transferred to shareholders.  New shareholders who are not 
informed that a unanimous shareholders' agreement was in place at 
the time of their acquisition would be allowed to cancel the 
transaction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-11 seeks to end costly time consuming administrative and 
legal burdens on federally incorporated businesses by limiting 
conflicts between federal and provincial statutes and 
regulations.  Amendments would also modernize the wording of the 
legislation to bring the CBCA up to date with technological and 
other developments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to insider trading, Bill S-11 would repeal the 
federal duplication of provincial insider filing requirements, 
impose civil liability on persons who disclose insider 
information, even if those persons did not participate in the 
transaction, and increase the maximum fine from the current 
$5,000 to $1 million.

<A HREF="#LINKT28"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-11 would repeal the CBCA provisions for takeover bids and 
would allow the comprehensive codes for the takeover bid 
regulations under provincial securities laws to prevail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provisions restricting financial assistance to directors, 
officers, employees and shareholders would be eliminated because 
they have proven to be difficult to apply in practice.  Since 
directors approving financial assistance transactions are already 
required to act in the best interests of the corporation, they 
can be sued for failing to do so.  This is safeguard enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-11 would allow for greater participation by small 
shareholders in corporate decision making.  It would do so by 
relaxing the rules under which shareholders communicate among 
themselves and allowing proxy solicitation to be done through 
public broadcast or newspaper advertisement instead of by direct 
mailings.  The amendments would encourage corporations to employ 
new technologies such as e-mail when communicating with 
shareholders and when conducting shareholder meetings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation would also liberalize mechanisms for individual 
shareholders to submit proposals as well as set minimum share 
ownership and length of ownership thresholds required to submit a 
proposal.  The bill also aims to restrain management's ability to 
block or refuse proposals from being considered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-11 reflects the transformation of business since 1975 
with respect to the global marketplace, the electronic revolution 
and the rise of shareholder rights, as well as the necessity of 
reducing federal-provincial regulatory redundancies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance therefore supports in principle this 
legislation.  However we will be consulting with interested 
parties to ensure that the changes in the bill are indeed 
beneficial to Canadian business. 
<P><A NAME="LINK52"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the House for its tolerance 
in allowing me to share the time with my colleague.  Bill S-11, 
an act to amend the Canada Business Corporations Act and the 
Canada Cooperatives Act and to amend other acts, is a good bill. 
It is a bill that we support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my friend and colleague just mentioned, the CBCA has not been 
amended since 1975.  After consultation the government put 
together a plan that will amend it in this bill.  The CBCA is the 
main federal law that governs corporations in Canada, including 
large and small to medium sized businesses.  In fact it governs 
more than 155,000 businesses in total. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I wonder why the government has not taken it upon 
itself to be more innovative and aggressive in trying to improve 
the business climate in our country.  We have heard over the past 
week and a half that productivity in Canada has been declining 
for years.  That hits every single person in our country.  Our 
nation and the people in it are reliant on an environment in 
which businesses can thrive in an effort to improve the health 
and welfare of all Canadians and so we can also have jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our globalized economy we are laggards.  We are falling 
further behind.  Why do we accept the fact that countries such as 
New Zealand, Singapore, the United States, the United Kingdom and 
Ireland have grown, prospered and thrived and have been more 
productive than Canada?  Canada is a nation and a country that 
has overwhelming resources and a good workforce, a competent and 
intelligent workforce, people who are willing to put their backs 
into the country.  As well, relatively speaking we have an 
enormous amount of wealth in and above ground.  Yet despite these 
natural assets we are falling further behind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do we accept the fact that our dollar has plummeted from the 
70 cent range to 65 cents today?  I believe it was at 73 cents 
when the government took over in 1993.  There is no end in sight 
as analysts view our dollar as continuing to slide.  Some make 
the glib comment that this is okay because it strengthens our 
ability to sell products abroad. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1225"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is true, but what does it do for those companies that are 
reliant and dependent on the ability to import products?  How can 
they function properly and make their products?  What does it do 
for Canadians who travel abroad?  It severely hamstrings them, 
reduces their productivity and reduces their competitiveness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to create a nimble, aggressive economy in Canada.  The 
government's responsibility is to enable Canadian companies to do 
that.  Its responsibility is to provide a climate of ingenuity 
where Canadian companies can prosper, where they can compete with 
and beat other countries from around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need strong fiscal and monetary policy.  Why do we not have a 
debt reduction strategy?  Why do we accept that our national 
debt sits at $560 billion?  Perhaps the public watching today 
would be very interested to know that the debt we are all saddled 
with exceeds $1 trillion when we take in the debts accrued by the 
provinces and crown corporations.  That is $1 trillion that we 
owe as a nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why has the government not taken it upon itself to flatten the 
tax system?  Our complex and onerous tax system makes it very 
difficult for most people to even do their own taxes.  They have 
to get a professional to do them.  Why do we not simplify the tax 
system? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the years my colleagues in the Alliance have repeatedly put 
forth suggestions to flatten the tax system, to simplify the tax 
system and to lower the tax structure so that individual 
Canadians and businesses can have more money in their pockets. 
Why does the government not have the same zeal for this as it has 
for Bill S-11?  Why does it not apply that zeal to improving the 
structural aspects of our economy?  Why does the government not 
drop the GST to 5%?  Why not make it comprehensive and have 
single, one year reporting?  Why have a system where private 
companies must hire people to do their GST returns?  It adds 
costs to the ability of those firms to function properly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do we not reduce payroll taxes, which in effect put just 
another cost on top of the costs to do business and the costs to 
Canadian consumers?  Why do we not reduce personal taxes?  When 
personal and business taxes are reduced, what happens?  The 
economy improves, unemployment rates go down and, interestingly 
enough, moneys coming into the public coffers increase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to draw to the attention of the House the tale of two 
provinces.  I will compare my province of British Columbia to the 
province of Ontario.  The NDP has ruled in my province for the 
last eight years or so.  Thankfully its life will soon be 
shortened.  With the upcoming election on May 16 there will be a 
new provincial government in my province, which I am sure will do 
a much better job than the NDP has done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the objective statistics in a province that has 
had high taxes, crushing rules and regulations and an environment 
that basically told the private sector to go somewhere else 
because it was not welcome in that province.  Real per capita GDP 
when the NDP was elected in my province was $367 greater than the 
national average.  After eight years of NDP rule, with its high 
taxes, complex rules and regulations and choking union rules, the 
actual decade ended with the real per capita GDP $3,471 lower, 
while the rest of the country, in particular Ontario and Alberta, 
experienced tremendous growth in real per capita GDP, 16.7% and 
26% respectively.  In regard to disposable income, which really 
hits the individual consumer, when the NDP came into power the 
real per capita disposable income was $743 greater than the 
national average.  Now it is $768 below the national average.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has plummeted nearly $1,500 during the period of high taxes, 
complex rules and regulations, and an oppressive environment for 
the private sector.  That is what has happened to the money in 
the pockets of citizens in my province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Conservative Party in Ontario on the other hand took over 
from the regime of Bob Rae the mess of high taxes, complex rules 
and regulations, and an oppressive environment in the private 
sector.  Since that time, with the lowering of taxes and the 
removal of rules and regulations, 822,000 jobs were created; tax 
revenues were up $15 billion; and Ontario's economy is expected 
to grow 2.3% this year and 3.6% next year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Interestingly the left wing tries to lambaste the so-called 
heartless PCs in Ontario, but the fact is that 622,000 people in 
the lowest socioeconomic group are not paying taxes now.  The 
same number of people in British Columbia find life more 
difficult.  They have less chance of being employed and a greater 
chance of being on welfare.  The amount of moneys and 
opportunities accessible to them are less.  Is that fair?  Is 
that a good environment to be in? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everybody in the House, including the NDP, must see that having 
high taxes and complex rules and regulations chokes off the 
private sector.  It harms people who are on welfare but who want 
to work.  It harms the people who are underemployed as well as 
those who have talents and skills and want to use them to help 
their families and be able to contribute to society.  These are 
the people who are hurt by left wing, socialist economic policies 
that have choked the life out of the province of British Columbia 
and out of Ontario prior to the PCs getting in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although education is a provincial responsibility, why does the 
federal government not work with the provinces to develop 
national standards?  With people being forced to move, and 
sometimes quite rapidly, why do their children not have the same 
educational opportunities in all provinces?  If national 
standards were established children could be slotted in and have 
similar educational opportunities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have to expand and improve educational opportunities. 
Why not look at private-public partnerships?  Germany has taken 
it upon itself to have a very innovative private-public 
partnership.  People are given apprenticeships in high school. It 
has enabled people in high school and in university to develop 
experience and skills that will benefit them and enable them to 
be employable in high paying jobs.  That is innovation.  I urge 
the federal government to sit down with its provincial 
counterparts to accomplish that goal.  They could have a very 
useful and innovative meeting which would benefit all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government also needs to tackle the issue of loans.  At the 
present time access to post-secondary education is becoming the 
purview of the rich.  I would not be able to go to medical school 
today.  Statistics demonstrate that at the University of Western 
Ontario the average family income has increased dramatically to 
$80,000.  Very few Canadian families make $80,000 a year.  That 
means that children of people making less money have far less 
opportunity to gain access to professional faculties.  Canadians 
do not want that.  They want to ensure equal opportunities based 
on skill level, not based on the amount of money in their 
pockets.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should also look at ways to decrease red tape.  Red tape 
chokes the living daylights out of the private sector.  It is 
easier for people to trade between Athens, Greece and London, 
England than it is to trade between Halifax and Victoria. Members 
should think about that.  That is absolutely absurd.  Why is it 
easier for a business person in Europe to have trade facilitated 
between two cities in Europe, which are separated by a 
considerable amount of space, than it is within our own country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has attempted in the past, and I do not know why 
it has failed, to bring down trade barriers.  It has simply 
nibbled around the edges.  The barriers to trade in our country 
are a very real problem.  It is very difficult to export the very 
fine wines that are made in my province of British Columbia to 
the rest of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it so difficult?  Why do we have so many barriers for 
individual producers and business people engaged in trade and 
commerce within our own borders?  We certainly pursue free 
trade with vigour.  Why does the government not pursue the 
elimination of internal barriers to trade with as much zeal? That 
is something the government should bring forth in this term. I 
know it would find a great deal of support and constructive input 
if it were to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues have raised the issue of transportation and the 
fact that our transportation arteries are falling apart.  With 
the benefit of our surplus a good investment would be for the 
government to invest wisely in those structures which the private 
sector cannot invest in.  An investment in improving 
transportation arteries within the country would be a wise 
investment that would help commerce within our borders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Good environmental policies are also required.  We do not have 
them.  There are many good environmental policies, though, that 
are not followed by the government.  Time after time the 
environment commissioner puts forth good, constructive solutions 
and points the government in a direction that would improve our 
environment.  There are many good scientists and people with very 
good ideas on how we can improve the environmental behaviour of 
businesses.  I encourage the government to use some of those 
ideas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government needs to look at how our businesses operate 
abroad.  I encourage people to look at how the Export Development 
Corporation, using taxpayer dollars, is funding companies that 
are pillaging other countries through mining processes.  They are 
dumping tailings and poisoning rivers or engaging in the 
rapacious destruction of hardwood forests in places like Papua 
New Guinea, Borneo and Central America. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are we tolerating environmental destruction abroad when we 
would never tolerate it in Canada?  What is worse is that we are 
using Canadian taxpayer money to fund corporations and companies 
to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian public would be appalled.  I have been to the 
island of Borneo and have seen pristine jungles being decimated 
for palm oil plantation.  I have driven for dozens and dozens of 
kilometres through what was formerly jungle to get to the 
interface between jungle and palm oil plantation.  We have 
recently discovered that a lot of large primates such as 
orangutans are being decimated as a result of this destruction 
and that Canadian companies supported by the government are 
funding this behaviour.  That is absolutely appalling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage the government to look at our aging population with 
as much zeal as it is looking at Bill S-11, which would be very 
beneficial.  The population is aging.  As a result, the relative 
numbers of people working compared to those retiring will produce 
a grave imbalance.  No one is looking at that.  This will have an 
impact on our workforce, tax structure, government revenues, 
social programs and health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that we have a pension system.  The public would be 
interested to know that our pension system, the CPP, is 
unsustainable.  When it was put together the CPP architects knew 
very clearly that decades from now it would collapse under its 
own weight.  There would be demands placed on it that could not 
be met by the number of people in the workforce. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1240"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT32"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the government not look at something innovative such as 
increasing the minimum age of retirement to age 70.  This would 
enable people to have a somewhat graded ability to access CPP. It 
would also encourage them to be in the workforce, earn money, pay 
taxes, be productive and be less of a drain on a CPP that would 
otherwise collapse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government had to raise CPP premiums quite significantly 
through a payroll tax.  We see the imbalance in what is 
happening.  We have an aging population and an unsustainable CPP, 
which forced the government to raise payroll taxes, depressed 
productivity, put people out of work, and reduced government 
revenues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government were to look at what happened in Ontario where 
taxes were lowered, it would see that revenues went up by $15 
billion.  Wherever taxes were lowered, whether in New Zealand, 
Singapore or Europe, economies thrived and more money, not less, 
went into the public coffers.  This is not elemental; it is a 
fact of life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of immigration as it relates to the workforce 
situation, we have a workforce crisis that will be exacerbated. 
We need to take a critical look at our immigration policy.  We 
need to encourage and expand the number of independent immigrants 
coming into the country as well as review the people who are on 
the list and the skills required in our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is Nursing Week in Canada.  We have a crisis in nursing. We 
will have a shortage of 112,000 nurses in the next 10 years as 
our population ages and the demands on our health care system 
increase.  Nursing is not a required profession on the list of 
professions that we are seeking.  It is unimaginable that it is 
not.  We need nurses.  That is just one of a number of 
professions that we need which are not on the list of professions 
required.  I strongly encourage the Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration to look at the list, revamp it and make it reflective 
of the needs of the economy and industry today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to deal with the issue of right to work 
legislation.  It is a very contentious issue in the House and it 
should not be.  We need to look at the impact of right to work 
legislation, at the international experience.  Right to work 
legislation gives the individual worker the right to be part of a 
union or not.  I strongly encourage the government to work with 
its provincial counterparts to introduce right to work 
legislation. It helps the worker and makes labour laws more 
flexible.  It unleashes and unshackles the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has happened in countries where right to work legislation 
has been in place is extraordinary.  In the United States, in 
those states where they have right to work legislation, the per 
capita income of the worker has improved dramatically.  It has 
gone up about $3,000 per worker.  Unemployment has dropped by 50% 
and productivity is at 157%, whereas in areas where there has not 
been right to work legislation it is hovering around 0%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These extraordinary statistics demonstrate the need for right to 
work legislation in our country today.  If we bring it in workers 
would have a greater chance of being employed and would have more 
money in their pockets.  The provinces would have more money 
coming in.  It would be a much healthier environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage the government not to dismiss this out of hand but 
to look at the facts.  It should look at areas where the right to 
work legislation has been put in place: the U.S., New Zealand, 
Ireland and the United Kingdom.  The facts support the notion 
that right to work legislation improves the health and welfare of 
the worker.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not having right to work legislation harms the most vulnerable 
in our society.  It gives them fewer opportunities to work, less 
money in their pockets and worse working conditions. I would 
encourage the government to work with the provinces on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I would encourage the government to look at having 
tax free zones, tax free zones that have worked in Subick Bay in 
the Philippines; in Raleigh, South Carolina; and in areas of 
Ireland.  If we had employer centres in Canada that were tax free 
havens, they would be a major attraction for investment, 
employment would go up and they would be magnets for innovation 
and research and development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my speech I, as have many of my colleagues, have given the 
government numerous innovative solutions.  We support Bill S-11 
but I would encourage the government to look at other more 
complex issues it can actually tackle, issues that must be 
addressed today if Canada is to become a nimble, aggressive 
player on the world stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The failure of the government to address issues on taxes, 
education, trade, barriers to trade, rules and regulations and 
others, will result in a country that is punching far below the 
belt.  We do not need to do that.  We can do better. I plead with 
the government to follow our advice.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean—Saguenay, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will put my remarks in a context of globalization and 
then speak about the data pertaining to this bill, one element in 
particular that has a personal interest for me, that is, clause 
137. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliamentarians and society in general are speaking more and 
more about the social impacts of globalization. I applaud this, 
because for many years now I have been hoping we would give more 
thought to making globalization more human and to finding 
possible solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the results of increased interaction among states is 
that trade is increasing, which means that competition 
among corporations is also increasing. We have to remember that 
corporations are profit oriented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to remember what kind of impact increasing 
competition among corporations can have. In the past, a 
corporation competed on local markets, with other Canadian 
corporations. Nowadays, competition involves other countries. 
Very often, the best companies in the world are competing against 
one another. We see that this whole process does have an impact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see in the media, in the newspapers, how corporate 
reactions are irrational. I would even go so far as to say that 
corporations overreact, that they lose track of what they are 
doing. 
Given this increased competition, companies must act recklessly, 
which is not the word that I want to use but the one that comes 
to mind, and understandably so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the context of competition, having the best minds is a 
critical advantage. In some areas, including in the new economy, 
as it is called, one must have the brightest minds. A company 
like Nortel or Microsoft will have a definite competitive edge if 
it attracts the brightest minds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other companies in other sectors will lower their production 
costs to make profits. It is interesting to look at the elements 
that have an impact on production costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first one is labour. If a company has more employees than 
its competitor, it will tend to lay off some of these employees, 
to streamline operations so as to be more competitive. This has a 
huge impact on the workers who find themselves out of work. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1250"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT35"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT35"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1250

<A HREF="#LINKT34"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A competitive environment may also make companies exert pressure 
to prevent salaries from increasing too much, if not to lower 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A solution for a company that is based in North America is to 
build a plant in South America, or in countries where labour is 
cheap. While the minimum wage in Canada is around $7 per hour, in 
some countries that same $7 is the salary for one week or one day 
of work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the measures taken by businesses in this competitive 
environment is to reduce production costs and, by the same token, 
labour costs. Such a decision has an impact on society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The environment and natural resources make up the other element 
I want to mention. In order to increase their profits, some 
companies may overexploit natural resources or have a tendency 
to not respect environmental protection rules. If they do not 
respect these rules, they may also be tempted to move part of 
their production to countries where these rules are not as 
strict. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I often give the example of a cheese producer in my riding who 
recently told me that he had had to spend several hundreds of 
thousands of dollars because he could no longer dump production 
residues into the river behind his factory.  Protecting the 
environment costs money.  However, I think that this is entirely 
reasonable, because we must meet the goal of protecting the 
environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another advantage of competition is that certain companies will 
try to pay as little tax as possible in order to lower their 
production costs, thus putting pressure on western, and now 
world, governments.  These companies will lobby governments in 
order to pay as little tax as possible, once again to lower 
production costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has repercussions.  I think that one of the major effects 
of global competition is tax competitiveness. In order to attract 
investors, governments must lower their taxes so that companies 
see an advantage in locating in a particular place and, if they 
do not pay high taxes, their production costs will go down and 
they will be more competitive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, this has repercussions, because governments will 
forgo huge amounts of money.  I give the following example:  50 
years ago, 50% of federal government tax revenues came from large 
corporations; today this has dropped to 13%.  It is no surprise 
that citizens have had it up to here with taxes.  The tax burden 
has shifted away from large corporations to individual citizens. 
This is another repercussion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing we have seen recently is corporate mergers. 
If you cannot beat your competitor, swallow it, buy it or sell 
your own assets. Now we are witnessing an unprecedented 
concentration of economic power through corporate mergers, hence 
my concern. I wonder where this will end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it like in Monopoly, where all players begin with the same 
amount of money, then one player buys another and the game stops 
when one of the players has the monopoly? I am not saying that it 
will go that far, but for the time being I am concerned about 
corporations becoming larger than countries and having sales 
assets bigger than the national GNP of some countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My reason 
for explaining these things, the impact of globalization—while 
not being against globalization, of course, except that I have 
some concerns which I am voicing here—is that this bill may 
provide the means to humanize the behaviour of corporations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In facing the challenges that we have to face, we must strive to 
achieve the objective of democratizing globalization. I believe 
we should do it on two levels. We must absolutely undertake to 
democratize the decision processes of globalization, that is, 
international bodies, the role of parliamentarians in 
international agreements and in environmental agreements. This is 
a great challenge, but this is not the subject of today's debate.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Another element is the democratization of capital.  At the 
present time, there is a major change taking place in the role 
big business plays in our economy.  Take the pulp and paper 
companies for instance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past these were often owned by major financiers, rich 
company owners who owned several plants and made sure, year in 
and year out, that their plants remained functional and 
cost effective, thereby maintaining and creating employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, we see that ownership has changed.  Now we are the ones 
owning these major multinational companies, not the major 
financiers. How so?  Through our pension and mutual funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope everyone will be able to enjoy a comfortable retirement 
one day, with enough income to live on.  Today it is the 
investment funds that are financing retirement.  Everyone 
invests, ourselves included.  Those who work for governments and 
those who work in industry see part of their salary withheld for 
a pension fund.  The important thing is what happens to the money 
in the pension funds.  It is given to a portfolio manager 
mandated to invest in businesses, here and elsewhere, whose 
performance will add to the retirement fund so that we can have a 
peaceful retirement at the end of our career, as I said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very worthy objective, but what has to be noted is the 
fact that sometimes managers of pension funds invest in the 
world's most competitive businesses.  Why are they the most 
competitive?  They have what it takes to compete, which I 
mentioned earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people here or watching, or we who are building up a 
pension, may have their money invested perhaps in businesses that 
do not reflect their values, businesses that perhaps do not 
respect the environment or social rights.  This is why pension 
fund owners, like us, must pay attention, so we can say “No this 
is not the way we want our money invested, since this is not in 
keeping with our values”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If all we can see is the objective of financial performance—God 
knows that many people, when they pick up the paper, look 
immediately to see how their stocks or mutual funds are doing, 
and we can naturally hope for yields of 15%, 20%, 30% or even 
40%—we should look to see how these businesses manage to have 
such returns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sometimes, not always, but sometimes, 
the yield may be the result of a highly productive business, 
because they do business with the sweatshops in developing 
countries where children are paid a dollar a day.  This kind of 
yield can also be produced by businesses that do not respect the 
environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, it is absolutely necessary that an awareness, that 
what I call a democratization of capital can emerge, so that we 
can decide where our money will go, even though the return may 
not be as good. If we put too much emphasis on competitiveness, 
plant workers may be laid off. There will be economic and social 
consequences locally, because our pension plan requires a higher 
return than that which the company located next door can give. 
This is not without consequences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For this democratization of capital that we need, there is an 
appropriate tool called shareholding activism. As I said, since 
many of us have pension funds and these funds are invested in 
companies, we are in effect the owners of these companies.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means that we have a say in the direction and the decisions 
of these businesses. Of course we may wish that their sole 
objective is the highest possible return. But if I find out that 
my money is invested in a business that does not reflect my 
values, I must be able to attend the annual shareholders meeting. 
Shareholders must be able to make proposals to change the 
company's focus and tell it “We think that you are headed in the 
wrong direction. This is why we are submitting a proposal of a 
social or environmental nature”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I now come to the subject matter of the bill. 
Before this bill, subsection 135(5) of the Canada Business 
Corporations Act said that a corporation was not required to 
comply with a shareholder proposal if, and I quote: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—it clearly appears that the proposal is submitted by the 
shareholder primarily ... for the purpose of promoting general 
economic, political, racial, religious, social or similar 
causes;— 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>So it is environmental, but the corporation's board of directors 
may reject this proposal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a stakeholder, through my pension fund, the mutual fund, I 
should be able to do this. If a union, for example, decides to 
attend the annual meeting of shareholders to say that the 
business in which it has invested is cutting down too many trees, 
is not respecting the environment, and is not respecting social 
rights, it is the right of this union or of any other shareholder 
to make a proposal to the annual meeting of shareholders calling 
on the board of directors to change the behaviour of this 
company. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take the case of a company which we have heard about 
recently, that of Talisman, which invests in the Sudan.  Many 
people say that the fact that Talisman is in the Sudan encourages 
the civil war.  If Talisman's shareholders go to the 
shareholders' meeting and propose that the company get out of the 
Sudan, because its presence benefits the military government, 
this represents an important tool. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the existing legislation, the board of directors is entitled 
to reject this proposal of a social nature.  The new legislation, 
Bill S-11, does not contain this provision.  This opens the door 
to shareholder activism and means that we, as shareholders, would 
be able to assume our responsibilities and do something about the 
excesses of certain companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see this as a hope for humanizing globalization, for 
humanizing the behaviour of certain companies, but this should 
be done only if there is a greater awareness.  Workers who own 
pension funds and invest in certain companies whose economic 
behaviour is sometimes questionable need to be more aware. 
Otherwise, the amendment in this bill will have been for nought. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why workers must absolutely make conscious choices 
concerning their investments.  This is like fair trade.  A good 
example of this is fair trade coffee.  That coffee was first 
marketed because people thought it was totally wrong to do 
business with coffee companies which took advantage of farmers 
down south. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A fair trade coffee network was established. It ensures that 
producers get their fair share of the profits and that every link 
in the economic chain benefits. Of course, that coffee is a bit 
more expensive, but at least the consumer is making a political 
choice when buying coffee that will not result in coffee 
producers being exploited.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For consumers, the act of buying is a political choice.  Instead 
of buying shoes from Nike, for example, a company that used to 
take advantage of children, making them work for $1 a 
day—although I am not sure whether it still does—if we decide 
not to buy those shoes but rather to buy a different brand from 
a company that abides by the international labour rules we are 
making a political choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is possible, through the choices we make as 
consumers, to humanize globalization.  That is one thing. 
However, if you are alone, as one single consumer, you have very 
little weight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The manager of a retirement fund does not have $50 but rather 
billions of dollars to manage. These billions of dollars will be 
invested in corporations, some of which will meet social 
standards and others not, hence the need to raise awareness among 
workers and retirement fund owners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, this bill is not perfect. Compared to what is going 
on in the United States in terms of shareholders' activism, Canada 
is still living in the stone age. Fortunately, we are heading in 
the right direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why I am talking about the United States? Because, for several 
years now, it has been much easier to make shareholder proposals 
in the States than in Canada. In the U.S., 200 to 300 shareholder 
proposals are made every year in annual shareholder meetings, 
compared to only about 10 here in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although this bill is not perfect, it opens a door. As I was 
saying, in the United States, shareholders have a lot more power. 
The Varity Corp. case is a clear example of the difference in the 
degree of power in terms of the eligibility requirements for 
making shareholder proposals for companies incorporated under 
federal jurisdiction in Canada and for companies incorporated in 
the U.S. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Varity Corp. case deals with a proposal of a social nature 
that the Jesuits presented in Canada at the annual meeting of 
Massey Ferguson shareholders in 1987. The Jesuits wanted Massey 
Ferguson to withdraw from South Africa. They submitted a 
proposal to the corporation, which was able to reject it because 
of its social nature. The Jesuits turned to the Canadian courts, 
which ruled in favour of the corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, Massey Ferguson shares were also traded on the American 
stock exchange. Following a ruling by the SEC, the Security 
Exchange Commission, the company had to accept to circulate the 
proposal to withdraw from South Africa. The possibility of 
circulating that proposal at the annual meeting was rejected in 
Canada, but it was accepted in the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, several other similar proposals were accepted in the 
United States. 
A recent example of a shareholders proposal in Canada is the 
proposal submitted by various large Canadian investors, 
including the FTQ, through its Fonds de solidarité, to the three 
largest retailers in this country, namely Hudson's Bay, Sears 
Canada and Wal-Mart. The proposal calls upon the companies to 
improve their codes of conduct and their monitoring methods to 
ensure that their suppliers meet International Labour 
Organization standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the existing law, the companies may reject that proposal. 
With the new law, it will be more difficult. 
I now want to move on to the improvements that must be made to 
the bill or, at least, about the proposals my colleague from 
Témiscamingue and I will put forward in committee because, as I 
said, although the bill goes in the right direction it may be to 
vague in some regards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, there are too many references to regulations. What I 
want to say is that in the United States there is a special 
tribunal to settle disputes between shareholders and companies, 
the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1310"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT39"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT39"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1310

<A HREF="#LINKT38"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The SEC is an effective mechanism, but the bill does not provide 
for any dispute settlement mechanism. It is said in the bill that 
the minister will see to it later. I think that we have an 
opportunity to make constructive suggestions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Personally, I suggest that we set up a dispute settlement 
mechanism that can be triggered rapidly. For example, the company 
could choose an arbitrator, the shareholder could choose another, 
and a third could be appointed by the minister. Of course, this 
third arbitrator would be impartial. Such a mechanism would not 
be costly, it would be fast and it could set precedents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, the bill says this will be set out in the 
regulations. This will not be included in the bill. The minister 
will be able to decide how the dispute settlement mechanism will 
be set up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My concern is that shareholders might be at a disadvantage with 
a mechanism established by the minister. Of course, I am 
speculating, because I do not know what will happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another point is that the bill does not include the amount of 
shares a shareholder must hold to make a proposal. This would be 
set out in the regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps it will be said that, to make a proposal at the annual 
shareholders' meeting, a shareholder would have to hold $2,000 or 
$500 in shares, or whatever. I would a specific amount included 
in the bill. If it is not included in the bill, it would be set 
out in the regulations and could be changed whenever the minister 
wanted to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My concern is that the minimum amount or percentage of shares 
held by a shareholder could be increased. Thus, the shareholders' 
power to make proposals would become a power only for the rich, 
for those holding many shares in the company. This is a threat 
that we see in the bill, as it now stands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another point is the possibility for a shareholder to come back 
the following year if his proposal has been refused. I suggest 
that if, in the first year, the shareholder's proposal has been 
refused, but he has received at least 3% of the vote of 
shareholders, he could come back the following year to make his 
proposal once again. The following year, if he has received 6%, 
he could come back the next year; the third year, if he has 
received 9%, he could come back the year after that, and so on. 
At least he could promote his cause within the company. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some might say that this is some sort of political interference 
in companies. 
This is not political interference, but just shareholders taking 
their responsibilities. This would be excellent for companies, I 
believe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It could make companies more responsible. It could bring about 
sustainable development, as we say in 
Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean, development that respects social and 
environmental rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A company, whose name escapes me, made an investment in the 
Philippines, and shareholders suggested that it should get out of 
this investment because of the catastrophic environmental impact 
mining could have on people. The company kept mining there, and 
the environmental impact was indeed serious. The company incurred 
heavy losses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the tone of my remarks is admittedly social, I must 
recognize that this empowerment of shareholders can also have a 
positive impact on companies in the long term. Companies should 
have a long term vision of their business. Like the governments, 
they must respect the environment and social standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another positive element for companies and even for 
Canada. If the president of an U.S. union that has a pension fund 
wants to invest in a business headquartered in Canada but cannot 
issue shareholder proposals, he could very well say “I will not 
invest in Canada, because my rights as an investor and 
shareholder are infringed upon”.

<A HREF="#LINKT39"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It can limit investment in Canada. If the bill is amended 
properly and allows for a healthy dose of shareholder activism, I 
think it would be good for investment in Canada because, as I was 
saying, the rights of shareholders would be respected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recognize that this is not simple, but it gives me hope. I 
only talked about section 137 of the bill. There is a lot more in 
this bill, which is quite voluminous and on which bureaucrats 
have been working for several years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois and myself have several reservations, 
particularly with regard to securities. We will try to express 
these reservations in committee. What I wanted to focus on today 
was really that part of the bill that opens the door to what is 
called shareholder activism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the pioneers of shareholder activism in Canada—there are 
several—who is better known in Quebec and who has been dubbed 
the Robin Hood of the banking industry is Yves Michaud. As a 
shareholder dissatisfied with the behaviour of our voracious 
banks, he attended a shareholders' meeting to submit proposals 
for increased transparency on the part of the bank and for more 
reasonable salaries for bank executives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of Mr. Michaud's proposals was aimed at ensuring that a bank 
executive's salary was not more than 40 times higher than the 
salary of an employee in one of its branches. This would have 
introduced a social component in the behaviour of banks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Shareholder Association for Research and Education, in 
Vancouver, of which Peter Chapman is the director, does a lot of 
work in this regard. The Interchurch Committee on Corporate 
Responsibility and the Social Investment Organization, for which 
Tessa Hebb, a professor at the University of Ottawa, works, have 
been working on this for a number of years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the Fonds de solidarité des travailleurs du Québec. 
This represents the largest union in Quebec that is interested 
in these issues. I am also thinking of François Rebello, who is 
presently working on these issues, saying to unions and pension 
funds managers “Listen, give me the mandate to go to 
shareholders' meetings, and I will report back to you on them. 
Give me the right to vote for you”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All this is shareholders putting democracy to work. All this is 
the democratization of capital. 
I am not saying that this will change the world. All I am saying 
is that this can be a useful tool when businesses with a very 
high global productivity are tempted to do things like laying 
off workers, polluting the environment, overexploiting natural 
resources. If we act responsively as owners of pension funds, it 
could make a difference. One out of every two dollars on the 
financial market is owned by workers. This is important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is about all I wanted to say, and I hope that my remarks 
will have an impact on the decisions of the standing committee 
on industry. I hope the committee will be receptive to our 
proposal to include in the bill elements that could help create 
a culture of shareholder activism.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
bill is the first major overhaul of the Canada Business 
Corporations Act since 1975.  It also overhauls the Canada 
Cooperatives Act and seeks to harmonize the Canada Cooperatives 
Act with the Canada Business Corporations Act.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Shortly after it was elected in 1993 the Liberal government 
began a lengthy consultation process on overhauling the Canada 
Business Corporations Act, a process which has led to the 
introduction of the bill.  The government consulted over 1,700 
corporations, corporate associations and corporate law firms but 
only 41 citizens groups.  It appears to have largely ignored the 
contributions of citizens groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the consultation process was drawn out over a long 
period it was not a fair process and the government clearly did 
not consult as broadly as it should have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To add insult to injury, after waiting 25 years to overhaul the 
Canada Business Corporations Act the Liberal government is all of 
a sudden in a big rush to push the bill through the House as 
quickly as possible.  Why is there such a rush to pass it after 
25 years? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After 25 years of overhauling the act we have the Broadbent 
commission, chaired by Ed Broadbent, whose panel includes 
representatives from business and labour.  The panel is going 
across the country holding consultations on the issue of 
corporate responsibility.  Those two words, corporate 
responsibility, probably shock the heck out of the governing 
party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government is clearly rushing to get the bill passed 
before the Broadbent commission finishes its work next month. 
After waiting 25 years the government will rush the bill through 
within the next 30 days.  It wants to avoid addressing the issues 
the Broadbent commission is dealing with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Industry has assured Mr. Broadbent he will take 
the commission's findings into account.  If that is so, why is 
the government in such a rush to pass the bill after 25 years? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister is taking a similar approach to another bill, Bill 
S-17, which overhauls the Patent Act.  He says there is no time 
to deal with the problems of the Patent Act which have caused the 
price of medicine to rise by 87% in the last 10 years.  One in 
ten Canadians cannot afford the prescription medicines they need. 
There has been an 87% increase in prescription drug costs.  This 
is a serious problem.  However the Liberal government does not 
want to deal with it so it says there is no time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real issue is that the Liberal government is putting big 
corporations ahead of the sick and elderly in Canada who are 
struggling to pay for their medicine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the same issue here.  The government does not want to deal 
with the findings of the Broadbent commission.  The Broadbent 
commission, unlike the government, is talking to ordinary 
citizens who are concerned about democracy and corporate 
responsibility.  The Liberal government consulted only with 
corporations and after 25 years it is suddenly in a rush to pass 
the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill has a lot of technical amendments to bring the act up 
to date with our current legal system and allow corporations to 
make better use of electronic communications.  That is not a 
problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The three parts of the bill of most concern deal with director 
liability, shareholder rights and Canadian residency 
requirements.  The words shareholder rights and director 
liability are probably not well enforced on the other side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill makes it easier for corporate directors to defend 
themselves from lawsuits if they break their fiduciary 
responsibilities.  Canadian governments have a long history of 
breaking fiduciary responsibility.  They have been doing it to 
first nations people for decades. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At present corporate directors can use the defence of good faith 
reliance.  They can defend themselves from lawsuits by showing 
they have acted in good faith and relied on reasonable 
information from experts like accountants, economists and 
engineers.  Bill S-17 would replace the defence of good faith 
reliance with a new defence called due diligence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government is trying to make corporate directors 
even less accountable by removing the obligation to show that 
they base their actions on facts and expert opinions.  Bill S-17 
would switch to the more vague language of due diligence which 
could mean anything and be interpreted in almost any way by the 
courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the government making the language clearer in the rest of 
the bill but less clear in the section dealing with director 
liability?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If anyone thinks corporate directors need to be less 
accountable, as the bill would ensure, they need only look at the 
Westray tragedy.  The bill deals with civil and not criminal 
liability.  However the two are related because the managers of 
the Westray mine avoided both criminal and civil liability for 
the deaths of 26 coal miners.  Today one of the Westray managers 
manages a Canadian owned mine in Central America. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want every member of the House to recognize that it was 
Justice Richard's inquiry, a long, drawn out inquiry into the 
Westray tragedy, and its recommendations that prompted the 
government to put in place criminal liability for corporate 
directors and executives who knowingly put lives at risk.  It was 
Justice Richard who asked the government to respond. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has the government done?  Nothing.  To this day, nine years 
after the tragedy, nine years yesterday, the government has done 
nothing.  It has already been a number of years since Justice 
Richard's recommendations were made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prior to the election the government made a big show of how it 
would come forth with legislation to deal with the issue.  What 
are we now hearing?  The government will consult industry.  After 
Justice Richard's lengthy inquiry that is its biggest concern. It 
would rather not deal with the issue at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to put the bill before committee and have public 
hearings on it.  Let us listen to what industry has to say 
because a lot of corporations live by the rules and have ethics. 
They are not the ones for which we bring in laws.  It is for the 
ones which do not have ethics and do not care about workers that 
we have laws.  Not all citizens will commit criminal acts but we 
want to be able to charge those who do and hold them accountable. 
The corporate manslaughter issue is about holding corporations 
responsible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been waiting for the bill for how many years?  How many 
years has the issue been dragging on?  Since 1993 the government 
has had lengthy discussions.  We are rushing the bill through 
now, but where is the legislation on corporate manslaughter?  Why 
is it not being rushed through the House?  Why do we not have it 
on our plates to deal with?  It is because the government is not 
concerned about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members might gather that I am very passionate about the 
Westray tragedy.  I come from a mining community and have seen 
numerous deaths over the years.  Some were accidental and 
unavoidable, but for a number of others there should have been 
accountability.  When workers go into those places they do not 
have the same rights as each of us.  If we get killed in the 
House, if someone gets us at the door coming in, they will be 
liable for murder.  It is not the same for ordinary workers going 
into their workplaces.  We are protected.  Other workers are not, 
and that is because the government has failed to bring in 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To give credit where it is due, the bill makes progressive 
changes on the issue of shareholder rights.  My colleague from 
the Bloc mentioned a number of them.  Although the bill does not 
go far enough in giving shareholders real influence over 
corporations, it is an improvement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-11 would allow shareholders to submit resolutions at 
annual meetings on any issue pertaining to the business of the 
corporation.  At present, shareholder resolutions pertaining to 
social or other issues not related to the profitability of the 
company are not allowed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However in my view social issues are related to profitability. I 
do not buy from companies which have substandard labour 
legislation or take part in human rights violations.  For years I 
made a point of boycotting grapes because of the treatment of 
farm workers in California and throughout the world.  I make a 
point of making a statement.  If a product's country of origin is 
not marked I take it to the grocery store till and ask.  If they 
cannot tell me I do not buy the product.  If it comes from a 
country with a poor human rights record I do not buy it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not the only one who does that.  A lot of responsible, 
principled people do that because they genuinely care about 
the people in their country and those throughout the world.  I am 
proud and happy to say that I believe the majority of people 
would do that if they knew those violations were taking place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not buy rugs that come from certain countries unless they 
have a tag that says they are not made by child labour.  I do not 
buy certain running shoes.  I and a lot of other people do not 
wear the hats or the logo of certain companies.  Many people 
want to know where products come from and they will make a point 
of asking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I prefer to buy Canadian made items because, at least for the 
most part we are not as bad as other countries.  Bad practices 
do take place in the workplace in Canada but for the most part 
we are doing a good job.  Canada should not lower its labour 
standards nor diminish workers' rights or its treatment of 
children.  We need to promote Canada's good practices throughout 
the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to return to the issue of profitability of a company. If 
shareholders find out that the company they partly own is 
polluting the environment, today they cannot propose a resolution 
calling on the corporation to put a stop to it.  Bill S-11 would 
make this shareholder resolution possible, and that is a good 
move. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another improvement to shareholders' rights that our party 
supports is the ease with which shareholders would be able to 
communicate with each other.  Under the current Canada Business 
Corporations Act, it is illegal today for shareholders to solicit 
proxy votes from other shareholders unless they go to the great 
expense of sending out a circular to all shareholders. Bill S-11 
would allow shareholders to communicate in other less expensive 
ways, including websites. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We agree with the changes because they would make it easier for 
groups of small shareholders to band together at shareholders' 
meetings.  It is sad to say that shareholders have to fight to 
have a say in a corporation that they invest in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to note that the Liberal government is hardly 
breaking new ground with these improvements to shareholders' 
rights.  Canada is just playing catch up with the United States 
which has some of the most progressive laws in the world 
regarding shareholders' rights.  It shows how Canada, under the 
Liberal government, has fallen behind on some progressive issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two specific areas where the bill does not go far 
enough in expanding and improving shareholders' rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, shareholders should have the right to obtain information 
about a corporation's compliance with the law.  It is hard to 
believe but today corporations do not have to disclose their 
non-compliance with the law.  It can be very hard for 
shareholders or other people to find out if a corporation is 
violating labour laws or laws to protect the environment.  It is 
even harder to find out if these violations occur in other 
countries. Corporations should have to be completely open and 
transparent with their shareholders about these issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many people want to be ethical investors.  They want to know 
that when they buy shares in a company they are not contributing 
to the destruction of the environment or violating human rights. 
Shareholders should have the right to know these things. We 
emphasize that Canadians do not want to see their Canada pension 
plan dollars invested in unethical funds, such as in tobacco 
companies or in mining companies, that are literally wiping out 
villages in other countries.  I know the issue of Talisman oil 
has come up in these discussions already today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Shareholders' rights could also be improved by creating a 
shareholders' rights watchdog group.  Many states in the U.S. 
have created these sorts of groups and they are working out very 
well.  Corporations get shareholders to sign up to the 
shareholders' rights group.  This costs the government and the 
corporations nothing.   All the corporation is doing is inserting 
a form in a mailing that it has to send out anyway.  A 
shareholders' rights watchdog group is funded and run by its 
members.  There should be no objection to putting it in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to speak about the issue of Canadian residency. 
Bill S-11 reduces the requirement for directors of chartered 
corporations to be residents of Canada.  At the present time a 
majority of the board of directors of a corporation chartered 
under the Canada Business Corporations Act must be Canadian 
residents.  The current CBCA also requires that a majority of the 
members of any committees of the board be Canadian 
residents.  Bill S-11 reduces the Canadian residency requirement 
to 25% of the board of directors and completely eliminates the 
Canadian residency requirement for committees of the board. 
There are good arguments for and against the Canadian residency 
requirement. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1335"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT43"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the one hand the argument in favour of the Canadian residency 
requirement is that in theory if the directors of Canadian 
corporations live in Canada, they would be closer to the 
consequences of the corporations' actions and the corporations 
would therefore be more socially responsible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand the existence of these rules has not done much 
to turn Canadian corporations into good corporate citizens. Many 
corporate directors live in places such as Toronto and Calgary 
while their corporations do business in other parts of the 
country or even abroad.  This has not stopped Canadian 
corporations based in the financial capitals of countries from 
closing mines and mills in the hinterlands, breaking labour laws, 
polluting or even violating human rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian residency requirement is a disincentive for 
corporations to charter in Canada.  Canada is the only G-7 
country that imposes residency requirements.  There are four 
provinces that do not impose residency requirements: New 
Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and Quebec. 
Corporations that want to get around the residency requirement 
can already do so by chartering at the provincial level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since it has not done much good to make corporations into good 
citizens, reducing the Canadian residency requirement may help 
make Canadian corporations more internationally competitive at 
little cost.  However the issue does seem to warrant more 
consideration and discussion.  It would be nice to hear, for 
example, what the Broadbent commission has to say on the issue 
but unfortunately the Liberal government is rushing headlong into 
the bill before the commission finishes its work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, there has been much discussion over the last few 
years about corporate responsibility, ethical corporations and 
good corporate citizens.  For the most part corporations are good 
business operators and good managers that abide by the rules. 
However it is the same as with anything.  We need legislation to 
take to task those corporations that do not do so, those 
corporations that finagle, manipulate, and are not upfront and 
honest with their shareholders.  Those are the ones we are 
dealing with.  We need to give shareholders the right to check 
things out in the same way that corporations have the right to 
check things out.  Shareholders need to have the same rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is crucially important that the government move forward on 
the whole issue of corporate criminal liability.  Under 
absolutely no circumstances whatsoever should one more worker in 
Canada die with a corporate executive or director getting away 
with it if he or she knowingly put that life in jeopardy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will once again mention that as of yesterday over the past 
nine years there were 26 deaths and no one has been held 
criminally responsible.  What have we done to address that? 
Nothing.  It will not go away this time.  We will not let it be 
put to rest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Week after week we will continue to remind the government that 
it made a commitment to the people of Canada prior to the 
election last year that it would deal with the issue of corporate 
responsibility and criminal liability.  We will make sure that it 
keeps its promise and, if it does not, we will make sure that 
Canadians hear over and over again that it has failed to do what 
it promised.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the member for Churchill for her very eloquent remarks. 
She outlined very well some of the real problems that Canadian 
consumers, citizens and active participants in society face when 
it comes to dealing with megacorporations.  A lot of people feel 
powerless.  They feel like they are individuals taking on a 
massive structure which by its very nature is very undemocratic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Churchill has provided some very good 
evidence of some of the problems facing us in terms of 
dealing with these very undemocratic structures.

<A HREF="#LINKT44"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member gave the example of the Westray disaster and the 
tragic deaths that occurred there nine years ago.  The fact that 
the government has not taken any action is regrettable and again 
another indication of how this part of our society, these 
corporations and massive institutions, has been allowed to get 
off scot-free.  They operate in a realm where most of us feel 
like we have very little recourse to deal with them.  We could go 
through the judicial system, which is hugely expensive, but we 
would be up against a corporation that has very deep pockets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the member to comment further on the growing 
movement of consumers who are taking action into their own hands. 
Consumers say that they will make choices about what they do. 
They will not use their hard earned dollars to purchase goods or 
services from corporations that are blatant in terms of their 
disregard of human rights, the environment or the way they treat 
women or minorities.  This movement is growing very strong in 
Canada.  Would the member agree with that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Bev Desjarlais:</B>  Mr. Speaker, there is no question 
that a majority of people would agree with that.  My colleague and 
I and the rest of our caucus went to Quebec City to the people's 
summit because there were concerns over trade issues and the way 
huge corporations were starting to control the political agenda 
and the legislation in numerous countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation would protect people and give them information. 
Our party believes that individuals should be allowed to decide. 
They should be given the information on which to decide about an issue 
such as genetically modified foods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is nothing to fear, the information should be put on 
the label and individuals should be allowed to decide whether or not they 
want to take that chance.  The same applies to buying products 
made in other countries where maybe the labour standards are not 
up to snuff. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know there is a problem in Indonesia so we do not make a 
decision to stop buying coffee there.  However we will not buy 
coffee from Indonesia if we know that its farmers are not being 
treated fairly or that someone is running roughshod over the 
people and violating human rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not jeopardizing the rights of Canadian citizens by 
saying they cannot do something.  We are saying that individuals 
should be given the information.  Information is what it is 
about.  Everyone has the right to ask those questions.  We should 
not have legislation in place, either through this piece of 
legislation or any other, that says it might jeopardize corporate 
profitability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is corporate profitability more important than knowing that a 
four year old is sitting at a loom making a rug we are going to 
walk on so that we can get it for some $20 less?  How many of us, 
if we knew that a four or five or six year old was working on a 
loom day after day to put a rug under our feet, would buy the 
darn thing?  We would not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However let us go a step further, have some principles and say 
that people have a right to know where something is made.  They 
have a right to know if a company is using child labour or if it 
is paying wages below the standards that it is supposed to.  We 
have a right to know these things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation should be about the rights of shareholders to 
control what their corporation is doing.  If they are investing 
they have a right to know where the corporation is investing and 
if it is breaking laws.  That is what we are asking.  We are not 
saying that shareholders cannot do it.  We are saying they have a 
right to know and the right to get information in order to make 
decisions. 
<P><A NAME="LINK56"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
commend the member for Churchill on her impassioned speech and 
her reference to the Westray disaster in Nova Scotia.  As a Nova 
Scotian it means a great deal to have members of parliament from 
other parts of the country recognize the call for action that is 
represented by what happened in Westray. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I learned a great deal about consumer power and the power of 
consumer advocacy from the hon. member for Churchill, even about 
ethically raised grapes.  I would suggest that any farmer or 
jurisdiction which allows grapes to be raised in an unethical 
manner will be subject to the wrath of grapes from the hon. 
member. 
Further to that I will also recognize that we have global 
leadership provided by some companies, for instance, on issues of 
the treatment of animals and animal testing and that sort of 
thing.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>An interesting question dawned on me the other day.  There are 
companies that for years have marketed against animal testing.  I 
think the Body Shop was probably the first company.  The other 
day I was in a pet supply store buying shampoo for my dog.  I 
looked at the label of the dog shampoo and was shocked and 
appalled because there was no warning against human testing. 
Perhaps that is another issue for another day in this place and 
for now we can move forward, but right now my dog is using 
shampoo that may have been tested on humans.  That is clearly a 
loophole we should seek to fill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-11, an act to amend the Canada Business Corporations Act, 
is a very important and long overdue act.  The bill comes to us 
from the Senate, where it should be noted that a very important 
amendment was put forth by my colleague, Senator Oliver, and 
adopted by that House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Senator Oliver's amendment corrected a major flaw in the act. 
Before the amendment there was no statutory review of the act, an 
act that has a major impact on Canada's business framework and 
indeed on our competitiveness.  The amendment was proposed 
because it is recognized that in a global, hypercompetitive, ever 
changing economy we cannot leave legislation or a regulatory 
framework like this untouched for 25 years, as was the case in 
this instance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we are looking at the types of policy frameworks that 
companies or investors look at when determining where to invest 
in the world, not only is tax policy important, and it is, or 
regulatory burden important, and it is, but increasingly issues 
of corporate governance are moving to the forefront as being 
extremely important in every country in the world.  We need to 
ensure that we have clear, consistent, up to date policies in 
that regard that are reflective of those that exist in other 
countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I am glad to see the government finally move forward on 
this issue, the fact that it has been 25 years since we have had 
major updates is unfortunate.  I heartily commend the initiative 
and the amendment of Senator Oliver which will ensure that this 
does not happen again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are battling on a daily basis to attract investment 
and capital to our country.  If we look at the secular decline of 
the Canadian dollar over the last 30 years, much of that has to 
do with declining levels of productivity.  Productivity is 
closely related to levels of investment, and when we fail to 
attract investment usually the consequence is that we fail to 
develop greater levels of productivity in our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course that is reflected in our limp loonie, our falling 
dollar, which continues to be a source of concern if not 
embarrassment for many Canadians as Canadians see their standard 
of living decline with the declining dollar.  In fact, Canadians 
are taking a pay cut every time our dollar drops relative to that 
of the U.S.  These are some of the issues we have to consider. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly corporate law administration in Canada has been 
consistently quite good.  On the issue of corporate governance 
addressed by the legislation, Canada has not had a bad record, 
but we have failed in many ways to keep up to some of the trends 
that have occurred in other countries and with our trading 
partners.

<A HREF="#LINKT46"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In researching our response to the legislation, I was shocked to 
find that a 1996 recommendation by the Senate banking, trade and 
commerce committee to institute a review within 10 years was 
actually rejected by the industry department.  The government's 
reasoning at the time was this: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The increased recognition of corporate law and corporate 
governance issues as factors affecting the competitiveness of 
corporations will likely ensure the continued improvement of 
corporate laws. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a great leap of faith coming from the government.  I 
would argue that where government does have a responsibility in a 
market driven economy is to set in place the framework within 
which the private sector and in fact the public sector can work 
and develop.  In not rigorously maintaining and updating its 
regulations relative to corporate governance issues, the 
government has clearly abdicated its responsibility in this 
regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is just one part of competitiveness and one part of the 
framework required to ensure to investors looking to make 
investments anywhere in the world that Canada is a good place to 
do business and that in fact, along with tax policy and 
regulatory policy, along with these other issues, corporate 
governance is increasingly important.  I would hope that the 
government would become much more vigilant in evaluating the 
threats and opportunities in this competitive global environment 
and would move more proactively in addressing them with 
legislation in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again this legislation came to us from the Senate and again it 
is reflective of some of the very positive benefits of our Senate 
and of some of the forward thinking and visionary approaches 
taken by our members in the upper House.  I would commend them 
for their input on this initiative and for their amendments, 
which in fact have improved the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Senator Brison. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  One of my hon. colleagues has referred 
to me as Senator Brison.  That is not the case, but we are 
still waiting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to impress on the government that its policies relative 
to an industrial policy for the country and relative to a 
framework for growth and competitiveness have been sadly lacking. 
That the legislation is coming to us after such delays and 
dilly-dallying is unfortunate.  We need to ensure on an ongoing 
basis that we are updating our corporate governance rules and 
that not only are we keeping up with global trends but perhaps 
actually seeking to set some global trends in this and in other 
areas.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1953 we have celebrated the arrival of spring every year 
with this festival.  This great event originated in 1945 when 
Princess Juliana of the Netherlands donated over 100,000 tulip 
bulbs to Canada.  This was a gesture of thanks for providing the 
Dutch royal family with safe haven during World War II and for 
the role Canadian forces played in liberating the Netherlands 
from the Nazis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This year Great Britain will co-sponsor the festival which will 
be launched with a 46 metre tulip balloon on Parliament Hill.  We 
invite all Canadians to participate in the music and activities 
and to enjoy the colourful display of millions of tulips.

not well.  In the next 10 years we will have a shortage of 
112,000 nurses.  Hospitals are relying on nurses to do overtime 
just to fill their spots.  I have worked in hospitals where half 
the nursing spots in the intensive care unit and emergency 
department are simply not filled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This crisis is not only confined to nursing.  It also happens 
with physicians.  Our population is aging too.  Today 25% of the 
physician population is over the age of 55.  In the next 15 years 
that number will rise to the point where 45% of all doctors will 
be over the age of 55.  The crisis is staggering.  Who will care 
for us when we are old if there are no doctors and nurses left? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I implore the government to work with the provinces to increase 
enrolment in medical, nursing and training faculties by 20% and 
have a tuition for service in outlying areas program that will 
enable us to fill the absolute dire crisis in rural areas.  We 
must act now.  This crisis is not going away.  Lives depend on 
it.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the first time in the history of Canada that we have had

the payment on interest, it was $121 billion.  We reduced it by 
20% during the difficult years that we had.  We have increased it 
slowly since that time.  We are not back yet to where we were in 
1993-94.  Of course we still have problems in Canada but we have 
a program: reduction of the debt, reduction of taxes and spending 
for some of the problems that exist in society that we do 
recognize on this side.

her job it is a matter of considerable concern to the government. 
The fact is that there is a slowdown in the United States and a 
slowdown in the high tech industry and the telecommunications 
industry.  That is where these job losses are taking place.

them.

is disturbing.

Mr. Speaker, yesterday the solicitor general told the House that

about 926 individuals who have either escaped or are unlawfully 
at large from all levels of our institutions.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask a question of the solicitor general.  What 
resources could the government commit to keeping these guys in

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, one year 
ago today the Minister of Transport announced that there would be 
more competitive grain handling transportation.  In fact he 
predicted that the average reduction would be $5.92 a tonne. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course we have come nowhere close to that.  In Saskatchewan, 
for example, it is less than one-tenth, a measly 53 cents a 
tonne.  Since the bulk of the money did not go to the producers, 
my question is very straightforward.  Who did it go to? 
<P><A NAME="LINK158"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I believe that Bill C-34, passed before the last 
election, was one of the more successful pieces of legislation in 
restoring some equilibrium with respect to pricing of grain on 
the prairies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under that legislation farmers, the producers, will be receiving 
about $175 million in benefits.  I believe the figure the hon. 
member has calculated is wrong in the sense that he did not 
include all the various components of the cost.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, in fact 
the minister promised an 18% reduction.  What producers have 
received is actually less than 2%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most of the money has obviously gone to the railways and the 
grain companies.  It is a sad commentary, not only on their 
commitment but on the commitment of the government, that there 
has not been more assistance for the producers.  Railway profits 
last year of $1.47 billion exceeded all the net farm income for 
prairie producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given all this, how can the minister justify the 3.5% increase

August 1?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

have an all party committee working on modernizing the rules of 
the House, and we have only just begun.

legislation.  Afterward, if there is any time left, we will 
resume debate on Bill C-10 regarding marine parks.

<P><A NAME="LINK209"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Collenette (for the Minister of Finance)</B> moved 
that Bill S-16, an act to amend the Proceeds of Crime (Money 
Laundering) Act, be read the second time and referred to a 
committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK210"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I welcome the opportunity to 
speak today at second reading of Bill S-16, an act to amend the 
Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) Act.  This bill would 
improve upon its predecessor, Bill C-22, which received royal 
assent last June.  That bill was needed for several reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Allow me to take a moment to review some of the background to 
that bill. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As hon. members know, money laundering in recent years has 
become more and more of a problem in Canada.  By definition, 
money laundering is the process by which dirty money from 
criminal activities is converted into assets that cannot be 
easily traced back to their illegal origins. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today's open borders provide criminals with a daily opportunity 
to launder millions of dollars in illegal profits with the 
intention of making the profits look legitimate.  These 
activities can undermine the reputation and integrity of 
financial institutions and distort the operation of financial 
markets if adequate measures are not in place to deter money 
laundering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To illustrate the magnitude of the problem, it is estimated that 
between $5 billion and $17 billion in criminal proceeds are 
laundered through Canada each year.  A significant portion of 
this laundered money is linked to profits from drug trafficking. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1510"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT62"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Money laundering became a crime in Canada back in 1989.  Prior 
to Bill C-22 Canada had many of the building blocks of an 
anti money laundering program in place within the criminal code 
and the previous Proceeds of Crime (money laundering) Act. 
However the government realized that much more needed to be done 
to combat the problem. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On one hand, the government was being pressured by law 
enforcement agencies for better enforcement tools.  At the same 
time, on the international front, Canada was subject to scrutiny 
because of perceived gaps in our anti money laundering 
arrangements. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997 the 26 member financial action task force on money 
laundering, the FATF of which Canada is a founding member, found 
Canada to be lacking in certain key areas and strongly encouraged 
us to bring our anti money laundering regime in line with 
international standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of pressure here and internationally, the government 
brought in Bill C-22 in the last parliament.  That legislation 
strengthened the previous statute by adding measures to improve 
the detection, prevention and deterrence of money laundering in 
Canada.  Bill C-22 contained three distinct components which 
enabled Canada to live up to its international commitments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the bill provided for the mandatory reporting of 
suspicious financial transactions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the legislation required that large cross-border 
movements of cash or monetary instruments like travellers' cheques 
be reported to the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, Bill C-22 provided for the establishment of the Financial 
Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada, FINTRAC, 
which came into being on July 5, 2000.  An independent agency, 
FINTRAC is set out to receive and analyze reports and to pass on 
information to law enforcement authorities if it has reasonable 
grounds to suspect that information would be relevant to a money 
laundering investigation or prosecution. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should also mention that there are safeguards in place to 
ensure that the collection, use and disclosure of information by 
FINTRAC are strictly controlled.  These safeguards are supported 
by criminal penalties for any unauthorized use or disclosure of 
personal information under FINTRAC's control. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>FINTRAC is also subject to the federal Privacy Act and its 
protections. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-22 was welcomed last year by members on all sides of the 
House for several reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, it responded to domestic law enforcement communities 
needs for additional means of fighting organized crime by more 
effectively targeting the proceeds of crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, it responded to Canada's need to meet its international 
responsibilities in the fight against money laundering.  It did 
so while providing safeguards to protect individual privacy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In spite of these accomplishments, several of our hon. 
colleagues in the other place believed the act could be 
strengthened even further and could benefit from additional 
amendments.  The government agreed and the result is Bill S-16, 
the legislation before us today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me take a moment and provide some background. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Bill C-22 was studied by the standing Senate committee on 
banking, trade and commerce last spring, members of the committee 
indicated that while they supported the bill the legislation 
would benefit from amendments to certain provisions. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Secretary of State for International Financial Institutions 
made a commitment at that time to clarify the act by including 
several of the changes requested by the committee.  The result 
was Bill S-30 which was introduced last fall and subsequently 
died on the order paper when the election was called.  It was 
reintroduced in this parliament as Bill S-16. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments in this bill relate to four specific issues.  The 
first deals with the process for claiming solicitor-client 
privilege during an audit by FINTRAC.  The agency is authorized 
to conduct audits to ensure compliance with the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current legislation contains provisions that apply when 
FINTRAC conducts a compliance audit of a law office.  FINTRAC 
must provide a reasonable opportunity for a legal counsel to 
claim solicitor-client privilege on any document it possesses at 
the time of the audit. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1515"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT64"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT64"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1515
<A HREF="#LINKT65"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT63"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed measure in Bill S-16 pertains to documents in the 
possession of someone other than a lawyer.  It requires that that 
person be given a reasonable opportunity to contact a lawyer so 
that the lawyer could make a claim of solicitor-client privilege. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another measure would ensure that nothing in the act would 
prevent the federal court from ordering the director of FINTRAC 
to disclose certain information as required under the Access to 
Information Act or the Privacy Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment would ensure that the recourse of individuals to 
the federal court would be fully respected.  Indeed this was the 
intent of the original bill, Bill C-22. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third amendment more precisely would define the kinds of 
information that could be disclosed to police and other 
authorities specified in the legislation.  It would clarify that 
the regulations setting out this information could only cover 
similar identifying information regarding the client, the 
institution and the transactions involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, Bill S-16 would ensure that all reports and information 
in FINTRAC's possession would be destroyed after specific 
periods.  Information that has not been disclosed to police or 
other authorities must be destroyed by FINTRAC after five years. 
Information that has been disclosed must be destroyed after eight 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-22 introduced sweeping changes to Canada's anti money 
laundering regime.  First, it introduced new reporting 
requirements which would result in more reliable, timely and 
consistent reporting.  Second, it introduced centralized 
reporting through FINTRAC which allowed much needed and much more 
sophisticated analysis. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, successful prosecutions that benefit from analysis by 
FINTRAC can lead to court ordered forfeiture of the proceeds of 
criminal activities. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Above all, these benefits would be achieved in a way that 
respects the privacy of individuals.  The additional amendments 
contained in Bill S-16 would only serve to further strengthen and 
improve this statute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Irrespective of party affiliation, I am confident that all hon. 
members will fully support the bill.  I urge members to give the 
legislation quick and speedy passage so that we may proceed to 
other items on the government's legislative agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point 
of order to seek unanimous consent to revert to routine 
proceedings for the purpose of tabling a committee report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Is there unanimous consent of the House to 
revert to tabling of reports by committees? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No. 
<P><A NAME="LINK211"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak to Bill 
S-16.  It is long overdue, and deals with one of the most 
important aspects of crime in the country today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is estimated that a majority of crime today relates to 
organized crime.   Bill S-16, an act to amend the Proceeds of 
Crime (Money Laundering) Act is one we support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For a long time the Canadian Alliance has worked hard to 
influence the government to address in a very reasonable way the 
large problem that affects every single riding in our country. 
The extent and depth of the problem of organized crime is 
extensive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Organized criminals not only take advantage of the existing laws 
and working above the law, but also working beneath society and 
below the law.  They hide behind the law when it is advantageous 
and flaunt it when it serves their benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Historically many people may consider organized crime as the 
biker on a Harley Davidson, engaging in prostitution, drug abuse 
and in the buying and selling of drugs.  Organized crime is much 
more than that.  It is a national and transnational problem which 
will require a co-ordinated effort not only within our country 
but also among nations.  Organized crime gangs have formed 
transnational groups that are capitalizing on the globalized 
markets in our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Organized crime gangs deal not only with the traditional forms 
of money laundering, drugs, prostitution and the violence that 
goes with that, they also deal with a considerable amount of 
white collar crime. 
That white collar crime involves setting up businesses and 
engaging in illegal activities.

<A HREF="#LINKT64"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Organized crime groups set up shell companies that profess to 
deal with the cleanup of environmentally toxic areas.  They offer 
their services to businesses.  They tell them that they will take 
their waste products and dispose of them sensibly.  What they do 
is take those waste products, charge the company and then dump 
them illegally, polluting our land, our air and our water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They also take the moneys from things like prostitution, drugs 
and weapons.  They also take money from trafficking endangered 
species, which is second in the entire world in the trafficking 
of illegal products.  That money is put it into illegal 
businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is how do we deal with these organized crime groups? 
Police officers have told us that we have to go after the money. 
If we can take away the money underpinnings of international 
groups then we will crush them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is a case in point.  In the United States a crime gang took 
those moneys and bought a casino.  That was followed up and the 
casino was apprehended.  The moneys from the sale of that 
property went into fighting crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same thing happens in countries like Ireland, South Africa 
and south of the border.  However, to understand why this is so 
important, we have to look at the impact of organized crime in 
our society today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada it is estimated that it costs us $5 billion to $9 
billion a year, which includes insurance, cellular phone, credit 
card and telemarketing fraud, and much more.  Between $5 billion 
and $17 billion a year is laundered in Canada.  That is why we 
are known as a haven for organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine $5 billion to $17 billion being laundered in our 
country. That is a huge amount of money.  It impacts our civil 
society in ways of which we are unaware.  The cost of this 
impacts upon all of us.  It impacts our insurance costs, because 
of motor theft.  There is also securities fraud.  This is not to 
mention the violence generating effects of the illicit drug trade 
which has had such a profound and negative impact upon our 
society.  That is why we support this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I came back from Colombia in February.  There are enormous 
effects as a direct result of the illicit drug trade in that part 
of South America. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is poised for a flood of pure, cheap heroin that will 
undercut the price of cocaine.  This will mean that on the 
streets there will be a higher number of addicts, a greater 
number of overdoses and deaths, not to mention the increasing 
incidence of the transmission of hepatitis B, C and HIV among the 
drug users.  That is why many of us have asked the government to 
deal with drug use in a more pragmatic and less punitive way by 
looking at models in Europe which can be employed here.  In fact 
I had put forth a private member's bill to that effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing the government could do is employ RICO-like 
amendments which have been in the United States since 1970. These 
amendments would allow the government better opportunities to go 
after and apprehend civil property, civil forfeiture, as well as 
criminal forfeiture upon conviction of the properties that are 
used or acquired through illegal uses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to take a moment to look at the international 
aspects of organized crime.  In many of the hot spots around the 
world, from Nigeria to Somalia, Central Africa, Sierra Leone, 
Colombia, Brazil, Paraguay, Bolivia and Venezuela, we can see the 
impact and the integration of organized crime in society, 
particularly in societies that are in a very tenuous place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the price of oil went down in Nigeria, organized crime 
insinuated itself into the country.  It has become a haven for 
the trafficking of cocaine, heroin and diamonds.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have had a chance to visit South Africa some 12 times since 
1986.  That country made some good changes, but unfortunately has 
suffered from a breakdown in law and order.  Organized crime 
gangs saw an opportunity to insinuate themselves into a country 
which was trying to get on its feet.  As a result, South Africa 
has become a haven for organized crime and for the trafficking of 
contraband, particularly drugs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very serious problem because it destabilizes these 
countries.  Look in the heart of darkness of Africa where the 
blood of tens and hundreds of thousands of people has been 
spilled.  We can see how mercenary groups, in conjunction with 
organized crime groups functioning in a transnational way, have 
used diamonds to further their ends of making money.  However it 
has also contributed to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of 
innocent people and the furthering of conflict in these areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point I am making is that while the actions of organized 
crime are known, they are not only a domestic problem, they are a 
transnational and international problem.  These actions also 
contribute to the furthering of conflicts in some of the worst 
parts of the world.  Hundreds of thousands of innocent people are 
killed in areas where democratic rules and the rule of law with 
respect to human rights are simply absent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Organized crime groups have no compunction whatsoever in 
insinuating themselves into conflict that occurs in these areas. 
They grasp and capitalize on these problems.  In many cases we 
think some of these battles are mostly over religion.  We see the 
issue of Sudan being one of them.  However it has more to do with 
money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Somalia it was looked at as a fight between rival clans.  In 
effect, a larger part of it had to do with the trafficking of 
something called khat, which is a drug.  The trafficking, the 
influence and involvement of organized crime gangs has a profound 
impact upon these conflicts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a great opportunity for the Minister of Finance, who is 
the head of G-20 at this point, to try to work with the Bretton 
Woods institutions and use them as a lever to address the issue 
of organized crime.  The IMF should have built in opportunities 
to analyze where moneys are going to make sure that organized 
crime is not benefiting from it.  Similarly, the World Bank and 
the other IFIs need to look at where the money is spent to make 
sure it is not being channelled into illegal operations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Russia is a prime case.  Billions of dollars of western money 
has gone into Russia in good faith to try to stabilize the 
economic situation.  Unfortunately, a lot of that money has 
fallen into the hands of the oligarchs that have ruled a large 
chunk of that country for far too long.  I know Mr. Putin is 
working hard to deal with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can only encourage the Minister of Finance to work with the 
international community to implement levers which will ensure 
that moneys being spent are used for proper monetary and fiscal 
stability in these countries and are not being siphoned away by 
individuals who are thugs in business suits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I again emphasize that organized crime takes a big 
bite out of our economy and has many seen and unseen negative 
effects upon Canada.  We support the bill and encourage the 
government to strengthen it as time goes on, by implementing 
methods to have criminal and civil forfeiture for individuals who 
are engaging in crime and by implementing RICO-like amendments in 
this country.  We should work with the international community to 
ensure that similar laws are implemented so we can have a 
transnational, multifactorial approach to this scourge among us.

have our communications straightened out now between the parties 
and if you would seek it, I think you would now find unanimous

Speaker, I have the honour to present the seventh report of the

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>PROCEEDS OF CRIME (MONEY LAUNDERING) ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK218">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill S-16, an 
act to amend the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) Act, be 
read the second time and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK219"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les 
Basques, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise today to 
speak to Bill S-16, an act to amend the Proceeds of Crime (Money 
Laundering) Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, let me remind the House that proceeds of crime covers 
anything seized that was, in the court's opinion, used to commit 
an offence or gained as a result of the offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is just one piece of legislation among many others that 
were passed. Our society is now facing a major problem that has 
grown in scope in the last few years, with organized crime 
becoming a complex, international and ever changing industry that 
goes beyond traditional crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We now have technology based crime and international crime. For 
instance, drug traffic is run just like any other business, 
except for the fact that what is being traded is illegal, and of 
course new technologies are also used to commit crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As citizens, we often feel helpless. On the news, we hear about 
events, about people who are accused and about crimes, and we are 
not quite sure about the cause. The whole community wants 
governments to address this problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the Bloc Quebecois can be proud of the courage shown by 
our leader and our team, particularly during the last election 
campaign. We have made proposals and prodded the government into 
finally taking action. I think the leader of the Bloc Quebecois 
deserves credit for that, as well as those members who work on 
justice issues, including the member for Berthier—Montcalm, the 
member for Saint-Bruno—Saint-Hubert and the member for 
Hochelaga—Maisonneuve. They lead initiatives aimed at fighting 
organized crime, directly or indirectly, and its consequences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Organized crime has an impact on poverty. People who are most 
vulnerable make easier targets. They are more easily used. We 
must be aware of the fact that the related social and economic 
costs for our society are considerable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill before us amends the Proceeds of Crime (Money 
Laundering) Act. The act it is based on needs certain 
adjustments, which are contained in this bill. We hope they will 
enable us to fight organized crime more effectively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 1 of the bill says that reports and all information will 
be retained for five years, which is what the current act says, 
but then it sets out the circumstances under which three years 
will be added to that period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The retention period will thus be eight years, when the 
Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada 
passes information either to law enforcement authorities or to 
the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency, the Canadian Security and 
Intelligence Service, the Department of Citizenship and 
Immigration, an agency in a foreign state or an international 
organization with a mandate similar to the centre's. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, adding three more years will make documents 
available for a longer period of time. They will be retained 
longer.

<A HREF="#LINKT67"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of crimes requiring time consuming investigations or 
the retrieval of evidence that might have been seized in the 
course of a previous investigation, this gives an added 
opportunity to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, the addition to section 54(1) of the Proceeds of Crime 
(Money Laundering) Act provides that each report received and all 
information received or collected shall be destroyed on the 
expiry of the applicable period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This clause clarifies certain provisions regarding the retention 
and destruction of information. This does not raise any 
particular issue, but it is important to note that such is the 
intent of the lawmakers that we are, and that this type of 
amendment was necessary to make the act more efficient in the 
fight against organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 3 came about as the result of the realization that under the 
current act the federal court had no jurisdiction in this 
matter. With this amendment, no provision of the act will prevent 
the federal court from ordering the head of the centre to 
disclose information in accordance with the Access to Information 
Act and the Privacy Act, thus making the act easier to enforce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This clause is yet another one to make enforcement of the act 
easier and more effective. 
We are also told that the spirit of the act already allowed the 
federal court to play its role in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, by amending the text, we are making sure that not only the 
spirit but also the letter of the act allows that. This may 
prove very useful when dealing with organized crime, since those 
who are charged often have very good defence lawyers. Of course, 
it is the role of these lawyers to make sure that their clients 
are properly defended, but we must make sure that it is not 
possible, through some flaw, to miss the main issue when taking 
someone to court or preparing evidence. This is also the purpose 
of that clause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there is a clause dealing with the whole issue of 
solicitor-client privilege. 
We have a problem with that clause because any interpretation of 
the said clause, in its current wording, would be pure 
speculation. This provision is very vague. It does not specify 
its objective. We were told that it was included because of the 
concerns expressed by accountants, who wanted a privilege 
similar to the solicitor-client privilege granted to lawyers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This clause will have to be reworded to make it easier to 
understand. Some work will have to be done in that regard, 
probably in committee, to come up with useful amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the first three clauses of the bill include 
amendments designed to clarify the intent of the provisions they 
amend, and these amendments do not change the substance of the 
Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, as I just mentioned, there is a problem with clause 4. 
We simply cannot figure out this provision. It is very vague. I 
think we would be better off with no provision than one 
that is worded like this one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Still, the best option might be to rewrite the clause so that 
we can see if it is an amendment that can be used in the fight 
against money laundering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, we in the Bloc Quebecois were in favour of the 
Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) Act, and in particular we 
were behind the elimination of the $1,000 bill. This was called 
for, supported, debated and in the end successfully defended by 
the hon. member for Charlesbourg—Jacques-Cartier.   The government 
finally moved on this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion, the Bloc Quebecois record is impeccable.  We 
have proposed several concrete measures to improve the 
situation, to ensure that the state is properly equipped to 
fight organized crime.  We hope there are still other tools to 
be laid on the table in order to ensure that we end up with 
everything required to do away with this scourge, to eliminate 
this situation, and to ensure that within this society there is 
less and less of a parallel universe and a parallel economy, 
which penalizes our entire society by the way it operates.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all these reasons, we are going to vote in favour of Bill 
S-16, on condition that clause 4 is clarified for the reasons I 
have already given. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore invite the House to support this bill which will, as 
soon as possible, enable the departmental staff concerned to do 
their job more diligently and with more appropriate tools, so 
that results can be attained.  This is but one of the tools 
necessary to fight organized crime, but it is a useful one.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise today to contribute to the debate on Bill S-16. 
The New Democratic Party supported Bill C-22 in the previous 
parliament, which was approved and received royal assent.  We 
voiced a number of concerns as it went through committee stage 
and amendments.  We are glad to see that some of those concerns 
are being addressed in Bill S-16. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the NDP like other members of the House are extremely 
concerned about the impact of organized crime on our local 
communities and across the country.  There is no question that it 
is something that is very sophisticated.  It is very pervasive 
and has a huge impact on many people's lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Personally, as well as in terms of financial institutions and 
various businesses, we are all very familiar with cases that do 
come to public light.  They give us a glimpse of the kind of 
operation that exists outside the law in terms of money 
laundering, the profits from organized crime and how they are 
dealt with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For most people it is a fairly frightening glimpse when we look 
at a system that is so complex.  As in previous legislation the 
attempts in this legislation to deal with that sophistication and 
to find the appropriate mechanisms to track where money is 
flowing, where the proceeds of organized crime are coming from, is 
very important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP put forward some concerns about the original bill.  In 
any legislation there has to be a balance between a reasonable 
right and invasion of privacy.  There must be an understanding 
that the power of the state is not absolute.  When a new agency 
is created with far reaching powers we have to be very careful 
about how it is set up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, before Bill C-22 was approved we and a number of 
witnesses who came forward to debate the bill expressed concerns 
about whether or not there was potential for charter of rights 
violations, that the guarantees of reasonable search and seizure 
appeared to be at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were also very concerned about the possible pressures there 
would be on consumers.  Needless to say, there would probably be 
a significant cost in setting up any sort of regime to track and 
communicate suspicious transactions.  I do not know if that has 
been spelled out, but it seems to me that it would be enormous in 
terms of what the responsibilities would be for financial 
institutions and how that would get passed on to law abiding 
consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the NDP were also very concerned about the fact that 
the bill did not address what is often referred to as white 
collar crimes or technology based crimes.  Unfortunately this is 
a huge area that is booming.  We are all very familiar that the 
growth of the Internet and computers in general, credit card 
fraud, telephone fraud, stock market manipulation and computer 
break-ins are all things that can be characterized as technology 
based crimes or white collar crimes. 
There is no question that there is a very serious element within 
that which is perpetrated by organized crime.  It seems to us 
that the original bill did not and the legislation before us 
today does not adequately address the concerns that surely must 
be addressed in terms of technology based crimes.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the debate today I heard a number of members talk about 
different elements of organized crime and the impact they have. 
The member for Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca spoke about the drug trade 
and its human impact.  I will spend a couple of minutes speaking 
about that as well because it strikes me that there is a 
contradiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the one hand, as we should, we go to great lengths to deal 
with a legal apparatus and the setting up of a new agency, 
FINTRAC, the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of 
Canada, as it is called, and what a mouthful that is.  We go to 
great lengths to set up a very elaborate system for tracking 
suspicious transactions, trying to trace what has happened and 
making sure that there is adequate reporting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other side of that coin in terms of organized crime and 
the billions of dollars that are generated illegally through drug 
trafficking and drug use and the profits that are made, we do not 
pay enough attention to the human costs that are very clearly 
evident on our streets, in urban centres and even in smaller 
communities across Canada.  I have only to look at my own riding 
of Vancouver East to see the devastation that happens in an 
environment where illegal drug activity is a huge underground 
economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe, and I certainly would echo the comments from the 
member for Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, that we have to pay attention 
to that human side.  We have to recognize that in some respects 
it is the illegality of those substances, heroin or crack cocaine 
or other substances, that drives this underground market and in 
effect criminalizes addicts when they are on the street with very 
few resources.  We end up with a community where people are 
literally dying on the streets from overdoses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It strikes me as a horrible irony that while on the one hand we 
can somehow relate to this issue from a legislative point of view 
by setting up this centre, on the other we cannot relate to this 
issue from a human point of view and take the actions that are 
necessary to actually reduce the harm of what is happening on our 
streets because of these illegal substances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also add that we need a saner, more humane approach to 
drug use in Canada and we need to be seriously willing to reform 
Canada's drug laws, which have not been reformed for decades.  We 
have had Senate hearings.  We have had debates in the past where 
some of these issues have been debated very seriously, but not in 
recent times.  If we took the time to do that I believe we would 
go a long way toward dealing with some of the causes of the 
devastation we see on our streets.  We could in fact look at the 
issue of how organized crime is being driven by this very 
lucrative business of drug use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could look to the experience of what is happening in Europe, 
where the approach has been to medicalize drug use and addiction 
instead of criminalizing people.   The approach has been to try 
to remove the harm from buying drugs on the street.  Not only has 
there been a huge financial saving in health care costs and 
judicial costs, but lives have been saved as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wanted to make that point because it seems to me that we are 
missing the boat unless we look at the total picture.  We cannot 
just say that all this money is coming from organized crime and a 
lot of it is coming from drugs unless we are willing to examine 
Canada's drug policies and recognize that they need to be 
seriously reformed.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, even with marijuana we see the stories about grow 
operations in the papers all the time.  In east Vancouver there 
are media reports of various grow busts taking place.  We are 
talking about multimillion dollar operations.  It seems to me 
that if we had the courage to examine our drug policy laws and to 
seriously look at reform of those laws we would be going a long 
way in terms of removing the incentive and the huge opening that 
exists for organized crime to become a part of the underground 
economy.  That is a very important aspect of the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In regard to the bill before us today, I did want to say that 
the NDP certainly supports the amendments that are contained in 
the bill as a result of the previous bill, Bill C-22.  We support 
them in principle.  Important questions were raised as a result 
of Bill C-22.  It is notable that there has been a sort of second 
look based on the issues raised previously, for example, knowing 
how long this new centre would be able to retain the information 
it collects and whether there are issues in terms of the balance 
between the right to retain information or dispose of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another question was about when and how that information would 
be disposed of.  If an agency is created, for how long does it 
have a right to have that information and in which manner can it 
be disposed of?  If information is to be disclosed to law 
enforcement authorities, how should that be done?  Those issues 
needed to be more clearly spelled out and we certainly feel that 
the present legislation goes some distance to addressing those 
concerns put forward by witnesses and by different parties in the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, at this time we in the NDP are pleased to 
continue our support in principle.  We think it is an important 
bill.  It has obviously had strong support within the House.  It 
is always good to have a second look based on evidence from 
witnesses to make sure that the bill is fine tuned to address 
concerns put forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope as the debate continues that the government will pay 
attention to the concerns that are still being expressed.  It 
seems to me that there is strong general support but some areas 
still need to be looked at. 
<P><A NAME="LINK221"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to speak to the bill. 
This is a very important piece of legislation and I commend the 
previous speakers, including my colleague from the New Democratic 
Party.  It is interesting to note that many members have picked 
up on the fact that those in the other place have served a very 
useful purpose in reviewing the legislation and improving upon 
the legislation, as is often their wont. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should indicate at the outset that I will be splitting my time 
with the hon. member for Kings—Hants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-16 essentially deals with a response to concerns that 
were raised by the Senate banking committee.  Bill S-16 amends 
the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) Act and particularly 
focuses on areas of solicitor-client privilege, the disclosure of 
information and records retention.  This is, of course, 
information that is critical in tracing the origins and 
whereabouts of potential assets linked to criminal activity.  The 
money laundering that takes place in Canada is of great concern 
to our citizenry and certainly to our law enforcement community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Money laundering, as the Speaker would know, is a process by 
which criminals attempt to conceal profits earned from crime so 
that the money appears as if it comes from legitimate sources. 
When all traces of the money's criminal origins are erased, the 
money can safely be used to buy goods and services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is shocking to think that between $5 billion and $17 billion 
is laundered in Canada.  Of course it is difficult to accurately 
assess just how much because the proper authorities are not able 
to determine this amount, but it is estimated to be in that 
range. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1555"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT71"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were shortcomings in the original legislation which Bill 
S-16 attempts to correct.  Money that is laundered is often 
shifted among countries, financial institutions and investments 
without a paper trail so that it cannot be traced back to its 
origins.  With the advancing sophistication of technology, 
competent and sophisticated criminals are able to access and 
utilize these now boundless abilities to transfer money through 
cyberspace, leaving no tangible evidence as to its origins. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously much of this money is obtained by very nefarious means 
such as fraud or intimidation.  This is the type of money that is 
very often directly linked to criminal organizations in Canada 
and has been the focus of a number of pieces of legislation and 
the focus of considerable debate in recent months and years. 
Canada has come under heavy criticism in recent years for being a 
nation where criminal organizations are able quite easily to 
launder their proceeds of crime.  For that reason and that reason 
alone, it is incumbent upon us as elected officials and as part 
of the federal legislative branch to respond.  That is what this 
legislation is intended to do, to enhance the existing proceeds 
of crime legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The response last spring came in the form of government Bill 
C-22, the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) Act, which was 
passed.  Bill C-22 imposed new reporting and record keeping 
requirements and created the Financial Transactions and Reports 
Analysis Centre of Canada to receive and analyze 
information so there would be a focal point, a centre in Canada 
where those working in this location would be specifically tasked 
to assist law enforcement communities in locating and tracing 
proceeds of crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Concerns were expressed at that time about the bill by the 
privacy commissioner, the Canadian Bar Association and other 
groups that appeared before a parliamentary committee.  The 
Senate banking committee looked into the bill in June 2000 and, 
to be quite blunt, was not impressed.  The committee felt that 
the legislation was considerably flawed and had a number of 
shortcomings which it had hoped to remedy.  The government 
indicated at that time that it was unwilling to entertain 
amendments to the legislation because it was too late in June and 
the House of Commons had to deal with other bills and indicated 
that therefore the Senate might make changes in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Coming forward from that point in June 2000, we know that the 
Secretary of State for International Financial Institutions did 
give a written undertaking to the committee that certain changes 
would be contemplated and would occur in a new bill to be 
introduced in the fall.  Those changes formed the substance of 
Bill S-30 which was introduced in October.  Bill S-30 is 
identical to Bill S-16 which is currently before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Speaker and Canadians well know, the entire process in 
October was pre-empted by the legacy lust of the Prime Minister 
in his decision to put this piece of legislation and other very 
useful pieces of legislation aside and toss them in the dustbin 
in order to seize his political advantage and call an election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Beyond the changes that were agreed to in the letter from the 
secretary of state to the Senate banking committee, the bill was 
then reported with the observation that the government should 
consider other amendments.  Those amendments would include, 
first, further insurance that solicitor-client privilege would be 
protected by adding the phrase law office in any place in clause 
63 where the term dwelling house appears.  This simply expanded 
the physical premises that would attach under the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the government would hold the first review of the act 
after three years, not five years, with a five year review to be 
held after that.  This is essentially an opportunity in the first 
instance to look at the fallout from this legislation at an 
earlier date and assess the implications after three years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the government would require regulations under the act 
to be tabled before the committee in the House each year.  The 
Progressive Conservative Party is very supportive of all attempts 
to bring about transparency, both for the public and for 
parliament, and to access information that is rightfully to be 
placed before Canadians.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is important in the broader context of trying to rebuild 
lost confidence in the process and in this institution.  It is 
clear that the bill does not include all the changes recommended 
by the committee, but it goes a long way to improving the 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill will focus on the following legal issues.  The first is 
solicitor-client privilege, which is an attempt by individuals to 
prevent private information they share with a solicitor from 
being made public or in any way disclosed.  Bill C-22 only dealt 
with instances of solicitor-client privilege involving legal 
counsel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-16 clarifies that officials of the Financial Transactions 
and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada may not examine or copy 
documents subject to solicitor-client privilege where the 
documents are, and this is the important part, in the hands of 
someone else until a reasonable opportunity has been made for the 
person to contact legal counsel.  The bill would put in place a 
safeguard to allow an individual to speak to a lawyer before 
documents are seized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This responds to concerns raised by the Certified General 
Accountants Association of Canada.  Privacy is something we can 
never take lightly.  We must always strive to ensure individuals 
are protected in their privacy rights and in their business 
transactions.  However all that must be balanced with the 
recognition that there are those who rely upon nefarious means 
and complicated schemes to steal from others, rip people off and 
engage in blatant activities to take away a person's wealth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To that end a balance is struck in the legislation.  It contains 
safeguards and methods for review that allow for a weighing of 
evidence to determine whose interests are best being served. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-16 would allow individuals or the privacy commissioner to 
take the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of 
Canada to court if they are denied access to their files.  There 
is therefore a chance for judicial review if there is denial of 
access. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Next is disclosure of information.  Bill S-16 narrows the range 
of information that may be disclosed by the Financial 
Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada to the Canada 
Customs and Revenue Agency, the police, and citizenship and 
immigration officials. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After listing the types of documents that could be disclosed 
Bill C-22 gave the centre broad power to disclose any information 
so designated.  The amendment would replace that power with the 
power to disclose similar information relating to identification. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, there is record retention.  Records not disclosed by 
the centre are to be destroyed five years after they are received 
or collected.  Those which have been disclosed are to be 
destroyed eight years after they are received or collected. These 
are further safeguards.  It may be called fine tuning but it is 
important fine tuning nonetheless.  The sober second thought of 
the Senate has been usefully exercised here.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
credit my colleague from Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough for the 
comprehensive nature of his discourse.  There simply could be no 
questions after such a detailed and articulate speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is with pleasure today that I rise to speak to Bill S-16. 
The money laundering issue is of huge importance to Canada. 
Earlier today I spoke in the House on corporate governance 
issues.  It is extraordinarily important to put in place 
procedures, agencies and structures to deal with corporate 
governance and money laundering issues, issues which are 
increasingly global and are forcing governments to be vigilant if 
they wish to maintain international credibility.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The estimates of money laundering are difficult to get a handle 
on.  In Canada some estimates are as low as $5 billion per year 
and some are as high as $20 billion per year.  That variance 
alone speaks to the nature of the problem.  We do not know the 
full depth and breadth of the issue in Canada but we know we had 
better get a handle on it soon.  We hope this initiative will 
help us do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have spoken of previous incarnations of the legislation and of 
my concerns with them.  I still have not seen a commitment by the 
government to provide the resources to enable the agency to do 
its work.  I am very concerned about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, our justice 
critic, has spoken about the urgent situation of underfunding and 
the resource starved RCMP.  With the money laundering agency we 
could see the same types of issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Organized crime networks today use sophisticated technologies 
and have almost unlimited global resources.  We must provide the 
new agency the resources to be successful in the fight against 
money laundering.  I have significant concerns in that regard, 
particularly given the sophistication of financial instruments 
today.  There was a time when derivatives were considered 
sophisticated financial instruments but we have gone far beyond 
that.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>PROCEEDS OF CRIME (MONEY LAUNDERING) ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK226">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill S-16, an 
act to amend the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) Act, be 
read the second time and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK227"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have 
caused a stir with a couple of my remarks but I have never had 
that level of dramatic response.  It has been another great day 
for democracy and a moment in which I take great pleasure in 
having participated.  My time in the Senate was all too brief, I 
may add. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issues in Bill S-16 of critical importance to me and to our 
party pertain to whether the new agency has the resources 
necessary to deal with the increasing challenges and the great 
level of complexity in the nature of money laundering, the 
sophistication of financial instruments, and the almost unlimited 
resources of international organized crime.  We have to ensure 
that we do not simply create an agency with a tremendous level of 
responsibility but with very little resources to do what has to 
be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A bad job is one with lots of responsibility and no authority. I 
would suggest that to ask the agency to take on such a mammoth 
task and not provide it with the appropriate level of resources 
would be typical of what the government has done in a number of 
areas, but it would not be an appropriate way to proceed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A concern that I have had in the past and still have is the 
accountability of the agency, particularly in terms of the 
criteria required to meet the conditions that the agency share 
information with other agencies, for example, the Canada Customs 
and Revenue Agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be appropriate that any information attained by the 
Canada Customs and Revenue Agency indicating money laundering 
activity would be shared with the money laundering agency. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1620"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT76"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT76"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1620

<A HREF="#LINKT75"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That type of sharing of information back and forth could be 
constructive.  However I would be very concerned if, for 
instance, the individuals involved in the new money laundering 
agency were to identify no evidence of money laundering but some 
evidence of potential money laundering which could indicate some 
tax evasion or something similar.  I would be concerned if the 
agency were to share that information with Revenue Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I agree that we need a much stronger approach to money 
laundering, Canadians would not feel comfortable with a resulting 
beefed up Revenue Canada agency.  We have to be careful there are 
clear criteria and conditions that have to be met before it is 
deemed appropriate for the money laundering agency to share 
information with Canada Customs and Revenue Agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have another concern that the arm's length nature of these 
agencies tends in an institutional way to reduce the amount of 
accountability to parliament.  I understand some of the 
arguments, particularly from the government, in favour of 
achieving greater levels of flexibility for compensatory 
arrangements with the workers and offering a more flexible 
approach to provide these public services to arm's length 
agencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However much of this could be achieved within the context of 
more direct departmental agencies as opposed to these arm's 
length agencies.  I have a significant concern about what seems 
to be a secular decline in the level of accountability to 
parliament that the government seems to be very comfortable with. 
Again, these arm's length agencies are all part of that greater 
reduction in accountability to parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Progressive Conservative Party supports the legislation and 
the amendment which would improve accountability of the new 
agency.  The agency in the legislation is a step in the right 
direction.  Canada needs to do less following of what is 
happening in other countries and what our trading partners in the 
G-8 and OECD are doing.  We should try to be more proactive in 
leading on some of these issues whether it be on money laundering 
or in corporate governance issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It always seems that we are just a step slower than a lot of our 
international partners.  I would hope the government of a country 
like Canada, which in the past under the previous government was 
an international leader in many ways, would try to copy some of 
the initiatives of that previous government.  It has on other 
issues.  The government should provide some level of 
international leadership on some of these issues as opposed to 
being followers.  That is my wish in closing my remarks today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Before I call for the resumption of 
debate I address myself to the member for Kings—Hants who 
probably thinks that all this activity took place to assist him 
in marking his very special day, his birthday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would never make mention of a member's age, but I understand 
the member was what we might commonly refer to as a centennial 
year baby.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me point out to the House that when ship source pollution is 
detected in the marine environment, Transport Canada investigates 
in close co-operation with Environment Canada and the Canadian 
Coast Guard.  It is clear that industry supports the departments 
as they move toward a brand new Canada Shipping Act. This 
legislation shows that this government is committed to deliver a 
new statute that will benefit the marine sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have also heard an outline on the provisions of this bill, 
the compelling reasons for it and its many strengths.  Transport 
Canada is very proud of the consultative process that has made 
the legislation possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While industry for the most part spoke in favour of the proposed 
bill, several remained in opposition to the enforcement scheme. 
It is to this scheme that I would now like to focus members' 
attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-14 would establish a streamlined administrative 
enforcement scheme.  It would use modern, cost-effective means to 
secure compliance with regulatory requirements.  The Department 
of Transport is committed to work with its partner agencies to 
ensure a consistent application of the enforcement measures 
contained in this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The administrative penalty scheme would ensure that Transport 
Canada has a firm statistical base by which to assess the 
effectiveness of its regulations and help focus its enforcement 
activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Judicial fines have also been set at amounts high enough to 
deter unsafe and environmentally irresponsible practices.  These 
amounts reflect the potential harm that can result from these 
practices.  They would ensure that penalties would not be 
regarded as simply the cost of doing business. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is a conscious effort to hold those responsible for 
non-compliance liable for the consequences of their actions, 
including corporation heads.

behind a corporation. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>]

provide for a more efficient and less costly alternative to the

sanctions through the use of assurances of compliance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This system would be based on the successful program of 
administrative penalties developed in the Aeronautics Act, the 
Agriculture and Agri-Food Administrative Monetary Penalties Act, 
and the Competition Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This House will recall that during second reading some concerns 
were raised about the government's ability to protect Canada from 
foreign vessels that failed to comply with international 
standards.  I want to point out that in section 227 vessels that 
contravene international conventions relating to safety and the 
environment can be denied access to Canadian waters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now speak about Part 15 of the bill, which deals with 
amendments to the Shipping Conferences Exemption Act.  Part 15 of 
Bill C-14 contains several pro-competitive amendments.  These 
amendments would encourage greater competition within shipping 
conferences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments strike a balance between the interests of 
shippers and conference shipping lines and are the result of an 
extensive consultation period with all stakeholders.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Andy Burton (Skeena, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to rise today to speak to Bill C-14 on behalf of my 
party.  Bill C-14 is an act respecting shipping and navigation 
and to amend the Shipping Conferences Exemption Act, 1987 and 
other Acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the benefit of those Canadians watching television, I will 
summarize the purpose of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This quote is taken directly from the bill.  It states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This enactment overhauls and replaces the Canada Shipping Act, 
other than the portions that concern liability, with modernized 
legislation that will promote the safety and economic performance 
of the commercial marine industry as well as ensure the safety of 
those who use pleasure craft.  Key changes to the existing 
legislation include improvements to provisions to protect and 
support efficient crews, ensure passenger and vessel safety and 
protect the environment.  A new administrative penalties scheme 
provides an alternative means for dealing with certain 
contraventions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The enactment clarifies the marine responsibilities between the 
Department of Transport and the Department of Fisheries and 
Oceans.  The enactment organizes the contents, updates the 
terminology and streamlines substantive requirements to make the 
law much clearer and easier to understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The enactment amends the Shipping Conferences Exemption Act, 
1987 to inject greater competition within shipping conferences, 
to streamline the administration of the Act and to ensure that 
Canadian legislation covering international liner shipping 
conferences remains in harmony with that of Canada's major 
trading partners. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On this side of the House, we feel that these are all good and 
supportable directions for the legislation to take.  As the quote 
outlines, Bill C-14 is a significant piece of legislation.  I am 
told the departmental officials have worked on this for some time 
in an attempt to perfect it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the members in the House know the bill was originally 
introduced in the House as Bill C-35, which died on the order 
paper in the 36th parliament when the election was called.  Bill 
C-35 did not go so far as to include the Shipping Conferences 
Exemption Act amendments.  It only dealt with the regulatory 
changes affecting the industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill contains some 334 clauses and is just under 200 pages 
long.  I reiterate that obviously the department officials have 
worked on this for some time.  We would have appreciated more 
time to go through it in a little more detail and perhaps absorb 
it a little better, however we were not allowed that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-14 was introduced at first reading on March 1.  It went 
to second reading the following week and was sent to committee 
shortly thereafter.  As I said earlier, it was a very speedy process and 
I would have to wonder why. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee stage for this bill was a journey in itself.  We 
heard the departmental officials give testimony and briefings 
regarding the bill and heard from witnesses in the industry as 
well.  Some members may also have been visited by lobbyists from 
the shipping conferences exemption side of the bill urging 
support for the bill without amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of this happened in short order and the bill moved along the 
process quite smoothly until it came to the clause by clause 
examination. 
The opposition, and even some Liberal members of the committee, 
were not too impressed at the lack of organization by the 
department when presenting amendments.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We entertained 27 separate amendments at committee.  This may 
not seem excessive but when they are dumped on your lap at the 
beginning of a meeting it certainly is a handful.  We certainly 
did not appreciate such short notice nor did we appreciate not 
having the opportunity to review these amendments beforehand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As many members know, clause by clause can be a rather tedious 
venture at the best of times, but with many last minute 
amendments of a detailed nature to a bill which deals mainly with 
regulations, it makes the process all the more taxing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Up until that time, we thought highly of the officials for 
undertaking such a monumental task as to redraft such a large and 
detailed act.  However being so disorganized as to drop those 
changes in the committee's lap at the last minute 
suggested either that the bill was possibly not ready for the floor of 
the House when it was first introduced or the drafters of the 
bill did not take the time to check their work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Either way, as the government official put it, 27 minor 
amendments were put to committee and frustrated the entire 
process.  The amendments were so poorly written that the 
parliamentary secretary had to verbally amend an amendment on the 
fly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not acceptable.  For members of parliament to truly have 
input in the process of making laws in the country, we need to 
ensure that the process is properly seen to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are now at third reading where amendments can be made to the 
bill at hand.  We see today that there are no further amendments 
of the bill.  At least right now it appears that way. However I 
would not be surprised, if the process allowed for it, if we were 
presented with last minute amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the Speaker made a recent ruling preventing frivolous 
amendments, but I say to the hon. members in this Chamber today, 
does that mean that committee now becomes a mockery?  I hope not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This may be a phenomenon that only occurs with the transport 
department.  I do not know.  However I do know that I did not care 
for it and I do not think other members of the committee cared 
for it either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the bill, at present the official opposition 
supports the bill in its current form.  As I said earlier, we did 
have some concerns about the speed of the process, but overall 
the general direction of the bill is positive and it needed to be 
done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank you, Mr. Speaker, for allowing me the leeway to express 
my frustrations with the process.  I would urge the members 
opposite, and should departmental officials be watching today, 
that to have good law making in Canada we have to get down to the 
business of drafting both in committee and in the House and at 
report stage, to ensure that such abuses of the process which 
occurred in this committee no longer happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, overall we support the general direction and the 
long overdue overhaul of the legislation.  We have some real 
concerns over the need to fast track this lengthy bill and would 
have preferred more time to analyze it in detail.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mario Laframboise (Argenteuil—Papineau—Mirabel, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Bloc Quebecois will be supporting Bill C-14, because 
the development of the Canadian shipping industry should have 
been reviewed decades ago. This legislation has been long 
awaited by the public, shippers and receivers of goods and also 
part of the industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, we will never say it often enough, this bill should have 
been passed in the last parliament. It did not happen because 
the government called an election for no better reason than to 
please some politicians. 
Because of that early election, bills like Bill C-14 are once 
again before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Was the wait worth it? That is the big question that we and the 
people of Quebec and the rest of Canada who are listening should 
be asking ourselves. As I was saying, Bill C-14 was introduced in 
that last parliament but was not passed because the government 
called an early election. Did the government use the delay to go 
over the bill and ensure that the industry would be totally 
happy with the proposed changes to the Canada Shipping Act? I am 
afraid not.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a press release dated March 1, 2000, the Minister of 
Transport stated that this legislation, as introduced, was aimed 
at promoting the economic growth of the shipping industry. That 
is what the Minister of Transport said on March 1 regarding the 
introduction of Bill C-14. All those who are concerned about the 
future of shipping in Quebec and in Canada expected the 
government to seize the opportunity, being just a few months 
into its mandate, to introduce a stronger bill that would have 
really helped the shipping industry, as mentioned by the 
minister in his statement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I repeat that he said in that statement that the bill's intent 
was to promote the economic growth of the shipping industry. It 
so happens that the Bloc Quebecois had mentioned on several 
occasions that the only way to promote the economic growth of 
the shipping industry was to establish a real federal 
shipbuilding policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had no choice but to recognize that the bill that was 
introduced at the beginning of this parliament is a carbon copy 
of the previous one, except for some 27 amendments dealing 
mostly with periods, commas and legal technicalities. We sadly 
realized that the government had not taken this opportunity to 
establish, through this shipping bill, a true federal 
shipbuilding policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though the minister received a report in early April from 
the committee, the national partnership project committee on 
shipbuilding, he has still not announced what he plans to do 
about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Advantage could have been taken of it to introduce a real 
change, not just piecemeal amendments.  This was a new bill, 
even if it was drafted already for passage during the last 
parliament.  Since a committee was struck, as I have said, 
the national partnership committee on shipbuilding, which has 
submitted its report to the minister, we could have taken 
advantage of it as a good responsible government to introduce 
a whole new chapter on shipbuilding in Canada, but as hon. 
members will have realized, this was not done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois, and myself in particular, want to see the 
entire matter of shipbuilding revisited. 
As we speak, the shipyards are only at about 25% capacity.  In 
Quebec there is an obvious decline, when total job numbers are 
looked at, in Lévis, Île aux Coudres and Les Méchins, and the 
situation is the same everywhere, in Vancouver and in Halifax.  In the 
past it has given work to some 12,000 people, but as we speak 
the figure is scarcely 2,750. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is hard to understand.  We MPs wage battles for our 
constituents.  The Bloc Quebecois has fought for them on shipbuilding, 
on the number of jobs in this sector.  We began the 
battle.  The government struck an independent special committee, 
which was to produce a report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the bill that preceded Bill C-14 was introduced in the 
previous parliament, the government could argue that it could 
not add a chapter on shipbuilding because it was waiting for 
the committee to table its report. The committee has now 
submitted its report, but the minister has yet to decide what he 
will do with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to promote the industry's economic growth, it might 
have been very interesting, as the minister said, to add a whole 
new chapter on the recovery of Canada's shipbuilding industry. 
Why? Because the Canadian workforce is qualified and it costs 
less than that of most of our competitors. We have an edge on 
all the other countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The majority of Canadian shipyards use very modern equipment and 
advanced technology. Two of them hold ISO 9001 quality 
certification, while four have ISO 9002. Shipyard managers and 
other stakeholders in the marine industry feel that they were 
abandoned by the federal government at least ten years ago. They 
feel left out compared to other industries such as, to name but 
one, the aerospace industry. The shipbuilding industry deserved 
to be listened to in a serious and independent fashion.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With direct access to three oceans and to the world's longest 
inland waterway, shipbuilders and shipowners wonder why Canada 
chose to let their industry down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are issues that were raised by the Bloc Quebecois and 
that the government decided to deal with by setting up a special 
committee. However, it did not see fit to include a whole 
chapter in the new Bill C-14 to deal with the industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Shipping is the most economical means of transportation and the 
one that is most respectful of the environment. 
A number of shipyards are surviving at the present time because 
of provincial government intervention, although this is an area 
of federal jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talk about all kinds of jurisdictions. Today or 
yesterday the Prime Minister announced the creation of a task 
force on urban issues that will be travelling across Canada. That 
is an area of provincial jurisdiction, one that is the sole and 
exclusive jurisdiction of Quebec. The government should leave it 
to the provinces, but it is apparently very hard to understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec has tax measures, including a tax credit. Nova Scotia has 
a specific program of financial guarantees. British Columbia has 
encouraged the acceleration of its aluminum ferry program. 
Canada's shipbuilding industry is at a disadvantage compared to 
its Asian competitors, who receive government subsidies of up to 
30% of the amount of their contracts, the Europeans, who receive 
about 9%, and the Americans, who benefit from protectionist 
measures. Yet Canada has neither subsidies nor protectionist 
measures. We have missed the boat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to commend my colleague from the Bloc Quebecois, 
the hon. member for Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière, who 
introduced, on October 14, 1999, a private member's bill, Bill 
C-213, on shipbuilding. His bill was intended to promote 
shipbuilding in Canada and to enhance the competitive capacity of 
Canadian shipyards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously our fine Liberal government decided to not make this 
bill a votable item.  Still, I congratulate my colleague on his 
effort, because he had three very ingenious and significant ideas 
arising from the discussions he had with the industry. That is 
why there were three parts to his bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first part concerned the establishment of a program of loans 
and guarantees to indicate to the shipbuilding industry in Canada 
that there was a program providing that 87.5% of the amount of a 
loan for the purchase of a ship could be guaranteed by the 
federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was therefore, initially, a loan guarantee, and then a 
rate of interest comparable to that available for loans from 
financial institutions to large and financially strong 
corporations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would have been possible to provide a loan guarantee with 
competitive interest rates and a repayment schedule comparable to 
that offered by financial institutions to large corporations. 
The method of repayment would suit obligations and be appropriate 
for a business that could become very prosperous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second part concerned the exclusion of new vessels from the 
application of the lend lease regulations.  Because of their 
complexity, lend leases effectively eliminated the purchase of 
ships in Canada by lend lease.  The new lend leases include 
repayment conditions, which harm the industry. New ships were 
excluded from the lend lease regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third innovation was to establish a refundable tax credit. 
In 1997 the government of Quebec announced tax incentives to 
stimulate the shipping industry. These incentives were based on a 
tax credit. The Quebec government raised the refundable tax 
credit for shipbuilding from 40% to 50%. The federal government 
could have offered the same kind of tax credits to businesses in 
the shipbuilding industry to breathe new life into this industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It did not happen. Once again, the Liberal government missed a 
golden opportunity in a very interesting bill that was supposed 
to be a life saving measure for the shipping industry, according 
to the minister himself. I repeat that he said in a statement on 
March 1 that the bill's intent was to promote the economic growth 
of the shipping industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did he not heed the recommendations presented to him in 
April by the committee that he himself established? Why did he 
not take advantage of this new expertise and these new 
recommendations to include in the very interesting shipping bill 
a whole chapter on shipbuilding in Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would have solved the problem and would have given momentum 
to an industry which, I repeat, is only operating at 25% of its 
capacity today.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The present number of workers is 2,750. It used to be 
12,000.  These men and women, these Quebecers and Canadians, 
expect that when the time comes to bring in a bill the 
government will table one that they want. I repeat, we had one 
that was votable at the end of the last parliament, which was 
interrupted when the government decided to call an election to 
satisfy the wishes of certain politicians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the government again brings in an identical bill, when 
it would have had a great opportunity after being presented with 
a most interesting committee report to bring in a real bill that 
would have got the shipping industry back on its feet, with a 
whole chapter devoted to shipbuilding and to getting this 
important industry back on its feet, since it is operating at 
only 25% capacity.  We have the brains and the skills necessary, 
and we are capable of competing with all other industries in the 
world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again the Liberal government, the Government of Canada, has 
not listened to the recommendations by taxpayers, by 
representatives of the industry, and by the Bloc Quebecois.  The 
Bloc Quebecois has staunchly defended, not for partisan reasons 
but for human ones, the skilled men and women who are getting on 
in years but would still like to use their experience for this 
fine country. They cannot, because there is no work at this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has again missed a golden opportunity to include 
in this Bill C-14 a whole chapter on shipbuilding, which could 
have revived the industry in a number of our regions that are 
experiencing major blips.  We could have had an opportunity to 
revive this entire industrial sector, which involves a number of 
regions on the coasts of both Quebec and Canada.  This would have 
been an excellent opportunity, one once again missed out on by a 
government that is too arrogant, that governs alone without 
heeding good recommendations from those who are anxious to pass 
them on.

<P><A NAME="LINK236"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
want to say a few words on Bill C-14, the Canada Shipping Act and 
amendments to the Shipping Conferences Exemption Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the bill was tabled, the minister's press release stated 
that it would update, modernize and streamline Canada's marine 
law and that it would delineate new roles for the Department of 
Transport and the Department of Fisheries and Oceans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister also indicated that the bill would allow the entire 
marine community to operate in a manner that is safer, more 
efficient, environmentally sound and responsive to the needs of 
Canadians in a global community and a global economy.  These are 
laudable aims that we in this party can support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed amendments to the Shipping Conferences Exemption 
Act are purported to generally streamline the administration of 
the act and to promote greater competition in the marine shipping 
industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Shipping conferences of course are groupings of shipping lines 
that are essentially cartels.  The word cartel brings to mind 
OPEC, an organization dedicated to fixing the volume and price of 
oil on world markets.  Similarly, shipping conferences collude on 
prices and services and claim to prevent wild fluctuations in 
same as regards the marine shipment of goods.  The conferences 
claim that the benefit to our importers and exporters is 
stability in the shipping industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In general, most stakeholder witnesses at the transport 
committee felt that Bill C-14 was generally an improvement over 
the current situation.  However, just about every group of 
witnesses had one or two complaints about one clause or another. 
As an opposition critic and a layman in the field, one is faced 
with saying yea or nay to a complicated piece of legislation 
where the average witness says that he or she is in favour of 95% 
of the bill but that he or she is strongly opposed to clause x or 
y. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One major change that the bill brings in is to put all 
commercial vessels under the jurisdiction of the Department of 
Transport and all pleasure craft under the Department of 
Fisheries and Oceans. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1700"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT84"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT84"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1700

<A HREF="#LINKT83"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Department of Transport will now have to create an automated 
small vessel registry as small commercial vessels under 12 metres 
in length used to be handled by DFO.  One hopes that this will 
not result in a bureaucratic nightmare for small commercial 
vessels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One concern that has come up is that the boats are not always 
pleasure craft or commercial vessels, depending on usage.  In 
many rural areas of Canada, the family pleasure craft is 
sometimes rented out to say a sports fishing or outfitting 
company if there is a large increase in clients.  The vessel that 
met the pleasure craft standards yesterday may not meet the 
Department of Transport rules for commercial vessels tomorrow. 
This will preclude rural people from making a few extra dollars 
if the transport department rules are strongly enforced.  There 
are implications down the road for ordinary people that may not 
be evident at first glance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One witness asked the committee “What if a pleasure craft gets 
into an accident with a small water taxi?” Whose jurisdiction is 
it to straighten out that mess, the Department of Transport or 
DFO? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are millions of pleasure craft in Canada and this bill 
would allow the minister to make regulations on standards of 
construction and equipment carried on boats.  A number of 
witnesses expressed concern that the government may require 
pleasure craft to be upgraded in order to be licensed.  This 
could lead to financial hardship for many small boat owners, 
especially pleasure craft owners, whose boats were bought many 
years ago when standards were different or not as high as they 
are today.  Are we going to run into a situation that sees people 
being refused a licence unless considerable money is spent on a 
small boat? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am given to understand that federal legislation requires that 
a boat with an engine larger than 9.9 horsepower be licensed, and 
that includes many boats in Canada.  At present we have a paper 
only licensing system where a form is filled out that goes into a 
file cabinet and nowhere else.  If a boat is licensed, carries a 
number and gets lost or stolen, how do police trace it? At 
present they cannot look it up on their computers because the 
only copy of the licence is in a file cabinet in some government 
office halfway across the country.  As a result, thousands of 
small boats in the country are not licensed at all, and because 
the boat may be at a lake near a cottage, no one in authority 
really knows it exists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The solution of course is a computerized licensing system, but I 
wonder if the general public out there is ready or willing to get 
into a new bureaucratic system on boats that has been taken for 
granted for years.  I realize that boat traffic in some of the 
lakes and waterways in the mainland of Canada can be very dense 
during the summer months and tighter controls are necessary.  In 
rural Canada, however, such a new intrusion into peoples' lives 
may not be welcome.  My problem of course is that the bill raises 
more questions than it probably answers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-14 claims to be progressive in that enforcement 
mechanisms would allow for administrative penalties in 
addition to the usual court proceedings.  In theory, this would 
allow the minister to take action against lesser infractions 
without dragging someone into court and maybe giving him or her a 
criminal record.  That could be very good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in court one must be found guilty beyond a reasonable 
doubt and one has the protection of the charter of rights. In an 
administrative penalty, the onus on the minister to prove guilt 
is far less onerous.  Just about all the witnesses commented that 
they disagreed with the administrative penalties because one 
would not have full access to due process as one would have in a 
court of law.  I do not know if that is good or bad.  I guess we 
will have to wait and see. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the beginning of my remarks, I mentioned that the amendments 
to the Shipping Conferences Exemption Act were purported to 
encourage more competition in the shipping industry.  The 
exemption in the act's title refers to exemption from Canada's 
competition laws which would normally outlaw cartel activities. 
In particular, the Minister of Transport claimed that the bill 
would bring our legislation more in line with our American 
trading partners.  The shipping conferences generally agreed but 
people with goods to ship, the Canadian Shipping Council for 
instance, did not.  We will wait to see where that leads as well.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Shippers want to be able to enter into confidential contracts 
with individual shipping lines so as to get the lowest price for 
shipping their goods.  This bill would allow them to do so, but 
there is no clause requiring the owner of the ship to keep the 
details of such a contract secret from other shipowners in the 
conference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the United States a shipper can enter into such a 
confidential contract but in the U.S. the owners of the ship and 
the members of the conference are expressly forbidden to share 
the details of the contract with fellow conference members.  The 
change in our rules would be a step toward the 
American rules but falls a bit short of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The shippers wanted a dispute settling mechanism in the 
legislation but were also disappointed.  As well, they wanted a 
sunset clause ultimately phasing out the cartels over a number of 
years, and they lost that battle as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All told, the shipping conference legislation changes little 
that would help our exporters and importers.  The bill merely 
makes some administrative improvements to the status quo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am given to understand that changes to Canada's shipping laws 
have been in the works for many years and there have been 
extensive consultations with many stakeholders.  I am reluctant 
to vote against the bill if there has been that kind of wide 
consultation.  However, I have grave reservations about the 
implications for small pleasure and commercial vessels.  I fear 
that in due course the public may be in for more bureaucratic 
entanglements than they currently expect or want.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from May 2 consideration of the motion that 
Bill C-10, an act respecting the national marine conservation 
areas of Canada, be read the second time and referred to a 
committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK239"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Andy Burton (Skeena, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today to speak with great concern about the government's 
Bill C-10, an act respecting the national marine conservation 
areas of Canada.  Before I comment on the areas of the bill that 
I find quite concerning, I would like to make the following 
statement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that Canada's natural heritage should be protected and 
that it is our responsibility to ensure a viable environment is 
passed on to our children and our children's children in 
perpetuity.  However, I also believe that the very survival of 
many remote and coastal communities, particularly those in my 
riding in northern British Columbia, depend on natural resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>British Columbia has been blessed with beauty and an abundance 
of natural resources, many would say more than enough to go 
around.  Yes, we must protect our natural environment, but we 
must do so with the understanding that not all industry is 
harmful to the environment and that the economic sustainability 
of many coastal and remote communities hinges on their ability to 
extract or harvest those natural resources, be it fisheries, 
forestry, mining or drilling for fossil fuels.  This is a reality 
we cannot overlook. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members of the House undoubtedly know, the bill has had a 
rather difficult time making its way through parliament in the 
past.

</I></B></P><P align=left>An earlier form of the bill was introduced in the House of 
Commons during the 36th parliament as the then Bill C-48.  It was 
referred to the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage which 
heard evidence in February and March of 1999.  Bill C-48 then 
died on the order paper when parliament was prorogued. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It reappeared in the second session of the 36th parliament as 
Bill C-8.  It made its way as far as report stage.  Although it 
was amended slightly in committee, it too died on the order paper 
when parliament dissolved to the call of the October 2000 
election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-10 before us today is a reincarnation of both Bill C-48 
and Bill C-8, taking into account the 1999 amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would venture to suggest that a lack of broad public 
consultation is the reason for previous versions of the bill 
being dumped from the government's legislative agenda in the 
past.  I would say that it still needs much amending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do urge the government whip to allow her members to take a 
long hard look at the effects of the bill and allow their 
conscience to guide them in making much needed changes in 
committee and report stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this time I would like to shift my attention away from the 
scope of the bill and narrow in on what I believe are some key 
areas of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To begin, let us take a close look at the preamble, specifically 
lines 4 to 10 in the government's definition of precautionary 
principle.  The bill begins by stating: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whereas the Government of Canada is committed to adopting the 
precautionary principle in the conservation and management of the 
marine environment so that, where there are threats of 
environmental damage, lack of scientific certainty is not used as 
a reason for postponing preventive measures; 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. members in the House today and the viewers at home may 
not realize that Bill C-10 considerably expands the concept of 
the precautionary principle.  There is broad support for the 
wording of principle 15 of the 1991 Rio declaration on 
environment and development, which states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to protect the environment, the precautionary approach 
shall be widely applied by States according to their 
capabilities.  Where there are threats of serious or irreversible 
damage, lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a 
reason for postponing cost effective measures to prevent 
environmental degradation. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the House should be concerned that since the 
precautionary principle guides the government in its decision 
making process, this substantially expanded version allows the 
government to essentially create marine conservation areas 
wherever it pleases; the definition is that broad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By removing the words serious or irreversible when dealing with 
threat assessment, the government has carte blanche to decide 
what warrants a designation of a marine conservation area and 
what does not.  This is not in accordance with the Rio 
declaration that Canada signed on to and, as such, is not an 
appropriate definition of the precautionary principle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would urge members of the House to demand the amendment of the 
definition.  The precautionary principle is the guiding force 
determining what regions become marine conservation areas. It is 
not acceptable that this definition be expanded arbitrarily. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am concerned with a few other clauses of the bill, which I 
believe either need to be amended or entirely deleted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has said that the purpose of the bill is to 
establish the rules that will allow for the creation of national 
marine conservation areas to protect and conserve marine 
ecosystems that are representative of the 29 marine environments 
in Canada's coastal zones and the Great Lakes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unlike national parks, whose resources are fully protected, 
marine conservation areas are managed for sustainable use, except 
where forbidden by clause 13, which deals with the exploration 
and extraction of any and all mineral or other deposits within a 
marine conservation area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would allow for sustainable use within the marine 
conservation area, with a focus on recreation, tourism, education 
and research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently, federal-provincial agreements are either in place or 
under consideration for four parks, representing five of the 
twenty-nine marine regions.  The proposed Gwaii Haanas park on 
Queen Charlotte Shelf in the Hecate Strait marine regions is in 
my riding of Skeena.  This park could represent an area roughly 
equivalent to one-sixth of my total riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must say that there are those who believe the intent of the 
legislation is to forbid any form of development within marine 
conservation areas and, further, to go beyond protecting the 
original 29 marine regions the legislation was designed for and 
to create many more new marine conservation areas.  This is of 
grave concern to me and to many other Canadians. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1715"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT87"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT87"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1715
<A HREF="#LINKT88"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT86"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As is mentioned in the bill, these 29 marine conservation areas 
would be zoned for different uses.  Some may be zoned strictly 
for tourism, others for science, and there are many who believe 
most of these marine conservation areas would severely restrict 
any human activity, but more specifically industrial activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whatever the original intent of the bill may be, I would urge 
members to take specific notice of clause 13, which specifically 
forbids any mineral or inorganic resource extraction within all 
marine conservation areas.  Allow me to quote from the bill in 
clause 13 on page 9: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>No person shall explore for or exploit hydrocarbons, minerals, 
aggregates or any other inorganic matter within a marine 
conservation area. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the House to reflect on why the bill needs such a severely 
restricting, overarching clause affecting all marine conservation 
areas when it is supposed to be the intent of the bill to zone 
each area for specific usage, unless of course it is the 
government's intention to shut down those industries in Canada 
that rely on the extraction of such materials. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, I find it quite strange that members of parliament 
representing areas of Atlantic Canada would not strongly object 
to such a clause since some of them hail from a province like 
Newfoundland, where the famous Hibernia offshore drilling program 
has successfully and, may I say, in an environmental manner 
penetrated the ocean's floor, and its very existence is ensuring 
the lives and well-being of many Newfoundlanders and Atlantic 
Canadians.  Should such a bill and clause have been introduced 
prior to the Hibernia project and even prior to any exploration 
for that project, it possibly would never have been. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to press on in this vein a little further and say 
that the legislation could prevent any further exploration and 
development off the shores of Newfoundland.  For that matter, it 
could prevent such development off the shores of Canada, period, 
be it in our Atlantic, Arctic or Pacific oceans.  Of course many 
will say that is true only if those specific areas are designated 
as marine conservation areas.  That brings me to my next concern 
with the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask hon. members of the House to take note of clause 5 on page 
4.  Subclause 5(1) is most distressing and represents what is 
fundamentally wrong with the government.  It seriously undermines 
the effectiveness of elected representatives in the House.  I 
believe that once the members in the Chamber today hear what I 
will read from the bill they cannot help but understand that 
there need to be serious changes to the bill for it to be 
accepted in the Commons.  I will quote from subclause 5(1): 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Subject to section 7, for the purpose of establishing or 
enlarging a marine conservation area, consisting of submerged 
lands and waters within the internal waters, territorial sea or 
exclusive economic zone of Canada and any coastal lands or 
islands within Canada, the Governor in Council may, by order, 
amend Schedule 1 by adding the name and a description of the area 
or by altering the description of the area. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In plain English what this means is that the Prime Minister and 
his cabinet can decide out of the blue to create a marine 
conservation area in any member's riding or backyard.  Yes, the 
bill does recommend that the Minister of Canadian Heritage 
consult with those she or he deems to be affected people, but it 
does not guarantee that their opinions will be heard and agreed 
to.  It is conceivable, should parts of the St. Lawrence be 
considered a marine conservation area, that the government could 
restrict or reduce fishery catch levels for various species, or 
even shipping levels.  The heritage minister might even choose 
some of the most fertile fishing grounds on the east coast or, 
for that matter, the west coast, and deem them marine 
conservation areas.  There would be nothing we as elected members 
of parliament could do about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does the minister think this will sit with Canadians and 
more so with coastal communities whose very survival in many 
cases depends on the resources they can extract from the sea? The 
power the bill in this clause takes away from Canadians and their 
parliament and places in the hands of a very few insiders, 
cabinet members, is appalling.  I know my constituents will not 
stand for it and neither will I. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I implore members of the House to demand the amendment of the 
clause and to return the power of creation and enlargement of 
these marine conservation areas to the hands of parliament, where 
it will receive much reflection, consultation and thought.  We 
are accountable to our constituents and to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know my comments in the House today may seem strong and 
passionate, but when I read on to the end of clause 5 to 
subclause 5(3) my blood really boils.  There is no doubt that 
Canadians listening today should be outraged at the fact that 
cabinet is the sole body creating and enlarging marine 
conservation areas. 
However, it should incense them even more to learn that the body 
that creates these areas does not have the power to reduce or 
eliminate them.

<A HREF="#LINKT87"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me explain.  It is all right for the government to expedite 
the creation of these marine conservation areas and to wield the 
swift power of cabinet to that end, but to reduce or eliminate an 
area would take an act of parliament.  Allow me to read once 
again from the bill.  I would ask members to take note of 
subclause 5(3) on page 5: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>No amendment may be made by the Governor in Council to Schedule 1 
for the purpose of removing any portion of a marine conservation 
area. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course I agree that parliament should be the body deciding on 
whether or not a marine conservation area should be designated. 
However, what Canadians may not realize is that only the 
government can raise in the House an amendment to an act of 
parliament, meaning that it would have to be the will of the 
government of the day to amend or remove a marine conservation 
area.  It would not be up to individual members to do so. 
Although we as elected members would have the opportunity to 
debate such a bill, we could not make any changes on our own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also important to note that it is not uncommon for a bill 
to take up to one year to make its way through the House of 
Commons and its standing committee, to the Senate and then to 
receive royal assent.  Depending on the priority the government 
places on the bill, it could take even longer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that in reality the time a bill spends in the House of 
Commons or the Senate is controlled by the government.  It has 
been known to push bills through in weeks and it has also dragged 
its heels on some bills for years, not unlike what has happened 
to the history of this bill, I might add. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point I am trying to make is that the government does not 
need to abrogate its democratic responsibility by allowing clause 
5 to stand.  It already has the power to push bills into law and 
could create as many marine conservation areas as it likes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would urge the government to do the right thing and allow 
parliament its due evaluation, consultation and amendment of 
bills relating to specific marine conservation areas, not ram 
this omnibus piece of legislation through the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask members to support amendments to the legislation 
that would see the need for the government to introduce specific 
legislation for every marine conservation area it plans to 
designate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask members to support amendments to remove clause 13. 
As mentioned, that clause would eliminate the ability to ever 
extract resources from the marine conservation areas regardless 
of the environmental viability of any project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will leave you and my hon. colleagues with 
these final words of caution and conscience.  Members should ask 
themselves how their constituents would react if their fishing 
grounds were to become protected under the bill.  How would their 
constituents feel if their activities, those which, I might add, 
put food on their tables and clothes on their children's backs, 
could not be continued?  What if they were told they could not 
work or that the bill would drastically affect the future of 
their community?  I would venture to suggest members of 
parliament would want to consult widely, bring their concerns to 
the attention of the minister and have their day in the House to 
express those opinions and to convince their colleagues to 
support their endeavours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As this bill currently stands, hon. members will never have that 
opportunity.  That is wrong.  Therefore I move: 
<A NAME="LINK240">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the motion be amended by deleting all the words after the 
word “That” and substituting the following therefor:  Bill 
C-10, An Act respecting the national marine conservation areas of 
Canada, be not now read a second time but that the Order be 
discharged, the Bill withdrawn and the subject matter thereof 
referred to the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B>  The amendment is in 
order. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK241"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
listened very carefully to the speech by my colleague, the 
Canadian Alliance member. I might have ten or so questions to 
ask him as a result of his speech, but I will sum them up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He mentioned the precautionary principle. I believe it is quite 
normal for him to do so. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1725"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT88"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know what he means, as the Canadian Alliance 
critic in this matter, by precautionary principle with regard to 
the marine conservation areas? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At present, marine conservation areas cover endangered species 
and territories located in the provinces. Throughout his speech, 
I did not hear him refer to consultation with the provinces. The 
member made no mention of the involvement of provincial 
governments in the decision to create such areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my area of the Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean, we have the Saguenay—St. 
Lawrence Marine Park, which was created after consultation with 
the community, the province and the federal government. Based on 
that, the government did something really fine. I believe it is 
a model of what Canada and Quebec can do together. The member 
did not mention that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also said in his speech that no matter what the environmental 
sustainability of a project is, we must forge ahead. I have very 
serious reservations about this. He referred to the Rio 
convention and the precautionary principle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the first questions I would like to ask the member. If 
I still have the time, I would like to ask him some more. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Andy Burton:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for those questions.  I unfortunately cannot reply in the 
member's native language, but I will do the best I can in 
English. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will deal first with the provincial consultation aspects. 
Obviously if legislation such as this proceeds there is a role 
for the provinces.  I would suggest that it is a major role.  It 
is absolutely critical that the provinces be involved in the 
creation of any marine conservation areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am from British Columbia, the west coast of Canada.  I think 
the implications for the province of British Columbia are of 
great concern because of the potential for offshore oil and gas 
development, among other things.  The implications are not just 
for the offshore but for lakes, streams and so on.   Certainly 
there has to be a great deal of provincial consultation.  There 
is no question about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said right at the beginning, I have a great deal of concern 
about the environment.  We all respect the environment.  I come 
from a rural area.  I have lived in small town Canada all my 
life.  I hunt and fish.  I consider myself to be a basic 
environmentalist.  I enjoy the outdoors.  I respect the outdoors 
and the environment, as do all my colleagues in the Canadian 
Alliance.  It is extremely important that we continue to protect 
the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are saying is that we cannot allow this legislation to 
stand in the way of environmentally acceptable development.  That 
is my concern.  As I said earlier, especially in B.C. there is 
potential for offshore oil and gas development, for instance.  We 
cannot just shut that down.  The potential for the economy of 
Canada and British Columbia is huge.  Look at what it has done 
for Newfoundland.  Look at what it has done for the east coast. 
We have to take all of those things into consideration.  We need 
to have a balance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am no expert but the precautionary principle has been changed 
to some degree by taking out words around the phrase lack of 
scientific certainty.  The real statement reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage, lack 
of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason for 
postponing cost effective measures— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are saying that the removal of certain words from that 
principle creates a little different and much harsher aspect in 
the content of the bill.  That is what concerns us. Even if there 
was no real evidence something could be stopped on that basis 
rather than people saying that we should take a look at it and 
see if we can really do it in an environmentally friendly manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B>  We have less than a 
minute left for questions and comments.  Therefore I would like 
to see the clock as 5.30 p.m. and take the five minutes the next 
time it is before the House.   Is that agreed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed.

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this 
House, the Canadian government should lead efforts at the 
United Nations to lift the economic sanctions imposed upon 
Iraq since 1991, which have served only to inflict severe 
suffering on civilians, especially the most vulnerable 
members of the Iraqi population, namely the elderly, the 
sick and children. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Madam Speaker, it is with a sense of profound sadness 
and anger that I rise in my place in the House today to once 
again plead with our government, the Government of Canada, to 
finally show leadership and to call on the United Nations and on 
every other international forum for an end to the genocidal 
sanctions that have been imposed upon the people of Iraq for the 
last decade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot believe I am still standing in place today pleading 
with our government to act, over a year after a strong, powerful 
and eloquent report of a unanimous foreign affairs committee 
called on the Liberal government to do precisely what I am 
seeking today, to lift the economic sanctions that have had such 
a catastrophic impact on innocent human lives, innocent people in 
Iraq.  The sanctions certainly have not had an impact on Saddam 
Hussein, but over the course of the last decade, they have 
resulted in the death, according to UNICEF, of over half a 
million children under the age of five. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I travelled to Iraq back in January 2000 with a delegation from 
a group called Voices of Conscience, Objection de conscience. 
This is a group of very fine women and men, mainly from Quebec, 
who are artists, journalists, doctors and representatives of 
non-governmental organizations.  We travelled overland into 
Baghdad and then down into the southern part of Iraq. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For me it was a return visit because I had been to Iraq nine 
years previously, just before war broke out.  I visited in 
November 1990 leading a delegation that included Lloyd Axworthy, 
then foreign affairs critic for the Liberal Party, and a 
Conservative member of parliament named Bob Corbett. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The results of the imposition of that draconian sanctioned 
regime, as well as the massive and ongoing bombings that many 
Canadians do not even know are happening in Iraq today, were 
absolutely devastating both to the people and to the 
infrastructure of Iraq. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must never forget the appalling attack that took place in 
1991.  I will not call it a war because, as one of the United 
States generals said, it was like shooting fish in a barrel.  I 
believe there were over 100,000 Iraqi casualties of that attack. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prior to that attack, Iraq was one of the most advanced 
countries in the Middle East in economic, social and cultural 
rights. Iraq has the second largest oil reserves in the world 
after Saudi Arabia.  They belong to the people of Iraq.  They 
were nationalized in 1972.  Iraq had an extensive health care 
system, clean and abundant drinking water, sewage treatment 
plants, electric power generation plants, free education at all 
levels and a comprehensive network of social services.  The 
status of women in Iraq, a country in the Middle East in which 
too often women are still very much second class citizens, was 
one of the most advanced of any country in that region.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What our delegation witnessed on our return last year was the 
total collapse of Iraq's human and physical infrastructure, a 
nation that has experienced a shift from, as was described by the 
United Nations development program, relative affluence to massive 
poverty.  Unemployment is epidemic.  Inflation has skyrocketed. 
The average salary is about $5 U.S. a month.  There has been a 
dramatic increase in begging, prostitution and crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agriculture sector is in disarray, ravaged by hoof and mouth 
disease, screw-worm and the effects of major drought.  The once 
thriving and vibrant cultural sector has been another victim of 
this inhumane sanctions regime, as our delegation heard from the 
artists with whom we met. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we were in Baghdad we also met with the then United 
Nations humanitarian co-ordinator, Hans von Sponeck.  Hans von 
Sponeck, who was a distinguished public servant with the United 
Nations for many years, resigned shortly after we left.  He said 
that he could no longer participate in the administration of the 
inhumane sanctions regime.  In resigning in that way, he joined 
the former United Nations humanitarian co-ordinator, Dennis 
Halliday, and the former head of the United Nations World Food 
Program, Jutta Burghardt.  He pointed out in many speeches 
afterwards that, in his words, Iraq was truly a third world 
country once again.  He said, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have never been in a country where I have seen so many adults 
crying. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a recent speech, he quoted from a December 2000 UNICEF report 
that ranked the increase in Iraq's child mortality rates the 
highest among 188 countries in the world since 1991; a 160% surge 
as a result of a lack of medicine, malnutrition and waterborne 
diseases, such as dysentery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hans von Sponeck strongly opposes the sanctions and has called 
for the lifting of the sanctions.  He said that he wants it 
clearly underlined that does not mean he supports Saddam Hussein, 
which is certainly also the case for myself and members of the 
New Democratic Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While Saddam Hussein has an appalling track record of 
repression, including the gassing of Kurds in northern Iraq at 
Halabja, and should be held accountable before the international 
community for his crimes, we also need to understand that the 
impact of these genocidal sanctions means that those are who are 
directly responsible for imposing them are, in my view, also 
guilty of crimes against humanity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the former United States secretary of state, 
Madeleine Albright.  When she was asked in an interview whether 
the deaths of thousands and thousands of innocent Iraqi children 
were worth the price that was being paid to enforce these 
sanctions, she looked right into the camera and she said “yes, 
that is a price worth paying”.  That was a price worth paying, 
the death of those children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague for Vancouver East said, that is shameful and 
that is genocidal.  As Hans von Sponeck said “whether you die by 
bullets or by hunger and disease, you are still dead”.  Iraq in 
the last 10 years has suffered beyond any imaginable allowable 
limits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We often hear talk of Iraq as a rogue state.  The United States 
is seeking to justify its new star wars scheme, the national 
missile defence program, partly by suggesting that somehow Iraq, 
North Korea, Iran and others are rogue states. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to suggest that the true rogue state on the planet today 
in fact is the United States itself, which has shown such 
contempt for international law and for the standards of basic 
humanity in enforcing these profoundly immoral and illegal 
sanctions.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The United States, after all, is a country that has demonstrated 
contempt for international law in many different ways.  It has 
shown contempt for the environment by turning its back on the 
Kyoto accord.  It has shown contempt for the rights of children 
by being one of the only countries in the world, along with 
Somalia, that has refused to sign the international convention on 
the rights of the child.  It has shown contempt for international 
law by supporting the absolutely violent and appalling policies of 
the Israeli government in its attacks on the Palestinians and its 
illegal policy of occupation in settlements. Terrible violence is 
being directed against Palestinians.  It is the United States 
that has consistently been propping it up.  We can also look at 
the United States in the context of its support for the illegal 
sanctions against Cuba.  Once again, which state is the real 
rogue state in the world today?  We know which one it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current situation in Iraq is absolutely tragic.  The 
greatest burden of these sanctions is borne by the most 
vulnerable people in Iraqi society:  the children, the women, the 
disabled and the elderly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have mentioned, UNICEF has confirmed that infant mortality 
rates have skyrocketed since the imposition of these sanctions. 
Over half a million children have died as a result of the 
imposition of these sanctions and 4,500 children continue to die 
each month. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I met with doctors in Baghdad and Basra who, with tears in their 
eyes, spoke of their sense of helplessness and powerlessness in 
being unable to save the lives of more than 2% of the children in 
their care in the oncology wards.  They knew that many of those 
who survived would just return to hellish conditions of 
malnutrition and open sewage.  There was one nurse for 100 
children in a ward that we visited. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been an explosive rise in the incidence of endemic 
infections, such as cholera, typhoid and malaria, and major 
increases in measles, polio and tetanus.  Iraq has also seen a 
huge brain drain as a result of the sanctions.  The middle class 
has largely been destroyed and young people see no hope for their 
future.  We were told of Saturday auctions where proud Iraqi 
families are forced to sell off their family heirlooms and 
furniture simply to survive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I visited a pediatric clinic in Basra in the south.  The death 
toll there was particularly high and it was linked to the use by 
the allies of depleted uranium in bombing in the spring of 1991. 
As I have mentioned, the bombings continue even today in that 
region.  It is illegal.  The no fly zones have no legal basis 
whatsoever, yet the United States and the U.K. continue to bomb 
and innocent civilians continue to die as a result of that 
bombing.  Recently they bombed just outside Baghdad.  I was 
ashamed as a Canadian that our government was one of the only 
governments that was actually prepared to stand up and defend the 
United States and the United Kingdom in that illegal bombing. 
The bombing goes on and the impact of depleted uranium in terms 
of the congenital deformities, particularly in the south, has 
been terrible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also witnessed the results of what one Baghdad professor 
referred to as the intellectual genocide of Iraq. Virtually no 
funding is left for education as a result of the oil proceeds and 
so the system has collapsed.  They have no access to scientific 
and medical journals and no opportunities to attend professional 
conferences.  Parents give their children chalk to take to 
schools.  Our delegation brought in pencils and medical supplies 
as an act of silent defiance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about the oil for food program?  Well, it has not worked. 
In fact the so-called 661 committee, which enforces the program, 
has been harshly criticized by many commentators, including the 
secretary general of the United Nations who said just last 
November that he had serious concerns over the excessive number 
of holds that have been placed on applications and on sectors, 
such as electricity, water, sanitation and agriculture, that 
impact adversely on the poor state of nutrition in Iraq. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to say a word about nutrition.  Dr. Sheila Zurbrigg 
has documented eloquently the state of famine that has gripped 
Iraq today.  She pointed out that in recent statistics the trends 
in mortality are getting even worse and that the conditions are 
getting worse.   She also said that child malnutrition rates in 
the centre south part of the country do not appear to have 
improved and nutrition problems remain serious and widespread. 
Acute malnutrition is a huge problem and it is above 10%.  Many 
children are small for their age and visibly wasting away.  One 
in seven Iraqi children will die before the age of five.  It is 
absolutely unbelievable.  The agricultural sector, as the FAO has 
pointed out, is in crisis as well.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I have mentioned Dr. Sheila Zurbrigg.  I will also pay tribute 
to the many Canadians, individuals and organizations that have 
worked so tirelessly and with such commitment and dedication 
against these inhumane and genocidal sanctions.  These include 
the Canadian Network to End Sanctions on Iraq, the Nova Scotia 
Campaign to End Iraq Sanctions, End the Arms Race, Physicians for 
Global Survival Canada, Objection de conscience or Voices of 
Conscience, Project Ploughshares, Kawartha Ploughshares and many 
such groups across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I once again remind the House of the unanimous 
recommendation of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and 
International Trade that the government immediately work for the 
lifting of economic sanctions.  It is essential that the 
sanctions be lifted, that they be lifted now and that Canada show 
the leadership that makes it possible. 
<P><A NAME="LINK246"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Paradis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, while the government 
is sympathetic to the humanitarian objectives of the motion 
before the House, we cannot support the proposition that Canada 
seek the removal of U.N. sanctions on Iraq in the absence of 
Iraqi compliance with U.N. obligations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian policy toward Iraq has been motivated by the 
government's concern both for the humanitarian situation and for 
the security challenges Baghdad continues to pose for the region. 
This balanced approach must continue to guide our actions on the 
Iraq file. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not dispute the fact that sanctions have had a profound 
impact on the people of Iraq.  It is the prescription called for 
in the motion with which we disagree.  The call to lift sanctions 
is an appealing response to the situation, but it neglects not 
only the security risks of such a unilateral step but also the 
measures that have been and continue to be instituted with 
increasing success to minimize the civilian impact of the Iraq 
sanctions regime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The approach that Canada and the international community have 
brought to the design and implementation of the Iraq sanctions 
regime has been focussed, from the outset, on both the security 
and humanitarian dimensions of the problem.  While the 
international community has been justifiably determined to put an 
end to Iraqi weapons of mass destruction programs, equal 
attention has been paid to the need to mitigate the humanitarian 
impact of sanctions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Resolutions 661 and 687, which set up the sanctions regime after 
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and extended it following Kuwait's 
liberation, exempted food and medicine from the embargo. When, 
because of Iraqi obstruction, it became clear that Iraqi 
disarmament would take longer than the few weeks or months 
originally anticipated, the UN tried to establish an oil for food 
program which would enable Iraqi oil revenues to be used for 
humanitarian purposes. UN resolution 706 creating the oil for food 
program was passed in 1991. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For its own political reasons, the government of Iraq rejected 
UN resolution 706, delaying the implementation of an oil for food 
program for nearly five years.  The result was a catastrophic 
degradation of Iraqi society.  When the Government of Iraq 
relented in 1995-96 and finally accepted the oil for food 
program, it was already far too late to avert a collapse in Iraqi 
health and living standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However the oil for food program did help in ending the Iraqi 
decline and it was continually modified over the years in an 
effort to improve its effectiveness.

<A HREF="#LINKT93"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This effort culminated in December 1999 with the passage of UN 
Security Council resolution 1284, which brought even more 
sweeping changes to the humanitarian program in Iraq. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These changes included a lifting of the oil ceiling, which 
allowed Iraq to sell unlimited quantities of oil, and the 
development of pre-approved lists of items that would not need to 
be reviewed by the sanctions committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These so-called green lists have been expanded continually and 
now cover medical supplies, pharmaceuticals, agricultural 
equipment, educational materials, water and sanitation equipment, 
housing materials, oil spare parts and agricultural items, 
effectively lifting UN sanctions on these items. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, Iraq rejected resolution 1284 and has, where possible, 
blocked the implementation of a number of its key humanitarian 
provisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite Baghdad's efforts to weaken the program, there is little 
doubt that the impact of the oil for food program and the changes 
brought about by resolution 1284 are having a positive impact in 
Iraq, as UN secretary general Kofi Annan indicates in his report 
of March 2, 2001. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With funding for the humanitarian program at $5 billion to $7 billion 
every six months, the UN secretary general noted, “Iraq is in a 
position to address urgently the nutritional and health status of 
the children of Iraq”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether Iraq will in fact realize and make full use of its 
revenue potential to address the needs of its citizens, however, 
is an entirely different question.  It has already been mentioned 
here in the House that Saddam Hussein preferred building houses 
for himself to looking after the needs of the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Efforts by Baghdad to impose illegal surcharges on oil contracts 
slowed Iraqi exports through most of 2000, prompting the UN 
secretary general to worry in his report whether sufficient funds 
will be available to meet the humanitarian targets in Iraq. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, concern continues to grow regarding Baghdad's 
willingness to spend the humanitarian funds that are available 
in a timely manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, as of January 31, Iraq had contracted for only 21% 
of the medical items contained in the distribution list for the 
last phase of the program, which had expired at the beginning of 
December. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By March, the figure had climbed to only 48%.  Education sector 
contracts were less than 50% of the allocation, while oil spare 
parts contracts amounted to just over 10%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It appears that this lax attitude towards the program on the 
part of the government of Iraq will continue in the current 
phase, as Baghdad was more than two months late submitting the 
distribution list for phase nine, which began on December 6, 
2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result, by March 31, nearly three months later, there were 
no contract applications for health, electricity, water, 
sanitation, education or oil spare parts.  This is despite the 
fact that with around $3 billion currently sitting uncommitted 
in the escrow account in New York the financial resources for 
these items are clearly available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The money is there, and the Iraqi government is not using it. It 
is very clear that the international community has tried to 
mitigate the humanitarian impact of sanctions from the very 
beginning.  This process continues under the aegis of the United 
States, in an effort to better target the Iraq sanctions regime 
by easing the import of civilian goods into Iraq, while 
tightening the restrictions on military related items. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the details surrounding this effort are still being 
developed within the UN Security Council, the initiative appears 
consistent with the approach Canada has long advocated.  Canada 
will contribute what we can to this process to ensure that the 
security goals and humanitarian needs in Iraq are indeed 
addressed with equal vigilance and priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Better targeting of the Iraq sanctions regimes may seem an 
inadequate response for those who see a full lifting of sanctions 
as the only solution to the Iraq situation, but the fact remains 
that sanctions must continue to be applied in Iraq because the 
disarmament job is not complete. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the earliest days through eight years of UN inspections, 
Iraq offered far less than what Baghdad had pledged and the 
ceasefire arrangements demanded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obstruction, deception and outright lies were daily occurrences, 
as Iraq was trying to save key elements of its weapons programs.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The crucial question regarding disarmament efforts is, if Iraq, 
as it claims, has honoured its obligations and is not in fact 
rebuilding its weapon programs, as a number of recent reports 
have claimed, why is it not allowing arms inspectors to verify 
its statements on site? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lifting the sanctions now, while Iraq continues to fail to meet 
its obligations to the UN, would send a dangerous message on the 
weakness of the international system in the face of a ruthless 
and rebellious regime.  The international community cannot accept 
Iraq's intransigence and its refusal to comply with its 
obligations toward the UN. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is little doubt that left to itself Iraq would again 
constitute a serious threat to its neighbours and to the security 
of the entire Gulf region.  The country is run by one of the 
world's cruellest regimes, with a disastrous human rights record. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada is sympathetic to the objectives which 
underlie the motion.  While the international community has tried 
with increasing success to mitigate the worst effects of the 
sanctions and make their humanitarian provisions Saddam-proof, 
the Iraqi people have suffered too long.  Ultimately sanctions 
must be lifted but the option put forward in the motion is not 
the way. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unilateral actions are not the answer.  There is a process in 
place to achieve the common goal of removing sanctions and it 
begins and ends with Iraq's compliance with its international 
obligations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Security demands require that sanctions remain in place until 
Iraq meets its obligations, but this does not mean that the 
people of Iraq need to bear the full burden.  The instruments are 
in place to address the pressing needs of Iraq's civilian 
population, and efforts are underway to make them more effective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pressure must be brought to bear to force the Government of Iraq 
to both use the humanitarian tools that are available to their 
full potential and abandon its long established policy of 
sacrificing the well-being of its population to achieve its 
political and military objectives.  Baghdad can ensure the return 
to normality in Iraq by complying with its UN obligations, and 
Canada should do what it can to move Iraq in that direction. 
This motion, by rewarding Iraqi intransigence, does the opposite.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Madam Speaker, we have a great deal of sympathy 
for the people of Iraq and the issue is about the tragedy taking 
place there.  Our hearts go out to the people of that country who 
have been abused far too long by a thuggish, violent, illegal and 
brutal leader named Saddam Hussein.  This is all about Saddam 
Hussein.  It is not about the people of Iraq who have suffered 
far too long. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to the member for Burnaby—Douglas that while we have a 
great deal of sympathy for his motion it is naive.  It detracts 
from the issue which is about dealing with a violent thug called 
Saddam Hussein. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his speech the member for Burnaby—Douglas spent far more 
time bashing the United States than dealing with the thug Saddam 
Hussein.  He spent a good chunk of his time U.S.A. bashing and 
not enough time dealing with the major antagonist.  That says a 
lot about the member and where he is coming from on the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However let us talk about the issue at hand.  Saddam Hussein has 
caused the brutal deaths of thousands of his people through 
torture and summary execution by his own hand and the hands of 
others.  One and a half million Iraqi civilians have died since 
1991.  According to UNICEF, 600,000 of them were under five years 
of age.  Every month 4,500 children die.  Maternal mortality 
rates are up and have more than doubled since 1991.  Child 
malnourishment has increased by more than 300% since 1991. 
Hospitals, water and the education system are in disarray.  Why? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the hon. member from the government mentioned, Iraq can sell 
as much oil as it wants for food.  There are more than 660 things 
the government can do with no problems whatsoever.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>People need education, infrastructure development and 
humanitarian supplies in order to live.  Why are the conditions 
on the ground not improving?  They are not improving because 
Saddam Hussein is using his own people as pawns in a brutal 
political struggle.  He is prepared to kill his own people in an 
effort to break these sanctions and to rub the nose of the west 
in the ground.  Saddam Hussein is the rogue. He is the one who is 
brutalizing his own people and standing in the way of prosperity, 
peace and security for the people of Iraq. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to look at the situation in northern Iraq 
where there is a no fly zone, as there is in the south.  The no 
fly zone in the north was meant to protect the Kurds.  Why?  It 
was because Saddam Hussein murdered Kurds using chemical and 
biological weapons.  That says a lot about the person.  It says 
that we are dealing with an individual who is prepared, at a 
whim, to violate the basic norms of international respect and 
international law for his own end.  He is prepared to kill and 
murder his own people with brutal chemical and biological 
weapons.  We all saw pictures on television of what happened to 
those Kurds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Saddam Hussein is also trying to murder, and has murdered, the 
marsh Arabs in the south.  Those people have lived there for 
thousands of years and do not want to harm anybody but he has 
sent his people in with tanks.  He has murdered these people, 
destroyed their environment and has tried to drive them out of 
their homes.  Saddam Hussein is the one killing the Iraqi people, 
not the west, not the United Nations and not Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the hon. member for Burnaby—Douglas should be doing is 
using his efforts to tell the Iraqi regime that we will not 
tolerate that any more.  All that Saddam Hussein has to do is to 
allow the weapons inspectors to enter his country.  He only has 
to co-operate with the security council resolutions and the 
international community, and we would be happy to work with his 
people to improve their health and welfare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want the children of Iraq to be educated and the babies to be 
healthy.  We do not want to see the children of Iraq die from 
malnutrition.  It is Saddam Hussein who can change that, and 
change it overnight.  The power to improve the health and welfare 
of the Iraqi people rests in his hands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not confident, and I do not believe that anybody in the 
House is, that he will do that.  However, what would happen if 
we were to immediately drop those sanctions?  Can we trust Saddam 
Hussein to respect international law and to treat his people 
well?  The fact of the matter is that he is obstructing what is 
going on in his country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to note that Saddam Hussein, while his people 
are starving, has built over 42 palatial palaces for himself and 
his cronies with money that should have been used to feed and 
educate the children and improve the water supply.  Why is he not 
using the $3 billion that he held in a UN escrow account for 
water, agriculture and industrial production, as well as for 
improving the infrastructure in the country?  The facts speak for 
themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have imposed those sanctions with a heavy heart.  We do not 
want them to continue.  As Kofi Annan said, they are a temporary 
measure.  When the regime in Iraq complies with international law 
and allows UN inspectors to enter the country unfettered, and 
when it co-operates with the international community, we will 
co-operate too.  It is not only for the international community 
at large but also for the regional security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it that at the last Arab summit, and where better to find 
co-operation or sympathy for Saddam Hussein, Arab leaders gave 
only muted and lukewarm support to the lifting of sanctions?  The 
reason they did that was that they feared for their security.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The invasion of Kuwait by Iraq was a graphic example of how this 
individual is prepared to be a security threat in the Middle 
East.  Why is it that his fellow Arab leaders look upon him as a 
thug and a bully?  Do they embrace him?  No, they fear him 
because he is unpredictable, violent and willing to abuse people 
in his own backyard for his own political gain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is sad that he has been able to secure greater control in his 
country.  We would support other countries in supporting the 
opposition forces in Iraq.  Unfortunately his secret security 
forces have a greater control and a greater hammerlock on the 
people.  They pick people off the street who later disappear. 
They have been doing that for a very long time.  It is a reign of 
terror. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot imagine the tragedy that the people of Iraq have 
endured for so long.  To the people of Iraq we say that we want 
them to thrive, prosper and live in peace.  Their leader has to 
either change or he has to comply with the basic norms of 
international security.  We do this for the people of Iraq and 
for ourselves.  We do this for basic human rights and for peace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the member for Burnaby—Douglas can approach the issue in 
a pragmatic way to fulfil the basic needs and improve the health 
and welfare of the people of Iraq.  I hope he invests a lot more 
time in shooting his barrels off at Saddam Hussein than at the 
United States of America.

Madam Speaker, I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak to 
Motion No. 83 on behalf of my colleague from 
Cumberland—Colchester, the Conservative critic for foreign 
affairs who is on his own peace mission today in the Middle East 
accompanying the Minister of Foreign Affairs.  He is pursuing a 
very noble peace cause in his own right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sanctions were imposed on the Iraqi nation after Iraq 
unilaterally invaded Kuwait in 1990.  Canada played a leading 
role, even a decisive role, in ensuring that the response to 
Iraq's aggression occurred under the flag of the United Nations 
and not unilaterally.  The response of our allies came about in a 
very reasoned and well thought out fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The international community believed it was essential to impose 
sanctions as a means of keeping Iraq in check and to improve the 
lot of that nation by forcing the brutal and sadistic Saddam 
Hussein to stop his oppressions.  The United Nations action 
including the sanctions forced Iraq out of Kuwait.  The sanctions 
had a positive effect in that they curbed military and other 
aggressions that might very well have occurred. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The evidence suggests that the lot of the Iraqi people has not 
improved.  The real issue is the suffering of human beings. The 
situation among Iraq's people is tragic.  There is no denying 
that reality.  Poverty, malnutrition and depleted social services 
such as health care are leaving their indelible marks.  The 
situation is wretched and dismal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>UNICEF figures indicate that 4,500 children are dying every 
month from lack of food and decent health care.  Thousands of 
people, and some sources are putting the number at over one 
million, have died since these sanctions were put in place.  All 
this has occurred under the negligent and oppressive leadership 
or lack of leadership of Saddam Hussein. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>United Nations resolution No. 96 that deals specifically with 
food in exchange for oil allows between $1.5 billion and $2 
billion for food.  This fund is administered by the United 
Nations and the food package consists mostly of carbohydrates for 
the malnourished.  The program has made a difference but 
undeniably there is a long way to go to address other horrific 
conditions that exist for the people living in Iraq.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The United Nations sanctions committee can reject goods if it 
thinks something might be used for military purposes.  This is 
cause for concern because it is a contentious and sometimes grey 
area.  There is a military application for almost anything. Pipes 
for sewage could have scores of military uses.  It is therefore 
sometimes difficult to draw the line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bottom line is that sanctions may be keeping Iraq in check 
but they are also severely afflicting scores of innocent people, 
mostly children, who do not deserve to be punished for something 
for which they are not responsible.  There are severe 
implications for what is taking place.  It begs the obvious 
question:  Why should children be the scapegoats for a conflict 
between the international community and the pathological 
behaviour of Saddam Hussein? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Saddam Hussein's regime does the Iraqi people no favours in 
their struggle for survival and decent healthy living. 
Maintaining the people's basic needs is not the totalitarian 
regime's number one priority.  Saddam Hussein's own standard of 
living has certainly not suffered like that of his people, as was 
pointed out by the hon. member for Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The evidence suggests that Mr. Hussein's personal wealth has 
continued to escalate.  He has continued to build palaces, an 
absolutely horrific situation given the poverty and squalor of 
his own people who he is supposedly representing.  The regime is 
irreverent and defiant to the international community and to the 
pressures being brought to bear by countries like our own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to determine the true impact of the sanctions and, more 
important, the fate of the children.  We do not need to argue 
about how many angels can dance on the head of a pin.  This is 
not an academic exercise.  We must look at the facts and figures 
and the costs in terms of human life, costs which are often 
difficult to determine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bearing in mind the situation the Iraqi people are facing, it is 
clearly time to revisit the state and the nature of the economic 
and military sanctions being imposed on Iraq.  Is it possible to 
get good, sound reliable figures on how well the sanctions are 
working?  It probably is not.  However we should certainly be 
able to make a cost analysis of the toll they are taking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are the sanctions producing the desired result?  Are they 
accomplishing goals or meeting ends?  These are the questions the 
international community must ask persistently.  It must ask the 
questions openly and honestly with a mind to determining whether 
sanctions should continue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one in this Chamber or in any legislature can single-handedly 
answer these questions.  However, they must be addressed in a 
fair, open-minded and impartial way and they must be addressed 
soon.  If not, it will be the demise of the innocent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is admittedly not an easy situation.  It is difficult to 
dissect the issue and remove the variables that directly or 
indirectly hurt those innocent people.  We cannot sterilize the 
issue or look at it in a detached way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With economic sanctions, as with military sanctions, there are 
always innocent bystanders killed or left suffering.  The trick 
is to distinguish between economic and military sanctions so that 
sanctions which primarily hurt civilians can be lifted.  Any 
sanction, military or otherwise, can inflict collateral damage on 
a population.  That is occurring in Iraq, and the worst effects 
must be identified and dealt with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion says that the Canadian government should lead the 
efforts at the United Nations to lift the sanctions.  Canada has 
an amazing amount of credibility, trust and respect on the world 
stage.  We have an opportunity to intervene and get the ball 
rolling again.  What better country to raise the issue in a 
serious fashion and to effect results than Canada?

taking a leading role in opening this dialogue again.  It is 
paramount that in the short term we find the facts, delve into 
our ability to effect change and be a part of the action, not 
just to talk about it but to actually try to bring pressures to 
bear on those who can immediately impact on this decision.  The 
situation certainly needs to be addressed in the near future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to have had the opportunity to speak on this 
important motion.  I thank the member for Burnaby—Douglas for 
bringing it to the attention of the House and to all Canadians. 
Although I am not the critic in this area, I will certainly 
maintain an interest in the issue of sanctions and in the overall 
outcome that we hope the United Nations, with Canada playing a 
leading role, will embark on in the near future. 
<P><A NAME="LINK249"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
am pleased to rise in the House today to wholeheartedly support 
the motion brought forward by the member for Burnaby—Douglas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The work of the member for Burnaby—Douglas has been 
outstanding, not just on this issue but also in understanding and 
promoting international human rights.  He speaks with a great 
sense of hope for people in Canada who seek an alternative to 
Canada's foreign policy.  The member has been a beam of light for 
a lot of people in the work that he has undertaken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened with great sadness as he described his personal visit 
to Iraq and what he encountered while there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members in the House and Canadian enjoy the basic necessities of 
life, although there are people in this country who live in 
poverty.  However what is happening to the people of Iraq is 
something that is truly horrifying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened to the debate and was quite alarmed at what I heard. 
The member who spoke for the government side and the member who 
spoke for the Canadian Alliance were both members of the 
committee and, as we heard from the member for Burnaby—Douglas, 
were part of the unanimous report that came from that committee 
which sought to have these sanctions removed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It quite alarming that in a committee members can somehow find 
the courage and the reason to see the absolute horror and 
devastation of what has happened with the sanctions, yet on 
another day in the House somehow be in favour of them.  In fact 
the member for the Alliance characterized the motion as being 
naive.  I am quite surprised by that.  If we look at the impact 
of these sanctions, which have been in place for over a decade, 
on a civilian population, we see nothing less than the total 
destruction of a civil society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we followed the Alliance member's reasoning and logic, if we 
can call it a logic, then for the net result what would be 
success in the eyes of that member?  Would it be that every child 
has died?  Would it be that 50% of the population of children 
under five have died?  The logic of what is being presented is 
actually illogical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take issue with the fact that, as we have heard, the target of 
the sanctions is Saddam Hussein.  If that is so, then there has 
to be an agreement that the goal of those sanctions has been a 
failure.  Here we are 10 years later and the guy is still in 
power.  Meanwhile the civil society, the infrastructure, the 
hospitals, the health care, the water system and everything has 
been totally destroyed.  I would say to those who have been 
proponents of this kind of course of action and this kind of 
foreign policy that this has been an abject failure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my community of Vancouver East, and in Vancouver generally, I 
have received many letters and phone calls from individual 
constituents who have been horrified and outraged at the 
destruction these sanctions have caused the people of Iraq.

<A HREF="#LINKT99"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have personally attended rallies, vigils and meetings.  I know 
that some of the real activists in Vancouver, people like Linda 
Morgan who was very involved in organizing the delegation that 
went to Iraq last year, are very committed to an international 
campaign of solidarity with people from other countries to draw 
attention to what is taking place in this country.  As a Canadian 
member of parliament, I feel ashamed that our government has so 
blindly followed this sanction policy for so many years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be clear about what the motion before us today says.  It 
does not say that Canada should take unilateral action.  It does 
not say that Canada should just strike out on its own.  It says 
that the Canadian government should lead the efforts at the 
United Nations to lift economic sanctions.  There are many 
Canadians who would see that as a positive, hopeful and powerful 
role for the government to play rather than standing by and 
watching the devastation take place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened to the news the other day to hear what was going on, 
as we all do every day.  I made note that the Pope has now called 
for lifting of the sanctions.  I believe there is a growing 
consciousness globally that if this is what we have sunk to as an 
international community, if the lowest common denominator of 
foreign policy is to basically impose hunger, famine, lack of 
medical supplies, lack of education, lack of clean water and if 
this is what foreign policy has come to, then where are we in 
terms of an international community? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Canadians we should pause and reflect about our complicity 
in these sanctions.  I urge members on the government side, 
particularly those members who are part of the foreign affairs 
committee and who apparently supported the lifting of the 
sanctions, to think about what this government policy is doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that historically after a conflict or war there 
is often a period of reconciliation where the international 
community comes together to rebuild from the devastation of war. 
Yet in this situation not only was there a war that was horrific, 
and we could argue that another day in terms of what that was all 
about, but another war has unfolded, a war that has been even 
more devastating and that has been going on now for 10 years, 
which is the war of these sanctions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, I feel a sense of deep tragedy about what has taken 
place here.  I hope the motion today will help draw attention to 
the plight of the Iraqi people and to some of the very credible 
reports which have been produced by the international community 
such as UNICEF, Doctors Without Borders and many others who have 
witnessed firsthand what has happened and have given evidence to 
their witness of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another point I would like to make is that the member from the 
Canadian Alliance made an outrageous statement that the Arab 
summit was not in favour of lifting the sanctions, which was 
absolutely not the case.  That is totally false. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, the Amman Declaration of March 28, from the 13th Arab 
summit, clearly stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We call for lifting the sanctions on Iraq and for dealing with 
the humanitarian issues pertaining to Iraq, Kuwaiti and other 
prisoners of war according to the principles of our religion and 
national heritage. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, the Alliance member was clearly false in his 
assertion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I want to thank the member for Burnaby—Douglas for 
bringing forward this issue again; a sane idea, a saner policy 
for a humane world where we do not destroy a civil society 
because we are trying to get at one person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the members of this House will consider this motion and, 
like the local and national organizations who have worked so 
hard, put pressure on our Canadian government to convince it to 
be part of an effort to lift these sanctions.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend Robinson:</B>  Madam Speaker, in the final minutes 
of this debate I want to certainly thank my colleague, the member 
for Vancouver East, for once again eloquently speaking out for 
justice, for human rights, for the rights of the people of Iraq 
to live in dignity and in support of this motion for the lifting 
of sanctions.  I also want to thank my colleague from 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough for his very thoughtful comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must say that I am really quite shocked at the fact that not a 
single Liberal member of parliament was prepared to stand during 
the course of this debate and speak out in support of what 
Liberal members voted in favour of during the last parliament. 
The foreign affairs committee in that last parliament passed a 
motion unanimously with the support of every party, including the 
Alliance Party and the Liberals.  I see the parliamentary 
secretary here who was a member of that committee and voted in 
favour of this motion, as did the member for Esquimalt—Juan de 
Fuca.  The motion passed unanimously stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Notwithstanding the adoption of security council resolution 1284, 
the committee urgently pursue the delinking of economic from 
military sanctions with a view to rapidly lifting economic 
sanctions in order to significantly improve the humanitarian 
situation of the Iraqi people— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what the motion today calls for.  It is unbelievable 
that members who voted in favour of this principle in the last 
parliament now are condemning it.  How many more innocent Iraqi 
lives have been lost over the course of just the last year? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They say we have to maintain these economic sanctions because of 
concern about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.  They ignore 
the report that they signed on to.  In fact that report states 
very clearly, referring to a March 1999 report of the UN expert 
panel on disarmament “The bulk of Iraq's prescribed weapons 
programs have been eliminated—100% of verification may be an 
unattainable goal”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed the former lead United Nations weapons inspector, Scott 
Ritter, has emphatically declared that Iraq was qualitatively 
disarmed of weapons of mass destruction from 1991 to 1998.  Yet 
of course there was no lifting of sanctions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have no doubt that if the international community, with Canada 
leading in this, were to make it very clear to the Iraqi 
government that we were prepared to lift economic sanctions by a 
specific and firm date with international guarantees, Iraq would 
be prepared to allow the readmission of arms inspectors into that 
country and an assurance that any evidence of weapons that were 
being produced illegally would be dealt with and dealt with 
firmly.  However, that is not what is happening here today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to appeal to members once again to recognize the impact 
of this.  The fact is that we as Canadians are spending some $35 
million every year in enforcing these insane and genocidal 
sanctions.  We have spent over $1 billion since 1991 in this 
region.  I do not believe that Canadians who know of the impact 
of these sanctions on innocent human lives support this for one 
minute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dennis Halliday, the former United Nations humanitarian 
co-ordinator, in speaking of these sanctions said “We are 
destroying an entire society.  It is as simple and as terrifying 
as that”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He is right.  The purpose of this motion is to call for 
leadership.  It is a tragic coincidence that we are debating this 
motion on the eve of Mother's Day.  I recall so vividly meeting 
many Iraqi mothers who had lost children as a result of these 
sanctions.  I recall looking into the eyes of an Iraqi mother who 
pleaded with me “Why are you killing my innocent child?”  I 
could not answer that question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appeal on the eve of Mother's Day for the international 
community and Canada to show leadership to end the impact of 
these destructive and genocidal sanctions and ensure that no more 
children, no more innocent people in Iraq, die as a result of 
these sanctions.  That is my plea.  That was the unanimous plea 
of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International 
Trade in its report.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend Robinson (Burnaby—Douglas, NDP):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I rise on another very important subject, the subject of 
democracy and the growing assault by corporate powers on 
democracy in the context of NAFTA and the proposed FTAA 
agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On February 20 of this year I asked a question of the Minister 
for International Trade concerning Metalclad Corporation, which 
was at that time before the British Columbia supreme court 
defending its NAFTA right to run a toxic waste dump in Mexico, 
ignoring the health and environmental concerns of elected local 
and state governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked the Liberal government to 
intervene in this case and to speak out strongly against the 
impact of the chapter 11 investor state provision in NAFTA in 
these circumstances.  I held a press conference with CUPE and 
Greenpeace pointing out the impact of chapter 11, the investor 
state provision, on democracy itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case members of the small Mexican community of 
Guadalcazar said they did not want to allow a toxic waste dump in 
their community.  They had already seen the impact on their 
children and on the environment of the existing toxic waste 
facility there.  They said no and Metalclad under the investor 
state provisions of NAFTA sued the government of Mexico. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just a 
few days ago we learned that it had won before a secret tribunal 
and the B.C. supreme court just upheld the award of millions of 
dollars.  This is an outrage and an attack on democracy itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again I call on the Canadian government today to speak out 
clearly and strongly against an investor state provision in the 
FTAA.  The Minister for International Trade said he was opposed 
to it last year.  Now he says he is in favour of it.  He says it 
has worked well.  In fact it has not worked well at all in the 
case of MMT and Ethyl Corporation, in the suit by United Parcel 
Service against the public post office in Canada and in a number 
of other cases such as the Methanex case.  We as New Democrats 
say that this corporate attack on democracy has to stop. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More and more local councils are recognizing this as well.  The 
city of Ottawa just passed a motion calling on the Canadian 
government not to sign any trade deal that includes this kind of 
investor state provision.  The city of Vancouver was the first to 
do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am calling today on our government to show that leadership and 
make it very clear that we believe in democracy.  We still do not 
know the position of the Government of Canada.  It has not posted 
any position on investment on its website.  The text that was 
supposed to have been made public is still secret. We are still 
waiting for that text to be made public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ultimately, democracy, human rights and the environment must 
come ahead of corporate power and corporate profits.  There must 
be no chapter 11 investor state provision.  Metalclad made that 
very clear.  The people of Mexico, the people of Canada, the 
people of the Americas are saying no to this attack on democracy. 
I call today on the government to defend democracy itself.

to what he said.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member claims the Minister for International Trade said that 
he was opposed to an investment clause.  That is not correct. The 
minister and the Right Hon. Prime Minister have repeatedly said 
that given the full context of Canada's trade with the United 
States the clause works reasonably well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However the Government of Canada is actively seeking 
clarification with its NAFTA partners, specifically the Minister 
for International Trade with his counterpart ministers, to limit 
the interpretation some adjudicating bodies have given to chapter 
11 which expands its scope beyond the intention of the three 
partners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member says that the government has no position on 
investment.  The fact is we are still consulting with 
stakeholders.  We are anxious to see all the positions of the 
other countries.  We will not short circuit the process of 
consultation.  When the government is good and ready with its 
position it will be publicly announced to Canadians and available 
on the website. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the text to which the member refers, Canada submitted the 
text in French at Buenos Aires for translation.  We are awaiting 
the Portuguese text.  When all the translations are done and when 
the secretariat of the FTAA which is now in charge of it has the 
four texts, it will release them at once. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One would think the sky was falling to listen to the member for
