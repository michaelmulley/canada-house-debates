move that the fifth report of the Standing Committee on Foreign 
Affairs and International Trade, presented on Thursday, May 7, 
1998, be concurred in. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1015"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I rise today representing the constituents of Edmonton East to 
move concurrence in this motion.  As the sands of time run out on 
the 20th century they do too for Canada's World War II veterans 
who were captured and enslaved by Japan 57 years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Christmas Day in 1941, 2,000 soldiers surrendered to Japan 
beginning a 44 month tenure of a hell of inhumanity at the hands 
of the Japanese and at the feet of Emperor Hirohito.  Many barely 
survived, only to suffer lifelong misery from the effects of 
Japan's engineered slave labour camps.  These men were sentenced 
to pay with their lives and health by a Canadian government eager 
for a war posting and by an enemy, Japan, indifferent to 
humanitarian treatment and the Geneva convention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Japan went on to recover from its war injuries to prosper as an 
industrial giant, somewhat due to our veterans' efforts. Canada's 
Hong Kong enslavement veterans deserve an apology and some 
recompense.  It is fair.  It is right and the Liberals agree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of these very modern industries then employed slave labour 
treating the workers with brutality beyond contempt.  On the eve 
of the new millennium as we face the globalization of the 
international marketplace, Canada must take a leadership role in 
insisting that we Canadians are not simply purveyors of timber 
and oilfield technology.  Canadians also export our Constitution 
and Charter of Rights and Freedoms.  When the outside world sees 
our flag, the symbol of our nation, it feels warm in the solace 
that it stands for freedom and rights of all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our government could do well and reflect on this to act to 
redress wrongs committed years ago to our brave veterans. By 
example Canada could lead the way to show to other nations as 
Japan that their shame is our shame if we do not act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Japan's shame is well documented in all the nations of the world 
except Japan itself.  Revisionists and extinguishment of history 
may well suit the Japanese population as a whole but Canada 
should not participate.  Canada must not wait for Japan to act. 
Canada must reference Japan's shame, lead by example and act 
alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To acquiesce and support Hong Kong veterans in spirit but not in 
recompense as the Minister of Veterans Affairs wishes is to be an 
accomplice to the same and to share Emperor Akihito's 
bewilderment in the veterans' disdain and to share Hirohito's 
shame.  To be mute to the outrageous honouring of Hirohito's son 
Akihito for chivalry when our Hong Kong veterans still suffer 
from the ravages of enslavement is unconscionable and displays a 
government callousness that cries out for question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly the Government of Canada must achieve fiscal 
responsibility by a balanced budget and reduced taxes, but we 
have a duty to show Canadians that we care and will support their 
legitimate concerns.  We also have a duty to show to the world 
that we are not followers but rather a leader when recognition 
and recompense are appropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can and must act now to do right and provide compensation to 
our war veterans who were forced to endure slave labour at the 
hands of the Japanese and Hirohito.  We must not hesitate or skip 
one heartbeat in the conduct of our duty to Canada's veterans. 
Certainly we should claim costs from Japan but at a later date. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I will read a list of survivors' names to put a human face 
to this request and hopefully to add a sense of urgency as well. 
This list contains 361 names.  It is shorter than it was a week 
ago.  It will be shorter again a week from now.  I ask in the 
name of decency that I will not be in the House on this matter to 
read again a much shorter list next year and the year after.  I 
ask that you pick up the torch.  I ask that you not fail in the 
task lest we all forget.

Canada's Hong Kong war veterans for enslavement.  I want to 
recognize the human element of a well documented statistical

</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish now to conclude my tribute to the surviving veterans of 
Japan's evil enslavement with a call for support for compensation 
for Canada's Hong Kong veterans. 
<P><A NAME="LINK27"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George—Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am sure that everyone in the House can support 
this issue.  I hope the Liberal government will take those steps 
to ensure that our veterans who were enslaved in camps in Hong 
Kong during the war will be adequately recognized and 
compensated.  That compensation will be claimed from the country 
of Japan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the member if he could give us an explanation as to why 
Canada has not acted on this issue prior to now. Why does it take 
until 1998 for a government, whether current or previous, to act 
on this very important issue? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Goldring:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for 
the question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The history of this relates back to 1953 when there was a 
settlement made with a Japan that was broke.  With Japan's 
economy after the war it was felt that there was no money 
available for compensation.  The Canadian government on behalf of 
the Hong Kong veterans accepted a $1 a day settlement for 
enslaved labour by Japan, a buck a day settlement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the Hong Kong veterans are asking for is something that was 
a reasonable return for labour at that time, let alone slave 
labour.  They would like $18 a day, which would be reasonable. 
The $1 a day was totally unacceptable.  It was inappropriate. 
Japan, now the richest country on earth, uses that buck a day 
settlement as an excuse not to approach it again.  That is wrong. 
Canada now has an opportunity now to correct this wrong.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois—Salaberry, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
a brief comment to make, which is that the Bloc Quebecois would 
be totally in favour of this motion, particularly since, during 
the previous Parliament, the Bloc Quebecois introduced two 
motions in the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs in response 
to this request by the Hong Kong combatants and veterans for 
fair compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government opposed those two motions, or at least the first. 
Those motions afforded the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs 
the opportunity to hear some very moving testimony from the POWs 
themselves, or their survivors, who revealed all the details of 
the dreadful treatment accorded these prisoners, who were used 
as forced labour, and worked on airports and other things from 
which the Japanese and the Japanese government benefited. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What our party finds most distressing is the government's total 
lack of compassion and sympathy for these prisoners and their 
survivors. The government is hiding behind an international 
treaty, a peace agreement and legal opinions on this matter, 
which have never been presented to the Standing Committee on 
Foreign Affairs, despite demands from opposition parties 
including our own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is hard to understand why the Government of Canada is 
unwilling to demonstrate the requisite generosity toward these 
prisoners, as it did toward other prisoners and veterans.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We feel that the government should follow up on the 
recommendation in the report by the Standing Committee on 
Foreign Affairs and International Trade to pay each Hong Kong 
veteran fair compensation, particularly as this fair 
compensation has been estimated at about $23,000 per veteran and 
as there are only 200 to 400 of them left to receive it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, my question for my colleague in the Reform Party 
is this: Does he not think that this claim is justified and 
should be recognized, particularly as many other prisoners and 
veterans have had their right to fair compensation recognized? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Goldring:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the kind 
comments from my colleague. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do believe it is essential for Canada to step forward and give 
recognition to these honourable veterans.  It has been far too 
long.  Christmas day 1941 was the first day of their internment. 
It is now 58 years later and there are still questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this day of revising and changing history, we should step 
forward, do the right thing and provide compensation for these 
veterans.  We should give them this sign of respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I phoned Mr. Wilbert Lynch in Edmonton yesterday. He is now in 
the hospital and I wish to give him my regards right now.  There 
is a sense of urgency to give this sign of respect.

<A NAME="LINK34">&nbsp;</A>
<P><A NAME="LINK35"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Marcel Massé (for the Minister of Canadian Heritage)</B> moved that 
Bill C-29, an act to establish the Parks Canada Agency and to 
amend other Acts as a consequence, be read the third time 
and passed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK36"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mauril Bélanger (Ottawa—Vanier, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I take 
this opportunity to provide details on a bit of a debate that 
arose in connection with the deliberations of the committee on 
Bill C-29, an act to establish the Parks Canada agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I sit on this committee, I had an opportunity to be in on 
discussions and even, at one point, to introduce an amendment. 
I would like to speak about this amendment today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The aim of the amendment was to have the Official Languages Act, 
a cornerstone of public policy in this country on respect for 
linguistic duality, apply in its entirety to the bill 
establishing the Parks Canada agency.  I would first like to 
repeat the remarks I made in introducing the amendment in 
committee. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First off, I have to say I am no expert, that my area of 
expertise is not legislative drafting.  So, if changes are 
required to clarify thinking or the scope the committee wishes 
to give this amendment, if it agrees to it, naturally, I have no 
problem. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to say here that the intent of this amendment was to make 
it clear the Official Languages Act applied to the bill before 
us at the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, since I am no expert in drafting bills, I asked the 
government to simply follow the discussions and, if the proposed 
amendment were passed, ensure that it was improved, if 
necessary, to really define the scope of debate and accurately 
represent the committee's intent in the debate that preceded the 
vote on the amendment.  This was done.  That said, the debate 
took place May 12. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What was said in the debate is important.  Discussions in 
committee even raised the question of whether the person 
painting a fence, cutting the grass or collecting garbage had to 
do so in both official languages.  Absolutely not.  That was 
clear during the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were referring to services to the public and a majority of 
committee members felt that, if the agency were created, it 
could not be exempted from the obligation to provide services to 
the public in both official languages, even if it called on a 
third party or subcontractor to provide services that it would 
normally perform itself. These third parties or subcontractors 
would also, in the case of services to the public, provide these 
services in both official languages, in every province of the 
country. The issue was discussed and clearly understood. The 
amendment was passed by a majority of committee members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A little later, on May 20, the member for Saskatoon—Humboldt 
issued a press release which stated, and I quote: 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On May 12 the Liberal dominated House of Commons heritage 
committee voted in favour of including specific reference to the 
Official Languages Act in the new bill establishing the Parks 
Canada Agency. 
</UL>
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Saskatoon-Humboldt goes on in this vein, leading 
people to believe that the said amendment would have the exact 
opposite effect of what was sought, that is to demand that any 
subcontractor performing any type of work, including painting a 
fence—which is the example used by the member—do so in both 
official languages.

<A HREF="#LINKT8"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was absolutely not the committee's intention, and it does 
not in any way reflect the outcome of the debate. I cannot see 
how the member for Saskatoon—Humboldt could arrive at such a 
conclusion. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I felt disappointed that he did not praise the committee.  The 
party that he represents has always criticized the hegemony of 
government.  He used the term Liberal dominated House of Commons 
Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage.  It is interesting that 
in this case the amendment carried and was supported by the Bloc 
Quebecois, the NDP, the Tories and two of five Liberals.  It was 
not a Liberal dominated vote, yet he chose to present it that 
way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He chose to ignore the fact that members of the committee sat 
down, did some serious work and had a very thorough discussion on 
the concept of services to the public being offered in both 
official languages, whether by Parks Canada as a department or by 
Parks Canada as an agency.  That was the debate.  That was the 
intent.  That is what the committee wanted, yet he chose to say 
otherwise.  He chose to say that the committee was insisting that 
anybody who paints a fence must do it in both languages.  It is 
very disappointing to see such misrepresentation of the intent of 
the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said at the start that when the amendment was tabled there 
was an invitation given to the government to redraft it to 
reflect accurately the intent and the desire of the committee 
that services to the public be offered in both official 
languages.  That is what the government did.  That is the 
amendment that was tabled in this House, which I had the honour 
of supporting along with one of my colleagues, and that was the 
amendment that was carried. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The system worked.  The will of the committee eventually won the 
day and the government rallied, despite an opinion to the 
contrary.  It saw the advantages of putting in the bill a direct 
reference that the agency and subcontractors who offer services 
to the public would be subject to the Official Languages Act. 
This very much reflects a concern expressed to this House by the 
official languages commissioner in his most recent report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the last few years there has been a devolution in the 
general way of handling things.  They go to third parties, 
special agencies and so forth.  The official languages 
commissioner has rightfully demonstrated that there has been, 
without it being the objective necessarily, a fraying of the 
application of the Official Languages Act.  There has been some 
sort of an erosion of its application through this devolution.  A 
majority of members of the committee wanted to make sure that was 
not the case with the Parks Canada agency.  That is what was 
intended.  That is what the reformulated amendment does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would hope that instead of fearmongering, if not 
French-mongering, we would realize what the objective was.  It 
was strictly to make sure that Canadians from coast to coast 
could visit their national parks and expect to be served in 
either official language. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to congratulate the government for showing such 
flexibility. Various and even opposite views were expressed 
regarding the need for and appropriateness of such an amendment. 
It is because we debated these various views that we came up 
with a solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government endorsed the notion that we had to clearly 
indicate that we must not shirk one of our main responsibilities 
as a government, which is to provide services in the language of 
their choice to all Canadians who visit their national parks. It 
is as simple as that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must not resort to fearmongering with this issue, as some 
tried to do. 
This is very bad for everything we stand for in this country: 
respect for Canada's linguistic duality and the possibility for 
Quebeckers to visit parks in Alberta and get served in their 
language and, conversely, for Albertans to go to Quebec and get 
served in English, if it is their language. Such was the purpose 
of the amendment, and I am very disappointed by the attitude of 
some members opposite who tried to make a big deal out of this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wanted to take a few minutes to assure all those who contacted 
me that there was no intention other than to respect a 
fundamental principle in our country, that of our linguistic 
duality and the implementation of the Official Languages Act 
when a Canadian visits a national park in a province other than 
the one in which he or she lives.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Nice try, but it is 
not a point of order.  We will resume the debate. 
<P><A NAME="LINK37"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon—Humboldt, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to have the opportunity to rise in the House today 
to participate in the third reading debate on Bill C-29.  This 
bill seeks to establish a new parks agency responsible for the 
administration and protection of our national parks, national 
historic sites and other heritage areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the House knows, the responsibility for national parks 
presently lies with the Department of Canadian Heritage.  Bill 
C-29 would transfer that responsibility from the heritage 
department to a new body that would operate at arm's length from 
the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new agency will still be accountable to parliament through 
the appropriate minister.  As well, accountability will be 
ensured since the new agency will be subject to the Access to 
Information Act and the auditor general will be able to report on 
the agency's activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill, as it was originally drafted, ensured that the chief 
executive officer of the agency would undertake consultations at 
least every two years.  It committed the CEO to hold public 
forums and to invite interested parties to participate.  However, 
the Liberal government has removed that provision and placed 
those consultations at the discretion of the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, reference to public forums has been removed from the 
bill and in its place the minister will convene a round table of 
persons.  There is no commitment to making these discussions 
public nor to making the minister's responses to the round table 
public.  This is a step backwards in the bill since it leaves the 
public on the sidelines and consolidates more power in the hands 
of cabinet.  That is something that we should be moving away 
from, not entrenching further. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There seems to be a movement within this government to diminish 
the role of parliament and to move decision making into cabinet 
and rule by regulation.  I think this is a disturbing trend.  It 
leaves many members of the House feeling powerless and 
ineffective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nevertheless, I am pleased to note that members of the heritage 
committee did at times work well together on this bill and some 
sensible amendments were the result.  First of all, the name of 
the agency was changed to the Parks Canada Agency.  Many 
witnesses who appeared before the committee expressed a concern 
that the Parks Canada brand name was going to be lost.  It is a 
name that has international recognition.  There was also a 
concern about costs if Parks Canada signage needed to be changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Accordingly, I introduced an amendment at committee stage to 
have the new agency renamed the Parks Canada Agency.  Other 
members of the committee could see the sense in that, so the 
amendment carried.  It was unusual, but the Secretary of State 
for Parks testified against the name change, saying that it was 
unnecessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was pleased that the committee members were not swayed by his 
arguments and opted to maintain the Parks Canada name.  Indeed, a 
great many amendments were moved at committee stage which I 
believe reflected the keen interest each member had in producing 
a good bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, one part of the bill is drafted very poorly.  It 
is in fact redundant.  I refer to clause 36 which refers to the 
application of the Official Languages Act. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1140"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT11"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT11"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1140

<A HREF="#LINKT10"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To paraphrase, clause 36 now states that the Official Languages 
Act will apply to the new agency, since the agency is a federal 
institution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is wrong with that?  The Official Languages Act applies to 
all federal institutions anyway, so there is no need to spell it 
out in the bill.  Why is it there?  It is a smoke and mirrors 
clause to cover the tracks of the justice minister and the member 
for Ottawa—Vanier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At committee stage the member proposed an amendment, which 
passed, that would force the application of the Official 
Languages Act on subcontractors working in national parks.  Make 
no mistake about it, despite his denials to the contrary, the 
intent and the objective of his amendment was obvious.  He 
completely went against the advice and instructions not only of 
his own justice minister, but of justice officials who were 
present at the committee meeting.  They told him in no uncertain 
terms that the Official Languages Act would apply because it is a 
federal agency and that by writing it specifically into the bill 
with specific reference to subcontractors was unprecedented and 
would result in the criticism that followed, that being that 
people who were never before subjected to the requirement of 
being fluently bilingual would be.  Painters and garbage 
collectors were the examples that were used in committee that 
day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was also discussing whether it was a Liberal dominated 
committee.  In fact it is.  I invite anyone to look back at the 
record to see how the voting went.  As far as I know, I am the 
only person who voted against the amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, if what he was saying was so benign and innocent, 
why did the Liberal officials take him behind closed doors, force 
him to withdraw the amendment and replace it with this new 
amendment?  They were obviously admitting that they were making a 
mistake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mauril Bélanger:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  The hon. member opposite has just said that I was forced 
to do something and that is totally inaccurate and misleading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  That is a point of 
debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Pankiw:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the point I was making is 
that if the intent of his motion was not as it obviously was, 
then there would have been no need for him to have risen in the 
House today to say that he was standing to reassure members that 
that was not his intention, when in fact it was, and that should 
be obvious to everybody. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At committee stage the amendment passed.  It would have resulted 
in the requirement that fence painters and garbage collectors, 
which were the examples used in committee, would have to be 
fluently bilingual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, the justice minister told the member for 
Ottawa—Vanier not to do it and justice officials told the member 
not to do it.  What happened?  He did it.  As a result the 
justice minister looks bad and it is the fault of the member for 
Ottawa—Vanier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To get out of this jam and to avoid a major political 
embarrassment for the justice minister and for the member for 
Ottawa—Vanier, the government brought in this vacuous political 
amendment, which is clause 36.1.  The wording of this clause is 
lifted straight out of the Official Languages Act.  The clause 
does nothing to the bill except clutter it.  It is trite law.  It 
brings redundant and unnecessary language into the bill.  It is 
poor legislative draftsmanship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals do not seem to mind.  They would rather pass a 
poorly drafted bill than simply admit that they made a mistake 
and delete the offensive clause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My amendment to delete that clause was voted down by the 
government last night at report stage.  Hopefully when Bill C-29 
is reviewed by the Senate it will recognize that clause 36.1 is 
unnecessary and delete it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I think we can all acknowledge that the chance of that 
happening is remote indeed because, as we know, the Senate is 
ineffective and useless.  This is a prime example of why we 
should have an effective and elected Senate because, in cases 
where a Liberal dominated government puts forward redundant, 
meaningless legislation, it could be corrected.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Aside from the bill itself which simply establishes the 
framework for the new organization, I have some concerns about 
how Parks Canada is currently being run. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have reports printed by the <I>Globe and Mail</I> that memos 
within Parks Canada instructed staff to mislead the public with 
respect to developments at Lake Louise.  The same article says 
Parks Canada will undertake public consultations only after final 
decisions have been made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked the secretary of state about these memos at committee 
but he did not really answer my questions.  I asked him to table 
these memos but he suggested I get them from the media. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find the contents of these memos, if described accurately by 
the <I>Globe and Mail</I>, to be quite disturbing.  My concern is 
that no Canadian would want Parks Canada to operate in a manner 
suggested by these leaked memos.  I am concerned that this method 
of operation may be standard practice at Parks Canada but that 
this time it was caught. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the new agency operate differently or is this method of 
operation too deeply ingrained and impossible to root out?  Only 
time will tell, but I certainly hope these leaked documents are 
not indicative of how the new agency will deal with the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agency will also have its plate full with respect to parks 
issues.  There is of course the development at Lake Louise and 
the contents of these memos.  As well, near Jasper a debate is 
raging concerning the Cheviot coal mine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has found itself in court over this 
project as environmental groups argue that the full impact the 
mine will have on the environment has not been completely 
examined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, the agency will have to deal with the ramifications 
surrounding the boundaries of Tuktut Nogait national park. There 
has been some debate over a mineral find that extends across the 
western boundary of the proposed park.  While the Inuvialuit want 
the boundary changed to permit exploration of the minerals the 
federal government refuses to review the matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Considering the government's stubborn position, the new agency 
will definitely have trouble improving relations between itself 
and the Inuvialuit in the Northwest Territories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agency will be working toward the creation of 15 new 
national parks by the year 2000.  This is a monumental task 
considering the cutbacks that Parks Canada has had to face.  I 
hope this goal does not make it revenue hungry and force it to 
hike fees and service charges unnecessarily. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Aside from the concerns I have mentioned I believe the creation 
of a parks agency is a good idea.  It should allow national parks 
to operate more efficiently since the agency will be able to 
raise and keep its own revenues.  As well, it will allow the use 
of third parties to administer certain facilities and the agency 
will have access to a new $10 million parks and heritage sites 
account.  This account will provide funds for the agency in times 
when particular opportunities arise to purchase land, expand a 
park, et cetera.  Furthermore, funds from this account are 
repayable to the crown with interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new agency structure provides much needed flexibility.  I 
believe the new agency will ensure our national parks and 
heritage sites are administered in an accountable, efficient and 
cost effective manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Policy issues concerning our national parks are another matter 
which I know we all take an interest in.  However, this bill 
simply creates a framework for the new parks agency and I support 
that framework.  I hope other members can also see their way to 
supporting this new organizational structure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  A short time ago I asked for unanimous consent to present 
my repeal of Bill C-68 petitions.  I am wondering if I could 
present them at this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Is there unanimous 
consent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski—Mitis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, we are 
debating today at third reading Bill C-29 introduced by the 
Minister of Canadian Heritage, the short title of which was 
National Parks Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say “was” because, faced with the unanimity of those who 
testified before the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage and 
of the committee members themselves, the secretary of state 
responsible for Parks Canada finally bowed to the evidence and 
accepted the amendment passed by the committee suggesting that 
the title of the bill be changed to an “act to establish the 
Parks Canada Agency and to amend other acts as a consequence”. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1150"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT13"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT13"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1150

<A HREF="#LINKT12"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 1 of this bill sets out the short title of the act as 
follows: “Parks Canada Act”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After holding public hearings in which a number of witnesses 
raised objections to this bill, questioning Heritage Canada and 
justice officials to get a different perspective on how to 
interpret certain clauses and to address the objections raised, 
and asking the secretary of state responsible for Parks Canada 
about the government's objectives in establishing this agency, 
the committee proceeded to the clause by clause study of the 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to take into account all the work done by committee 
members, we then set out to examine the merits of several 
amendments proposed by the various parties. 
To this end, at report stage, we used a working paper made 
available to the House of Commons. This was an updated version 
of Bill C-29, reprinted as amended by the standing committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With few exceptions, the amendments in question are mainly 
changes of a technical nature or designed to ensure the text 
said the same thing in both official languages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the additions, they fit for the most part into three 
categories. First, additions to clarify a clause to facilitate 
the interpretation of the act. A fine example of this type of 
addition can be found at clause 5.1, which clarifies the status 
of the direction referred to in clauses 4 and 5 of the original 
bill. 
It reads as follows “A direction by the Minister referred to in 
sections 4 and 5 is not a statutory instrument for the purposes 
of the Statutory Instruments Act”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A second type of addition is for the purpose of improving the 
bill.  There are several examples of these, including clause 21, 
which calls for the creation of a new parks and historic sites 
account.  There was an addition to subsection 3(c), the 
possibility that this account could be used, not only to 
maintain and develop, but also to “restore any national park, 
national historic site or other protected heritage area that has 
not yet attained full operational status”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In clause 32, ecological integrity has been added. 
A significant addition was made to clause 33, to enhance the 
transparency of the agency's administration.  It calls for the 
chief executive officer to submit a corporate plan for the 
agency before March 31 of each year, and that 30 days after its 
approval by Treasury Board, the Minister must table a summary of 
the plan in each house of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To this was added, and I quote “at which time the plan shall be 
made available to the public on request”. This phrase was added 
to the bill at the request of a number of witnesses who wished 
to have access to this type of document. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another significant addition was to clause 36.1, which reflects 
an amendment adopted by the Standing Committee on Canadian 
Heritage, and reads as follows “The Official Languages Act 
applies to the Agency and to its subcontractors”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This addition was to initiate lengthy discussions between 
representatives of the Department of Justice and the committee 
members.  We also debated it here at the report stage, when a 
member of the government, the hon. member for Brossard—La 
Prairie, asked for withdrawal of the amendment to clause 36.1 
passed by the committee, and its replacement with another 
amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new clause 36.1 ought therefore to read as follows “For 
greater certainty, the Official Languages Act applies to the 
agency and the agency has the duty, under section 25 of that 
Act, to ensure that, where services are provided or made 
available by another person or organization on its behalf, any 
member of the public in Canada or elsewhere can communicate with 
and obtain those services from that person or organization in 
either official language, in any case where those services, if 
provided by the agency, would be required under part IV of the 
Official Languages Act to be provided in either official 
language”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I followed with interest the presentation made earlier by my 
colleague from Ottawa—Vanier. I remember the remarks made by 
Reform members, including the chief opposition whip, who, 
offended, rose in this House to accuse the Bloc Quebecois of 
having only French on the doors of its offices to indicate the 
offices of its party leader, its House leader and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I walked through the corridors, I realized that those living 
in glass houses should not throw stones, because they risk 
having them thrown back.  Members should know that, if they go 
to hallway C on the sixth floor of the Centre Block, they will 
find a sign saying “Deputy Whip of the Official Opposition” in 
English only on the whip's door. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A third way to change the law and add details to it is to amend 
the laws affected by the passage of a bill.  In the case in 
point, Bill C-29 amends the Saguenay-St. Lawrence Marine Park Act, 
among others, by amending the definitions of “park warden” and 
“superintendent” to align them with those in this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the amendments we introduced were rejected either by the 
committee or by the government majority.  Although creation of 
the agency offers certain benefits, it also raises concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has shown us for the past five years its 
strong tendency to pass its problems on to others.  Sometimes it 
sends them to the provinces.  Sometimes it gets around them by 
creating new agencies and requiring them to be more 
cost effective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why we wanted to make sure that the Parks Canada Agency 
struck a balance between its priority mission and its concern to 
be cost effective.  Our amendment read as follows, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When implementing policies of the Government of Canada, the 
Agency's priority shall be the conservation and the ecological, 
historic and cultural integrity of national parks, national 
historic sites and other protected heritage areas, and it shall 
reconcile this priority with the development of tourism and 
commercial activities. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to say we have a real concern.  We all know about the 
lure of money. 
If the government does not maintain parliamentary appropriations 
at an adequate level so the agency has the means to fulfil its 
mandate, the agency will have to find a way to do so at any 
cost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why an amendment such as the one we proposed could have 
been useful for the agency. Indeed, it could have used it to 
present its case to the Treasury Board and get the funds it 
needs to meet the challenge it is faced with. Unfortunately, our 
amendment was rejected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also proposed another amendment which made a lot of sense. 
Generally speaking, local communities lose part of their 
environment when parks or historic sites are created. 
That is why we asked the government to show some compassion 
towards these communities by giving them access to these parks 
and sites at a reduced fee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, this government is obsessed with money. It 
rejected our amendment, even though the arguments used to 
justify its decision did not convince me at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather, they made me realize that the government is aware that, 
in most cases, visits are made primarily by local people. It is 
with these local people, who make more frequent visits than 
tourists from outside the region, the province or even the 
country, that Parks Canada will make money, through entry fees. 
So, in this case as in others, the government is opting for the 
status quo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The result is that we have a slightly better bill instead of one 
that could have been greatly improved, if the government had not 
used its majority to impose on us decisions that were made not 
by those elected to represent the people of this country and 
look after their interests, but by bureaucrats and public 
servants who are too close to their own reality to have the 
proper perspective to make the best decisions.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The aim of the bill is to turn Parks Canada, one of the three 
programs of the Department of Canadian Heritage, into an agency 
separate from the department, to be known as the Parks Canada 
Agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the moment, Parks Canada has 5,000 employees, more than a 
third of whom work seasonally. It administers 38 national parks 
and national park reserves, three marine conservation areas, 131 
national historic sites, seven historic canals, 165 heritage 
train stations and 31 heritage rivers. In addition, Parks Canada 
works with 661 national historic sites it does not own. 
It administers policy on some 1,000 heritage federal buildings 
and shares responsibility for eight world heritage sites with 
UNESCO. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Briefly, the three reasons the government gives for the creation 
of a new agency to replace Parks Canada are as follows: to 
simplify structures, to improve administrative efficiency and to 
establish more flexible staffing and financial procedures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to achieve these objectives, the agency will have new 
or revised financial, administrative and human resource 
management powers. 
To this end, the agency will become a separate entity, a public 
corporation as defined in schedule II to the Financial 
Administration Act and will become subject to part II of 
schedule I of the Public Service Staff Relations Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of responsibilities, the agency will report directly to 
the Minister of Canadian Heritage, who will be accountable for 
the agency's activities to Parliament. The agency will report to 
parliament by tabling the following five documents: an annual 
report on the agency's operations; a summary of the five year 
corporate plan; management plans for the national parks, 
national historic sites and other protected areas; a report 
every five years on the human resources management regime; and a 
biennial report on the state of protected heritage areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the financial statements of the agency are to be 
examined by the auditor general, who will report to the 
government and will also provide an assessment of the agency's 
mandate, objectives and business plan.  The parks Canada agency 
will remain subject to the legislation governing official 
languages, employment equity and human rights, access to 
information and privacy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the agency's funding, the legislation will give it a 
number of new financial powers, particularly: a budget spread 
over two years, which is better suited to investing in the 
development of parks and historic sites; the power to retain and 
reinvest all proceeds with the exception of fines; the creation 
of a dedicated permanent fund from parliamentary appropriations 
and the sale of surplus property.  This account will be used to 
finance new national parks and historic sites. 
Finally, the agency may advance funds for the unplanned purchase 
of land when favourable conditions present themselves.  These 
advances must be repaid with interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for human resources management, the agency will be a separate 
employer under the Public Service Staff Relations Act.  The 
director will be empowered to appoint employees and to define 
the conditions of employment of agency staff, particularly 
negotiation of a collective agreement and the creation of a 
classification and staffing system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hopefully, these changes will give the agency the necessary 
flexibility to develop a human resources management system 
better suited to its operational context.  The parks and 
historic sites system is spread across the entire country, 
operates year round and around the clock in a number of different 
time zones, and employs many seasonal, permanent and part time 
workers. 
All employees whose duties are transferred to the Parks Canada 
agency will receive an offer of employment.  Their present jobs 
are guaranteed for two years by Treasury Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the federal government, the creation of an agency 
responsible for Canada's parks will fulfil the present mission 
of the Parks Canada program of Canadian Heritage with greater 
efficiency and cost-effectiveness.  This strikes us as an 
important commitment: enhanced efficiency for less money.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not forget that, in the last four years, the government 
reduced Parks Canada's budget by $100 million. That budget is 
used, among other things, to develop the network of national 
parks and marine conservation areas, and to maintain and promote 
national historic sites and monuments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The financial constraints imposed on Parks Canada led the 
government to consider a restructuring of the program's 
operations. The bill we are debating today at third reading is 
the result of that exercise. 
The government reached the conclusion that the best way to 
ensure the objectives of Parks Canada were met was to create the 
Parks Canada agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois has long been asking the federal government 
to streamline its operations wherever possible, and to fight 
waste, instead of cutting in social programs and education. This 
is why we support the bill, since it will truly improve the 
effectiveness of the parks' management, without jeopardizing the 
mandate to preserve, protect and develop Canada's national parks 
and historic sites for future generations and for all Canadians 
and Quebeckers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has assured us that this bill is not the first 
step toward the privatization of parks.  We were very concerned 
that the Parks Canada agency might be the first step toward the 
privatization of parks. 
I want to say it here in the House so it will be officially 
recorded in Hansard.  The government has assured us that it has 
absolutely no intention of privatizing Parks Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When he appeared before the Canadian heritage committee, on 
November 20, the secretary of state responsible for Parks Canada 
said, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There's something I have said over and over again, and I will 
take an opportunity to say it here when we are talking about 
finance. It is not the intention of this government to either 
privatize or commercialize Parks Canada. We believe the 
maintenance of our special places in Canada is an important 
trust given to us by Canadians. That stewardship Canadians want 
to see exercised publicly, and we will continue to do that 
through our agency and through the oversight of Parliament. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the Bloc Quebecois' main concerns about this bill is to 
ensure that, once in operation, the agency will maintain access 
to parks for everyone. This bill shows the unequivocal will of 
the government to increase user fees in parks, even though 
taxpayers already contribute through taxes. There has to be a 
reasonable limit to the fee increases imposed on visitors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We put forward the idea that people living close to these parks 
should enjoy a preferential rate, but the government rejected 
our amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agency should use its increased revenues from user fees, 
royalties or the sale of assets to provide more services, better 
fulfil its mandate, or develop its activities. 
The anticipated increase in revenues should not be used by the 
government to justify a further reduction of parliamentary 
appropriations for the agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A fair balance must be maintained between the revenues from 
taxes paid by taxpayers, and those from the fees they have to 
pay when they visit these parks and sites. If we continually 
increase fees, soon there will not be enough visitors and Parks 
Canada will have a hard time keeping these parks, sites and 
historic monuments in good shape. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also want to ensure that the agency's financial objectives 
and the obvious desire of the federal government to increase the 
number of visitors to ensure greater economic benefits do not 
lead to overuse of our parks and historic sites.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We know how difficult it sometimes is to keep sites in decent 
shape because too many people have been allowed in all at once 
and there is not enough time for proper maintenance. We would 
like to be sure that the agency balances the need to preserve 
and maintain natural or historic sites against the increase in 
the number of visitors and the related expansion of tourism and 
commercial activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois is not alone in expressing the concerns I 
have just mentioned. In November 1996, the auditor general 
presented a meaty report to parliament on the protection of 
Canada's national heritage. 
The auditor general had examined the systems established by 
Parks Canada to maintain and enhance the ecological integrity of 
national parks.  I am delighted that the government has agreed 
to add a provision to one of the bill's clauses to the effect 
that the Parks Canada Agency will have the mandate of preserving 
the ecological integrity of national parks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1996 the auditor general pointed out that park management 
plans place more emphasis on economic and social factors than on 
ecological factors. He noted also that Parks Canada should 
upgrade its knowledge of the condition of natural resources in 
national parks in order to adopt a sensible management approach, 
based on the ecosystems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this regard, a number of witnesses appeared before the 
committee to express their concerns. I hope that the Parks 
Canada agency, which can obtain the minutes of our meetings, 
will read them carefully, analyze them and take them into 
consideration when developing its policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the auditor general's report, Parks Canada has taken a 
number of corrective measures and, last fall, when the secretary 
of state forwarded to us Parks Canada's response to some of the 
auditor general's criticisms, it was clear that it had truly 
made an effort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill calls for measures relating to the creation and 
implementation of park management plans.  Much still remains to 
be done, however, before all the auditor general's 
recommendations can be implemented. The data on park conditions 
still need to be updated, and the policies on ecological 
conditions need to be implemented on an ongoing basis as well. 
The environmental objectives set in the act must result in 
concrete measures if they are to be achieved, regardless of 
budget constraints. I do hope that the Parks Canada Agency can 
really fulfil that part of its mandate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parks Canada designed ambitious development plans to complete 
the network of national parks, expand the number of national 
historic sites, and create marine conservation areas. Currently, 
24 of the 39 natural regions defined by Parks Canada are 
represented in the network, and the objective is to develop the 
15 remaining regions by the year 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That objective seems quite ambitious, considering the pace at 
which Parks Canada operates. Still, even though its pace may 
seem slow, Parks Canada should not act precipitously but take 
the time to meet the needs of the communities, instead of trying 
to please bureaucrats and technocrats. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a case in point, which we will soon discuss, when we 
deal with another bill on a park in the Northwest Territories 
that sets boundaries which do not at all reflect what is good 
for the community. But this is another issue which will be 
debated at another time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government claims that these objectives are 
attainable, thanks to the improved efficiency resulting from a 
restructuring exercise that will allow Parks Canada to do more 
with fewer resources. Developing the 15 remaining regions in two 
years sounds like sheer utopia. 
We hope that the government and the minister will not ask the 
Parks Canada agency to achieve this goal in less than two years, 
since we are almost half way through 1998.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The year 2000 will soon be here, and I think the Parks Canada 
agency must have the time it needs to develop these 15 regions 
at its own pace and to carry out the consultations necessary to 
involve the people concerned in their development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nevertheless, we question the new agency's ability to 
consolidate and fully develop the existing sites, while 
maintaining its objectives of expansion in today's context of 
budgetary restraint. What we do not want to see happen is for 
there to be a very vast but badly maintained system, with 
insufficient services and no ecological integrity. 
We wish to ensure that the development of the system of national 
parks and historic sites is durable and sustainable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We let the government know that, when this bill was studied by 
the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage, we wanted the 
committee to call as witnesses representatives of all groups of 
employees, including seasonal and part time workers, whose 
status might be changed as a result of the bill's planned 
changes.  We were very satisfied on this point, since the 
representatives of these employees from all categories testified 
before the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would appear, from what we heard, that relations are 
excellent and that everything seems to be progressing in the 
best way possible, under the best conditions. We were assured 
that the tendering process for all Parks Canada agency contracts 
would be impartial and transparent in accordance with 
regulations. The new structure and wide-ranging authority of the 
agency's CEO in the management of human resources must not pave 
the way for arbitrary decisions and patronage appointments. It 
would appear we have guarantees here too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will support Bill C-29, which creates the Parks Canada agency. 
We will carefully monitor the establishment of this agency to 
ensure that everyone may work there and carry out the mandate 
given the Parks Canada agency in peace, friendship, solidarity 
and prosperity.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney—Victoria, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is a pleasure for me to rise today and speak to this 
particular piece of legislation which has come before the House. 
I am not the New Democratic Party's critic in this area but I do 
come from an island that has not one but two national parks 
located within its boundaries.  This is of particular importance 
to the people of Cape Breton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Cape Breton Highlands National Park is contained in my 
riding.  It contains some of the most spectacular scenery in the 
country and some of the most important plant growth and 
ecological— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Hear, hear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini:</B>  Thank you. I acknowledge the applause 
from my colleagues from Nova Scotia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the island of Cape Breton in the riding of my colleague from 
Bras d'Or is the national historic park the Fortress of 
Louisbourg which is of great importance to the heritage and 
history of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I stand to speak on this bill, I do so from the perspective 
of a resident who sees the importance of these parks to their own 
areas in many ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I start by addressing some of the concerns that have been raised 
by the hon. member for Rimouski—Mitis and the concerns of 
constituents in my riding and I think across the country on a fee 
structure for using national historic parks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been some mention made that people who once resided in 
these parks gave up their land. It was a concern of the Bloc 
Quebecois member that those people be given reduced rates. I 
would go further and say that they be given free rates to the 
parks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can speak as one who represents people whose property was 
expropriated by the national government to ensure that there was 
a national park in Cape Breton to be used for the benefit of all 
Canadians.  Indeed many people from all over the world visit that 
park. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1220"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT18"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those people were farmers and fishermen, families who had lived 
on particular pieces of land for generations.  The land 
represented their livelihood.  They were prosperous farmers. They 
were prosperous fishermen.  Their land bordered the coastline. 
They were self-sufficient.  They farmed and fished all summer. 
They dried the fish in the winter and they preserved the goods 
from their farms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That land was expropriated.  It was expropriated for a good 
reason.  It is important to preserve that area.  Those 
individuals were relocated.  They pay taxes to the Canadian 
government for the preservation of the parks.  To ask them now to 
also pay a fee to enter land that was once their own is unfair. I 
know it will raise the hackles of the constituents in my riding. 
I have already received complaints about that very process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well I want to talk a little bit about the advisory council. 
We are creating an agency to manage the parks. We have heard that 
this is not a step.  The hon. member for Rimouski—Mitis quoted 
the secretary of state as saying that this was not a step to 
privatization.  We have not gone far enough to include the public 
in the debate about the management of the parks and what role the 
community should have in that area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am concerned when we delegate authority to an agency in that 
we lose some accountability.  I say that having just had some 
experience with Nav Canada corporation.  Members in this House 
will remember that was a private corporation, admittedly 
different from an agency, set up to deal with the flight service 
stations in various airports.  When I asked it for a report 
dealing with the safety of individuals in my community, I was 
told it is not the corporation's policy to make that report 
public and I could not see it even though I am a member of 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have some concerns when we say that we are going to move Parks 
Canada from the full administrative role that the government has 
in administering Parks Canada to an agency that may or may not be 
answerable.  I recognize that the minister will have some 
authority.  At the same time we need to make sure that every 
individual member in this House who has a request for information 
for that agency is entitled to receive the information 
immediately or as soon as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This party has other concerns with regard to amendments that we 
put forward, some of which were accepted. I still have great 
concerns when it comes to the personnel in Parks Canada.  As I 
read the act and what the government intends to do, it gives no 
great comfort to the employees of Parks Canada.  They have 
already been cut back in terms of numbers, leaving those who are 
left to pick up the additional workload.  They have had their 
wages frozen and rolled back.  They have had their work increased 
for less money.  I know from speaking to people who work for 
Parks Canada in my riding that there are serious morale concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we are telling the individuals who work for Parks Canada 
that they are going to be answerable to a new agency. That agency 
we are told would simplify organizational structures, improve 
administrative efficiency and allow more flexible staffing and 
financial procedures. Given what these individuals have been 
through in the last six to eight years, it seems that they have 
legitimate concerns about what those phrases mean. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we can read into those phrases, contracting out of 
services, layoffs and seasonal work with reduced benefits.  I 
think we can also read into them less money in the hands of the 
individuals who work in those parks and who are the citizens who 
have given up the development of that land for commercial 
enterprises in order to ensure that all Canadians can benefit 
from it.  That causes concern for me as a representative of the 
people who work in Parks Canada and who live in the surrounding 
areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have concerns about the increasing fees at Parks Canada.  Let 
us not forget that we have a number of parks across this country. 
If we increase the fees, I would hope that we do not see the 
parks getting into some kind of competition with each other 
whereby certain incentives will have to be offered at the Cape 
Breton Highlands national park to entice tourists from the new 
park located in Prince Edward Island or from Banff National Park. 
I hope that we do not begin a race to the bottom whereby the 
parks get more and more Disney-like in an effort to attract 
visitors.

<A HREF="#LINKT19"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we move away from federal government financing of the parks, 
and I appreciate that we are looking at an 80-20 split here, 80% 
from the federal government and 20% from private revenue, we are 
on a very slippery slope where we may begin to increase the 
dependency of the parks on private financing.  That then 
increases competition between the parks to attract the limited 
tourist dollars that come into this country. Once we do that, we 
move away from the ecological concerns and the preservation 
concerns of the mandate for having these national historic parks 
to creating a carnival-like atmosphere whereby the parks will 
cater to the lowest common denominator.  I take the government at 
its word when it says we are not moving in this direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time I am concerned that we are moving toward a more 
American style of parks system.  As I speak to the House today I 
am not sure that members know this but it has been reported in 
“Environmental Dimensions” that on May 20 the minister of state 
for parks entered into an agreement with the United States 
regarding national parks along the border states.  A 
co-management or a co-operation agreement has been entered into 
between Canada and the United States on managing the border area 
parks.  There will be co-operation in management, research, 
protection, conservation and the presentation of national parks 
and national historic sites. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know if members of the committee have been made aware 
of this but this country's national parks are something Canadians 
hold dear.  They determine our identity. When people in other 
countries think of Canada they think of our national parks.  They 
think of Banff in Alberta.  They think of the new park in Prince 
Edward Island.  The pristine waters. Those are the things that 
define us.  Now we see that the minister of state has entered 
into an agreement to co-manage Canada's national parks that fall 
along the border between Canada and the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why in heaven's name would the minister do this?  Why are we 
handing over the authority to manage those parks to another 
country? What does that mean in terms of Bill C-29? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It may well mean that personnel for border area parks could be 
American.  It means that the new chief executive officer who will 
head the Canada parks agency will have to deal with the U.S. 
parks service.  I am not sure the committee was aware of this at 
the time the bill was introduced.  As I indicated, I do not sit 
on that committee, but I think it is worth questioning the 
minister in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister of course says for his part that he is delighted to 
have made the commitment to create a framework for future 
co-operation and co-ordination in conserving and presenting the 
national and cultural heritage sites.  But these are our national 
and cultural heritage sites. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see that kind of movement by the minister at the same time 
that we are introducing this piece of legislation to take some 
responsibility away from the government and to create an agency. 
At the same time we are talking about increasing user fees for 
the parks.  At the same time we are not providing special 
incentives, if you will, for those who live in the areas so that 
they do not have to pay the same price to use the parks.  It 
causes me concern as to where we are going with the national 
parks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With those comments I indicate that the New Democratic Party has 
always been in favour of Canada's national historic parks and 
preserving them for the people of Canada and for the people in 
whose regions they exist.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I was very interested in the comments by the NDP member with 
respect to this piece of legislation.  It is one of the few 
pieces of legislation that the Reform Party feels relatively 
comfortable with that has been proposed by the government with 
one or two exceptions that I will be outlining in a speech later 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I really have to wonder where the head space of the NDP is with 
respect to this issue of making something more efficient.  It 
would seem as though as long as national parks are under some 
kind of public service, some kind of overlayering of bureaucracy, 
that is going to make the parks more protected.  Nothing could be 
further from the truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The biggest single problem that Parks Canada has had in recent 
history has been that there has been an overlayering and an 
overcomplication of the administration of the parks.  What this 
act will do in terms of creating efficiency is set up the most 
creative and efficient way to deliver services to Canadians and 
visitors to the parks and to give the greatest protection to 
parks in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the NDP unfortunately is setting up a bogeyman by saying 
if we do not have all of this overlayering somehow the parks are 
going to be in peril.  I do not know whether the NDP is coming 
from the 1950s, 1940s or the 1920s, but it certainly is not 
coming from the level of today's way of delivering services to 
people. I cannot imagine where this member has come from with his 
comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to reply 
to that comment from the member who says he does not know where 
the head space is of the NDP. It is with the Canadian public and 
in the preservation of the things that the Canadian public from 
one end of the country to the other holds dear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand the Reform Party will support this piece of 
legislation.  Perhaps it is the beginning of unite the right or 
the merger the hon. member's leader speaks about.  There is not 
that great a difference I guess between some Liberal thinking and 
Reform thinking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member says this is the most creative and efficient way to 
manage the parks.  He asks if we are in the 1950s or the 1920s. 
We are moving well into the millennium when the preservation of 
the things Canadians hold dear will never be more important.  We 
know where the Reform Party would like to go with Parks Canada. 
It would like to have a Disneyland and McDonald's on every 
corner.  That is its mechanism for making money and becoming cost 
efficient in Canada's parks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am happy to respond to his comments and let Canadians know the 
difference between the NDP which has always fought to protect and 
preserve traditions of Canada and the Reform Party which has 
adopted the thinking of Ronald Reagan and the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott:</B>  Mr. Speaker, apparently this member is 
not aware that I and my family have proudly lived in the region 
of East Kootenay since 1974.  We live there because there are 
four mountain parks within my constituency in addition to another 
three mountain parks on the Alberta side of the border. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very aware of and have a personal commitment to parks.  I 
find his myopic sense of righteousness as put forward by the NDP 
that somehow it is the only protectors of the environment to be 
exceptionally unfortunate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my commitment and it is the commitment of the Reform Party 
that national parks be accessible to Canadians while at the same 
time reflecting that these parks represent a national treasure 
that must be protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is really scandalous that he would be making these kinds of 
allegations which are absolutely, totally and factually 
inaccurate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am glad it took my 
comments to wring out of the hon. member that he sees these as 
historic treasures even in his own riding.  I suggest that the 
people of his riding, if they have concerns about the protection 
of those very parks that he has so eloquently mentioned, question 
him on this bill and what it means.  I wonder if those 
individuals will have to pay the same price for access to their 
own land that the tourists will have to pay. 
I wonder if those people understand there may be a downgrading in 
the privatization of the parks to the lowest common denominator. 
I am sure, given his comments today and the members of his 
constituency who are watching him, that he will have to answer 
those questions for them.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member may not have been 
in the House last night.  He must have missed the fact that the 
Reform Party voted in favour of the lower rates for the local 
residents.  He obviously missed that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the delivery of services, Kootenay National Park 
is in my constituency within the geography of my constituency 
office.  The park did the initial trial for delivery of services 
by painting road signs of all things.  The park created an 
efficiency after due process by giving an individual who was only 
half employed a commercial contract.  On the basis of that 
commercial contract, the individual who had become an ex-park 
employee was able to start his own commercial sign business. With 
that base he could go ahead to develop his own private business 
in the Invermere area outside of Radium, the Kootenay National 
Park boundary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now delivery of the sign painting service to Kootenay National 
Park is at a significantly lower cost, a new commercial 
enterprise is now paying taxes and there is somebody who is very 
happy to deliver the commercial services as well as the services 
he is delivering to the park.  It is a win-win-win.  It is this 
kind of creativeness and inventiveness we would bring to deliver 
services to the Canadian public and to protect parks for future 
generations.  It is not under the rubric or the umbrella of this 
overlaying of bureaucracy that the NDP seems to feel is the only 
way to protect the ecology of the parks.  There are new ways. 
Maybe this member should start to learn that the NDP ideas of the 
1950s do not fit anymore. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I find that an 
interesting analogy.  The hon. member has given us what he 
believes to be a success story of contracting out.  I wonder if 
the individuals who live along the border states, where the 
minister of state has just entered into an agreement for 
co-management of Canada's parks, will feel happy if the 
contracting out of services goes to the Americans or if we go to 
some other nation to paint the signs, to mow the lawns, to bring 
in the machinery.  I wonder how happy the constituents in this 
member's riding would be if the contracting out went to a nation 
with no minimum wage.  I know that is his position. The workers 
in that riding would be forced to the lowest possible wage in 
order to maintain what was once their own land.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill establishes the Parks Canada agency as a distinct legal 
entity.  The agency will report directly to the minister of 
heritage who will be accountable for its activities before 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-29 also outlines the roles and responsibilities of the 
minister with respect to reporting and submission requirements to 
parliament, cabinet, Treasury Board and the public.  This 
accountability regime includes responsibility for corporate 
reports, annual reports, state of Canadian protected area 
reports, management plans for both national parks and national 
historic sites and the holding of biannual public forums to 
solicit public feedback. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation specifies the roles and responsibilities of the 
deputy minister of heritage with respect to policy advice, policy 
development and legislative development, as well as the roles and 
responsibilities of the chief executive officer of the Canada 
parks agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-29 also outlines the roles and responsibilities of 
Treasury Board as they relate to a broad array of administrative 
interactions between Treasury Board and the Canada parks agency. 
It also specifies the auditor general's audit function over the 
parks agency's financial statements and performance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-29 also contains provisions for the maintenance of other 
government services and administrative functions as they relate 
to the functioning of the Canada parks agency.  These include the 
Access to Information Act, the Privacy Act, the Official 
Languages Act, the Public Service Superannuation Act, the 
Employment Equity Act and the Canadian Human Rights Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill would give the agency a number of financial powers, 
including a two year operational budget, retention and 
reinvestment power for all revenues, the establishment of an 
account to fund new national parks and historic sites from 
appropriations, the sale and surplus of properties and general 
donations, and the authority to advance funds for various 
reasons, including unfunded land acquisition opportunities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-29 was not and is not a perfect a bill.  A number of 
opposition members proposed amendments to Bill C-29 to strengthen 
it.  Some of those amendments were adopted but other amendments 
that would have given the bill more teeth were rejected.  We were 
told that such amendments should be brought to other related acts 
such as the Parks Canada Act.  During our hearings on Bill C-29 
many of the witnesses, including representatives of the Canadian 
Nature Federation and CPAWS, shared their concern that the 
government must do more to protect the ecological integrity of 
our parks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general in his 1996 report criticized Parks Canada 
for not doing enough to protect the ecological integrity of 
Canada's national parks.  He also stated the government is in 
danger of not meeting its objective of completing the national 
park system by the year 2000.  Even the minister of state for 
parks acknowledges that the national park system cannot be 
completed in the next two years.

</I></B></P><P align=left>My party looks forward to dealing with the Canada Parks Act when 
it comes before the House.  Although Canada's parks service has 
been in existence since 1911 it has never been legislatively 
recognized as the manager of the park system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, Parks Canada is not even mentioned in the National 
Parks Act and does not have a significant legislative mandate. 
The PC Party has always recognized the importance of our national 
parks and national historic sites as contributors to our Canadian 
cultural identity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1988 the former Progressive Conservative government 
modernized the National Parks Act which had not been updated

Act and other acts that have a consequence on our parks, historic 
sites and waterways.  My party will continue to work hard to 
promote, protect and enhance our rich legacy of accomplishments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I thank all those groups and individuals who brought 
their concerns to me and assure them today that we will continue 
to work on their behalf to bring forward amendments to 
legislation as it comes before the House.  As parliamentarians it 
is very important that we work together to ensure that Canada's 
natural heritage and resources are conserved for future 
generations.  I urge all hon. members to support the bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jerry Pickard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
wish to point out that I am sharing my time with the member for 
Oak Ridges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout the House I have heard some very positive comments 
about the forming of this parks agency.  There is no question 
that it is a very positive step forward.  When we think about the 
national parks system and national historic sites we think about 
the canals and the conservation areas.  We think about all that 
will fall under this agency.  It is a fantastic opportunity to 
show Canadians and people around the world what Canadians really 
stand for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is absolutely no question that as we look at our parks 
system it encompasses some of the most imaginative and most 
characteristic sections of Canada.  There is no question that our 
heritage sites represent very important historic references to 
Canada.  There is no question that we have within our parks 
system, our heritage system, our conservation areas, a really 
great story to tell. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That story can be told to young people throughout the land by 
taking them to those areas.  That story can be told to all 
Canadians.  In fact it can be told to visitors around the world 
to show what a great country we are, what great background we 
have and what great historical significance there is to this 
great country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is with a great deal of pride that I am able to talk to this 
issue today.  I think it is in essence what Canada is about.  The 
Canadian parks system has been significant over the past.  It has 
grown tremendously in the last several years.  There is no 
question that it must expanded.  It must be moved forward as 
well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have some very significant national sites that we must 
incorporate into the 39 different areas we designate as 
significant areas.  We must make certain that the message to 
Canadians is that we respect this great country with its land and 
historic sites, with all this put together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we travel through the north we see some amazing river 
valleys, gorges and mountain sites.  We can look at the 
grasslands in Saskatchewan and realize it is the land of the 
prairie dog.  This is the area where Sitting Bull rested after a 
traumatic event in the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can look at Prince Edward Island National Park and realize it 
is among the finest areas of Canada with the best salt water 
beaches in the country.  Anne of Green Gables, a tremendous 
significant issue in Canada, is one of our national historic 
sites.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding we have Point Pelee, one of the best birding 
locations in the world.  People from Europe, Asia and the United 
States, in fact people from all over the world, come to visit 
that area to see the significance and celebrate this land itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can look back at our heritage and understand some significant 
adventures in history.  I think of Josiah Henson and the fabulous 
story of <I>Uncle Tom's Cabin</I>, the black culture coming 
together in our sites, or I think of other opportunities for 
Canadians to participate and enjoy what is happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly with the agency coming to bear we can see some 
tremendous changes coming about.  We will now have opportunity to 
move into parks that will have great significance for Canada's 
Great Lakes and Atlantic and Pacific areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fathom Five National Marine Park protects Niagara escarpment 
history and work on the Georgian Bay waters. We have conservation 
marine parks on the Atlantic coast and on the Pacific coast which 
point out the significance of our flora and fauna, our rich 
culture and our Indian heritage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Saguenay River marine park on the St. Lawrence protects 
beluga whales, seals, plant and bird life of all kinds.  Our 
national marine conservation area program is new and will remain 
an ongoing part of the national parks system.  The evolution of 
our national parks system is very significant to our heritage and 
our understanding of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Historic sites and monuments are another alternative area of 
education and support that we must make sure is expanded in a 
wide range of areas.  Recently the board undertook initiatives to 
consider the history of aboriginal people in the country, the 
history and culture of women and the communities that have 
brought a great deal to our nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could talk about the Grizzly Bear Mountain area and Scented 
Grass Hills that have been designated historic sites by our 
minister. We could talk about our great culture and Portia White, 
a Nova Scotian with a very rich, vibrant voice, a great concert 
personality in the area.  We are designating sites to recognize 
great accomplishments of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will move forward with a cultural site for the black cultural 
centre in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia.  We certainly need to recognize 
the races.  We need to recognize the cultures that have made the 
nation come together and great.  We need to move forward on the 
issue of significant Canadians to ensure recognition of such 
events. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question that the legislation will allow the parks 
agency to focus upon permanent, forward moving areas which will 
make the country very rich in national pride and very rich in 
national culture, one that we can display to the world, that we 
can exhibit to our visitors, and show our internal pride. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because we have such good support in the House for the 
legislation it shows that all Canadians, regardless of political 
stripe, are extremely proud of the accomplishments of people and 
of the physical terrain of the country.  We look forward to 
making certain the legislation moves along as quickly as 
possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased with many of the comments I have heard from the 
opposition.  I am pleased with the comments I have heard from my 
own colleagues.  I have to say for all Canadians that we are 
looking at something that is truly great for our land. 
<P><A NAME="LINK44"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I was interested as a point of information from the member who 
just spoke particularly about Point Pelee.  As he mentioned 
somebody involved in birding would love this park. 
It is a very special place as are all national parks.  However, 
it is in the middle of one of the Great Lakes where shipping is 
going back and forth.   Unfortunately, as we know by some of the 
crustaceans that have ended up in water intakes and so on, very 
frequently ships from offshore will actually end up pumping bilge 
or from time to time dropping oil and that kind of thing.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a point of interest and information, could the member 
enlighten us from a local perspective whether, in taking a look 
at the ecological integrity of that area, we should be looking at 
any further restrictions or any further controls particularly 
with respect to shipping and the potential of pollution around 
Point Pelee? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jerry Pickard:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for 
the question because it is an extremely significant one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The freshwater system in Canada, particularly the Great Lakes, 
is one that has over the last five or ten years suffered a fair 
amount of change because of the zebra mussel being brought into 
Canada in the bilge water dumpings from foreign vessels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are questions about other significant changes that can 
occur from boats entering the Great Lakes system, dumping bilge 
water and causing ecological change which in many cases could be 
very negative and problematic in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have made very clear in the past that I would certainly 
support and endorse this issue.  I had opportunity to meet with 
several fishing communities and ecologists in our area two weeks 
ago to discuss it.  We talked about legislation that may be 
significant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think legislation should be put into force that the dumping of 
bilge water from ships has to be stopped in our Great Lakes and 
in other waterways where it what may cause significant change in 
our systems.  I have no question about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member is pointing out a very clear ecological problem not 
just for the Great Lakes, by the way.  All freshwater systems 
throughout the country must have some type of protection.  I 
would strongly endorse working at international levels to make 
sure that other countries with similar pristine areas to Canada's 
are protected as well as they possibly can be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-29 is intended to assist Parks Canada in its role of 
preserving, protecting and expanding Canada's national parks, 
historic sites and related protected areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From Cape Spear, Newfoundland to Pacific Rim National Park, more 
than 38 national parks and 786 historic sites visited annually by 
24 million Canadians are among the most important aspects of 
Canadian identity and are cherished symbols of Canada's land and 
history.  Of these, 12 Canadian locations have such outstanding 
universal value that they have been designated as UNESCO world 
heritage sites. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The creation of the new parks agency will result in three key 
benefits, benefits which will ensure continued excellence of 
stewardship for the precious heritage now entrusted to Parks 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Parks Canada agency will be an autonomous organization 
accountable to the Minister of Canadian Heritage and in turn to 
parliament, an organization able to make needed decisions in a 
more timely fashion at less cost to the Canadian taxpayer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new agency will be able to deliver continued cost effective 
and efficient services to visitors to the national parks, 
historic sites and other related protected heritage areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Parks Canada agency will have new financial authorities and 
flexibilities to retain and reinvest revenues.  These will allow 
appropriations to be used to create new national parks, national 
historic sites and related protected heritage areas throughout 
the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mandate of the program will not change after the new entity 
comes into existence.  The legislation creating the new agency 
will support and will possibly strengthen the existing mandate. 
The Parks Canada agency will be in a better position to continue 
to maintain the current systems of national parks, national 
historic sites and other related protected heritage areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will continue to provide a high level of service to park and 
site visitors and will work toward the completion of the national 
parks system and toward the expansion of a system of national 
historic sites and national marine conservation areas, and 
continue to preserve and maintain the natural ecosystem of the 
parks which is constantly renewing itself in order to survive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why we are bringing in the new Parks Canada agency into 
existence.  Canada's parks service is the oldest in the world 
with a distinguished history and a promising future.  The 
creation of this agency is an important step forward, one which 
will ensure that we satisfy our obligations to Canadians and to 
the world to protect and to conserve our most enduring and 
cherished symbols. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the past president of the Canadian Parks and Recreation 
Association, I am a strong advocate of the need to preserve our 
national parks and the important role they play in the lives of 
Canadians.  They provide an oasis for vacationing families as 
well as provide unlimited outdoor recreation for the avid campers 
and nature lovers in Canada.  From mountain climbing in Banff and 
Jasper to bird watching at Point Pelee, Canadians are enjoying 
all the benefits our parks have to offer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In turn, Canadians gain a greater appreciation of our country 
and its natural beauty.  Our national parks are indeed a national 
treasure.  They link us to our history, our heritage and the 
Canadian landscape. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1885, about 25 years before the Americans, Canada's first 
prime minister, Sir John A. Macdonald, created North America's 
first national park, Banff National Park in the Rocky Mountains 
of Alberta.  Banff remains one of Canada's premier and most loved 
national treasures.  Its natural beauty and resources must be 
preserved for generations to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By passing Bill C-29, we in the House of Commons can ensure the 
renewal of the organization that Canadians have entrusted with 
their cherished national parks, national historic sites and other 
protected heritage areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think now is

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
will be splitting my time with the member for Esquimalt—Juan de 
Fuca. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It gives me great pleasure to rise in support of this 
legislation.  Some things I will be discussing shortly that are 
of concern to me within the legislation but let me be perfectly 
clear.  As the heritage critic for the Reform Party and with my 
colleague, the Reform Party parks critic, we recognize fully the 
value of the national parks system to Canadians and to Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party is committed to ensuring that we have national 
parks today and into the future for our children and for our 
children's children, that there be proper protection for the 
environment and the ecology around all our national parks. Our 
party is very committed to the entire concept of environmental 
responsibility for generations to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a good piece of legislation in that it simplifies and 
makes more efficient the delivery of services.  I quote from the 
Montreal <I>Gazette</I> today, an article entitled “MPs vote to 
keep parks bilingual”. The article states: “Several MPs feared 
that the new agency which will contract work out rather than use 
public servants will jack up entrance fees to make national parks 
into a money making operation”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have four national parks in my constituency. I work with the 
superintendents and I work with the people who are delivering the 
services to Canadians from top to bottom in those park 
organizations.  I know that is an absolutely false concern.  The 
concern is to continue to deliver a high level of service and 
protection of parks at reasonable cost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I outlined in debate between me and an NDP member an actual case 
in my constituency creating a contract with a person who is now a 
former park employee. Painting and maintaining signs in our 
parks, in Kootenay National Park, is now delivered in a far more 
cost effective way while this individual is much more involved in 
his own life. This individual has his own business, he is 
delivering a commercial service. Now rather than being a park 
employee drawing wages from Parks Canada, he is delivering 
services to Parks Canada as a contractor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a far more efficient way of working. This former 
employee now being in his own business is now in a situation 
where he becomes a taxpayer generating more work and more wealth 
in commerce.  He has just delivered a couple of massive signs, 
excellent work, to my community of Wasa Lake, British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This concern the NDP has is really unfortunate because having 
had the great opportunity to work with supervisors, management 
and hourly workers in our parks, I have discovered a core of 
Canadians committed to our parks.  Because of the bungling by 
this and the former government, there has been a very serious 
downloading of concern and responsibility to people who were 
committed to the parks on one hand but on the other hand parks 
did not seem to be committed to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to this new agency as being a way of being able 
to straighten this out, and we are going to be able to bring some 
order to the management of parks. I think that is excellent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I would be remiss if I did not mention the bit of 
silliness that was brought to this act by the member for 
Ottawa—Vanier and his colleague from Brossard—La Prairie. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a concept of law that it is bad law to put into law 
something that already exists. 
It is not only redundant, it is bad law.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>By these two members' bringing forward this motion in committee 
that was accepted, what fundamentally happened was they brought 
forward something that already existed.  If it did not exist what 
would have happened?  Contrary to what the member said earlier in 
debate, people delivering services in the new Saguenay park, for 
example, who might be working on wharfs, I do not care in what 
language they speak to each other on the job or at home, there is 
no requirement for those people to be able to speak English. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Conversely, when one goes out west there is no necessity for 
somebody collecting garbage and cleaning up the campsites to be 
able to speak French.  They put a piece of mischief into this 
legislation, albeit with every good intention.  It was totally 
and absolutely unnecessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To prove the point that it was unnecessary, the top law maker in 
Canada, the justice minister, said this amendment was not only 
unnecessary but dangerous.  Their colleague, the justice minister 
of Canada, the top law maker, said that what they did with this 
legislation was unfortunately a bit of a buffoonery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is all very well and good to stand on their bilingual high 
horse and try and lob salvoes at us in the Reform Party.  I guess 
that is part of the political game the Liberals like to play. 
The reality is there is absolutely no necessity for this.  What 
did the Liberals do?  Last night the Reform Party came forward 
with an amendment.  The amendment said strike this unnecessary 
amendment created in committee.  But in order to save face they 
asked all their sheep to line up and vote in favour of saying 
that the Official Languages Act applies to this piece of 
legislation.  Guess what?  It already applies to this piece of 
legislation.  It was simply a piece of face saving.  The justice 
minister saw that these people had put this piece buffoonery into 
the legislation.  Unfortunately once again the Liberal sheep 
lined up on the side of trying to save face. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality of the situation is this.  This piece of 
legislation, notwithstanding that one silliness, has the very 
real potential to create efficiencies in the delivery of service 
and in the protection of our national parks.  That is what the 
Reform Party is about.  I believe that is what all members of 
this House are about, to create an environment of protection of 
the parks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me add one caveat. The concern I have is that if we are not 
very careful in the way we apply protection to these parks, we 
have the potential to end up with a situation of making them the 
exclusive playground of rich people.  That would be an absolute 
shame.  I hope one of the first things Parks Canada would be 
taking a look at, before or after this legislation, is the whole 
issue of entry fees, the way the entry fees are applied to not 
only local residents but to individuals and automobiles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must be very careful while being fiscally prudent, which is 
what the Reform Party is all about, at the same time making sure 
we do not make our national parks a playground that only the rich 
can afford to come to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On balance, clearly this is a good piece of legislation.  My 
party will be supporting it with great enthusiasm.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's proposal is to force subcontractors to become 
bilingual and ensure money is being put into something.  One 
questions as to whether or not it is going to get the returns 
necessary.  This is in view of the fact that today our parks are 
under siege and many species are being threatened or becoming 
extinct. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does my hon. colleague feel that the money the government is 
planning to use to force subcontractors to become officially 
bilingual could be better utilized in another area for preserving 
our parks? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott:</B>  Mr. Speaker, clearly the answer to that 
question is yes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The situation is even more confused than what the hon. member 
has outlined. It is confused because of this face-saving attempt 
the Liberals made last night. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unclear what this redundant clause will actually mean in 
enforcement. The legislation was originally set up to come under 
the Official Languages Act which means that the delivery of 
services to individuals must be in both official languages.  That 
is the way this bill was created.  It is the intention of this 
bill. That is what the members of my caucus are in favour of 
which is fine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem came when the members went overboard and brought in 
this piece of puffery.  The problem is that it then appeared as 
though the painters, the garbage collectors, the people working 
on park benches, the people who are not actually verbally 
delivering services to the visitors to the parks were going to 
have to take French or English lessons depending on what their 
mother tongue was.  If they were recent immigrants to the country 
and were still working on mastering either of the official 
languages, they might even have to take time out of their 
contract to become fluently bilingual, which of course is the 
height of idiocy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have now as a result of the face-saving exercise the 
Liberals went through last night, is that we simply do not know 
the answer to the member's question.  It is a perfectly valid 
question.  We do not know what impact this is going to have.  It 
just shows that there are times when it is good to bring forward 
amendments and there are other times like this when those 
amendments are problematic, troublesome and just create 
confusion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure today to speak on Bill C-29, the Parks 
Canada act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are problems today in our parks, from endangered species 
to threatened habitat to species that are becoming extinct.  The 
mark the World Wildlife Fund has given the Canadian government is 
a <I>D</I> in its behaviour and activities toward protecting our 
species, the flora and fauna that inhabit our wonderful country. 
And today the government is pursuing a bill which deals with such 
absurdities as making subcontractors in our parks become 
bilingual. Is it necessary?  The answer is no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the purpose of language is communication, if the purpose of 
language is to make people understand each other, clearly 
bilingual services are necessary in certain areas. 
It is probably not necessary for the people who clean our parks, 
who work in our parks in many areas, who fix our parks on a 
contractual basis in construction.  I fail to see where those 
individuals need to be bilingual.  The government has simply not 
presented an idea of why that is so.

<A HREF="#LINKT30"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Looking at the parks, one of the biggest problems is that of 
resources as all industries and ministries have.  As a result of 
a lack of resources and as a result of a lack of leadership, a 
major problem is that thousands of Canadian species are 
threatened or will become extinct.  From the Vancouver Island 
marmot to the eastern cougar, to the Mississauga rattlesnake, to 
the northern right whale, all of these species and many, many 
others are threatened with potential extinction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many solutions that we have to these problems. I will 
get into those a little bit later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The money that the government will be using to force people to 
become bilingual could be put into other areas such as paying for 
enforcement officers and conservation officers and better 
equipment and surveillance measures for them.  That would have a 
much more powerful effect on our parks in ensuring that the 
habitats of today will be there tomorrow.  Instead, the 
government wants to pour money into a useless and futile attempt 
to make parks subcontractors bilingual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many problems within our own areas, including the 
threatened extinction of many species.  A situation that many 
people are not aware of is that Canada is a major conduit for 
threatened species' animal parts.  The Siberian tiger, the Bengal 
tiger, the clouded leopard, endangered birds, animals and plant 
life, Canada is a major conduit for dispersing these parts from 
our country to other areas.  It is contributing to the decimation 
of the population of various subspecies of tiger in other parts 
of the world, particularly in Asia; the decimation of the black 
rhino, the Javan rhino, the Sumatran rhino, the clouded leopard, 
the snow leopard and on and on it goes.  Canada is partly 
responsible for that, not because of our enforcement officers, 
but because they do not have the resources to do their jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, there is the current situation with respect to our 
law.  While our law provides for some serious penalties, those 
penalties are not being enforced.  What kind of message does that 
give to potential poachers?  It says that they can knock off 
those bears and send their gall bladders to other parts of the 
world because they know if they get caught they will only get 
their wrists slapped. That is an embarrassment to our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, the reason poachers and people who sell wild animal 
and endangered species' parts all over the world are using Canada 
is that we have a large border, but also that our enforcement 
measures are wholly inadequate.  They are wholly inadequate 
because of a lack of resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other issues we have to deal with.  The current 
legislation protects habitat. Habitat loss is the most important 
aspect of why species are becoming extinct.  The federal 
government is not taking the leadership role to work with the 
provinces to make sure that larger tracts of land are being 
protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Animals and birds do not know provincial boundaries.  They do 
not know where the line is drawn between Alberta and British 
Columbia.  These animals need to be protected on a number of 
levels.  It requires federal and provincial leadership in order 
to do that. The only time we have seen effective conservation 
measures being put in place is when provincial leaders have taken 
the bull by the horns and enacted some kind of legislation to 
protect them.  We have seen an utter absence of leadership in 
this government and the previous government in trying to adjust 
the situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here are some solutions.  First, stop the forced bilingualism 
issue that my colleagues have spoken about before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the Canadian Endangered Species Protection Act needs 
strengthening.  It is absolutely weak and as a result our species 
are paying the penalty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, Cosewic is a group of independent scientists.  It should 
be used to identify the plants and animals threatened with 
potential extinction which need our protection.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, we can look at other programs around the world where 
they have used their parks and their wild spaces to generate 
funds which they then pour back into their parks for expansion 
and preservation.  This strengthens their ability to preserve the 
flora and fauna within their boundaries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The golden lion tamarin, a beautiful little monkey in Central 
America, was becoming extinct.  The Belize government made the 
park in which the monkeys live pay for itself through aggressive 
marketing.  The park managed to save that species and many other 
species within that park.  It prevented the encroachment of 
surrounding people and expanded the park.  The moneys generated 
from the park went toward funds for health care, clean water and 
education of the surrounding people.  The people benefited from 
the park in a tangible fashion which enabled them to act as a 
buffer zone to protect against poaching in the park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can apply that same lesson.  We can use our parks in a 
sensible, environmentally sound way to generate funds.  Rather 
than going toward general revenues and having the Minister of 
Finance spend the funds who knows where, we could ensure that at 
least a significant portion of those funds was poured back into 
the parks department for expansion and protection of the habitat 
for many species. There is a lack of funds. This would be a very 
pragmatic way for the parks to generate the necessary funds for 
their own preservation.  It could be done in a sensible way 
without destroying the parks at all.  We have seen where this has 
been done in places around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fifth, we have to ensure the penalties we have on the books are 
severe and that they are applied to those people who commit 
crimes such as poaching and trafficking in endangered species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sixth is the aspect of differential fees.  My colleague and 
others in the House have mentioned that it is a sham to charge 
the same fees for all people.  Other parts of the world have 
differential fees for tourists and for domestic individuals. 
Tourists pay more. Domestic individuals who reside in the area 
pay nothing or very little to come and go from their parks.  This 
model works.  It is absurd to have the same fee for those who 
live in the park, for those who come and go from the park and for 
those who reside in the area.  It will hamstring the ability of 
the parks to generate revenues which could be used to preserve 
the parks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an enormous challenge in front of us.  The preservation 
of wild habitats and animal species is not an esoteric 
intellectual argument.  The pragmatic reason for it is that many 
species harbour direct benefits to human beings through medicine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On a philosophical basis, what has been given to us we have a 
right to give to others.  The fact that many species are becoming 
extinct, particularly amphibians, is a cold hard indicator that 
our ability, our environment, our survival as a species could be 
compromised.  Many of the species in this world are harbingers of 
things to come.  What happens to them may ultimately happen to 
us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask that the federal government take a leadership role with 
respect to the parks department.  I ask that it take a leadership 
role with respect to our endangered species and develop and put 
forth pragmatic solutions which already exist in Canada to try to 
preserve the wild animal species, the flora and fauna and the 
wild spaces within Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to rise to speak on Bill C-29, the parks Canada 
agency act.  My Reform colleagues and I are committed to having 
our national parks and heritage sites administered in an 
accountable, efficient and cost effective manner.  We support the 
concept of cost recovery, but at the same time fees should not be 
levied at such a level that would deter people from using the 
parks. 
The national parks, after all, belong to the people of Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of Dauphin—Swan River are fortunate to have a 
national park located in the centre of their riding.  It is a 
beautiful park, possibly 70 miles by 30 miles, and is within an 
hour's drive for all residents of the riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The area that I would like to concentrate on in this brief time 
is the area of accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-29 states that the agency will report directly to the 
Minister of Canadian Heritage who, in turn, will be accountable 
for its activities before parliament.  Current mechanisms to 
ensure responsible public dialogue and accountability will be 
enhanced.  I agree with that objective, but I will say that from 
my experience with Parks Canada we have a long way to go before 
that occurs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A bi-annual review or forum of stakeholder groups will be 
conducted to provide an opportunity for public dialogue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I would like to do at this time is to relate my experiences 
regarding the national park located in my riding and basically 
talk about the process of consultation.  I hope that with a new 
Parks Canada Agency Act the same mistakes will not be made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Several years ago Parks Canada took on the task of restructuring 
the organization.  The first thing it did was to notify the 
public and the stakeholders in my riding that it was going to 
hold meetings, which it did.  As a former mayor of Dauphin I 
attended.  Lo and behold, when the report came out, guess what 
happened?  It forgot about listing the town of Dauphin.  In fact, 
I complained about this very issue, but to no avail.  It is 
obvious that in the report the meeting that was held in Dauphin 
was not there.  Obviously we did not have a meeting.  We had a 
meeting, but we really did not have a meeting.  Surely this type 
of behaviour is unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope this is not the way the new parks agency will conduct its 
consultations.  By the way, the final report did not completely 
reflect the views of the stakeholders of the region.  What it did 
reflect were the views of the parks officials and the 
bureaucrats. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The common point of view was that this consultation process was 
exercised so that Parks Canada could cut jobs.  This it certainly 
did after the report was released. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who will be the watchdog of the new Parks Canada Agency?  Who 
will make sure that the consultations will not be a repeat of my 
own experience? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to read a paragraph from a letter written by a 15 
year employee of the park who resigned due to this 
reorganization.  This individual had experienced many wonderful 
years in the employ of Parks Canada, except for his last couple 
of years.  He states in his letter: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, due to many reasons, both work oriented and personal, I 
feel that my services are no longer beneficial for myself or the 
department.  It has become very clear to me that my health has 
diminished and the stress level I am experiencing is intolerable. 
I have honestly persevered for approximately two years whereby 
specific individuals engaged in activities that I feel are not 
only legally unacceptable, but also morally unacceptable.  As a 
result, the working environment has suffered considerably. 
Therefore I am unable to work in the conditions that now exist 
within my department.  The low staff morale, the high double 
standards, unfair favouritism, lack of respect and authority 
along with the continual individual personal attacks on myself 
and others is beyond control. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my hope that the new parks agency will deal with its 
personnel in a more rational manner.  I say again, who will be 
the watchdog of this new parks agency?  The legislation says that 
it will report to the minister.  Big deal.  What does that mean? 
If the minister does not care to take an interest, where do we go 
from there?  This has already happened in my experience in 
dealing with Parks Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another area I would like to talk about is cost recovery.  I 
agree that we need to practise this principle.  Even here there 
are limitations.  The Wasagaming Chamber of Commerce is concerned 
that at this time the concept of cost recovery is exercised 
beyond what is reasonable.  It is not considered reasonable for 
the park to charge local residents who live nearby when they 
enter the park to buy an ice cream cone.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The chamber of commerce is very concerned when the town site of 
Riding Mountain National Park is compared to the town site of 
Banff National Park.  Obviously we cannot compare those two 
different places.  There is probably no town site that could be 
compared to Banff National Park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Chief Dwayne Blackbird of the Keesikownan Indian Reserve has 
concerns that they will not be considered as stakeholders in any 
future discussions with the new parks agency.  A portion of Chief 
Blackbird's reservation is inside the boundary of the Riding 
Mountain National Park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The town of Dauphin is also concerned about the new agency 
because of the water supply.  Their water supply comes from the 
park.  They were there before the park came into existence. 
Obviously they should have some historical rights to water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another concern is the decision of Parks Canada to clear cut 
80,000 mature white spruce trees from inside the boundaries of 
the national park.  Has anyone ever heard of that, cutting down 
80,000 mature white spruce trees inside a national park in this 
country?  I thought parks were to preserve our forests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once in a while we hear the threat from Parks Canada that it 
will charge users of the provincial trunk highway, which travels 
north and south through the national park.  It is a direct access 
road between Dauphin and Brandon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last concern that I will mention concerns the historical 
rights of access to a road closed by the park during the 1960s 
which connects the towns of Grandview and Rossburn.  This was 
done without any consultation with the local people.  Currently 
there are seven municipalities which have lobbied hard to have 
the access road re-opened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will close by saying that these and other decisions made over 
the last many years continue to puzzle the people in my 
constituency.  The people of Dauphin—Swan River want to see more 
transparency in how decisions are made.  People want to be 
involved in the process and they want the process to be honest. 
They do not want consultation and then see something totally 
different written on paper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the problems is that the park superintendent has too much 
power.  At the present time the park superintendent or the 
director general has total authority within the boundaries of the 
park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I challenge the new Parks Canada Agency to put into practice its 
proposal for enhancing accountability to Canadians.  After all, 
it is the taxpayers of Canada who own the parks. 
<P><A NAME="LINK55"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney—Alouette, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I listened with great interest to my colleague's speech 
and the examples which he gave about the parks in his riding and 
how this bill would affect the individuals within his riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask if he might give us a little more detail about his 
support for the bill.  I would also ask what his opinion is on 
the interventions made earlier concerning the subcontracting 
clause in terms of the requirement of all individuals having to 
speak French even if they are not directly involved in providing 
a service to individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Inky Mark:</B>  Mr. Speaker, one of my biggest concerns 
with respect to accountability is:  Where does one go when there 
is a problem with Parks Canada?  Even though the process is in 
place, we have all the stakeholders, the round tables are 
established and the specific groups are organized, somewhere 
throughout this process it can be totally sabotaged.  I say 
sabotaged seriously because, unfortunately, we do not control the 
final documentation or the final reports that are written about 
the discussions that take place at the round tables. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sometimes I feel that it is almost like playing politics with 
the people who live in the parks and the surrounding areas.  It 
almost appears as if they are trying to keep these people busy. 
Maybe the people will not complain as much if they are given 
access to the discussions, so they let them discuss the issues. 
But they know what they are going to do when the consultation 
process is finished.

I know that the member's constituents are aware of the fact that 
as mayor of Dauphin, Manitoba he worked very hard on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure they are also aware that he continues to work very 
hard on their behalf, particularly with respect to the 
complications surrounding all the issues involving the Riding 
Mountain National Park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the major problems that has been relayed to us by the 
member is the whole issue of how the parks are managed.  They are 
run almost like a fiefdom.  The Riding Mountain National Park is 
an absolutely classic example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The direction of the road was changed at the town site on the 
south end that intersects the park going from south to north. 
The town site has basically been isolated.  The commercial 
ventures in that area are suffering dreadfully.  The parking lots 
in the area that were formerly overflowing on July 1 and on other 
holidays are all but empty even on what should be the busiest 
days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The park fee structure that has been established in the area and 
the way in which fees are collected has fundamentally driven 
business outside the park.  Yet, at the same time, Parks Canada 
is saying “We are not going to allow a renewal of leases in 
perpetuity”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure the member has some things to say on this subject

bill.  I may be coming at this from a slightly different 
perspective than even some of my Reform colleagues, certainly a 
different perspective from many members of this House, but I come 
at it from this point of view for a very good reason. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I live in northwest British Columbia.  The riding I represent, 
as members know, is Skeena.  As they are probably aware, there 
has been a significant amount of debate in British Columbia over 
the whole issue of the creation of parks and so on, to the extent 
where many people, particularly in rural British Columbia, and I 
would imagine that it is similar in other rural parts of Canada, 
are becoming increasingly uncomfortable with the whole notion of 
parks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I imagine that I am not unlike most Canadians.  I grew up with a 
great sense of pride in Canada's national parks system.  We took 
the care and the foresight to preserve parts of our country in 
perpetuity.  There was only going to be human activity in the 
sense of viewing the wildlife, camping and so on.  There was to 
be no other human activity in those areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I talk about human activity, I am of course referring to 
mining and industrial activity.  I am referring to towns being 
created and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The experience in British Columbia has been more and more 
negative.  Let me explain.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provincial government in British Columbia is committed to 
turning 12% of the province into parkland.  Mr. Speaker, I know 
you are not from British Columbia, but I also know you have 
probably had the occasion to fly over the province.  On a clear 
day it is readily available for anybody to see that most of the 
province is a park by virtue of the fact that our geography makes 
it impossible for anything to happen on about 40% of the land 
base in that province.  It is glaciers.  It is mountain tops.  It 
is inaccessible areas that are rugged and difficult for human 
beings to access.  For all intents and purposes it will be left 
alone for all times.  That is almost half the province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In its infinite wisdom the NDP government in British Columbia is 
intent on turning 12% of British Columbia into parkland.  Is it 
talking about glaciers?  Is it talking about mountain tops?   Is 
it talking about areas which are already inaccessible?  No.  To 
some degree it is talking about the areas that will never be used 
by human beings anyway, but for the most part it is talking about 
the valley bottoms, the forest land and the land base that is 
productive or potentially productive.  I have a great deal of 
difficulty with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, we are so wealthy as a province that we can afford 
to leave $10 billion worth of copper cobalt in the ground in 
Tulsequah to preserve it as a world heritage site, whatever that 
means, for all times and to forgo the economic prosperity and 
wealth creation that would have resulted from that mine 
development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is estimated by the business community in British Columbia 
that it would have resulted in about 2,000 full time, high paying 
jobs.  We are talking about $25 an hour jobs on the ground at the 
mine site and with the standard multiplier effect probably 
another 4,000 jobs in the province in businesses and industries 
to support the mining industry.  Those are gone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>CBC and CTV cannot go around with television cameras and their 
microphones to interview people who lost their jobs because 
nobody lost their jobs.  It was not like Cassiar, a mining town 
that closed down in my riding.  It had been there for a long time 
and the pain and suffering caused by this ridiculous decision 
could actually be seen.  No.  Those people cannot be interviewed 
because we do not know who they would have been, but we know for 
sure that those jobs would have been there.  They are lost for 
all time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have another example to give, Moresby Island in the Queen 
Charlotte Islands.  Back in the mid-eighties there was a lot of 
controversy concerning logging on South Moresby.  We had the 
likes of the Sierra Foundation, the Earth First people, every 
environmental organization possible, along with significant parts 
of the aboriginal population decrying logging on South Moresby. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>David Suzuki made a film about logging on South Moresby in which 
he showed his concern that the black bears may actually be forced 
off Lyell Island.  Then it was pointed out to him that black 
bears did not live on Lyell Island and he had a difficult time 
explaining how he could have taken film footage and pawned it off 
on Canadians as representative of Lyell Island when in fact it 
was not the case.  It was a blatant lie. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the kind of thing the environmental movement engages in 
all the time.  It engages in lies and mistruths, scaremongering 
tactics, trying to convince Canadians that the sky is falling. It 
has been largely successful, particularly in large metropolitan 
areas of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any even the environmental movement persuaded both the 
provincial and federal governments to suspend all logging on 
South Moresby and to create a new national park.  Is this going 
to be a wonderful thing?  Is this going to be great?  I hope 
there are people in Sandspit today watching this debate on 
television because I know how important the issue is for them.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This small but vibrant logging community that had existed for 
several decades was all but obliterated by this decision.  The 
politicians of the day said that the economic focus for Sandspit 
and South Moresby would change from logging into tourism.  What a 
joke.  What a laugh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can go to Sandspit and ask the people there how much tourism 
they get.  Parks Canada employees have built themselves a little 
fiefdom there at taxpayers' expense.  They have a beautiful 
lodge. It is the only structure that is allowed within the park 
because it belongs to Parks Canada.  Parks Canada employees are 
on what I liken to a year round vacation at taxpayers' expense. 
The only thing they do is limit the people that go into this 
so-called park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have made it difficult for anybody to access the park. They 
have a waiting list.  They only allow 2,000 people a year or 
thereabouts into the park.  One has to phone ahead to make a 
reservation a year in advance as if going to some high class 
hotel.  I can see the parallel.  One has to be a very wealthy 
person to afford the terms and conditions that Parks Canada has 
placed on anybody going into that park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why I have a difficult time listening to the government 
talking about bringing in legislation to create new parks.  I 
like the idea of conserving parts of our land basin for future 
generations and leaving it untouched.  However I do not like the 
idea of creating little fiefdoms for Parks Canada bureaucrats to 
go around telling Canadians what they can and cannot do and to 
have my taxpayer's dollars and the hard earned taxpayers' dollars 
of other Canadians spent on building grand lodges, flying around 
on float planes and doing all the things most of us can only 
dream of doing.  We would like to be able to enjoy the wilderness 
like Parks Canada people can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why I have a difficult time supporting the legislation. 
That is why the people in my riding, the people in my province, 
have a difficult time with the whole notion of parks.  It is not 
because we do not want to see a part of our heritage preserved 
and protected for our children and their children, for future 
generations.  It is just that we are becoming increasingly 
sceptical and doubtful that it will happen under the guise of 
Parks Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see it as another giant boondoggle of the federal government 
consuming huge amounts of federal taxpayers' money and delivering 
no tangible benefits to the people of Canada and, more important, 
to the people in the residual communities where they are so much 
affected by Parks Canada dictates of the day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am looking forward to any questions members on the other side 
may have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Questions and 
comments.  Since there are no questions and comments we will 
continue with debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am little bit slow today.  I 
wonder whether we could revert to questions and comments and I 
could ask the hon. member a question or two.  Would that require 
unanimous consent?

for Elk Island have the unanimous consent of the House to revert 
to questions and comments?

order.  I could not follow the hon. member's comment.  I want to 
know what he said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The member for Elk 
Island requested unanimous consent of the House to revert to 
questions and comments.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I just 
assumed Liberal members opposite would have some piercing 
questions for my colleague.  I was waiting for them to rise but 
none of them did.  My apologies for not jumping up and trying to 
be recognized ahead of the Liberals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a national park in my own riding.  One thing that is a 
big issue in Elk Island, the home of Elk Island National Park, is 
that local people actually started that park.  They got it going, 
organized it and eventually made a golf course in it.  They have 
had a ongoing fight with bureaucracy in Ottawa as to how the park 
should operate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ottawa sent them a message that they had to close the road 
through the park.  A lot of seniors were involved in that park 
from the beginning.  Some of them are unable now to ride 
bicycles.  They are 85 years old, for heaven's sake, but they 
still like to take a ride through the park and enjoy it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are others with limited financial abilities who want to 
participate in the park they helped to build.  Lo and behold in 
their senior years the very park they built is closed to them 
because they cannot afford to go there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have control.  We have taxation.  We have limitations on the 
way these people can use their parks.  In my view there is too 
much control from distant Ottawa over parks that we want to 
enjoy, that we have developed, that really belong to the people. 
Suddenly parks have become an exclusive domain of the rich and 
the mighty and government bureaucrats.  I would like my colleague 
to comment on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I tell my hon. friend that 
it is worse than he thought.  The reason is that I am convinced 
the bureaucracy of Parks Canada is staffed and populated with 
radical environmentalists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people in essence are anti-human.  That is why they do not 
want human beings in these parks.  They care more about bugs and 
slugs than they do about people.  That is the reality of it. 
David Suzuki, a leading light in the environmental movement, 
posited a few months ago that in order for the world to survive 
there had to be a mass die off of human beings.  We invited him 
to lead the way but so far he has not taken the challenge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the kind of attitude that pervades the bureaucracy at 
Parks Canada.  It is the kind of attitude that pervades the 
environmental movement.  These are largely far left political 
operatives who have lost the battle on the main front because 
communism as we know it is pretty much dead all over the world. 
They are trying to come through the back door and the 
environmental movement is a very effective way for them to do 
that.  That is the reality of it.

<P><A NAME="LINK94"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the largest service contract in Canadian history has 
been awarded to Bombardier without competitive bidding.  The 
whole thing was hammered out behind closed doors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last November the official opposition sought access to documents 
on this deal. We filed an access to information request.  We 
asked again in February, in March, in April, in May, and no 
response. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is it that the Prime Minister is trying to hide by blocking 
every attempt to get full disclosure on this deal? 
<P><A NAME="LINK95"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, there was a public announcement made by the Minister of 
National Defence in 1996 when the Government of Canada was trying 
to find a solution to make sure that the base at Moose Jaw would 
be in operation.  There was pressure put on the government by the 
premier of Saskatchewan and the premier of Alberta.  We made an 
application to NATO to make sure that the base could be used for 
training in Canada. There was a public announcement at that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is only months later that the contract was awarded when there 
was no interest at all by any other company.  It is a consortium 
of many companies, some from Edmonton, Alberta, some from 
Winnipeg, Manitoba.  It is a contract that will create— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The hon. Leader of the Opposition. 
<P><A NAME="LINK96"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, you would think when the government was awarding the 
largest service contract in history and giving it to a party with 
close ties to the Liberal Party and with close family ties to the 
Prime Minister, that it would— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  We are getting fairly close, my colleagues. 
Be quite judicious in the choice of words.  I ask the hon. Leader 
of the Opposition to put his question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning:</B>  Mr. Speaker, you would think with a 
contract with these characteristics that the government would 
endeavour to scrupulously follow the rules, but it did not.  It 
bypassed the rules on competitive bidding.  It bypassed the rules 
on public disclosure of sole source contracts.  Now the Prime 
Minister ignores access to information requests on this deal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is it about this deal that the Prime Minister is 
endeavouring to hide?

</P>
<P><A NAME="LINK97"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, on March 24 the department gave a briefing to the Reform 
Party on this contract.  It was a very important initiative of 
the private sector to make sure the countries that wanted to 
train in Canada had the proper services.  I invite the Leader of 
the Opposition to repeat his speech in Moose Jaw, Cold Lake, 
Edmonton and Winnipeg where a lot of jobs would be created. 
<P><A NAME="LINK98"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would be happy to repeat the speech in those places 
where they voted more for Reform than they ever did for the 
government.  No wonder the private sector was anxious to get this 
deal.  This deal is one in which if profits are made, Bombardier 
gets to keep them, but if the losses are big enough, the public 
gets to pick up the tab.  It is also a $2.85 billion dollar 
project.  That is four times the budget of Prince Edward Island. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will ask the Prime Minister again.  On a deal as sensitive and 
as big as this, why would the government not scrupulously follow 
all the procurement rules? 
<P><A NAME="LINK99"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, we followed all the rules. It was examined carefully and 
approved by Treasury Board. It was in the best interests of 
creating economic activity in western Canada.  If the leader of 
the Reform Party has no interest in the economy of western 
Canada, that is fine.  As far as enjoying himself in the dirt, I 
know that he loves it and I do not expect him to change. 
<P><A NAME="LINK100"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
there is another rule bender.  The former commander of Canada's 
air command, Lieutenant-General David Huddleston took a job at 
Bombardier and brokered the multibillion dollar sweetheart deal 
with the Canadian government, this Liberal government.  He took 
the job only seven months after leaving the air force.  This is a 
clear violation of the conflict of interest code and the cooling 
off period, and the minister knows it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are there any rules the government did not break when it awarded 
Bombardier— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The hon. Minister of National Defence. 
<P><A NAME="LINK101"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it has been said time and time again that 
there were no rules broken.  This was handled in the proper 
fashion.  As for the former air chief, all of the rules with 
respect to conflict of interest were followed.  There was no 
lobbying done by that individual anywhere within the period of 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, this decision was taken about two years ago. In 
fact earlier this year the Reform Party had every opportunity to 
look at the records. It was offered to Reform members and they 
refused to do that. Instead they want to get up today and smear 
what is a very good deal that creates a lot of jobs in western 
Canada and saves the base— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The hon. member for Calgary Northeast. 
<P><A NAME="LINK102"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the facts speak for themselves.  The conflict of interest code 
makes it clear that there is a cooling off period of one year and 
he violated it.  How can the minister deny this is a conflict of 
interest and that it makes this sweetheart deal to Bombardier 
look worse than it already did? 
<P><A NAME="LINK103"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it would be interesting to see if the 
hon. member wants to repeat that outside the House because there 
was no violation of the conflict of interest code.  All those 
things are watched very closely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a good deal for Canadians.  It saves $200 million over 
20 years. 
There was no other consortium of companies that would likely put 
a project of this magnitude together.  We had a time deadline in 
which to get this in to NATO.  A decision had to be made or we 
would have lost Moose Jaw.  We would have lost over 5,000 person 
years of employment in western Canada.

the member does not understand the process.  Ministers have asked

Edmonton to examine all the options we put before them and to 
report back to the ministers so a decision can be made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of leadership, it is as a result of the leadership of

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (Charlotte, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, indeed I 
understand the process.  My question is for the Prime Minister. 
The Prime Minister understands as well because he in fact is the 
one who put the health minister where he is in the front row of 
those benches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the Prime Minister take some leadership, stand in the House 
and give the health minister the liberty to go in there with the

<P><A NAME="LINK121"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
there is a good process in place.  Discussions are under way 
among officials in Edmonton.  They are examining and fleshing all 
options which ministers will then consider.  I suggest the member 
await the conclusion of that very good process. 
<P><A NAME="LINK122"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, in fact in

there is a process going on in which a number of options are 
being examined by officials.  I think the member would be well

act responsibly in this matter. 
<P><A NAME="LINK124"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, yesterday

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I think the member has touched upon something here.  Yesterday 
the representatives of certain groups left quite happy with the 
process.  Today they are saying something else.  I do not think 
we should assess this issue on the basis of an hour by hour 
reaction of certain people to the meeting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a negotiation in Edmonton.  It is an assessment and 
examination by officials who will put facts before ministers for 
decision.  That is the way governments act when they act 
responsibly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge the member to let this process come to a conclusion.  I 
am confident that it will produce a result that is in the 
interest of all those who got hepatitis C through the blood 
system.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of the examples we have provided him with, the facts

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources

government's position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have known all along that it would be extremely important to 
assess the impact of such a fundamental reform of the employment 
insurance system on all citizens, to make sure that the system 
is serving them well and generating the desired type of 
employment in those regions where unemployment is the highest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, no positive or constructive suggestions to help 
unemployed Canadians re-enter the workforce have come from across

possible. 
<P><A NAME="LINK139"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, does the 
minister not realize that, while he is refusing to use the 
existing surplus in the EI fund to improve the employment 
insurance plan, he is having the wool pulled over his eyes by 
his colleague, the Minister of Finance, who is devising ways to 
use this surplus to lower taxes?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Marlene Jennings (Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, last year the solicitor general introduced 
provisions permitting accelerated parole for first time 
non-violent offenders.  Unfortunately, some organized crime 
offenders have used these provisions to get parole before serving 
one-sixth of their sentence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know what the solicitor general plans to do to 
fix this. 
<P><A NAME="LINK167"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to thank the member for her question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I would point out that there is already a provision that 
allows the courts to order that parole not be considered until 
50% of the sentence is served.  Originally it was thought that 
would deal with this issue.  It has not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result, I have sought the support, and received it, of the 
justice committee, which will be introducing legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we are conducting the Corrections and Conditional Release 
Act review I would invite all members of parliament to 
participate in that exercise to make sure that Canada continues 
to lead the world in corrections.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, in 
1955 England and Canada conspired in a cover-up to deny Hong Kong 
veterans their right to fair settlement with Japan for wartime 
enslavement.  This appalling act was perpetrated by the very 
country the veterans fought and died for.

Hong Kong veterans' enslavement by Japan?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, during the treaty negotiations in 1952 a 
compensation package was worked out to honour the incredible 
sacrifice the Hong Kong Canadian contingent made in that serious 
battle.  We are continuing to work on it.  Once the treaty is 
signed there is no other legal recourse to pursue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the hon. member to use the kind of exploitive language he is 
using does not do proper honour to the people who gave their 
lives in Hong Kong.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>THE LATE ROBERT LORNE MCCUISH 
</H3><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK172"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (Charlotte, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, in rising 
to mark the passing of Lorne McCuish my colleagues in the 
Progressive Conservative caucus extend our sympathy to Mrs. 
McCuish and to her children and grandchildren. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Their loss of a husband, father and grandfather is difficult.  I 
hope they will draw comfort and pride from the public service 
that Mr. McCuish rendered to the people of Prince George—Bulkley 
Valley during his career in municipal government and his service 
to the people of Canada through his election to the House of 
Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The measure of a member of parliament is not something easily 
expressed.  The consistently positive election results for Mr. 
McCuish say much about him and the gratitude of his community for 
his efforts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The constituents of Prince George—Bulkley Valley from 1979 to 
1988 were the beneficiaries of his feisty, tell it like it is 
style of politics.  I am sure Mr. Speaker remembers that.  He 
possessed a wonderful mischievous personality and was not the 
least bit squeamish about using it on anyone from big business to 
his caucus colleagues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of those mischievous pranks are legend in this House and I 
am sure Mr. Speaker has some memories of them. 
He had a wonderful sense of humour.  We recall one of the famous 
incidents. I believe that Lorne at one time was a member of the 
consumer affairs committee.  His granddaughter and he one day 
counted the raisins in the bran flakes because the company that 
produced these bran flakes was talking about two scoops of 
raisins.  It is a famous story. Lorne said “We opened a lot of 
boxes of these but we never did find two scoops”.  Apparently a 
few days later a truckload of Raisin Bran arrived at his 
parliamentary office.  That is just one of the many things he 
did.  Some of them I cannot mention in the House but he did have 
a great sense of humour.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lorne loved his work.  He realized that to love his work he had 
to have fun at it.  He did have fun at politics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lorne represented a very large riding, 322,000 square 
kilometres. He was like the travelling representative.  He always 
visited the remote corners of his riding to make sure he was in 
touch with his constituents, and in touch with them he was. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In expressing our gratitude for the public service of Lorne 
McCuish we would like to say thank you to his family for its 
understanding and for sharing him with the House and with the 
people of Canada. 
<P><A NAME="LINK173"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, today the government caucus joins with 
the House in paying tribute to the memory of Mr. Lorne McCuish 
who from 1979 to 1988 served as member of parliament for Prince 
George—Bulkley Valley. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like many British Columbians, Mr. McCuish was born in Winnipeg 
but was certainly at heart a true British Columbian.  He was 
raised in Vancouver before moving to Prince George in the 1950s. 
It was there that he became involved in public service to his 
community.  He gave almost 20 years of his life to public 
service, working for the greater good of British Columbians, 
particularly those in northern British Columbia, and of course 
the country at large. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First as an alderman and then as a parliamentarian he served his 
fellow citizens enthusiastically, energetically and certainly to 
the best of his ability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He ran for parliament for the Progressive Conservative Party in 
1979 and became the first person to represent the new Prince 
George—Bulkley Valley riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lorne made it his personal mission to serve the people of his 
riding fairly and honestly.  His neighbours responded to this 
deep commitment by electing him to the House three times before 
his retirement in 1988. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lorne will best be remembered for his tireless commitment to his 
constituents, not an easy task considering his riding was well 
over 100,000 square kilometres and at the outset did not contain 
a single federal government office.  The nearest federal building 
was a Canada employment centre in the neighbouring riding of 
Prince George—Peace River. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lorne had a solution to that problem.  He decided instead to 
take the government to the people and he would spend at least one 
week of every six travelling his constituency throughout northern 
British Columbia holding accessibility sessions in town halls, 
schools, libraries, hotels, community centres and church 
basements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His constituents both liked and respected him for his commitment 
and for his feisty, tell it like it is style. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On a personal note, he will certainly be remembered for his 
sense of humour and for his love of life.  He was famous in this 
Chamber for his practical jokes and indeed he was called one of 
the most mischievous MPs ever, but that was always done with good 
spirits and in a lighthearted way.  His personal philosophy was 
always to live life to its fullest, never to take himself or 
others too seriously and to live every day to the best. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. McCuish was a husband, a father of four and a grandfather of 
six, a legacy which will last far longer than any accomplishment 
of those of us in office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those of us who represent constituencies many miles from our 
nation's capital know what Lorne knew, that our work would not be 
possible without the support of our family and our friends at 
home.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As both a British Columbian and a Canadian, Lorne McCuish made 
an important contribution to our society as the member of 
parliament for Prince George—Bulkley Valley. I convey to the 
House on behalf of the Liberal caucus and constituents our 
deepest condolences to his family and to his friends. 
<P><A NAME="LINK174"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George—Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as the member of parliament for Prince George—Bulkley 
Valley, I knew Lorne McCuish.  I met him in 1965 when I joined 
the Kinsmen club and I feel privileged to pay tribute to our 
departed former member of parliament who served Canadians from 
1980 to 1988 in my riding of Prince George—Bulkley Valley. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lorne moved to Prince George in the early 1950s after serving 
with the RCAF in World War II.  From there he launched his career 
as an independent insurance adjuster.  Lorne was a tireless 
worker in the community, having worked for many charity 
organizations and service clubs, including the Kinsmen club where 
we met.  Lorne's volunteer efforts played a huge role in the 
building of Prince George into the great city it is now, a great 
place to live. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was an alderman for the city of Prince George from 1973 to 
1977.  During that time he gave freely of his time and energy to 
help in the planning of the emerging city of Prince George and 
all the infrastructure that was to come to make it the great city 
it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His integrity and devotion to work were an example to all. 
Lorne made in his career and in his life many friends and 
acquaintances.  He will be missed by those friends and 
acquaintances and of course by his family members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the riding of Prince George—Bulkley Valley and the 
Reform Party of Canada, I send our sincerest condolences to 
his family and friends and express our gratitude to Lorne McCuish 
for his many services to Canadians as he served the riding of 
Prince George—Bulkley Valley. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK175"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to join with my colleagues in the House of Commons in paying 
tribute to Lorne. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the honour of serving with him from 1984 to 1988, so I got 
to know him a little, at least during one term. He had been 
elected in 1979. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember that even before his election he was known as an 
excellent administrator. He joined the team of Joe Clark, whom 
he greatly admired. He did an outstanding job of representing 
the new riding of Prince George—Bulkley Valley. In fact, he was 
the first member to represent this riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the term when we served together I had the opportunity 
to work with him on the famous northern pipeline issue on 
various standing committees such as veterans affairs, consumer 
and corporate affairs as well as Indian affairs, because his was 
a very large riding where a number of first nations were 
established. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He used to say his sole purpose was to serve the people of his 
riding. That was more than a mission; it was a passion. He did 
not have national ambitions as he told us repeatedly. His sole 
ambition was to serve his constituents well. In that sense he 
had a rather unorthodox approach to the duties of an MP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He could, for instance, spend one week in the House of Commons 
and the next in his riding, not at his office but visiting every 
village, community and organization to get a feel for what people 
thought, and this for months on end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He liked to say “There are no government offices in my riding. 
I am the office for all the departments, by bringing services to 
my constituents”.  He was passionately fond of meeting the 
people of his riding.  He was, moreover, always elected by a 
heavy majority because people saw him as one of them.  They 
recognized him as a tireless worker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was a fervent supporter of Joe Clark.  At this very moment I 
bet he is sending Mr. Clark signals from the other side about a 
comeback.  He was disappointed to see his leader leave but 
remained faithful to his party.  He stayed for the 1984 election 
because he dreamed of being a government MP for at least one 
mandate, and he knew that the Conservatives had a good chance of 
forming the government in 1984. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He leaves his four children and their children to mourn his 
passing. 
I would like them to know just how proud they should be of him 
and how much he taught all MPs about loving our work, 
doing a good job of it and serving the public before anything 
else.

<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK176"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is an 
honour to represent the New Democratic caucus in remembering 
Lorne as a member of parliament and as an alderman in the city of 
Prince George. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I learned a great deal from Lorne McCuish.  He was elected in 
1979 and I was elected in 1980.  He taught me a great deal about 
how a member of parliament ought to operate, particularly in the 
constituency.  We shared a hallway. I spent many an evening with 
Lorne McCuish.  We talked about politics and work in the House of 
Commons and in various committees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was from Prince George and I am from Kamloops which meant 
that we spent many a flight together flying across Canada.  I can 
recall countless evenings in Vancouver.  In those days we were 
required to stay over because there were no same day flight 
connections to our respective communities from Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As others have indicated, I remember Lorne as a very humourous 
individual.  He always wanted to play a joke. The first time I 
saw him play a joke was when we were flying from Ottawa to 
Vancouver.  I asked him how he avoided getting into conversations 
with people he did not want to talk to.  Sometimes you sit beside 
a person who for whatever reason you would just as soon forget 
having a conversation with.  He told me a secret.  I do not know 
if he ever did it but I thought it was very funny. He said that I 
should take 10 inches of cord with me and when I decided I did 
not want to talk to somebody I should hang it out of my mouth. 
He said that nobody would ever talk to a person with a cord 
hanging out of his mouth and I suspect he was probably right. He 
would say things like that continuously.  He was a man of great 
humour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was talking with him one day about doing constituency work. As 
others have indicated, he would take one week out of six and go 
back to his constituency, a very vast area.  He held what he 
called availability sessions for people to come out and meet 
Lorne.  He was a very approachable individual.  He asked me to 
come along and join him for one of these visits, which I did. We 
got in a little trout fishing at the same time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember walking with Lorne down the streets of Vanderhoof and 
Fort St. James.  He knew every single person by name.  If he did 
not know them he would sort of mumble and they would think he 
knew their names.  I thought that was a rather ingenious 
approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was very popular and popular for an interesting reason.  He 
was prepared to say no to people if he could not help them.  He 
did not pretend he could help them. Nor did he slough it off. 
Delegations would come from our part of central British Columbia. 
To be fair I would try to be kind of nice to those folks but he 
would just say “No, we cannot help you.  We are not able to do 
anything.  We are not even particularly interested in trying to 
help you with that problem because we do not believe in it”. I 
had not met anybody like that. It was very refreshing.  It 
demonstrated that you do not always have to agree with people for 
them to respect you or for them to vote for you. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can think of a great number of things I learned from Lorne 
McCuish.  On top of that he was a very genuine, nice person.  He 
often spoke of his family very warmly. I know he wanted to spend 
more time with his family.  When he decided not to seek 
re-election it was because he had decided it was appropriate to 
spend time with his family and he actually meant it. A lot of 
people just say that.  In the Lorne McCuish style he meant that 
he wanted to spend more time with his children, his wife and his 
young grandchildren. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the New Democratic caucus, I extend sincere 
condolences to Lorne's family, in particular his wife, his 
children and his four grandchildren.  We remember him fondly.  He 
added a great deal of humanity to this place and I know his 
constituents loved him.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>PARKS CANADA ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK179">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-29, an 
act to establish the Parks Canada Agency and to amend other acts 
as a consequence, be read the third time and passed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK180"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
will be sharing my time with the hon. member for Wild Rose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It gives me great pleasure to speak on something that is dear to 
my heart and that is parks.  The last time I spoke in the House 
was on the Saguenay bill.  This time I am speaking on Bill C-29 
the Canada parks agency act that offers to a degree a newer and 
more reformed approach to maintaining our national treasures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is a nation blessed with natural wonders.  I represent 
the riding of Calgary East, a stone's throw away from the 
humbling beauty of Banff, Jasper and Yoho national parks.  I can 
say confidently that Calgarians and all Canadians are proud of 
the national parks.  Our country's beauty is rarely paralleled in 
any other nation and that can be seen in our bustling tourism 
industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our national parks and sites attract over 24 million visitors a 
year and contribute over $2 billion annually to the economy.  My 
hope is that this bill will allow our national parks to flourish 
while at the same time free off cumbersome government 
bureaucracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-29 calls for the creation of a new agency, the Canada 
parks agency.  In this case I see some merit in the establishment 
of the parks agency.  Let me explain why. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parks Canada is currently responsible for our country's 38 
national parks and among other things 131 national historic 
sites.  It manages over 225,000 square kilometres of Canada's 
natural and cultural heritage and employs roughly 5,000 people. 
At present, responsibility for Parks Canada falls under the 
Department of Canadian Heritage through the Secretary of State 
for Parks and reports to the heritage minister. For this reason 
the new agency will be held accountable through the minister to 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No doubt this will contribute to more efficiency and will 
hopefully lead to a decrease in the fees Canadians pay to gain 
access to our national parks. I have heard from my constituents 
on numerous occasions that the costs of visiting places like 
Banff and Jasper are becoming too high.  These are treasures of 
Canada and belong to the people of Canada.  We have an obligation 
to the people of Canada to make it as affordable as possible for 
families to take advantage of the beauty of this nation.  It 
belongs to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is nice to see once in a while something positive come from 
the other side.  A parks agency is one such proposal, although we 
do have some reservations on this.  The parks agency will be able 
to raise and keep its own revenues.  It will have access to a $10 
billion parks and historic sites account which it will have to 
repay to the crown with interest from revenues generated, making 
the agency accountable. As well third party operators will be 
permitted to administer certain facilities hopefully providing 
increased revenues and efficiency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This new financial independence will allow revenues generated to 
flow back into the parks and sites.  This means that new parks 
will be created and those already in existence will be better 
served and maintained. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agency will be able to bargain directly with its employees 
and CEO and will have the authority to appoint employees and to 
establish terms and conditions of employment for agency staff. 
Hopefully this will afford the agency the flexibility to develop 
a human resource regime that is more responsive to the agency's 
operational environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general will be able to audit the agency at his 
discretion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-29 also commits the agency to hold consultations on a 
biennial basis.  This will allow Canadians to share their views 
on the agency's program and to participate in its management 
direction.

<A HREF="#LINKT55"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, the agency will consult directly with parties that may 
be affected by any new fees.  As I mentioned before, Canadians 
are getting a little upset at the high cost of park entrance 
fees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bottom line is that parliament, the auditor general and most 
importantly, the Canadian people will be able to hold this new 
agency accountable. What we have here is a bill asking for the 
creation of an agency that will be self-sufficient, more 
efficient, more flexible and fully accountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also my hope that this agency will contribute to the 
maintenance and enhancement of Canada's natural environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been fortunate enough to visit many parks around the 
world.  As a matter of fact I was born near the foot of one of 
the more famous sites in the world, the Ngorongoro crater in 
Tanzania.  Because of these reasons, national parks are very dear 
to me.  It is important to protect the environment and our 
treasures not only for the Canadian people but for the world.  We 
are the custodian of these national treasures for the people of 
the world.  This is why this is very dear to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to see the responsible management of these 
resources for future generations.  I would caution that I want to 
see responsible management of these great treasures for the 
people of the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have gone across the world and have seen great parks but I 
have also seen parks which have fallen in disarray.  It saddens 
me when I see that happening.  Therefore, when something such as 
this parks agency is proposed, then I feel there is merit to it 
and am willing to support it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition is committed to having our national 
parks and heritage sites administered in an accountable, 
efficient and cost effective manner.  For the reasons outlined, I 
see little reason why I should not support Bill C-29. 
<P><A NAME="LINK181"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak to Bill C-29 since it will directly affect Banff 
National Park which is in my riding of Wild Rose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of this bill is to establish the parks Canada agency 
to administer and protect national parks, historic sites and 
other heritage areas.  Ideally the rationale for a parks agency 
is that it would simplify the organizational structure, improve 
administrative efficiency and allow more flexible staffing and 
financial procedures. At first glance there are a few positive 
aspects to this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the new agency will remain accountable through the 
Minister of Canadian Heritage to parliament, as all agencies 
should be accountable to someone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the new agency will fall under the Access to Information 
Act.  It can be audited by the auditor general, unlike agencies 
in other pieces of legislation which the auditor general does not 
seem to be able to touch such as the infamous and protected 
Canadian Wheat Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, Bill C-29 was supposed to commit the agency to 
consultations on a biennial basis and to consult directly with 
parties that may be affected by any new fees. As of last night's 
amendments, this will now be in the form of round tables held by 
the minister.  Obviously the government felt that more power must 
be kept within the cabinet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, the agency will be more efficient.  It will be able to 
raise and keep its own revenues, bargain directly with its 
employees, permit third party operators to administer certain 
facilities, and allow the CEO to set terms and conditions of 
employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the agency will have access to a new $10 million parks 
and historic sites account. Any funds drawn from this account 
will be repayable to the crown with interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All in all, Reformers are committed to having our national parks 
and heritage sites administered in an accountable, efficient and 
cost effective manner.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support the agency's objective of cost recovery, while at the 
same time ensuring that fees at Canada's national parks and 
heritage sites do not become prohibitively expensive.  This is 
one amendment that should have passed.  I wish it had passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The majority of MPs voted down a motion that would have set up a 
two-tier park price whereby local area residents would pay a 
lower entrance fee.  The lower fee was turned down, despite 
warnings that soon only the wealthy would be able to afford park 
prices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fees have risen dramatically in Banff National Park over the 
past five years.  Many of the letters I receive about this 
particular issue concern the increase in fees.  The people of 
that area are not happy.  Seniors groups are extremely unhappy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Time and time again carloads of seniors have driven to Banff 
just for a nice afternoon out, but they turned around when they 
reached the gate because seniors cannot afford to pay the fees. 
Tourists from all over the world have noticed a big increase in 
fees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main problem with this bill is its lack of detail regarding 
how the agency will be financed and run, what the administrative 
costs of operating the agency will be and what portion of that 
cost might be financed by user fees.  All of this detail will 
not be known until the agency is set up.  I believe that detail 
should be taken care of prior to that happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As of now it has been reported that the agency is counting on 
receiving $70 million from user fees in fiscal year 1997-98 and 
an increased amount in subsequent years.  Therefore the agency 
will have to know exactly what consumers are willing to spend on 
our national parks and heritage sites because any miscalculation 
could hinder its functioning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The one main catch to this bill was highlighted last evening 
when the Liberal amendment designed to ensure bilingual services 
in Canada's national parks was passed.  I know that many of the 
people in Banff will really be upset, and so they should be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I often wonder why this Liberal government does not stop and 
realize that, for example, Banff has one of the highest number of 
new citizens.  These immigrants come to Banff.  Probably nine out 
of every ten are of oriental background.  There are numerous 
people who want to make that area their home.  They are 
immigrants and they speak neither French nor English. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People from Japan, Korea, Vietnam or some other country choose 
to make Banff their home.  They want to work there.  They went 
there as immigrants, they settled there and they love it. 
However, they will not even be able to get a job cutting the 
grass in the park, painting a fence or building protection around 
trees because they are not bilingual.  How ridiculous are we 
going to get in this parliament?  We are constantly passing laws 
that insist people must be bilingual in order to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is Banff.  A number of people out there do not speak 
French.  There are number of people who do not speak English. 
There are a number of people out there who are very fluent in a 
number of different languages.  There are a lot of good capable 
workers, however, members on that side of the House insist that 
they be bilingual.  It is getting just a little ridiculous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think of the days when I was on the farm.  One of the best 
milkers who came to take over the milking operation on our farm 
could not speak a word of English.  We could not even communicate 
for a while, except by motions, but did he ever do a job for us 
on that farm, and we could hardly communicate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To pass a law that says that is the way it has to be is really 
getting completely out of reach.  Immigrants continually come to 
this country.  Many settle in the west.  Many of them land in 
Banff National Park.  It will be very difficult for them to 
understand why, when they want to make Canada their home, when 
they want to contribute to the economy by working for a living 
and paying taxes, they cannot work because they do not speak both 
English and French.

</I></B></P><P align=left>What kind of mentality would come up with that kind of 
regulation?  Government members do not give it any thought, 
except when the time comes to vote on it and they jump up like 
little puppets and vote as the whip tells them to vote. 
Otherwise they will pay a healthy price for disobedience.  They 
continue down the same old path of not really caring what the 
bill is about or how it will affect individuals.  They only care 
what the whip says because they are good little Liberals and will 
always do what they are told. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As long as they keep doing that this country is going to keep 
going down the tube.  They are going to continue to chip away at 
these small areas and tell individuals that if they do not speak 
French and English they cannot get a job.  It is ridiculous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When is this government going to come to its senses?  Banff 
National Park is a beautiful place to work.  It is a beautiful 
place to earn a living.  If these people can communicate in 
Japanese and in other oriental languages they are going to be of 
real benefit to the park.  But they probably will not even be 
able to work for the park because, the way I read it, they have 
to be bilingual.  Is that not so?  They have to be bilingual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Congratulations, Liberals.  Congratulations to all the trained 
seals on the back rows who keep approving bills when they do not 
even know what they are about.  They ought to open up their 
brains and their minds to learn about what is going on.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, my hon. colleague is from Alberta and in his territory 
there are large numbers of parks and wilderness areas.  He knows 
very clearly the problems that our parks have had recently and 
also the problems they will face in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He mentioned that the moneys that will be used to ensure that 
subcontractors are bilingual will cause a major problem within 
our parks.  The ability of local people to earn revenues will be 
hampered.  In fact, the ability of the parks to function and 
generate revenues will be hampered.  They will not be able to 
safeguard the flora and fauna, which in many cases is under 
siege. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member feel that the money that is going to be lost by 
this ridiculous amendment the government is putting forward could 
best be spent in trying to preserve our parks?  If so, how would 
he preserve our parks?  What would he do, if he were the 
minister, to make a more intelligent parks agency act? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There seems to be an attitude on that side of the House.  They 
do not seem to understand that the national parks of this country 
belong to the people of Canada.  They do not belong to the 
Liberal government.  They do not belong to the government of the 
day, they belong to the people of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, the people of Canada should be able to enjoy these 
parks and that enjoyment should be affordable.  But the 
government squanders money on areas like bilingualism.  The 
government is going to make sure that the people who work in the 
parks are bilingual.  Those who are not bilingual will be totally 
confused and very upset.  They very much want to work for the 
parks because they have a talent.  That is why they were 
attracted to the mountains and to the parks.  But this 
legislation will prevent that from happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of Canada should be able to enjoy their property in a 
better way than they do today.  Fees chase them away.  Fees are 
up because certain costs have to be met.  Part of the cost is due 
to the fact that we have ridiculous legislation which says the 
workers have to be bilingual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hear a lot of nattering from across the floor, but I do not 
think they have even been to Banff.  They do not know what they 
are talking about.  I live in that country.  I know what I am 
talking about and I can guarantee that there are going to be a 
lot of unhappy people in Banff National Park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate those members on their big blunder.

my hon. friend, since we seem to have a lot of wildlife in the 
House and certainly an endangered species on the other side, some 
of which are green, and there is certainly a lot of old growth, 
if maybe this could not be the next park.  We already have 
official bilingualism in the House.  Maybe we could confine it 
here, rather than have it spread to the Northwest Territories, 
British Columbia and other places where there is absolutely no 
sense in having it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I could not agree more. 
The hon. member is right about one thing.  There are some old 
animals in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Probably the most important thing that the member mentioned is 
that there is an endangered species on that side because they 
continually shove things down the throats of Canadians. Canadians 
do not like it.  They are getting tired of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to continually insist that Canadians pay attention to 
that mighty bunch over there who say to the farmers in the west 
“You will do it with the wheat board, or else”.  They are the

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>NUNAVUT ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK186">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from June 1 consideration of the motion that 
Bill C-39, an act to amend the Nunavut Act and the Constitution 
Act, 1867, be read the third time and passed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK187"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure today to speak to Bill C-39, an act to 
amend the Nunavut Act.  This legislation will transfer powers to 
the new Nunavut assembly.  It will implement measures for 
territorial elections and the appointment of senators. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to talk to a number of issues today, but I want to 
address the long history of dealing with the aboriginal people in 
a way which has created a welfare state.  This dependency has 
compromised the health and welfare of aboriginal people to a 
great extent.  They have some of the worst health care in this 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill will allow the government to appoint senators for the 
Nunavut region.  That concerns democracy.  Should the people who 
represent the people of Nunavut be appointed or elected? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1545"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT60"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT60"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1545

<A HREF="#LINKT59"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have always maintained that the election of individuals 
representing the people should be the way to go.  An appointment 
circumvents the democratic principles of the country and prevents 
individual members of the community from getting the person they 
want as opposed to the person a prime minister would like to 
have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Prime Minister would take a courageous leadership role in 
ensuring that from now on senators would be elected by the people 
and for the people, he would be doing an enormous service to 
institute an element of democracy in the House that it so 
desperately needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For years we in the Reform Party and others in the community 
have asked for a triple E Senate, an elected, equal and effective 
Senate, a Senate that would bring power to the people, not power 
to the leadership of a political party.  We have asked for that 
repeatedly.  If the Prime Minister would take that initiative he 
would be demonstrating enormous courage and leadership.  I 
implore him to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the powers of the Northwest Territories, those 
powers will be transferred to Nunavut through the bill.  I want 
to get to the heart of my speech, the real reason I wanted to 
speak on Bill C-39. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For decades we have created an institutionalized welfare state. 
The institutionalized welfare state has been put forth through 
the Indian Act, an act that is discriminatory. It balkanizes, 
increases prejudice and keeps the boot on the neck of aboriginal 
people by preventing them from having the ability and the power 
to develop, to be the best they can be and to be masters of their 
destiny. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have circumvented that by creating a separate act for a 
separate group of people.  That attitude has compromised the 
health and welfare of hundreds of thousands of aboriginal people 
and will continue to do so as long as we treat aboriginal people 
as separate and distinct members of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is possible and advisable to ensure that aboriginal people 
are integrated into Canadian society and not assimilated. 
Assimilation would destroy the incredible culture and language 
they have to teach all of us.  Integration will enable them to 
become integrated, functional members of Canadian society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the situation in New Brunswick today where 
aboriginal people are flaunting the law and cutting down trees. 
The response from those aboriginal people is that there is no way 
they will allow anybody to take away their chain saws.  For the 
first time in their lives they have been able to earn a living, 
generate funds and provide for themselves and their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The result has been a dramatic decrease in substance abuse and 
violence.  The community is stronger.  Individuals have a sense 
of community.  They are pursuing that course because they have 
the ability to generate the revenues, the funds and the 
wherewithal to be masters of their destiny and to take care of 
themselves, as opposed to the situation we have today where 
aboriginal communities are forced to look to the government to be 
their paternal father, the one who will take care of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the House are members of different ethnic groups.  If any 
of us were to come under the Indian Act and be forced to ask 
permission from the Government of Canada to do a number of 
things, what would happen? If we were forbidden to own land or we 
had to ask permission to get services, what would happen?  If we 
had a separate group of services and opportunities different from 
the rest of the country where things were given to us instead of 
our being forced to earn it, if instead of being given the 
opportunity to take care of ourselves and the chance to have the 
tools to take care of ourselves, and if money were given to us, 
what would happen?

</I></B></P><P align=left>We would suffer from alcohol abuse.  We would suffer from other 
substance abuse.  We would suffer from sexual abuse and violence. 
Our communities would be in tatters.  If a system were created 
where things were given freely to no matter whom, it would erode 
the very soul of a person.  As a result the society the person 
lives in would be eroded as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The situation on some reserves is appalling.  In my job as a 
member of parliament I have investigated allegations by members 
of reserves who have said that the resources their reserves are 
earning are disappearing.  It is alleged that those moneys are 
being taken by members of the reserves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Generally aboriginal and non-aboriginal people in leadership 
positions are alleged to be taking moneys that should be going 
directly to the people for education, health care and treatment 
programs and to enable them to have the tools and the power to 
stand on their feet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister of aboriginal affairs said there was no problem and 
that if I had a problem I could go to the RCMP.  The result is 
that the people on the ground, the average aboriginal people in 
the trenches, are being hammered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An aboriginal woman on a reserve I visited said that moneys 
which were supposed to go into schools had been taken by the 
leadership of her reserve.  If she went to the leadership she 
would be ostracized in her society.  If she went to the 
department of Indian affairs it would tell her to go to the 
leadership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What should that woman do?  Her children will be educated in a 
school that does not have the resources because the money has 
potentially been stolen.  Such people are caught between a rock 
and a hard place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not uncommon.  When I investigated allegations of 
misappropriation of funds on a reserve in my riding the minister 
said I could go to the RCMP.  Before that happened the people who 
were allegedly doing it, individuals on the reserve in positions 
of power, threatened to sue me to shut me up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happens to aboriginal people in that community who are 
seeing the money disappear and do not know where it goes?  There 
is no accountability.  There is no responsibility.  There is fear 
that if they complain they will be ostracized within their 
community or worse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They come to me.  I go to the minister.  The minister says that 
it is not a problem and asks me to go to the RCMP.  With the 
resources going into the Department of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development a significant amount of money is potentially 
in the wrong hands.  The Canadian taxpayer would be completely 
appalled by that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are we doing?  We are pursuing a course that will balkanize 
our country.  What will the Delgamuukw case that came down in 
British Columbia do?  It will drastically undermine crown 
ownership of 94% of B.C.'s land mass; put almost insurmountable 
hurdles in the way of the provincial government over land 
resource decisions; supplant common law with a new system of law 
in which equal credence is to be given to aboriginal cases, to 
the aboriginal perspective; and replace the longstanding rules of 
evidence in civil cases with two sets of rules, one for 
aboriginal cases and one for other cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The aboriginal title as defined by the court may be supplanted 
by other forms of land tenure only if there is rigid testament by 
the government and only if compensation is paid.  It failed to 
confirm in constitutional terms the right to make laws where they 
are fully vested in either parliament or provincial legislatures. 
It turned over to the federal government the right to exclusively 
legislate land management for natives on lands found to be 
covered by aboriginal title. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Delgamuukw case also prompted the first nations summit for 
an immediate freeze on development of land resources anywhere in 
British Columbia.  What did that do for aboriginal people who 
want to earn a living? 
It destroyed the ability of that land to be utilized for 
aboriginal people and for non-aboriginal people.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The attitude in the Delgamuukw case and in the federal 
government as in previous federal governments has been to divide, 
which does not bring aboriginal and non-aboriginal people 
together in an environment of mutual respect and tolerance, with 
a vision and goal of pursuing a common and united purpose for the 
betterment of the health and welfare of all people.  It pursues a 
course that will balkanize our country and will tear apart 
aboriginal and non-aboriginal communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has been the outcome?  As I mentioned earlier in my speech 
the health care parameters are appalling.  I have worked in 
emergency rooms and visited aboriginal reserves.  The incidence 
in some reserves of fetal alcohol syndrome approaches 60 per 
thousand live births.  The unemployment rate can be 50% or 
higher.  The incidence of diabetes is three times higher than 
that for non-aboriginals.  The incidence of infant mortality is 
much higher than for anyone else.  The birth rate is nearly 3% 
higher than in other communities.  The tuberculosis rate 
approaches third world levels.  Why? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the federal government not understand that the pursuit of 
separate developments is apartheid in Canada?  Does it not 
realize that will only fail?  If its actions are to work we would 
have seen that by now. Instead we have seen a decline in the 
health and welfare of aboriginal people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members should walk for a few minutes through the inner city of 
Vancouver and through some aboriginal communities.  They will see 
a scene that is reminiscent of a third world country.  This is 
not to say that some aboriginal communities do an outstanding job 
of providing for themselves and their people.  They have managed 
to do it because they have the ability to work with surrounding 
communities and the power to be the masters of their own destiny 
as we are in our communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is so wrong with giving aboriginal people the same 
municipal type powers as those of other communities?  What is so 
wrong with ensuring that the traditional rights, 
responsibilities, goals, objectives and cultural needs of 
aboriginal people are to be preserved in perpetuity? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would ensure that aboriginal people could engage in the 
cultural activities they have always engaged in for the 
betterment of their society.  What is so wrong with that? Instead 
we have a situation of separate development, balkanization of my 
province of British Columbia and balkanization of our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nunavut may proceed in that direction.  Furthermore who will pay 
for it?  Will the moneys be generated there?  The federal 
government and the Canadian taxpayer will foot the bill for 
separate development that has been demonstrated so clearly to 
fail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot emphasize enough that the apartheid, the attitude of 
balkanization of the country, the Indian Act and the department 
of Indian affairs and its goal of creating separate development 
for separate peoples will compromise everyone but particularly 
aboriginal people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Skeena has spoken eloquently many times and 
produced many different constructive solutions to the government 
along the lines of aboriginal affairs under the umbrella of 
mutual respect, understanding and tolerance, with an objective to 
move forward to develop as individual societies linked together 
with the common purpose of a united, positive and healthier 
future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is doing a separate development which, without 
accountability, will only increase the problems of aboriginal 
communities today. 
If for once I could get the minister of Indian affairs to sit in 
the House or to come with us to see what is happening in the 
reserves, in the trenches, she might change her tune.  It does 
not serve her to meet the aboriginal leadership alone, because 
the aboriginal leadership has a certain goal.  It is forced 
perhaps by circumstance to pursue an objective that is 
politically correct, given the current politically correct 
attitude we see today. It is this politically correct attitude 
that we have toward aboriginal people, this attitude toward 
separate development, that is causing enormous problems for 
aboriginal people.

That is the objective we should have.  Those are the people we

separate mini states within a province, say in British Columbia

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Finlay (Oxford, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I listened 
quite carefully to my hon. colleague from Esquimalt—Juan de 
Fuca. I am struck by a couplet of Pope: “A little learning is a 
dangerous thing; Drink deep, or taste not the Pierian spring”. I 
am very disappointed in my colleague.  I have always felt he is a 
man of honour and a man of some intellect, but he has talked a 
deal of nonsense this afternoon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not sure how much he knows about the bill.  I was in 
Nunavut two weeks ago today.  The weather was a little colder 
than here.  Eighty-five per cent are Inuit and speak Inuktitut, 
which will be the official language of Nunavut.  There was a 
feeling of springtime, a feeling of confidence and a feeling of 
looking at new things. Nunavut will be proclaimed April 1, 1999 
and the Inuit have been working some 20 years toward this point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a referendum and a vote in 1982 in which they 
expressed their strong approval for continuing; the same again in 
1992. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member not realize there is a distinction or difference 
between aboriginals and reserves and what the act is going to 
provide in the eastern Arctic?  Much of what he says is quite 
true. Being a member of the aboriginal affairs and northern 
development committee for the last two and a half years, I know 
they are true. 
I also know he does not appear to know what he is talking about 
with respect to Nunavut.  I do not suppose he is going to admit 
that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report of the committee on aboriginal peoples made the 
comment about respect, recognition, sharing and responsibility. 
It is the Inuit themselves who want this act to be proclaimed and 
who want to govern themselves.  They will be a public government 
so they will obviously be accountable and they will obviously be 
assimilated.  I do not like the term, but as far as that goes 
they will be assimilated about as much as the people of British 
Columbia or Prince Edward Island have been assimilated into the 
Canadian mosaic.  That is what this act does.  That is what the 
department has been working toward.  I would like the member to 
acknowledge that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for 
the question.  The question that really has to be asked is 
whether the carving up of Canada will help aboriginal people. Who 
will pay for the development of Nunavut?  Who will pay for its 
establishment and bureaucracy?  Where is the accountability? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I use Nunavut as an example of what might happen in British 
Columbia with the Balkanization and the carving up of British 
Columbia into mini states.  That is exactly what will happen. It 
is what will happen with the division of a province into separate 
mini states with separate laws, rules and regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Aboriginal people want to be masters of their own destiny.  They 
want the power to do that.  But can they not do that within 
Canada? Can they not be equal partners in a country in which we 
are moving forward together?  This government and previous 
governments have taken away power from the people and put them 
out separately in another field to develop by themselves, to go 
through different rules and regulations for their own 
development.  As a result, many resources have not reached them. 
As a result, we have created an institutionalized welfare state. 
That is the biggest crime of all and that is what has to be 
addressed today.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron (Fundy—Royal, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want 
to discuss a point used during the hon. member's speech. I 
consider him to be a very constructive member of parliament who 
definitely wants to contribute in a very positive way to the 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993 Reformers were first elected in substantial numbers 
primarily in the western provinces.  When they came to the House 
they said they were interested in providing opposition politics 
and in contributing to the process in the most constructive 
manner possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last night I found myself in a very difficult situation.  Before 
I voted on Reform's amendment to Bill C-39 I looked at our 
rationale for voting against it.  The rationale we were given 
initially was that Reform wanted an elected senator for Nunavut. 
As someone who fundamentally believes we need more democracy in 
the politically system, I believe that senators should at the 
very least be elected.  I would love to have supported the Reform 
amendment last night. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment was that this House decline to give third reading 
to Bill C-39, an act to amend the Nunavut Act and the 
Constitution Act, 1867, since the principle of the bill does not 
guarantee that the government will select senators who have been 
lawfully elected in a territorial Senate election.  Had I 
supported Reform's amendment I would not be able to support Bill 
C-39.  I was forced to vote against having an elected senator 
because of how Reformers chose to word their amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the hon. member to work in a more constructive way within 
his caucus.  If the intent of Reformers is to be constructive, 
when they make amendments of this sort they should use language 
that would actually guarantee the election of senators, as was 
done in Alberta.  They should not decline the progress of a very 
important bill.  That is not constructive politics.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for 
Fundy—Royal who has always put forth quite a number of 
intelligent suggestions in this House in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the crisis taking place today among aboriginal communities 
there are three things that can be done, scrap the Indian Act, 
have a phasing out of the department of Indian affairs, and those 
moneys can be put into developing programs for the aboriginal 
people to deal with issues such as counselling, substance abuse, 
economic development, giving the aboriginal people the tools to 
become employable and take care of themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my hon. colleague from Fundy—Royal knows from his experience 
in the maritimes, the people in New Brunswick are chopping down 
trees.  That is illegal and they should be dealt with accordingly 
but the lesson behind that is that these people now have the 
ability, albeit illegally, to take care of themselves.  They have 
the ability to work.  They have the ability to earn money.  They 
have the ability to take care of themselves and their families. 
As a result, we have seen a dramatic decline in some of the 
social ills that are being predatory on aboriginal communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we can do that it would be the greatest gift we could offer 
aboriginal people in giving them the powers to work with us to 
build a stronger country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the Senate amendment, the member knows very clearly that we 
have pursued a course of a triple-E Senate for a long time. I am 
encouraged that he supports that principle and I hope he will 
continue to work with us to making that a reality. 
<P><A NAME="LINK190"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
Reform Party likes to talk about listening to grassroots.  The 
most recent polling on the Senate shows that more Canadians would 
like to abolish the Senate rather than reform it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we elect a senator, does that not lock into place the 
existing Senate, the existing powers, the existing representation 
which is very unfair to our region of western Canada for example? 
If we are to do that how do we persuade Ontario, for example, to 
accept the idea of equality and yet leave meaningful powers with 
the Senate to make it effective? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All during the constitutional process during the last decade 
that was the most difficult question to answer, and there is no 
answer in my opinion to that.  It goes right back again as to why 
I think more and more Canadians are now looking at the abolition 
of the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would take a longer dissertation to make my questions even 
more clear and I think he would need more time to answer them but 
I would like a brief answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member from the 
NDP asks some very good questions.  The first thing that has to 
be done that can be done is to grandfather those members who are 
senators today and nothing will change for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, establish a plan right now that all new senators will 
be elected and will come on the basis of regional representation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the member clearly says it will be very difficult for 
provinces such as Ontario and Quebec that have the lion's share 
to accept that, or New Brunswick which has a disproportionate 
number to British Columbia, that is where leadership comes in. 
That is where doing the right thing will demonstrate to the 
Canadian public that this House is not a house of elusions but a 
house of leadership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Grandfather current senators.  New senators would fit into a 
system of proportional representation where senators would be 
elected on the basis of an equal number for each province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order to seek consent from the House to present some petitions. 
We omitted petitions this morning.  These petitions deal with the

<A NAME="LINK194">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-39, an 
act to amend the Nunavut Act and the Constitution Act, 1867, be 
read the third time and passed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK195"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, following up 
on the intervention of my hon. colleague and friend from 
Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, I was not going to talk a lot about 
Senate reform, because I know that we have covered that off very 
well already.  But in response to the questions that my hon. 
friend from the New Democratic Party asked, I would say that 
scrapping the Senate is the easy way out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason that polls show Canadians are in favour of abolishing 
the Senate is that they feel so frustrated and so angry over a 
Prime Minister who is only too willing to use the Senate for his 
own political partisan purposes, much as we had previously with 
other prime ministers, including the one immediately preceding 
this one. Canadians are really sick to death of this.  I can 
understand that frustration.  I can understand why the polls 
would indicate that they would just as soon see it abolished as 
have the ridiculous situation that we have right now which has no 
legitimacy whatsoever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would argue with my hon. friend and I would take this to 
Canadians and engage in a national debate that if we abolish the 
Senate, we lose any opportunity in the future for having the 
Senate provide a sense of regional balance and fairness within 
this great country of ours where we have a democracy which 
reflects representation by population. This is an opportunity to 
have representation by region as a control mechanism or as an 
overriding safety feature to ensure that the interests of the 
regions are not overridden by the provinces with large 
populations, particularly those in central Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important that we engage Canadians in this debate. 
Yes, at the end of the day we will follow the wishes of the 
country, but if it were laid out for them and if it were done 
properly, I am convinced that Canadians would support it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thought that was really worth dealing with prior to getting 
into the substance of my remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A member of the Progressive Conservative Party made a remark 
during the course of debate.  I know it was not on camera and it 
was not on the microphone, but he was quite right, and the member 
is still sitting here.  He said that this bill and the whole 
creation of Nunavut is not about creating a new territory, it is 
about creating a new province.  The member understands that well. 
I certainly understand it well.  And there are certainly some 
legal and constitutional experts out there across the land who 
understand it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is one of the main concerns and one of the main objections 
I have to this bill and to the bills that preceded it which gave 
rise to the territory of Nunavut.  In effect it does create a new 
province in everything but name. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, you would know I am sure that it is not proper, it 
is not right and it is not legal for the federal government to 
create a new province or for this country to see a new province 
created without provincial consent.  That is right in the 
constitution. A new province has been created in everything but 
name, and it has been done in a very underhanded and deceitful 
manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The original bill which gave rise to the creation of Nunavut 
back in the early 1990s was passed through the House.  Did it 
take a week?  Did it take three days?  No.  It passed first 
reading, second reading, report stage, and third reading in one 
day. Only one lone dissenting voice voted against this bill and 
that was Reform's member for Beaver River.  Other than that, it 
went through the House as fast as any bill has ever gone through 
the House from beginning to end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us consider for a moment what this bill does.  I am sure my 
hon. friend from the Progressive Conservative Party would be 
interested.  I hope he is listening.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill creates a new province or pseudo province as it does 
not use the term province.  It does so at the expense of the 
Canadian taxpayer to the tune of $300 million.  That is the cost 
of implementation, or at least that is the budgeted or projected 
cost.  By the time the Liberal government gets done with it who 
knows what it is really going to cost because as we all know that 
is the way things work around here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a tax program that was going to be the program to end 
all programs.  Mr. Speaker, I am sure you were in the House when 
the former Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Mr. Tobin, 
introduced it.  It was a program to end all programs for the east 
coast, $1.9 billion.  This is it, it will never happen again. 
Where are we now?  We are looking at TAGS two.  Just a little 
aside to remind everybody that the government continues to budget 
money for programs and then down the road it goes way over the 
cost.  It is likely to happen here as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is $300 million to implement Nunavut. It is a fairly large 
area but how many people are we talking about, half a million 
people, or 200,000 people?  No, we are talking about a population 
of 25,000, including children, people below the age of majority. 
There are hundreds of communities across this land and hundreds 
of communities in Ontario that have more population than what 
Nunavut is going to have once it is created. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can you get any more ridiculous than that.  Can you get any more 
ridiculous than to spend $300 million creating a territory that 
is going to have a population of 25,000?  It is going to create a 
legislature.  It is going to have all the trappings of a 
territorial government.  It is going to have its own environment 
building, its own fisheries department and its own department of 
Indian affairs.  All those buildings are going to be somewhere, 
probably in Yellowknife.  Who knows where it is going to be, but 
for sure it is going to have all trappings of this federal 
government somewhere in the new territory of Nunavut.  The long 
suffering Canadian taxpayer is going to enjoy the right to pay 
for this politically correct nonsense in perpetuity because in 
perpetuity it will last. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amount of $300 million for 25,000 people would be a real 
knee slapper if it were not so serious, if it was not creating a 
new province through the back door in such a deceitful manner. 
It is such an affront to the Canadian taxpayers who are going to 
be asked to put out hundreds of millions of dollars, billions of 
dollars over time to pay for this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has to be assumed that these are somewhat intelligent people 
in the government, but why would they create this territory at 
such a huge expense?  Why have they done it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only conclusion I can come to is it is nothing more than a 
bandage, a poorly considered politically correct response to the 
massive failure of the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development.  That is really what this is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That department has had a demonstrated track record of failure 
for over three decades.  Year over year there are increases in 
unemployment.  Year over year there are increases in dependency. 
There are increasing rates of social pathologies on reserves 
across this country where the infant mortality rate is double the 
national rate, where suicide is seven to eight times higher than 
it is in non-aboriginal communities, where more aboriginal youth 
go to jail than go to university. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government in its politically correct scramble to try to 
find a way of obfuscating and hiding its own failure is creating 
Nunavut as a politically correct response.  It says this is the 
way of the future for people in the Northwest Territories.

</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are seeing here is a bureaucracy that is in the process 
of swallowing itself whole.  Frankly, I think the Canadian 
public, largely as a result of work that the official opposition 
has done over the last few months but even before that, has 
common sense and is slowly coming to the conclusion that the 
Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development is a fraud 
of enormous size. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think Canadians are understanding that more than $6.2 billion 
goes into the top end of this department yet few benefits trickle 
out the bottom end to grassroots people living on reserves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the Canadian public is beginning to understand that the 
department of Indian affairs is not much interested in 
accountability within its own organization as the auditor general 
has continued to point out year in and year out for decades. This 
department has no interest in the truth.  It is a department 
which has no interest in looking at the real problems of 
aboriginal people and trying to find constructive ways of dealing 
with those problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the simple things.  We live in a country that recognizes, 
albeit with a whole long list of Liberal governments in a very 
muted way, private property rights.  Our Liberal forebear Mr. 
Trudeau did not have the courage to put it in the constitution. 
It is not in the charter of rights and freedoms although 
everything else is in there.  No private property rights are in 
there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do have as a foundation to our economy the notion of private 
property rights.  Way, way back when Mr. Diefenbaker was prime 
minister it was put into law.  We do follow that in most areas of 
the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is not the right to private property on reserves. That is 
a huge impediment for aboriginal people.  They cannot mortgage 
their property.  They do not own their property.  They do not own 
their own house. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a family breaks up, there is no process like there is in 
non-aboriginal society for courts to determine who is going to 
have custody of the family home and so on.  That does not happen 
in aboriginal communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A person cannot open a grocery store or a corner store.  They 
cannot open a gas station on an aboriginal reserve and arrange 
the capital at a bank because they will be laughed at.  The bank 
will not lend them money against a piece of property that they do 
not own.  It is ridiculous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In response to the historical and contemporary failure of the 
department of Indian affairs, the government comes up with these 
kinds of absolutely ridiculous ideas regarding how to deal with 
the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are parliamentarians.  We are supposed to be able to come 
here on behalf of the constituencies we represent and we are 
supposed to have access to information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a simple question.  How much money has the federal 
government spent in the Northwest Territories over the last 
decade?  I would like to know the answer to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know how the federal government would defend 
that expenditure against the population in the Northwest 
Territories.  I would like to see that expenditure per person 
applied to all of Canada in a theoretical sense to see what kind 
of expenditure the federal government would be engaged in if it 
expended money on the same basis for all Canadians. I am sure it 
would be a sum all the countries in the world could not afford, 
let alone poor little Canada with a population of 30 million.

reward his Liberal friends as he is wont to do and as we have 
seen recently with the appointment of the Liberal senator in

business associate and a good Liberal recognized by everyone in 
British Columbia. It is another opportunity for the Prime

hepatitis C victims.  Yet it finds money to award contracts in 
the amount of $2.8 billion to its friends in Bombardier.  This is 
the kind of nonsense that drives Canadians to distraction and has 
driven the Reform Party into being. In the last election we sent 
60 members to this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I tell those people across the way as I told them in the last 
parliament that they should look out.  Their day is coming. 
Canadians have had enough of this nonsense.  The $300 million for 
25,000 people because it is politically correct and it is such a 
do good, feel good kind of thing are coming from Canadian 
taxpayers.  They are paying attention.  They are catching on and 
the Liberals' days are numbered.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
want to go back to my friend in the Reform Party on the question 
I was asking before.  What he wants to do is to elect a senator 
from Nunavut.  The people right now are leaning more toward just 
straight abolition of the Senate and saving $50 million a year 
rather than trying to bring in a triple E Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even if he wants to bring in a triple E, I would like to ask him 
how that would be done.  We have been stuck with an appointed 
Senate for a long time.  We have a federation unlike any other in 
the world with one province which has almost 40% of the people. 
Another province with 25% of the people is unique and distinct in 
terms of a different language and culture.  How do we persuade 
those two big provinces that they should have the same number of 
senators as Prince Edward Island in order to get a triple E 
Senate? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even if that were to happen and the provinces agreed to it, what 
kinds of powers would be given to that Senate?  I suspect the 
powers would be so insignificant, so ineffective and so 
irrelevant as to wonder why we need a Senate first place.  We are 
stuck.  How do we put a round post into a square hole? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very real problem.  We have dealt with it for many 
years in parliament when constitutional issues have arisen.  New 
Brunswick has 10 senators and British Columbia has 6.  New 
Brunswick has about 600,000 people while British Columbia has 
between two million and three million.  New Brunswick and Nova 
Scotia have between them 20 senators.  We have 24 in the four 
western provinces.  How do we persuade them to reduce their 
number of senators and have an effective Senate that makes the 
Senate worth while to justify spending that $50 million per year? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we keep going around and around in a circle like a dog 
chasing his tail, in another 50 or 60 years we will still have an 
appointed senator from B.C., an appointed senator from Prince 
Edward Island and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are we not better off trying to abolish the Senate? 
That is the way in which public opinion is moving and the Reform 
Party tells us that it is a grassroots party that wants to listen 
to public opinion.  I would be very interested in knowing how he 
would square that circle.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the question. 
The member is being honest in his question.  He honestly believes 
in what he is putting forward, which is unlike the Liberals. They 
do not honestly believe most of what they say.  We know that. 
They come in the House with these canned speeches and read them 
off.  Half the time they do not even know what they are saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This member asks an honest question and I will try to give him 
an honest answer.  He talks about the fact that there are 
different regions in the country with different representation 
right now.  I think we would all agree, perhaps everybody except 
the Prime Minister and a handful of his closest friends over 
there, that the Senate has no legitimacy whatsoever right now, 
none whatsoever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is nothing more than patronage heaven for good little 
Liberals who have done what the prime minister wanted them to do 
over a long period of time.  It is like going to heaven for them. 
It is exactly like going to heaven.  That is the only way I can 
describe it.  It has no legitimacy whatsoever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However it is precisely because of the regional concerns of 
Atlantic Canada, for example Nova Scotia or Prince Edward Island. 
It is precisely because of the concerns of provinces like British 
Columbia and Alberta that do not want to be overridden. If we 
could imagine a triple-E Senate being in place at the time the 
Liberal government implemented the national energy program in the 
late seventies, it probably would not have gone forward. We do 
not know because we do not have the benefit of seeing history 
repeat itself with changed circumstances.  The reality is that if 
there were a triple-E Senate in place when that policy of the 
Liberals was put in place, it is very likely it would not have 
gone anywhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the type of example I can offer of why we should not 
abolish the Senate.  Abolishing the Senate has an appeal to it. I 
agree we should get rid of it.  We are not supposed to talk about 
the other place, but it represents the most despicable part of 
Canadian policies and nothing more.  It could be much more. How 
will it get there?   It will be when Canadians decide it is time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are coming to that point right now.  Canadians are coming to 
the conclusion that we need fundamental changes to our democratic 
institutions.  It is no accident that Reform sent 60 MPs here 
after the 1997 election.  It is not just because people like the 
name.  It is because they like the principles upon which the 
party is founded.  One of the four pillars is democratic 
institutions being reformed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest to the member that if the NDP, the Liberal Party and 
the Conservative Party are not on that wavelength, if they will 
not tell Canadians that they are in the House of Commons to fight 
for democratic reform, at some point sooner of later, and I 
believe it is will be sooner, Canadians will give political 
parties that espouse changes the authority to make them in a 
general election.  That is coming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member asks how.  I ask him to stay tuned and he will see it 
happen. 
<P><A NAME="LINK197"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Nancy Karetak-Lindell (Nunavut, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am very puzzled by the way the hon. member talked about talking 
to grassroots people and trying to do what the grassroots people 
want us to do.  We had a plebiscite and the people voted for 
division of the Northwest Territories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know how the member could get away from saying that 
this is what the grassroots people want.  The Reform Party says 
that we have to listen to the grassroots people.  This is what 
they want. 
They have also stated that they want to be able to make their own 
decisions.  They want the people who make those decisions to be 
knowledgeable of the departments and the programs they are 
working with.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member talked about the department of Indian affairs in 
Yellowknife.  Yellowknife is not even in Nunavut.  That is 
exactly what we are trying to get away from in creating Nunavut. 
We want to be able to make decisions because we know what the 
people need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He talked about the Senate.  We already have a senator.  Another 
member said that we would grandfather any senators who are 
already in place.  Nunavut already has a senator so I gather 
Reform is saying that senator will be grandfathered.  I do not 
see why this has to be an issue with the Nunavut government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I think of how the rest of Canada was created it got 
assistance from the government.  People from the east were given 
plots of land in the west so they would move there.  The country 
was created by people being given help by the government to get 
started. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who knows where we will be in 20 years?  However we need 
assistance at the beginning as every other Canadian was given 
assistance at the start of the rest of the country.  I am a 
little puzzled as to where the member is coming from.  Perhaps he 
could answer that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott:</B>  Mr. Speaker, as I said in my 
intervention, Nunavut has a population of approximately 25,000 
people.  The riding I represent has approximately three and a 
half times that population.  If a plebiscite were held in my 
riding that asked the people if they would like $900 million of 
federal government assistance to create a new territory, I would 
venture to say they would probably vote for it.  What about the 
people who have to pay the bill?  That is the crux of the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Going to the grassroots in terms of aboriginal people we are 
talking about going to people in reserve communities and asking 
how we can introduce democratic and fiscal accountability into 
these communities.  Lord knows we are certainly hearing from 
enough grassroots people telling us that it does not exist right 
now.  That is the crux of the issue when it comes to plebiscites 
or talking with the grassroots. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member cannot suggest in any kind of rational way that 
because she has the endorsement of 25,000 people who live in 
Nunavut she has the right to reach into the wallets of taxpayers 
of Halifax, Vancouver, Toronto and Prince George to take $300 
million to pay for it.  That does not add up.  I go back to the 
hon. member with that by saying it is a non-starter. She cannot 
do that. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> Order, please. It is my 
duty, pursuant to Standing Order 38, to inform the House that 
the questions to be raised tonight at the time of adjournment 
are as follows: the hon. member for Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, 
the Banks; the hon. member for West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast, 
Immigration; the hon. member for Vancouver East, Poverty. 
<P><A NAME="LINK198"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
speak today to Bill C-39. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last time Bill C-39 was under consideration was during the 
week before the House recessed.  Unfortunately, on the day in 
question, I was busy in my riding.  I felt badly missing the 
beginning of the debate, but I was happy to learn on my return 
that debate was not over and so today I have the opportunity to 
go at it anew. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As has often been said, the bill amends the Nunavut Act and the 
Constitution Act of 1867 permitting Nunavut to have a senator. 
I will have something to say later on the Senate, and I will 
also consider a number of what I consider gratuitous remarks by 
members of the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recall the speech by their leader, who was the first, at 
second reading of the bill, to talk on Nunavut and who never 
once used word “Inuit”.  He spoke for nearly two hours on the 
Senate. 
I found it totally deplorable and I note that we are continuing 
in the same vein today.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that I will suggest to my colleague, the member for 
Abitibi, that when we have a first meeting with the Reform 
Party, we should fill them in a bit on the aboriginal and Inuit 
issue.  We are at opposite ends of the spectrum on this one and 
later on I plan to respond to certain statements that have been 
made today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill provides for a harmonious transition toward the new 
territory of Nunavut.  In 1993, the issue of the territory of 
Nunavut and self-government was worked out. 
Since we also know that there are provisions in this legislation 
for a legislative assembly to be in place as of April 1, 1999, 
we cannot wait until the day before to say that an election may 
now be held. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the legislative assembly is to be operational effective April 
1, action must be taken now, and the people of Nunavut then 
allowed to decide when they will hold it, as long as they are 
ready to fly on their own by April 1, 1999.  I think that is 
what we are looking at today. We are not necessarily looking at 
Senate reform, or land claims.  We are looking at allowing the 
people of Nunavut to govern themselves beginning April 1, 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also looking at transferring the administrative powers of 
the federal and territorial governments to the government of 
Nunavut. This legislative election will precede the installation 
of the legislative assembly on April 1, 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What will the purpose of this election be?  Its purpose will be 
to elect people to represent the Nunavut Inuit.  As many have 
said, 85% of Nunavut's population is Inuit.  The Nunavut 
parliament will therefore be largely Inuit.  The purpose of the 
election will be to make the legislative assembly operational. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill will also allow the transfer of government services, 
and this is important.  It is important because, for too long, 
the Department of Indian Affairs has settled matters directly 
from Ottawa.  This is basically still the case, because the 
Indian Act gives them this power.  The Inuit are not covered by 
the Indian Act. 
This legislation does not apply to these people because, in 
Inuit communities, they have municipal governments. 
Nevertheless, the federal government has a responsibility since 
everything above the 60th parallel falls under its jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to ensure that, as soon as this devolution of 
powers takes place, the Inuit will have their own public 
service. This point was made at second reading but I want to 
make it again: The government must ensure that, when the Nunavut 
legislative assembly becomes operational, on April 1, 1999, the 
people of Nunavut will have duly elected representatives walking 
through the front door of the legislative assembly, as well as a 
public service capable of assuming its new responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ottawa will no longer be in charge. The purpose of the bill 
before us is to allow the people of Nunavut to take charge and 
break away from their age-old dependency on Ottawa. This is very 
important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We already have indications of what kind of government they want 
to have in Nunavut. There is much talk locally of an extremely 
decentralized system. We must understand that, in such a huge 
region, some communities are hundreds of kilometres away from 
one another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are already talking about a given community assuming 
certain responsibilities on behalf of all the others. That is 
interesting because this goes to show that the people of Nunavut 
and the Inuit are prepared to take charge. They already have a 
vision of the type of government they want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the discussion on the composition of the legislative 
assembly, there was a debate about having half the elected 
members be women.  Those are debates we have had here for a long 
time, and ones we have great difficulty in putting into 
practice.  Yet they are already addressing this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-39 calls for an amendment to the Constitution Act of 1867, 
because one senator has to be added.  I shall be stating the 
clear position of the Bloc Quebecois on this.  We have already 
called for the abolition of the Senate. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1650"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT73"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT73"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1650

<A HREF="#LINKT72"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have already had an entire opposition day on a motion to 
abolish the Senate and I intend to develop the Bloc Quebecois 
position a bit further on why we agree a senator for Nunavut 
should be appointed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From all the testimony we heard in the aboriginal affairs 
committee, the people who appeared before the committee, whether 
they represented the Government of the Northwest Territories, 
the Nunavut Implementation Commission, which is currently in 
charge, Nunavut Tunngavik company, which is sort of 
administering the funds until the Inuit really assume power, as 
well as the representatives of all the Inuit in the country, and 
Inuit Tapirisat of Canada, were unanimous in saying that it is 
absolutely essential for this bill to be passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No amendments have been moved.  We want our dream to become 
reality quickly.  These people have been negotiating an 
agreement for 25 years.  They have succeeded in doing so, and 
now they are anxious, like any other free and democratic 
society, to take charge of their own destiny and to move forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So a new territory is going to be created in Canada, after 25 
years of work.  Moreover, the bill is a bit the end result of 
the land claims and of discussions on self government.  The 
negotiations, the agreement reached and the legislation passed 
in the House of Commons in 1993 meant these people had achieved 
their objective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the objective to be fully met, the legislative assembly must 
now begin to function as of April 1.  I think that will happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is easy to say the Indian Act will be scrapped.  Even the 
aboriginals oppose the scrapping of the Indian Act, because so 
long as there are no discussions on self government and land 
claims or on the financial independence of this type of society, 
they will be forced to rely on outdated legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is therefore our responsibility to create the conditions that 
lead to self government and that help resolve land claims that 
will make financial independence possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have two reservations.  I mentioned the first during second 
reading in the House of Commons, just before the bill was 
referred to the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs and 
Northern Development.  I spoke, among other things, about the 
Belcher Islands, and I am happy to see colleagues here who were 
with me.  All the committee members went to Iqualuit not so long 
ago, either last week or the week before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were told in Nunavik and in Nunavut of the importance of the 
boundaries of Nunavut and Nunavik.  Understandably, for our 
viewers things are a bit confusing. 
But Nunavut is the eastern part of the Northwest Territories 
that will have a new legislative assembly as of April 1, 1999, 
while Nunavik is the northern part of Quebec. There are boundary 
waters along these two territories, which explains why 
negotiations are still going on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were told that the issue had been settled in the case of the 
Belcher Islands. The Quebec Cree and the Nunavik Inuit feel that 
the Belcher Islands should be part of Nunavut. But there are 
other islands around, and there are other waters around Nunavik, 
and this is why people say it is important to continue 
negotiating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Cree made it an issue when they appeared before the 
committee. They told us that they have been negotiating since 
1977 for the ownership of certain islands that are very close to 
their territory. But the federal government did not act on their 
claim. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same goes for Nunavik. We are told that negotiations with 
the federal government broke down in 1993. The people from 
Nunavik say they should have ownership of certain islands which 
are not part of the continent, but which should naturally be 
part of Nunavik. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge the minister to reopen the negotiations with the Quebec 
Cree and the Nunavik Inuit. I promised these groups that I would 
pressure the minister to reopen negotiations as soon as 
possible, so that this unresolved residual aspect of land claims 
can be settled once and for all.

<A HREF="#LINKT73"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that the minister must sort this out and I urge my 
Liberal colleagues to speak to their minister so that an 
agreement can be worked out for the islands and the pack ice 
bordering the territories both of Nunavut and of Nunavik, and 
the Cri territories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see my colleague opposite, who is responsible for the Quebec 
Cree.  I am glad to hear him say he is in total agreement and I 
am sure he will join me in trying to persuade his minister to 
see that this gets sorted out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois' other reservation concerns the Senate.  As I 
mentioned earlier, we are calling for the abolition, pure and 
simple, of the Senate. 
As long as this is not done, and should a new territory be 
formed, however, we are not prepared to be so objectionable as 
to say that, since we are opposed to the Senate, we are opposed 
to adding a new senator. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the present context, I think that people must be treated 
fairly.  If a new territory is created and if it is entitled to 
be represented in the Senate, we should not stand in the way. 
Nor should we say that, because of the Senate, we will stand in 
the way of Nunavut or use a major political problem to prevent 
people from attaining the fullest form of self government 
possible.  Our position differs radically from that taken by the 
Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where we are in agreement, however, is when we say that, since 
senators are accountable to the Prime Minister who appointed 
them, it amounts to nothing more than a cosy little nest, with 
people flying out during election campaigns in search of funding 
here and there. 
It is an institution that is costing us $50 million a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only is our position clear; it is based on 
representativeness.  When you mention senators to the people of 
Quebec, they are not interested.  When they hear that the annual 
bill for the Senate is $50 million, they say they have no 
further use for it.  Our position is therefore clear, but we are 
not going to take the Nunavut Inuit hostage and say that we will 
resolve the problem of the Senate by not voting in favour of 
their plan, the way the Reform Party is doing right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I repeat what I said earlier.  I was extremely disappointed when 
the leader of the Reform Party, the leader of the official 
opposition, spoke for two hours about Senate reform.  We all 
wondered if he had the wrong bill.  I is true, however, the 
Standing Orders allow us to focus on a narrow aspect, even a 
single word. 
If the word “Senate” appears in the bill, this gives someone the 
opportunity to speak about the Senate without getting to the 
bottom of the problem.  I criticized the leader of the official 
opposition at the time, and still do, for speaking for two hours 
on Senate reform without ever saying the word “Inuit” once. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I must also correct my two colleagues who spoke earlier. 
The hon. member for Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca told us that in 
British Columbia 110% of the land is being claimed. True, but I 
do not believe that the aboriginal population there, which is 
incidentally very large and spread over 225 different 
communities, is going to tell the people of Vancouver to vacate 
their homes, to go back to Europe or the east, and then take 
over those homes.  That is not what it is all about. 
When someone says things like this, it encourages myths and bad 
attitudes toward native people and is a completely gratuitous 
act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lets us look at how things were settled in British Columbia, 
with the Nisga'a for instance.  The Nisga'a were claiming a huge 
territory.  They settled for 7% of their claim.  So, if the 
Nisga'a claim becomes a precedent for British Columbia, the 
people will not be getting 110% of that province, but 10%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then he told us that the territory will leave Canada.  That is 
not the case at all, either.  To my knowledge, Nunavut will 
still be Canadian territory.  It will still belong to Canada.  I 
am sure it is funny to hear that coming from a sovereignist, 
because everyone is aware of what our option is, but we are open 
to questions of self-government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Wanting more autonomy, that is an approach we are familiar with 
in Quebec. 
We have worked on that a long time, built on it, built our party 
on it.  It is perfectly normal, therefore, for the Bloc 
Quebecois to say “So, you want more autonomy, we are agreeable 
to your having more”.  Our way of seeing it is Quebec 
sovereignty, and their way is self government within which they 
would have a legislative assembly.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it important to correct my two colleagues, who always 
seem to be trying to throw oil on the fire when it comes to the 
aboriginal question.  I find this particularly regrettable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are somewhat at odds with the Reform Party position on the 
whole issue.  Knowing along which lines the House usually 
divides on the aboriginal issue, I think that the Reform Party 
will find itself isolated, because the issue, as the Bloc 
Quebecois sees it, is very clear, as I have just explained. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois thinks that it is constructive to debate 
greater self government.  It is also a vote of confidence in the 
aboriginal peoples. 
You will never hear Bloc Quebecois members saying that they do 
not want to give aboriginals or Inuit certain responsibilities 
because they cannot handle them.  That is not our approach.  We 
think that these people, who occupied these lands long before we 
did, have their own approach.  They had legal, political and 
financial systems.  They had everything they needed before the 
Europeans arrived and upset their systems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, when people tell us they are capable of governing 
themselves, they must be given an opportunity to do so.  One way 
of doing this is to give them powers and responsibilities, and 
ensure that they have the necessary instruments to make it on 
their own. 
This is why we insist they be given funding for training, to 
make sure they will be ready April 1. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have nothing against giving significant sums for Nunavut— 
$300 million or $225 million—for agreements with the Micmacs or 
with the Nisga'a or the Cree.  This is one way of putting an end 
to dependence on the federal government and to the practice of 
saying “Here are millions of dollars.  Next year we will 
evaluate your needs and send more millions of dollars”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once people are given self-government and a territory 
sufficiently large to permit financial independence, I am sure 
they will be able to take charge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc considers the matter of Nunavut, like the native issue, 
a constructive one, a debate of confidence in the native peoples 
and of the issue of greater autonomy for them.  On this, the 
Bloc will continue to follow them, unlike, unfortunately, our 
friends in the Reform Party.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciated 
the remarks of the member for Saint-Jean.  He is familiar with 
the Inuit situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk of Nunavut, of the Inuit of this region, of Nunavik 
or Nunavut, we are always talking about economic development. 
The people in the south are always questioning the financial 
support they are given. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that my colleague has a lot of experience—he has done an 
excellent job on the committee for a number of months, and I 
appreciate it.  Could he describe the economic situation and 
talk about purchases, house construction, the sources of 
vehicles, of perishable and non-perishable goods? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Claude Bachand:</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish to thank my colleague, 
the hon. member for Abitibi, for giving me the chance to speak. 
I believe he is familiar with my concerns about the cost of 
living in the far north. He is very much aware of it because he 
shares my opinion that the cost of living up there is 
exorbitant.  My colleague also knows some people who will be 
coming to tell us how things operate there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the 35th Parliament, I raised the problem in order to 
tell people that it made no sense at all for the cost of living 
in the North, whether in Iqaluit or in Kuujjuaq, to be twice as 
high as it is here.  The average income up north is half what it 
is here.  So that means the cost of living is really four times 
greater. Up north, a quart of milk costs $2, three liters cost 
$8, while here they cost maybe half that.  These people have 
only half our income as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs is currently 
holding a quite extensive examination of economic development. 
When I spoke before, I referred to the fact that sometimes that 
carton of milk or other essential item had passed through 21 
middlemen before the aboriginal people bought it at their local 
Northern Store.

<A HREF="#LINKT75"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If you traced that milk from the beginning until it was 
purchased in the Northern Store, it sometimes had passed through 
21 intermediate steps, which was not logical.  Everybody along 
the way took a little cut, which ended up making the price 
exorbitant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we must get to the bottom of this. It is part of 
economic development. It is one way to help the people of the 
North by trying to find some way they can obtain their staples 
at a reasonable price.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure and an honour to rise in this House to speak on Bill 
C-39.  I have a great deal of interest in this debate.  I have 
listened to it for five or six hours but I have to admit I am not 
interested in a lot of the discussion that ensues about dragging 
the debate into other areas and other jurisdictions.  I am not 
interested in the term Balkanization.  I am not interested in 
filibustering and I am not interested in how this affects the 
Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am interested in is what this bill says to the people of 
Canada about a very historic occasion in this country.  This is 
the first time in over 50 years that we are presenting a new 
territory, bringing a new territory into the Canadian mosiac. 
This is a very historic occasion and it is one that as a member 
of the Indian affairs and northern development committee I am 
very proud to have participated in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is time to quickly summarize what this debate is 
about.  The Nunavut Act will create a new territory on April 1, 
1999 in the northeastern and central regions of what is currently 
the Northwest Territories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This process was initiated in the 1960s.  It has been a long 
process and it has been a long debate.  I am sure the people who 
started that debate in the 1960s would be very weary of it if 
they were still here.  Some of those early participants are still 
here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The creation of Nunavut was set out in the Nunavut land claims 
agreement signed on May 25, 1993 by then Prime Minister Brian 
Mulroney.  The government of Nunavut will be a public government 
reflecting the demographics of the area which is 85% Inuit.  The 
official language will be Inuktitut. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the debate of this bill, during the process of this bill 
through parliament we made some additions.  We made some changes. 
Amendments to the Nunavut Act were necessary to allow for a 
smooth transition for April 1, 1999 to ensure the continuation of 
services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of the complexity of the regulations, the original bill 
required amendments to ensure this would take place.  The 
amendments allow for additional seats for both a new member of 
parliament and a new senator to represent the territory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, this legislation removes any uncertainty regarding 
basic services like drivers licence registration and courtroom 
proceedings to allow them to continue after April 1, 1999 in an 
uninterrupted manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the specifics of the bill.  These are the nuts and 
bolts of what we are talking about here.  This is not an occasion 
for members of parliament to get up, filibuster and ask questions 
that have no relevancy whatsoever to the piece of legislation we 
are trying to discuss. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-39 is an historic piece of legislation that will create 
the third territory in Canada.  It is a step toward provincial 
status for all territories, Yukon, NWT and eventually Nunavut. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Amendments to the Nunavut Act and the Constitution Act were 
necessary to allow for an election prior to April 1, 1999 and to 
make a seat available in the House of Commons and the Senate to 
reflect and provide representation for this new territory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an historic event in the development of our country. I 
want to let the citizens of Canada consider that for a minute. 
This is not a time for politicians to stand up, filibuster and 
talk about issues that are certainly interesting and important, I 
admit, but which are not relevant to the debate. If we are to 
have debate in the House of Commons surely we should have 
relevant debate.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing for which there seems to be a misunderstanding is 
the size of this new territory.  Nunavut will encompass 2,242,000 
square kilometres.  Approximately one-seventh of that is under 
Inuit title under Inuit land claims.  That land claims area is 
Inuit controlled land.  The rest of that territory belongs to the 
people of Canada.  It is crown land.  This is not one huge land 
claim. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have listened to comments today. Obviously members have not 
read the act.  I have heard the debate go on and on about 25,000 
people and what it is costing the people of Canada.  What has it 
cost the territories of Canada to belong to this nation?  How 
much have we taken from Yukon?  How much have we taken from the 
NWT?  How much have we taken from the eastern Arctic in mineral 
royalties, mining rights, oil and gas revenues?  How much have we 
taken in taxation dollars?  How much has been contributed?  A 
lot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is time to allow a bit of common sense to enter the 
debate.  We are talking about maturity here.  We are talking 
about the maturity of a nation.  We are talking about having 
three territories.  Surely it is time we can be proud of this 
historic occasion and the very fact that on April 1, 1999 Canada 
will have a new territory.  I think it is an historic occasion 
and a wonderful event. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On those words I take my seat and I hope the filibustering has 
stopped. 
<P><A NAME="LINK201"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Finlay (Oxford, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
congratulate my colleague from Saint-Jean and my colleague from 
South Shore.  I have been in the House all afternoon and I hoped 
we would get around to talking about Nunavut and what it means to 
this country and to the people of Nunavut, and my two colleagues 
have done that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to put on the record one or two points about this 
Senate which seems to have consumed our friends from the Reform 
Party, that our need for reforming the Senate is somehow more 
important than our need for having our aboriginal people become 
part of this great nation, I mean a real part. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a senator from Nunavut, Senator Willie Adams, in the 
other place.  He was appointed in 1977.  He was not appointed by 
the present Prime Minister. There is a Yukon senator, Senator 
Lucier.  What we will have to do is appoint another senator for 
the western Arctic, Northwest Territories, the territory that Mr. 
Adams represented all these years. With the split another senator 
is necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am reminded in this historic debate, as my colleague from 
South Shore has said, of a comment by a former colleague, Elijah 
Harper, the former member for Churchill.  I remember him standing 
in his place at the other end of this Chamber and telling the 
then third party in the House that it just did not get it. 
My colleague from South Shore tried to put that across in gentle 
terms.  I am not prepared to be quite so gentle.  Quite clearly 
it does not understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The chief representative for that party on the standing 
committee, where we have done a lot of good work on this in my 
opinion, spoke for a minute and a half. 
Then like a trained dog he proposed the amendment, completely 
unknown to anyone else in the committee, his colleagues or anyone 
who worked with him.  We have spent hours debating something that 
is secondary or tertiary or maybe quaternary instead of the 
important parts of the act.

</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the Reform speakers said to scrap the Indian Act.  We 
have tried scrapping the Indian Act on more than one occasion. We 
tried to scrap it when the present Prime Minister was the 
minister of aboriginal affairs.  We tried to scrap it two years 
ago. The aboriginal community do not want to scrap it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the previous speakers spoke about ownership on the 
reserves and ownership of land.  My colleague for South Shore and 
I visited villages, both aboriginal and Inuit in the northern 
part of Quebec.  We also visited Iqaluit just two weeks ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask my hon. colleague whether in those villages that we 
visited he found a forward looking, positive attitude, a feeling 
that they were going to get somewhere with their rights as 
aboriginals, with their homes, health care and institutions. That 
is what this act is about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that every member of the House will allow Nunavut to come 
into being as a fully functioning member of the Canadian 
federation.  I expect all worthy members who see the Canadian 
federation as first in the world, as I do, will support it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for 
Oxford for his question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Very succinctly I would say it is an extremely progressive and 
very forward looking attitude.  It is almost an ebullience of 
wanting to become a realistic part of Canadian society and an 
equal partner in Canadian society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a group of people who have always paid taxes.  They have 
always contributed to Canadian society.  They have always been 
full-fledged members in Canadian society.  Today I found some of 
the disparaging comments that have been made or tendencies 
leaning toward that direction a bit irritating and quite 
annoying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have an opportunity with aboriginal people in Canada with a 
land base that is sufficient for them to actually be responsible 
and in control of their own destiny.  We have a larger land base 
over which they have political influence. We have a window of 
opportunity to be equal partners in our own land.  That is an 
important statement they will be able to make when this is over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anybody who introduces petitions behind the scenes does so very 
cowardly and I have the right to submit these openly.  I ask for 
the consent of the House to submit openly the great stack of 
petitions I have on the repeal of Bill C-68.

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage prepare and 
report a bill to this House, in accordance with Standing Order 
68(4)(b), no later than ninety (90) days following adoption of 
this motion, that will create a memorial recognizing the 
outstanding contribution of Lieutenant Colonel William 
(“Billy”) Barker (deceased), V.C., World War I flying ace, and 
hero of Canada and the Commonwealth. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to have the opportunity 
to debate this bill today. Unfortunately this bill was not made 
votable.  First I thank the members who will be speaking on 
behalf of this motion today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday I was flipping through some clippings and I came 
across a book review in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> of November 8. 
There was a very appropriate caption.  This review was on the 
book written by Wayne Ralph called <I>Barker VC: William Barker, 
Canada's Most Decorated War Hero</I> which was released this past 
fall. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The heading for this book review was “The greatest air ace 
you've never heard of”.  Below that in bold was “How Canada's 
most decorated hero slowly became an unknown soldier”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is that not appropriate when we talk about Lieutenant Colonel 
Barker, VC?  I want to tell this House and the Canadian people 
why we are debating this motion at this time.  This has been a 
personal project of mine since 1996.  As a former mayor of 
Dauphin I began writing all the politicians associated with 
heritage, certainly the Minister of Canadian Heritage and the 
historic sites and monuments board of Canada requesting that 
national historic significance be conveyed on Lieutenant Colonel 
William Barker, VC.

<A HREF="#LINKT80"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those who do not know anything about Lieutenant Colonel 
William Barker, VC, which is not a surprise to Canadians, this 
man was the most decorated soldier, not Canadian soldier but 
soldier, of the first world war, in the world.  Yet we are not 
familiar with his name. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wrote to the historic sites and monuments board.  I received a 
negative response from the executive secretary, Mr. Friend.  He 
refused to acknowledge Barker's outstanding contributions during 
the first world war.  He said: “Lieutenant Colonel Barker's 
post-war career does not appear to have been remarkable”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give a couple of pieces of evidence to show how 
remarkable his post-war career really was.  It appears to me with 
this kind of response that Mr. Friend did very little research, 
certainly his department did very little research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lieutenant Colonel William Barker was the first president of the 
Toronto Maple Leafs, installed in 1924. He was also the first 
acting director of the Royal Canadian Air Force at its founding 
in 1924.  If that is not an incredible post-war career, I do not 
know what is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the historic sites and monuments board did its job, I would 
not be standing here today to talk about this.  If the minister 
took an interest in this subject I would not be standing here 
talking about it.  Unfortunately no one on the side of government 
took an interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been asked by the media why am I so interested in this 
topic, whether it is because he was born in Dauphin.  Obviously I 
am interested because he came from Dauphin, Manitoba.  But more 
important, I am interested because as a country we need to 
recognize the real heroes of this country, people who have put 
their lives at stake so we can be free and enjoy the standard of 
living we have today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lieutenant Colonel William Barker was the most decorated soldier 
not only in this country but in the Commonwealth of Nations 
during that period. He is remembered not by Canadians but by our 
European allies, people in Great Britain, in France, in Italy. 
He is a household name in England but not in his own country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have heard of Billy Bishop because of the CBC 
production which most of have seen at one time or another. 
Ironically Bishop, as famous as he was, paid William Barker the 
ultimate accolade and labelled him the greatest fighter pilot the 
world has every known.  Is it not astonishing that most well 
known fighter pilot and war hero in this country, Billy Bishop, 
labelled Lieutenant Colonel William Barker, VC the greatest 
fighter pilot the world has ever known?  It is amazing. Yet no 
one seems to know who Lieutenant Colonel William Barker is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to read a couple of paragraphs from an article written by 
William W. Walker on the same topic.  He asked was this just one 
Canadian going overboard on the ability of another fellow 
countryman.  If Barker deserved Bishop's appellation of the 
greatest, why is he almost unheard of today? That is a fair 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Barker seemed to shun publicity about himself and his exploits. 
He left no memoirs in contrast to many of the aces who 
meticulously set down their autobiographies.

<A HREF="#LINKT81"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are no known definitive biographies of him or even of the 
RCAF.  The air ministry at Ottawa has only the barest history of 
one of the most illustrious warriors of World War I. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the reason there is only fragmentary information about 
Barker stems from the fact that he had very little use for 
systems and no patience for protocol.  His job was fighting and 
killing Germans.  It was an employment he pursued with 
relentless, wholehearted enthusiasm.  He lived for the thrill of 
the chase in combat and for the final blazing minute of the kill 
which was the pay-off, the raison d'être of the fighter pilot. 
Each victory spurred him on to new goals.  In the air he was as 
courageous and reckless as any of the young hellions skimming the 
clouds over France and Germany. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, once out of the cockpit he seemed more withdrawn, 
sombre and reserved.  He was different from his more lively 
compatriots who liked all the carousing and wenching they could 
crowd into the short hours between flights.  Most of them 
reasoned that death would join them in the cockpit soon enough, 
so why not live it up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the squadron commander, Barker was always concerned about his 
charges.  He was anxious to teach them the combat tactics that 
would enable them to survive.  When occasion demanded he would 
celebrate and drink with them, but unbridled celebrations and 
uninhibited acts so typical of the flying Galahads just did not 
fit in with his personality.  Compared with some of the more 
flamboyant young blades like Lufbery, Udet and Frank Luke, Barker 
was quite restrained on the ground. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Barker's score of 58 was not the highest, but he pioneered 
fighter pilot tactics that were widely used in the second world 
war and he blueprinted a plan for fighter armaments that was used 
by the British in the battle of Britain in 1940.  Few airmen have 
left such a legacy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will read a short passage written by Peter Warren, a Manitoba 
freelance journalist and broadcaster.  He asked this question in 
his column:  “Why is this Dauphin man the unknown hero for 
Canadians?  My God, he took a British cabinet minister and 
dropped one of the allied spies behind enemy lines in August 
1918”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Barker was told by King George V at his investiture on March 1, 
1919 that he had set a new record by receiving six gallantry 
awards, two more than the king had previously presented to any 
soldier in the British empire. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Warren raises this question: “Somebody out there help me 
explain”.  I do not know if there is an explanation, except that 
this country has basically ignored Lieutenant Colonel William 
Barker.  Government after government has forgotten his 
contribution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Canadians we tend to look elsewhere for our heroes, across 
the border and across the ocean.  We are a relatively young 
nation.  As a young nation matures we need to recognize and learn 
from our history.  One lesson we must learn is to acknowledge our 
heroes, those who can be positive role models for all of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I would ask for unanimous consent to make Motion 
No. 251 a votable motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon. member for 
Dauphin—Swan River has requested that the motion standing in his 
name be considered a votable motion.  Is there unanimous consent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  There is not 
unanimous consent.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Pratt (Nepean—Carleton, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
first I would like to offer my congratulations to the hon. member 
for Dauphin—Swan River for his initiative with respect to 
Lieutenant Colonel William Barker.  I think he has certainly done 
a service to Canadian history and Canadian heritage by moving 
this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House may be interested to know that I have a very similar 
motion on the Order Paper.  Whereas the motion of the member for 
Dauphin—Swan River talks about a memorial, my motion talks 
specifically about commemorating a statue to Lieutenant Colonel 
William Barker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is worth mentioning that the hon. member was instrumental in 
getting Dauphin airport renamed as Lieutenant Colonel William 
Barker airport.  Again, for that, I think the member deserves 
congratulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The history of the first world war has many heroes and many 
villains, but from a Canadian standpoint I think that William 
Barker's name stands out as being one of Canada's pre-eminent 
heroes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I became interested in Lieutenant Colonel William Barker's story 
as a young boy growing up in Nepean when I read a popular history 
book called <I>Knights of the Air</I> which talked about the great 
first world war aces like Bishop and Barker.  It was not until 
just last fall that I saw a book by an author named Wayne Ralph 
who lives in B.C. who had done what I considered to be probably 
the most definitive history on Lieutenant Colonel Barker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The book struck me as portraying a very sad story.  Barker was 
well known to the Commonwealth and well known to the Canadian 
people during the first world war because of his exploits. 
However, tragically, after the war he ended up having some 
personal problems.  Lieutenant Colonel Barker managed to get 
himself back on his feet again, but on March 12, 1930 he was 
killed in a very unfortunate air crash on the Ottawa River just a 
few miles from these parliament buildings at the Rockcliffe 
airbase where he was test flying a plane for the Fairchild 
company. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At his funeral in Toronto there were apparently 2,000 soldiers 
who served as an honour guard.  There were 50,000 spectators at 
his funeral.  Today Barker's name has been all but forgotten in 
the annals of Canadian history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find that very unfortunate because I think a country certainly 
needs its heroes and Barker was clearly one of ours.  The 
Americans have popularized their heroes over the years. Hollywood 
has done a tremendous job of instilling patriotism in the hearts 
and minds of many Americans based on the exploits of people such 
as Davy Crockett, Jim Bowie, John Paul Jones and many other 
famous American heroes.  We do not have that in Canada.  We have 
not had the glorification of our heroes to the extent that the 
Americans have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What was Lieutenant Colonel Barker's record during the first 
world war?  As the hon. member for Dauphin—Swan River has 
mentioned, he was credited with quite a number of air victories. 
The hon. member mentioned 58.  I believe his record was 50, 
according to Mr. Ralph's biography. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps Lieutenant Colonel Barker's most famous action occurred 
within two weeks of the war's end.  If I could, I would like to 
refer directly to the Victory Cross citation that William Barker 
received.  I would like to refer to it specifically because I 
think it outlines why Barker had the reputation that he did 
during the first world war.

<A HREF="#LINKT83"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The citation reads:  “His Majesty the King has been graciously 
pleased to confer the Victoria Cross on the undermentioned 
officer of the Royal Air Force in recognition of bravery of the 
highest possible order:  Captain, Acting Major, William George 
Barker, DSO, MC, No. 201 Squadron, Royal Air Force”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the morning of October 27, 1918 this officer observed an 
enemy two-seater over the forêt de Mormal. He attacked this 
machine and after a short burst it broke up in the air.  At the 
same time, a Fokker biplane attacked him and he was wounded in 
the right thigh but managed, despite this, to shoot down the 
enemy airplane in flames. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He then found himself in the middle of a large formation of 
Fokkers which attacked him from all directions.  He was again 
wounded in the left thigh but succeeded in driving down two of 
the enemy in a spin.  He lost consciousness after this and his 
machine fell out of control.  On recovery, he found himself again 
being attacked by a large formation and, singling out one 
machine, he deliberately charged and drove it down in flames. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During this fight his left elbow was shattered and he again 
fainted and, on regaining consciousness, he found himself still 
being attacked but, notwithstanding that he was now severely 
wounded in both legs and his left arm shattered, he dove on the 
nearest machine and shot it down in flames. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Being greatly exhausted, he dove out of the fight to regain our 
lines but was met by another formation which attacked and 
endeavoured to cut him off.  But after a hard fight he succeeded 
in breaking up this formation and reached our lines where he 
crashed on landing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This combat in which Major General Barker destroyed four enemy 
machines, three of them in flames, brought his total successes up 
to 50 enemy planes destroyed and is a notable example of the 
exceptional bravery and disregarded danger which this very 
gallant officer always displayed throughout his distinguished 
career. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Major Barker was awarded the Military Cross on January 10, 1917, 
the first bar on July 18, 1917, which means he won that award 
twice, the Distinguished Service Order on February 18, 1918, the 
second bar to the Military Cross on September 16, 1918, and a bar 
to Distinguished Service Order on November 2, 1918. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think members can certainly grasp from the account of that 
particular action that Barker today would be referred to as a 
super hero.  However, he has been all but forgotten. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of the first world war he was definitely Canada's 
most decorated war hero.  He held the Victoria Cross, the 
Distinguished Service Order and bar, the Military Cross and two 
bars, the French Croix de Guerre, two Italian silver medals for 
valour and three mentions in dispatches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also worth mentioning that in terms of his later career, 
as the hon. member for Dauphin—Swan River has already mentioned, 
he was appointed as the first acting director of the Royal 
Canadian Air Force in 1924.  He was, as was mentioned, the first 
president of the Toronto Maple Leafs hockey club in 1927-28. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Interestingly enough, his name was so well known that he was 
used as a character in one of Hemingway's books, in his famous 
short story <I>The Snows of Kilimanjaro</I>. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has a forgotten hero and his name is Lieutenant Colonel 
William Barker.  I think this nation must in some manner 
commemorate his name.  He is buried in Mount Pleasant 
cemetery in Toronto in a crypt that bears the Smith family name. 
Something must be done to ensure that the name of Lieutenant 
Colonel William Barker lives on and that his exploits and daring 
are understood by future generations of Canadians.

to rise today to speak to Motion M-251, introduced by my 
colleague from Dauphin—Swan River, in Manitoba. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The objective of this motion is the creation of a memorial 
recognizing the outstanding contribution of Lieutenant Colonel

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We agree in principle, but all the facts must surely be checked. 
This Canadian hero downed 53 enemy planes during the first 
world war and was awarded the Victoria Cross, the Military 
Cross, French and Italian military distinctions, six citations 
for acts of bravery from George V and other distinctions. 
Surely, he deserves recognition by future generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not doubt the facts, but personally I cannot verify them. 
The Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada was created for 
this very purpose in 1919, and we should call on this board, in 
this instance. 
I will therefore speak about this board in order to add weight 
to the bill that will be introduced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1979 the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada has 
advised the government on the commemoration of individuals, of 
historical sites and events of national interest and the 
mounting of plaques to inform Canadians about their history. 
Over time and with changes to Canadian historiography, the board 
widened its scope to include military, political and 
geographical subjects and to the broader subjects of our social 
and economic history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In reality, the board advises the minister on the commemoration 
of people, events, sites, structures and locations representing 
aspects of Canada's history of national importance. 
It also indicates the level of commemoration it deems 
appropriate, be it the installation of a plaque, the sharing of 
expenses with a third party or, more rarely, the acquisition or 
development of a site by Parks Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It can provide information on important persons, places and 
events of the past, on the principles and techniques of site 
construction and preservation, and on heritage legislation. 
Each year, it receives over 200 requests, 50 to 70 of which 
result in studies by the historic services branch. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has always viewed its plaque installation program as an 
educational activity in the broadest sense of the term.  To 
date, it has installed over 1,100 commemorative plaques 
throughout the country.  These are a testimony to its dedication 
to educating the public. 
An interesting fact is that it has broadened its definition of 
heritage to include cultural neighbourhoods, gardens and 
landscapes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore agree that the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of 
Canada should be called upon for advice. We could also follow 
the example of the Fondation des Amis de René Lévesque, in 
Quebec City, which is now raising funds in order to erect a 
monument in his memory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know that not only was Mr. Lévesque a World War II war 
correspondent, but that he was a member of the Liberal Party of 
Quebec before founding the Parti Quebecois and becoming premier 
of Quebec.  He was therefore a very important person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1960, he was the father of the quiet revolution and the 
father of the nationalization of electricity in Quebec; he was 
also was instrumental in helping the Quebec Liberal Party regain 
power in Quebec after decades in opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also owe him the great democratic legislation on party 
fundraising, which eliminates slush funds, limits contributions 
and allows the public to participate in the financial control of 
the parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>René Lévesque was also the driving force behind the 
constitutional reform undertaken in the 1980 referendum to save 
Canada. It is well known that he was trying to achieve 
sovereignty association in order to put an end to this idea of a 
federation justifying a centralizing and dominating government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on for hours talking about René Lévesque and quoting 
him as an example, but I will stop here for now and conclude by 
saying that this great man has no lack of feats to his credit, 
yet it will be his friends who will be putting up a memorial. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore urge the hon. member for Dauphin—Swan River to take 
the advice of the Canada Historic Sites and Monuments Board or 
follow the lead of the Fondation des amis de René Lévesque 
regarding this memorial.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise on this occasion to speak to Motion No. 251 to 
create a memorial recognizing the outstanding contributions of 
Lieutenant Colonel William Billy Barker, a World War I flying ace 
and hero of Canada and the Commonwealth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Billy Barker was born in Dauphin, Manitoba.  He died in Ottawa 
on March 12, 1930.  He was a cohort of Billy Bishop.  I remember 
Billy Bishop through a work of art basically, a play written by 
John Gray called <I>Billy Bishop Goes to War</I>.  It was an 
important play that helped me to understand in a very real way 
what it meant to go to war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Billy Barker was a cohort of Billy Bishop, just another young 
scared boy probably of the age of many of our children who went 
off to war.  It is very important to remember people such as 
Billy Barker and Billy Bishop.  It is important that we 
acknowledge their contribution to the military and to World War 
I.  It is important for Canadians to recognize heroes who served 
in the armed forces, both men and women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member of parliament for Dartmouth I represent a 
community with a long and proud military tradition.  I have met 
many of the heroes of today in the military, the peacekeepers, 
the sailors and the soldiers who make tremendous sacrifices for 
peacekeeping, national security and such things as environmental 
clean-up and natural disasters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many people right now in Canada are very aware that these people 
are heroes when they manage to put sandbags around their houses 
and save their homes or save their children or save their lives 
from fires.  We have many heroes today in the military. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also aware that there is a parliamentary committee crossing 
the country right now looking into the situation of people in the 
military and addressing the fact that perhaps DND and the 
Canadian government are not at the present time recognizing the 
heroes we have here and now.  I have also talked with people, 
peacekeepers who have come home from various war zones with their 
health is ruined.  They are trying to cobble together veterans 
assistance and basic disability payments.  We have to be aware of 
them also when we are talking about recognizing heroes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How do we recognize our heroes?  There are ways.  There are 
memorials.  That is one way.  I would say that a memorial for 
such a person as Billy Barker is an important way to do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also urge that we continue to recognize heroes on a daily 
basis by recognizing the values that people such as Billy Barker 
fought for.  These are values such as democracy, equality, 
freedom of speech, freedom from fear, freedom from racism and 
freedom from injustice.  I again say that we have to recognize 
people in the here and now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well I recognize a massive commitment to such things as 
education of our young people about the contributions of 
Canadians to politics, war, peace, culture, humanitarian efforts 
and strengthening our communities.  I take this opportunity to 
talk about some of the real heroes right now in our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I had the privilege of taking part in the buddies 
celebration in the centre block of the House of Commons.  Over 
the past year, 18 young people with special needs have been on 
the Hill every week working in MPs' offices with their staffs. 
This buddies program gives young people with disabilities a 
chance to build self-esteem, learn job skills and be part of the 
world of work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have some heroes today, people like the teachers at Ridgemont 
High School, Ilse Turnsen and Pat Mainwaring, who have put 
together this program to allow disabled people to fight for their 
rightful places in our communities.  They are heroes of the here 
and now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have in my office once a week a young boy named Capnello 
Bueti, who is trying to be part of our world of work and I 
appreciate that.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing I reiterate my desire to show the living practical 
commitment to the values of people such as Billy Barker for all 
the many years ago he sacrificed for the kind of society we want 
to live in.  In terms of memorials to people such as Billy Barker 
let us remember by doing, by educating and by committing our 
public resources to the struggle against such things as poverty, 
hunger, inequality and racism.  As well let us remember by 
example Billy Barker in the present. 
<P><A NAME="LINK209"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I remind the House that this is Canada.  In some 
respects perhaps Billy Barker did not do so badly for not having 
recognition when we remember that Billy Bishop got the 
recognition as the kid who could not miss. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the National Film Board treatment of Billy Bishop's career it 
was posed that Billy Bishop lied about the victories that gave 
him the Victoria Cross.  This was the subject of a great debate 
in the Senate.  There were protests around the country on the 
fabrication of the story that maligned one of our first world war 
aces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I welcome the opportunity to speak to the motion.  I find it 
slightly flawed in only one respect.  It celebrates only Billy 
Barker and his roots coming from Dauphin, Manitoba.  I appreciate 
why the member for Dauphin—Swan River wants to celebrate a local 
hero.  The problem is that we have to be a little careful in that 
respect because the same may be argued with respect Billy Bishop 
who was born in Owen Sound and certainly ought to have a similar 
memorial.  So it should be argued with respect to various other 
military heroes of various communities across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said, what is so fine about bringing the issue before 
the House of Commons is that it is not a just question of Billy 
Barker.  It is not just a question of Billy Bishop either.  What 
we are remembering about these two men is the tremendous 
contribution that Canadian first world war fighter pilots made to 
the first world war.  They were legends in their own time.  It 
was a different era.  It was the last era of military chivalry. 
The best knights of the air were Canadian pilots Billy Bishop and 
Billy Barker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the member for Dauphin—Swan River that there are other 
less well known heroes but heroes nevertheless.  I refer to Wop 
May who went on to be one of Canada's most famous bush pilots and 
Roy Brown who was remembered as the man who shot down Baron von 
Richthofen, the Red Baron. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Billy Bishop is famous because he was the surviving ace with the 
most victories at 72.  Richthofen was the ace of the second world 
war with the most sheer victories before he was killed, some 80 
victories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have read the autobiography of Billy Bishop.  I recommend that 
all Canadians read it to get into the mind of an individual who 
reflected the spirit of chivalry that existed on all sides in the 
air battle during the first world war.  It also reflects the 
Canadian independence of spirit that made Canadian soldiers both 
in the first world war and in the second world war some of the 
most admired soldiers of any nation in the world. Certainly that 
was the case with the fighter pilots of the first world war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fortunately, I assure the member for Dauphin—Swan River, there 
is one very excellent memorial to Billy Barker, Billy Bishop, Wop 
May and Roy Brown.  It is a series of novels by Donald Jack that 
are loosely called the Bandy Papers.  <I>Three Cheers For Me</I> 
is one of the titles and there are several others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to all Canadians that if they want to read good Canadian 
literature about Canadian fictional heroes taken from the real 
life stories of the real heroes they should read the Bandy Papers 
by Donald Jack.  They are some of the most amusing reading I have 
ever read.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are very insightful. They build on the wartime careers of 
both fighter aces.  They describe the struggles these two men 
had.  How do I describe it?  The British were not great champions 
of independence.  In fact one of the problems of the recognition 
of the first world war fighter pilots of Canada was that the 
British were very loath to recognize the colonials for what they 
did as colonials.  In fact they would only acknowledge anyone who 
was flying the British roundels as a British pilot. They would 
not acknowledge that Canadians were actually the lead pilots in 
the Commonwealth forces during the first world war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will digress for a minute.  If members of the House would like 
to get an idea of what it was like in Billy Bishop's day or Billy 
Barker's day, I recommend they go to the Canada warplane museum 
here in Ottawa. There is a ride available on a Stearman biplane. 
For $40 one can fly over Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the great good fortune last summer when my son and I went 
out to the warplane museum and we took a ride in the biplane.  It 
is quite incredible.  We flew over the parliament buildings and 
over the river.  We had this great sense of slow motion and this 
great sense of being next to the sky, next to the air. We could 
see what inspired those Canadian pilots of so many years ago. 
For anyone who wants that thrill, that thrill is available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To come back to the point, my problem with the motion is simply 
that it does not go far enough.  I wish it were a votable motion 
and that we could amend it to honour all the Canadian first world 
war flying aces.  I agree with the member.  We cannot leave it to 
bureaucrats, to academics who are sitting out there surrounded by 
weird senses of personal power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not matter a fig what Billy Barker did after the war. It 
does not matter a fig what Billy Bishop did after the war. They 
were heroes during the war. They were special heroes.  They were 
heroes who were admired the world over.  Can we in Canada not do 
anything better than condemn one of those heroes with a National 
Film Board production called <I>The Kid Who Couldn't Miss</I> 
which actually maligned one of our heroes? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the minister is listening to this.  I hope all Canadians 
are listening to this because I congratulate the member for 
Dauphin—Swan River.  However, it should not be just Billy 
Barker, it should be all the Canadian fighter pilot heroes of the 
first world war.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak to Motion 
No. 251 introduced by my hon. colleague from Dauphin—Swan River. 
This motion was first introduced by my hon. colleague in October 
1997 and is in furtherance of efforts which he made as mayor of 
Dauphin, Manitoba prior to his election to parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The actions of my hon. colleague illustrate the best elements of 
election to the House, whereby this House becomes a means to 
address concerns that caused a member to decide to stand for 
election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By this motion my hon. colleague seeks to have the House 
recognize by way of a memorial the valour and contributions to 
our history of Lieutenant Colonel William Barker. 
Lieutenant Colonel Barker was awarded the Victoria Cross for his 
valour in World War I.  It is regrettable this motion is 
non-votable since a vote would demonstrate to Canadians how 
parliamentarians view memorials to personal sacrifice and 
contributions to the freedom of Canada and the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand we have the hon. member for Dauphin—Swan 
River to thank for making the effort to raise this issue in the 
House, such that our views of Lieutenant-Colonel Barker's 
accomplishments may be part of the permanent <I>Hansard</I> record 
and thus part of the permanent historical record of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Actions such as those of the hon. member for Dauphin—Swan River 
become extremely important as a means to counter tendencies to 
forget valorous actions, or to diminish such accomplishments on 
the basis that they are associated with violence and war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Memorials are an important means by which we learn about and 
remember our history.  Most Canadians are connected to these 
famous people, these heroes, in one way or another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to Will Barker, I personally think of a relative, 
Harry Amy of Saskatchewan, and aboriginal Tommy Prince of my 
riding in Manitoba.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will Barker was a farm boy born in the Dauphin Valley of 
Manitoba in 1894.  As a boy, Will became a crack shot and helped 
to put food on the table with his skill.  His grandfather put 
money down on his shooting ability in competitions at local 
community events. Will never let him down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1915 not far into World War I, Barker enlisted with the First 
Canadian Mounted Rifles.  His ability with a gun soon caught the 
attention of his superiors and he was given air reconnaissance 
duty as an observer in the second seat of the plane manning the 
cameras and guns.  But Barker wanted to fly the plane. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On November 8, 1916 he was reassigned to the Royal Flying Corps 
and on January 12, 1917 began flight training.  After two dual 
trips, one of 50 minutes and another of five minutes, Barker 
soloed and received his flying certificate on January 18.  On 
February 14 Barker was graded a flying officer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>William Barker completed both ground and flight training in 
three weeks at Oxford University.  The normal time for ground 
training alone was six weeks.  Although Barker was recognized for 
his heroism in the air for shooting down some 50 enemy planes and 
balloons, he was known as a leader who would never leave behind 
any member of his squadron.  No flyer died under his command. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Wayne Ralph, author of <I>Barker VC</I>, asked another of 
Canada's air aces, Ken Guthrie, whether he liked Barker, he 
replied “Like Barker?  I liked him, more than liked him, I 
practically adored him”. The closing paragraphs of Wayne Ralph's 
<I>Barker VC</I> go as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unlike Britain and the United States, Canada did not build a 
`Tomb of the Unknown Soldier' after the Great War.  It took us 19 
years to put up a national war memorial.  We do not have a 
national military cemetery, our 100,000 war dead lie buried in 
foreign soil.  If it is true, as one Canadian philosopher has 
noted, that Canadians seem to like their heroes smaller than 
life, then Barker is sadly irrelevant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Outside of Canada, however, he is still remembered.  Almost all 
the magazine articles and narratives about Barker in the past 20 
years have been written by British or American writers who still 
like their heroes larger than life, and don't mind them having a 
darker, more complicated side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian historians and writers quickly erased everything that 
made Barker a human being, especially his physical and 
psychological pain.  We were left this cartoon image of a 
warrior—his life before and after October 27, 1918 (the day he 
won the Victoria Cross) only a footnote.  His internment in the 
private Smith family crypt, without even a bronze plaque to mark 
his place, was the final footnote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our most decorated war hero gradually became our unknown 
soldier, except, most importantly, in the hearts of the men and 
women who had loved him. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take great pleasure in speaking today in memory of 
Lieutenant-Colonel William Barker. I certainly would like to 
support the motion of my colleague. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> 
As is the practice with Private Members' Business, the last five 
minutes of Private Members' Business is reserved for the member 
moving the motion. The hon. member for Dauphin—Swan River has 
the last five minutes. If he speaks, that is it.  So if anyone 
else would like to get on, there are seven minutes of debate, and 
12 minutes in total remaining. 
<P><A NAME="LINK211"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin—Swan River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
first I would like to thank all the members of the House who rose 
today to speak in support of Lieutenant Colonel William Barker, 
VC. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have heard today is that there is certainly support for 
Canada's most decorated soldier of World War I and a true hero of 
this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point was brought up that other people have been discounted. 
That is not the intent of this motion.  The intent is not to 
discount other heroes like Billy Bishop whom I consider to be a 
hero as well. 
I would welcome an amendment to include all air aces.  I have no 
problem with that whatsoever.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As a nation it is an indication of our maturity to start 
recognizing the true Canadians and heroes who have risked their 
lives and have made contributions to this country.  This 
generation has a renewed interest in learning about Canada's 
history.  We had almost thrown that out the window as well in 
terms of history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lieutenant Colonel William Barker played a large part in 
Canadian history. There is something really wrong when other 
countries of the world know who our significant Canadians and 
Canadian heroes are and we in this country do not. It was brought 
up numerous times that there are many people to recognize in this 
great country of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is Dr. Norman Bethune who is known better in China for his 
contributions to that country.  If it was not for another 
television production, Canadians would not know who he was. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just came back from a parliamentary exchange trip to Taiwan 
and did I make a discovery.  I found out that we have another 
Canadian hero who has made immense contributions to the country 
of Taiwan.  His name is Dr. George MacKay from Oxford county in 
Ontario.  It was Dr. MacKay who started the school system, the 
medical system and the agricultural system.  He had a huge 
influence in the development of that country.  Does anybody in 
this country know who he is?  I do not think so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On May 13 of this year the town and the RM of Dauphin, Manitoba 
at least took the first step to formally recognize 
Lieutenant Colonel William Barker.  The regional airport was 
dedicated and renamed in his honour.  We were fortunate on May 13 
that after the ceremony the famous Canadian Snowbirds, and we all 
know who the Snowbirds are, dedicated their air show in his 
honour.  I know from the ceremony the air force holds 
Lieutenant Colonel Barker in high regard and always has.  The 
three grandsons and one great-grandson of the late 
Lieutenant Colonel William Barker were in attendance at the 
ceremony. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I really do not want to take up much more time.  This is long 
overdue. Canada needs to grow up and recognize all people who 
have contributed not only to the development of this country but 
to many countries around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I wonder if I can get unanimous consent to rise on debate for 
about 30 seconds in order to move an amendment to the motion 
before the House? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon. member for 
Wentworth—Burlington has, as the House knows, spoken to the 
motion.  Because the original mover of the motion had the right 
of reply, technically the debate on this motion has ended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to have a motion moved, it would be moved on debate. 
The member for Wentworth—Burlington is asking that the time for 
debate be extended and that the member be recognized on debate 
for the purposes of moving an amendment to the motion.  He will 
be finished within 30 seconds to one minute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member for Wentworth—Burlington have the 
unanimous consent of the House for this purpose? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Unanimous consent is 
not forthcoming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There being no further members rising for debate and the motion 
not being designated as a votable item, the time provided for the 
consideration of Private Members' Business has now expired and 
the order is dropped from the Order Paper.

Royal Bank has nine branches in Regina and the Bank of Montreal 
has eight.  Will the new bank really keep 17 branches in Regina 
open?  Will the second megabank really keep 16 branches open?  I 
think not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the questions people are asking.  In the math of 
mergers, 9 plus 8 will not equal 17 branches and the CIBC and TD 
merger of 9 plus 7 will not equal 16 branches.  When some of 
those branches close, jobs will go with them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lesson number two in the math of mergers is executive's 
salaries.  Look at the salaries of top 19 executives of the 4 
banks that want to merge.  They have combined salaries and 
bonuses of almost $50 million and unexercised share option gains 
worth almost $222 million.  That is a total pay package for 19 
people of over a quarter of a billion dollars.  In the math of 
mergers, that would also pay the salary of 10,000 bank tellers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is the catch.  When the bank executives negotiate the 
mergers, the market goes up and the value of their unexercised 
stock options goes up.  Once the mergers are approved, the 
tellers lose their jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lesson number three in the math of mergers is bank profits.  The 
banks say they need to merge to become profitable and compete in 
the global marketplace.  The last week's second quarter earnings 
report show they are certainly already profitable.  Earnings 
increased 15% at the Royal Bank, 19% at the Bank of Montreal and 
28% at TD.  Meanwhile depositors get dinged with one service 
charge hike after another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should mention there was a year about 10 years ago when the 
Royal Bank as a corporation actually paid less tax than one of 
its tellers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lesson number four in the math of mergers is fewer banks equal 
more consumer choice, or at least some people like the C.D. Howe 
Institute today are trying to make that argument. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bank of Montreal has even written me a letter making more or 
less the same promise, but CIBC chair Al Flood was a little more 
frank with the Toronto <I>Star</I> editorial board.  He said last 
Wednesday: “We've got more consumer choice and corporate choice 
if we leave it the way it is, but I think it's too late for 
that”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP is the only party saying that the bankers' math does not 
add up.  You do not cut the number of banks without risking the 
number of branches and the number of jobs.  You do not build 
incentives for bank executives to hike their salaries with 
mergers and expect them not to take the opportunity.  You do not 
get more consumer choice with fewer banks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Opposition to the bank mergers among small businesses and 
consumers in Saskatchewan is growing every day.  The provincial 
government is taking steps to strengthen our credit unions so 
they can step in to fill some of the void in rural Saskatchewan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bankers' math does not add up and Canadians are going to 
want a thorough audit.  That is why the NDP has been pushing for 
immediate hearings with all five political parties into the 
impact the bank mergers will have on Canadians.  We are sorry the 
government and the other parties do not share that sense of 
urgency.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Byrne (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Natural Resources, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the announcements by 
the Royal Bank and the Bank of Montreal and subsequently by the 
CIBC and TD of their intentions to merge have changed the 
potential landscape of the financial sector in Canada, as 
referred to by my hon. colleague opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These mergers, however, will not proceed without the approval of 
the Minister of Finance and not unless the government is 
convinced of the benefits to Canadians.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is concerned about the level of competition in 
the financial services sector.  It is concerned about the impact 
of potential mergers on access to services by Canadians and 
possible implications for employment.  Consumers, in particular 
those in rural areas, have expressed concerns about the 
possibility of reduced choice or higher fees as a result of these 
mergers.  Small businesses are also concerned with the potential 
loss of face to face contact with their bankers if branches are 
closed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance will consider the advice of the director 
of the competition bureau, the office of the superintendent of 
financial institutions and of the task force on the future of 
financial institutions in determining whether to allow any merger 
in the banking sector to occur. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I assure the hon. member and all members of the House that 
Canadians will be involved in this very important process. Public 
consultations will be held to give Canadians the opportunity to 
express their views before any decision is made on these mergers. 
The hon. member has the opportunity to participate in that 
debate.

</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK217"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, on May 13, I wrote the minister of immigration a 
letter and on May 14, I asked a question in the House with regard 
to a gentleman in Vancouver named Mr. Iraz Rezaei who runs an 
immigration consulting firm and who is facing 18 criminal charges 
for the way he conducts his business. The charges against Mr. 
Rezaei are eight counts of forgery with passports, six counts of 
attempted organized illegal entry into Canada, two counts of 
counselling false refugee claims, one count of threatening and 
one count of assault. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I asked the minister the question in the House her answer 
was the normal one she gives, that she does not talk about 
specific details of any individual case. This was not a case. 
This was an individual breaking the law in Canada and who is now 
using the Internet to expand his business. He is sort of laughing 
at us with the negative publicity he is getting.  He is saying it 
has actually increased his business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister also wrote me a letter.  Amazingly enough, I 
received it today.  It is dated May 25 but it arrived today. 
Once again the minister says she will not talk about the case 
because it is a criminal case, that he is innocent until proven 
guilty and that they are not going to do anything.  As the 
minister knows, if a lawyer were charged with such offences that 
lawyer would be suspended during the investigation.  Yet this man 
is allowed to continue doing his business.  That is because there 
is no regulatory body. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister's letter states: “You are likely aware that there 
are currently no regulatory bodies or regulations governing 
immigration consultants and that CIC officials are currently 
examining the very complex issue of how best to encourage 
competency and integrity in persons who represent our clients”, 
the people who come to Canada as immigrants or refugees. She 
states: “Officials will be presenting options on how to address 
this very important issue in the near future”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The near future is not good enough.  We have been looking at the 
near future in this department for years and years.  The minister 
also said: “I am sure you can understand that, due to Canada's 
privacy legislation and because the case is before the courts, no 
further comment would be appropriate”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The privacy legislation in Canada was not brought in to protect 
criminals, those who violate the laws of Canada.  It is right in 
the act that for the Canadian good ministers can go around the 
Privacy Act.  Certainly with a gentleman like this, with all 
these charges against him, with what is happening in his 
business, with the demand of the people in the city of Vancouver 
and the province of British Columbia, the minister should give us 
the full details concerning this case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While negotiations are going on with the provinces on this 
issue, the minister should tell Canadians that her department 
will not deal with immigration consultants, period, until the 
licensing issue is solved.  Let us put them right out of business 
until they have licences and until there is a body that can 
govern what they do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Innocent people are coming to Canada.  The federal government 
immigration office is in downtown Vancouver. That is where people 
get sworn in to become citizens and where they go for interviews. 
It is a very nice building with all the typical government 
signage on it, welcome to Canada.  Right across the street is 
this gentleman's business. It has big signs in every language 
“free immigration consultant”.  We all know he is not in 
business for free. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know Vancouver like the back of my hand but there are those 
just coming to Canada, a strange country for them.  A new citizen 
or a refugee may come to this country and be told at the airport 
to go downtown.  He will see this sign across the street that 
says free help. Looks nice and warm.  It has his own language 
written on the sign.  He will tend to walk in there before he 
goes in to see those big government guys.  They are not used to 
free governments like ours.  They are not used to officials who 
work to the benefit of those who are trying to come here. 
They get sucked into this man's office.  He is there.  He sucks 
them in.  He finds out where their money is and he is making lots 
of money.  It is time the minister acted.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Maria Minna (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am happy 
to answer the question of my colleague from West 
Vancouver—Sunshine Coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Immigration Act provides for the removal from Canada of any 
foreign national found guilty of serious criminal activity.  I 
think that is pretty clear.  Any person facing charges in 
Canada's judicial system is however presumed innocent until 
proven guilty.  In any instance where an individual has been 
convicted of a serious offence under the Criminal Code 
departmental officials monitor the case to ensure that 
enforcement action is taken when warranted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At present there are currently no regulatory bodies, as the hon. 
member mentioned, or regulations governing immigration 
consultants.  Citizenship and Immigration Canada officials are 
currently examining the very complex issue of how to best 
encourage competency and integrity in persons who represent 
immigrants or refugees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In view of the fact that this is an area involving provincial 
jurisdiction, departmental officials have been in contact with 
provincial authorities.  In addition, departmental officials have 
been consulting with other federal authorities as well as with 
the legal community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of immigration consultants has also been a subject of 
discussion during the recent legislation review consultation. 
Subsequent to these consultations departmental officials will be 
presenting the minister with options on ways to address this 
important issue directly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I understand that the hon. member does not agree, we still 
have to abide by the Privacy Act.  With regard to charges brought 
against specific individuals, I am still unable to discuss 
details of any specific case in public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the hon. member that it is an issue which has to be 
addressed.  As I have previously stated it is provincial 
jurisdiction, not just federal.  It needs to be addressed across 
the country and negotiated with all provinces.  This is what the 
department is attempting to do as we speak.

</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK220"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, a 
whole stack of reports has documented what too many Canadians 
already know as a daily reality.  Poverty is increasing in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The latest report of the National Council of Welfare paints a 
devastating picture similar to other reports from Campaign 2000, 
the Canadian Council on Social Development and the Canadian Human 
Rights Commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have raised this serious matter many times in the House and 
pointed out that while the Minister of Finance talks about 
growing economic optimism millions of Canadians are desperate as 
a result of high unemployment, low wages and lower welfare rates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Cuts to social assistance, education, health care and EI only 
make matters worse.  The information from the National Council of 
Welfare report is a condemnation of the government's record.  It 
shows that the gap between the rich and the poor is increasing. 
Three billion dollars have been slashed since 1996 and poor 
people are paying the price.  Some 5.2 million Canadians are 
living below the poverty line.  They stand in food line-ups, 
homeless and raising kids on welfare that keeps them in poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Human Rights Commission has drawn attention to this 
government made travesty.  The chief commissioner pointed out in 
her 1997 annual report that the Canadian Human Rights Act made no 
mention of poverty and did not include social condition as a 
prohibited ground of discrimination.  She went on to say that in 
the broader context poverty was a serious breach of equality 
rights which she believed had no place in a country as prosperous 
as ours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also she said that it was difficult to argue that poverty was 
not a human rights issue given the devastating impact it had on 
people's lives and that we must not forget that article 25 of the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights stated that everyone had a 
right to a standard of living adequate for the health and 
well-being of himself and his family including food, clothing, 
housing, medical care and necessary social services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have introduced a motion in the House that would amend the 
Canadian Human Rights Act to include social conditions as a 
grounds for being prohibited from discrimination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the government take action to reduce poverty by setting 
targets that are achievable?  Will the government admit that the 
too often announced child tax benefit falls far short of being an 
anti-poverty strategy?  It eliminates the benefit to families on 
welfare.  It is not indexed.  It has more to do with keeping 
wages low and unemployment high. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All this is taking place in an environment of media and 
political attacks on the poor.  Just last week the Reform Party 
member at the human resource development committee launched into 
an attack against poor people.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We need political leadership from the government and all 
political parties to agree that unemployment and poverty are 
serious matters crying out for change in government policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need a fair taxation system.  We need proper income 
distribution.  We need corporations to pay the billions of 
dollars in deferred income taxes.  We need the government to 
restore our social programs.  We need to set targets to 
aggressively reduce unemployment and poverty. 
<P><A NAME="LINK221"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Byrne (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Natural Resources, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, in reply to my hon. 
colleague, the government is very concerned about the situation 
of low income Canadians.  We are particularly sensitive to the 
situation faced by some of our children and youth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the February 1997 budget the government committed $850 
million to create an enriched child tax benefit.  This new 
investment will give much needed support to the 1.4 million 
Canadian families and will help more than 2.5 million Canadian 
children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the February 1998 budget the government committed another 
$850 million investment over the course of our current mandate 
fulfilling its promise made to Canadians.  This will bring the 
total Government of Canada investment into the well-being of our 
children to almost $7 billion per year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's commitment to provide more income support for 
low income families will enable our provincial and territorial 
partners to redirect savings into social assistance.  Those 
savings can go into complementary programs and services with the 
goal of helping welfare parents become fully employed.  This is 
the basis for the national child benefit system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Building on this co-operation, last January the government 
agreed to work with the provinces and territories to develop the 
national children's agenda.  It will be a broad comprehensive 
strategy to address the important needs of Canada's children, 
especially those in particular need facing poverty.
