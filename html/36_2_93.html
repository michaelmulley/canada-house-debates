Speaker, it is my pleasure to present two petitions today from 
the good folks in southern Alberta. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first petition deals with child pornography.  The 
signatories are horrified by pornography which depicts children 
and are astounded by legal determinations that the possession of 
child pornography is not criminal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They call upon parliament, which has the duty to enact and

ensure that possession of child pornography remains a serious

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners, citizens of Canada, draw to the attention of 
the House of Commons that because the British Columbia court of 
appeal did on June 30 dismiss the appeal to reinstate subsection 
(4) of section 163 of the criminal code making possession of 
child pornography illegal in British Columbia, that by upholding 
a lower court decision on the issue of possession of child 
pornography that possession is now legal in British Columbia and 
that the well-being and safety of children are put in jeopardy. 
Therefore the petitioners request that parliament invoke section 
33 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms to override the 
B.C. court of appeal decision and reinstate subsection (4) of 
section 163 of the criminal code making possession of child 
pornography in B.C. illegal and by doing so reinforce and 
reaffirm their objection to the B.C. court of appeal decision.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I present two petitions pertaining to Bill C-23 in which 
the petitioners ask that the bill be withdrawn and that the House 
affirm marriage as an opposite sex relationship.  I think at the 
time that these petitions were prepared the petitioners did not 
realize that in fact the government did insert a definition of 
marriage that would please them enormously. Nevertheless I submit 
these petitions and observe that they also note that they want to 
see the government advance legislation that defines dependency 
relationships as being entitled to benefits in the same sense 
that Bill C-23 extended the benefits to opposite sex 
relationships and same sex relationships.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CANADIAN TOURISM COMMISSION ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK24">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from December 1, 1999 consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-5, an act to establish the Canadian Tourism 
Commission, be read the second time and referred to a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Before giving the floor to the hon. member 
for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, I wish to inform the House that 
speeches on this bill will now be ten minutes, with no questions 
of comments. 
<P><A NAME="LINK25"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> I appreciate your 
informing us of that, Mr. Speaker, because, as you are well 
aware, I am always ready to share my ideas with my colleagues, 
particularly under your skilled leadership from the Chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was very pleased to accept the invitation of my colleague from 
Témiscamingue to take part in this debate.  He is the one who 
has managed the debate for the Bloc Quebecois, and he has done 
the committee work.  He is one of the most dynamic members of 
our party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In caucus, he pointed out to us that we would be greatly ill 
advised to support such a bill.  I will have an opportunity to 
speak of our position in detail, but I would like to start by 
setting out the general principle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the Bloc Quebecois side, we all know that the federal 
government has launched a vast nation building campaign.  All 
excuses are good for this government which is looking for 
visibility.  It is seeking visibility in an excessive, obsessive 
and even pathological way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fortunately, within the caucus, some ministers are not following 
the flock.  For the most part however, we do not understand why 
it is so important to adopt or propose a Canadian tourism 
commission.  If ever there was one area that should be handled 
by the communities, it is certainly tourism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I feel quite comfortable speaking about this issue because, at 
the beginning of the 1990s in Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, a riding 
with an extremely important working-class background, we chose a 
development based on what we call neighbourhood tourism. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1020"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT4"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT4"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1020
<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that time, Hochelaga—Maisonneuve went through a process of 
industrial dequalification. While the main employers in that 
district were the textile, shoe and clothing industries and the 
Vickers shipyard, from the early 1980s until 1990 or 1992, we 
lost a considerable number of jobs.  We must remember that there 
were 30% too many ships on the seas, and the shoe and textile 
industry lost some momentum.  I must admit that the textile 
industry recovered slightly in Montreal after it was 
restructured and reengineered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I did understand that, in the district of 
Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, we would never again be the working-class 
district we had been. We benefited from the presence of the 
Olympic stadium. We will recall that in 1976 the Olympic Games 
were held in Montreal. With the construction of the Olympic 
stadium, my district became one of the five major tourism growth 
poles in Montreal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course there is also the Old Montreal. Some of our hon. 
colleagues might have come to visit Quebec in the past and spent 
a few days in the Old Montreal, which is a very important 
tourism centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is of course another tourism centre that the hon. member 
for Laval Centre visits regularly: the St. Joseph's Oratory and 
Mount Royal. That is a very important tourism centre. Another 
tourism centre that has emerged is the Maisonneuve area, which 
is comprised of the Olympic stadium, the Biodome, the 
Insectarium and the Olympic facilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 1990s, I was personally involved in my community. A few 
years later, my constituents gave me the pleasure of trusting me 
with their confidence when they choose me as their elected 
representative here in the House of Commons. I have always seen 
it as a privilege that had to be renewed from day to day, always 
keeping in mind that the only way to live up to that duty 
properly and carry out our function as members of Parliament was 
to keep a great proximity with our constituents and remain very 
close to their concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Within the tourism growth poles that have emerged in Quebec, the 
district of Hochelaga—Maisonneuve found its place, and we live in 
the shadow of the Olympic stadium. 
The Olympic Stadium is located on Pierre-de-Coubertin Street. I 
had proposed in the 1990's the establishment of a functional 
link in the south of this neighbourhood, between the Olympic 
stadium and Ontario, Adam and Sainte-Catherine streets. That 
strategy has been adopted by the economic decision makers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do I talk about that? First of all, because very interesting 
things are happening in Hochelaga—Maisonneuve. I take this 
opportunity, before moving to the substance of the bill, to say 
that Hochelaga—Maisonneuve is a neighbourhood—and it is in 
moments like this one that the member for Charlesbourg's 
hospitality and enthusiasm are precious—a neighbourhood that 
has a rich industrial heritage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have for example the east end art and cultural centre, which 
is like a flagship for the community groups. During the summer 
months, from Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day until Labour Day week-end, 
there are activities on the marketplace. Let me give you a 
scoop, Mr. Speaker. This is a piece of information that I would 
like to share with all my colleagues and the viewers at home. 
This summer, starting on Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day, we will have “la 
Bolduc” on the marketplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to remind members that “la Bolduc” was born on 
Létourneau Street, in Hochelaga—Maisonneuve. I would be tempted 
to sing one of her songs, but the presence of the deputy whip in 
the House prevents me from doing so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The roaring twenties brought us the wonderful Bolduc. One cannot 
imagine the impact this singer had on our folklore. She was one 
of the first artist to penetrate the American market. 
This summer, in Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, there will be an 
interpretative tour presenting the life of “la Bolduc” through 
various monuments and architectural artifacts.

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask all my colleagues, especially the member for Ahuntsic and 
the member for Windsor—St. Clair, to visit Hochelaga—Maisonneuve 
this summer and discover how alive the past is there and how 
tourism is thriving in a working class neighbourhood in an 
industrial setting—everyone knows that Hochelaga—Maisonneuve is 
located between downtown and the end of the island.  The 
interpretation trail, which gives expression to the best of 
Bolduc's repertoire draws people from New England. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Something happened, and I will digress a little to tell you 
about it. 
From the beginning of the 19th century until the 1930s, 500,000 
Quebecers left the province to pursue their career in the United 
States.  There are those who say that, if these people had not 
been forced to leave, to move to the United States, we would no 
doubt have won the 1995 referendum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wanted to point out this fact of history, and I also want to 
tell you that our premier, Lucien Bouchard, is one of the best 
to have served Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, you are indicating that I have only a minute left. 
I have not said even a fifth of what I wanted to say about this 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to say that we oppose the bill, because we believe there 
already exist appropriate structures within the provinces and 
the various communities.  This is especially true in Quebec, 
because the society there has integrated tourism into its 
economic development.  It did so, naturally, because tourism 
generates revenues of $5.4 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know if any of you saw the report on RDI yesterday. 
The member for Charlesbourg, partial to this sort of 
information, will remember that last year was the best year of 
the decade for tourism in Quebec.  Quebec, with its tourism 
offices, succeeded in creating stakeholder groups with enough 
resources so that people in North America and Europe find 
pleasure in discovering tourism there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I close by inviting all my fellow citizens, all those watching 
and my colleagues here to take advantage of the season of 
tourism in Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, which will be both colourful 
and lively. 
<P><A NAME="LINK26"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
colleague from Hochelaga—Maisonneuve who spoke on Bill C-5 to 
explain how well tourism is working in Quebec and our concern 
that this bill might establish a Canadian tourism commission 
that could create problems for agencies that are now working 
very well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, the agency known as Tourisme Québec was established 
and is working very well. Of course, we want to fully encourage 
tourism because it is now one of the primary industries, if you 
will, in Quebec. We have considerable attractions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec City, where I am from and which is in my riding, was 
recognized by UNESCO as part of the international heritage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tourism in Quebec has grown considerably in the last few years, 
partially because of the attractions, but also because of the 
involvement of the Quebec government. Indeed, I could mention a 
series of actions taken and of mandates reinforced by the 
government for Tourisme Québec. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1030"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT6"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT6"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1030
<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These actions were successful. I must say that Tourisme Québec 
has consolidated the efforts. Tourisme Québec is comprised of 
almost all tourism associations in Quebec and several private 
interests to take joint action in the development of this 
sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, this is a sector that does not necessarily require the 
involvement of the federal government. Of course, since this is 
an extremely important industry, any effort to improve tourism 
is appreciated by those who work in this sector. What concerns 
us is that the establishment of the Canadian tourism commission 
will be another form of intrusion in sectors that are working 
well in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only is this an intrusion into the activities of an agency 
that is working well in Quebec, but it could also be an 
encroachment on Quebec's jurisdiction over tourism. Why bother 
an agency that is working well? I fear that the federal 
government wants to expand this commission's mandate—because it 
already exists with more limited powers—and through Bill C-5 to 
expand its spending powers, among others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know very well that its basic purpose is more propagandizing 
in Quebec. Of course, Quebec is considered as a threat to Canada 
because of its sovereignist vision. In fact, the federal 
government has, for some time now, not responded to Quebec's 
justified demands. Quebec has long been asking for recognition 
within Canada, which should have gone without saying and should 
have been given a long time ago, but was refused. 
On the contrary, a whole series of agencies have been set up 
essentially to promote the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is all this commission is. Certainly, it can have some 
beneficial effects, but essentially its purpose is to invest 
more in areas where federal visibility can be ensured. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to make two quotations, including one by Pierre 
Elliott Trudeau. He said “One way to offset the attraction of 
separatism is to use time, energy, and vast sums of money to 
promote federal nationalism”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Trudeau believe in using English-Canadian nationalism, 
federal nationalism, to thwart Quebec's nationalism. He used 
this attitude, these means at the federal level to counter 
Quebec nationalism. 
In fact, the idea was to set up agencies spending as much money 
as possible to give great visibility to Canada and its flag and 
to show that, in fact, Canada is working well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have another quotation from the current Prime Minister who, 
quite recently, on February 16, 2000, said “It is very important 
in every riding in Canada that the people of the ridings know, when there is 
a subvention coming from the taxpayers of Canada, that the money is 
coming from the taxpayers of Canada, particularly in areas where 
some people want to quit Canada because they do not know 
the good that this government is doing for its citizens”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the money that the government is using comes from 
Quebec taxpayers; it is Quebec's money that the federal 
government is using. There are huge amounts of money sent back 
through programs. 
In this regard, Quebec receives more than its share. If there is 
one area where Quebec receives more than its share, it is for 
propaganda on national unity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a well known fact that in other areas, such as research, 
job creation, industry, et cetera, Quebec does not get its fair 
share, but in that area we receive a lot. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1035"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For several years now, since 1993, the government 
has worked relentlessly to set up agencies such as the CIO or 
Canada Information Office, which every year gets $20 million, 
most of which, namely 60% to 70%, is spent in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also the one in a million flag project launched by the 
Minister of Canadian Heritage. Responsibility for this 
propaganda campaign focused on Quebec was removed from that 
minister. The Department of Public Works and Government Services 
is now responsible for this project and, because of that, the 
spending authority has been increased in several areas, 
including in public works. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to this, there are also a series of agencies and 
offices. 
It is unbelievable. It is mind-boggling to see all the money 
spent by the federal government specifically for Quebec. Again, 
this is money for propaganda. All this money is being spent to 
create an image, not jobs. This money is being spent by agencies 
close to this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, what does Attraction Canada do? It makes signs 
that can be seen here and there, such as along highways. These 
signs, and there are many of them in Quebec, suggest a nice 
visit to a national park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, of the $12 million allocated for 1999-2000, 60% was 
spent in Quebec. One wonders why 60% of Attraction Canada's 
publicity was spent in Quebec. It is to attract people to 
anything that symbolizes Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, the Council for Canadian Unity has spent most of 
its $6 million budget in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why was 65% of the budget for Canada Day, which is 
organized by Heritage Canada of course, spent in Quebec? Of the 
$5.5 million spent last year for Canada Day, $3.5 million was 
spent in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The list goes on and on. We could add the spending by the Canada 
Information Office, by the Council for Canadian Unity, as well 
as the one in a million flag project. The amounts are huge. 
There is also Operation Unity. If we were to add up all the 
money spent on propaganda in Quebec, the amount would be 
staggering. It is unfortunate, because that money could have 
been spent for a good cause instead of being used to create an 
image in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the same fear with regard to the establishment of the 
Canadian tourism commission. By establishing this agency, the 
government has found another way to spend millions of dollars in 
Quebec to pitch national unity.

Speaker, I could not disagree more with the Bloc Quebecois in 
terms of its assessment of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tourism is one of the greatest galvanizing agents in the country 
which encourages Canadians to travel from coast to coast and to 
interact coast to coast.  It is an instrument that pulls us all 
together.  It is an instrument that helps us to understand each 
other in a better way. 
When we think of it logically the separatists would not want to 
support an enhanced tourism commission, especially one that has 
had the success of our tourism commission over the last few 
years.  It would work against the separatist ideology.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to focus today on tourism as it pertains to my 
constituency in downtown Toronto.  We are going through a massive 
renewal of the waterfront in downtown Toronto.  I have a document 
in front of me that was recently released entitled “Our Toronto 
Waterfront: Gateway to the New Canada”.  I am sure members have 
read assessments in the papers of some of the work of the author, 
Mr. Fung, in recent weeks not just in Toronto but in different 
parts of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This will be the biggest infrastructure renewal project in our 
country's history.  In terms of dollars it will probably be more 
than what we spent on the St. Lawrence Seaway.  Some members of 
the House might feel a little uncomfortable about the fact that 
all three levels of government are considering a major investment 
in the centre of downtown Toronto, but at the anchor and core of 
this thinking is the whole tourism realm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tourism industry is the fastest growing industrial sector on 
the planet.  When we talk about tourism we are not only talking 
about leisure tourism.  We are also talking about business 
tourism.  In other words, when a city wants to compete today for 
trade shows and business events it must have not just the 
convention facilities and hotels that are part of the business 
experience, but it must also have all the supplementary 
activities if the city is to be considered a world class tourist 
destination location. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am appealing to the House, as we look into the whole realm of 
tourism, that consideration in time be given to the notion of 
revitalizing the waterfront in downtown Toronto.  It is not a 
waterfront that is used exclusively for the residents of the 
greater Toronto area.  It is a tourism destination which 
economically benefits the entire country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, there are times when certain cities in our 
country have to compete on the world stage.  For example, when 
Calgary put in its bid for the Olympic Games, it was not just a 
benefit to Calgary when it staged the Olympic Games.  It was a 
benefit to every part of our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are attempting to do in Toronto with our waterfront is 
primarily a tourism objective, tourism that will serve in an 
economic sense every region of the country.  That is how we have 
to look at major projects like this one, especially around 
tourism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The multiple spinoffs that happen in tourism are something that 
we tend to forget at times.  We will see only the initial capital 
investment, but we will not see all the ancillary benefits of 
businessmen and women coming to a city.  It might be for a 
convention or a trade show.  Inevitably, if they have the 
opportunity of to enjoy other components within the particular 
destination, it can have a dramatic effect on business 
investment. 
It can have a dramatic effect on reputation as we deal in a 
global market more and more, as our life and business experience 
evolves.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at capital investment today we tend to want the 
immediate return to be the driving force as to whether we make a 
decision in terms of investment.  It is the responsibility of the 
House to not just look for the short term, but to look for the 
long term effects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a beautiful city like my own city of Toronto, where it would 
cost a lot of money to revitalize and renew the Toronto 
waterfront, the temptation would be to forget about tourism and 
raise money by selling parcels of land so that we could build 
condominiums.  This would do a number of things.  It would take a 
beautiful jewelled location in downtown Toronto and allow only a 
few people to enjoy it.  Whereas, if we think of tourism, not 
only could all of Canada enjoy it, but as well all of those 
visitors who want to enjoy not just the hotel room or the 
convention centre, but all of our community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the models for rejuvenating a downtown area for tourism 
is the Tivoli Gardens in Copenhagen.  As one member of parliament 
for the downtown area, I would love to see a Tivoli Gardens 
treatment in our downtown waterfront corridor because when we as 
a community show all Canadians and anyone who is visiting our 
country our respect for the environment, our respect for all of 
our community having access to special areas, that has a profound 
long term tourism impact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this legislation we are renewing our commitment to the 
Canadian Tourism Commission.  I appeal to all members to continue 
to support the good work that the Canadian Tourism Commission has 
been doing over the last five years.  I continue to urge all 
members to reinforce not only their budgets, but to use their 
influence in cities across the country which have the potential 
to be world class tourism jewels.  I urge them to use their 
experience in tourism to ensure that those spaces are there not 
only for the good of the whole country, but for the benefit of 
all those people who visit our cities.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased, albeit somewhat surprised, to address Bill C-5, an act 
to establish the Canadian tourism commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, tourism is a rapidly expanding industry all over the 
world. This is a result of globalization, because as 
transportation modes become faster and more accessible, people 
who previously did not have access to international tourism are 
now deciding to visit various countries, and this is of great 
benefit to people the world over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tourism is also important for various regions of the country, 
particularly the federal riding of Charlesbourg, which will soon 
be called Charlesbourg—Jacques-Cartier, after the senators have 
heard me. I cannot understand why they have summoned me to talk 
about the name of a riding, as they are not elected, but this is 
another matter. As I was saying, the federal riding of 
Charlesbourg is one of the nicest ones in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It includes eight municipalities and most of the green belt 
around Quebec City.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>From Saint-Gabriel-de-Valcartier in the west to 
Sainte-Brigitte-de-Laval in the east, this greenbelt is one of the 
finest assets of the tourist industry in Quebec and Canada, an 
industry that is in full expansion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People from all over the world, particularly Europeans but also 
many Asians, want to come to Quebec and to Canada to see our 
wide open spaces and to commune with nature, because they often 
live in countries which, unfortunately, are not as fortunate as 
Quebec in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The greenbelt around Quebec City is located just a few minutes 
from downtown, from the Old City, which is one of the finest 
world heritage sites. 
It is only a 15 minute drive on highway 73 from the Old City, 
with its atmosphere that goes back to the 17th and 18th 
centuries—my colleague from Québec East agrees with me—to the 
wilderness. People around the world are increasingly aware of 
this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have had a pamphlet published which I will bring for 
distribution on my trips abroad. In a few weeks I will be going 
to Australia to promote the federal riding of Charlesbourg for 
investors and vacationing tourists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding of Charlesbourg, tourism has been targeted as one 
of the most important themes of economic development. Tourism 
can be seen from different angles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the park along the Jacques-Cartier River, which is really 
exceptional, with its deep canyons. 
I formally invite members to visit the canyons in this park. They 
will be stunned by their beauty. Activities include boating, 
kayaking, climbing, hiking or picnicking. This is an 
exceptional site, and I want to point out the excellent work 
done by Marie-Michelle Parent to develop the park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also the Stoneham ski resort, which is in full 
expansion and will also be a major tourist attraction for my 
riding and the whole Quebec City area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another ski resort is Le Relais. This excellent resort, which is 
drawing more and more people, is also just 20 minutes from 
downtown Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Work is underway on the Trans-Quebec trail, which is intended to 
be a northern version of the famous Appalachian Trail in the 
United States, and which will help us discover, in Quebec, and 
Charlesbourg in particular, some of the most breathtaking 
landscapes that a hiking enthusiast may see. In the wintertime, 
activities such as snowshoeing, skiing and snowmobiling are 
possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal riding of Charlesbourg is exceptional for tourism. 
One of the main attractions in that riding could be the 
Charlesbourg zoo, the development of which has been considered a 
priority by social and economic stakeholders in the greater 
Quebec City area. I notice the chief government whip is nodding 
in agreement and listening to me intently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the stakeholders in the greater Quebec City area have asked 
the federal government to invest in the Aqua-Zoo project—the 
aquarium in Sainte-Foy and the zoo in Charlesbourg—as an 
important tourist attraction. 
The Government of Quebec has made a firm commitment to help 
finance that project, but, unfortunately, the answer from the 
federal government is late in coming, as always. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I invite the Minister of Revenue, who is responsible for the 
Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec, 
to announce very soon that the necessary investment will be made 
to revitalize the Aqua-Zoo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is just an introduction to show the importance of tourism 
to us, in the Bloc Quebecois, and to myself, as the member for 
Charlesbourg.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, Bill C-5 does not meet the many demands and the 
many needs of that growing industry, as I was saying earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government is at war with the Government of Quebec 
and wants to impose at all costs its vision of a united Canada, 
or should I say of a standardized Canada from coast to coast. 
Bill C-5 is just one element of this shameful project on which 
millions and millions of dollars are spent. Bill C-5 is just 
aimed at increasing the federal government's visibility. Its 
sole purpose is to buy the loyalty of Quebecers, whether as 
individuals or as members of organizations. 
The backdrop to all this is an incredible fiscal imbalance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has already announced a $95 billion 
surplus over the next five years.  Bloc Quebecois members and 
the rest of the House know only too well that these surpluses 
will be more on the order of $137 billion to $140 billion over 
five years, while the provinces—all of them, not just Quebec—are 
having trouble keeping their heads above water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has decided to use the huge surpluses 
it has built up on the backs of the provinces, on the backs of 
the most disadvantaged and the unemployed, so that it can 
increase its visibility and invade normally provincial 
jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be clear that everything this government does is dictated by 
the desire to stop the rise of the sovereignist movement in 
Quebec. 
It is afraid because it is only too aware that the next 
time Quebecers are asked whether they want their own country, 
the majority will answer yes. There is one objective behind 
all the government's actions and that is to put a stop to the 
inexorable growth of the sovereignist movement, whatever the 
financial or social cost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One might wonder why it came up with this particular bill, Bill 
C-5, when most provinces, and especially Quebec, already have 
infrastructures, well developed tourist networks and strategies 
much better suited to their own situation than Bill C-5 could be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must wrap up my remarks because time is unfortunately running 
out.  The Bloc Quebecois is firmly opposed to the federal 
government using Quebecers' tax dollars in order to promote in 
all areas, including tourism with Bill C-5, its vision of a 
Canada that is united from coast to coast in order to stamp the 
maple leaf on everyone's forehead when that is not what 
Quebecers want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are strongly opposed to this bill and never—this government 
had better listen up—never will Quebecers be bought with their 
own money, never will they allow their vote to be bought by such 
a pathetic government. 
<P><A NAME="LINK29"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, like my 
colleague, it is with some surprise that I address Bill C-5 
today. Come to think of it, as I read this bill this morning, it 
is with great pleasure that I do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-5 aims more particularly at establishing the Canadian 
tourism commission. It is quite clear that in Quebec's own 
economic life, tourism has always been an important driving 
force of economic development.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tourism is not only an important economic development factor in 
Quebec, it is also an employment development factor. The jobs 
are not limited, as they are in other industries, to a few areas 
or cities. On the contrary, for us Quebecers, tourism is an 
economic and employment development tool in each of the regions 
of the province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given that Quebec has spent many years developing an expertise 
in tourism, developing the appropriate infrastructure and 
putting in place a tourist services supply, and that Quebecers 
have spent many years developing a foreign marketing network, I 
find that the government has a lot of nerve to put forward today 
an act to establish the Canadian tourism commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to remind hon. members of a number of things 
that have been accomplished up to now in the province of Quebec 
and some of the success stories that have brought tourism 
development in Quebec where it now stands. In the last 25 years, 
the tourist services supply has changed considerably in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Several years ago, when people were talking about the tourist 
infrastructure, they meant the big tourist complexes only. 
However, to respond to the demand of the new clients who are 
looking for specialized tourist services, Quebec had to adapt 
its tourist products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, since Europeans are coming to Quebec in greater 
numbers, we had to develop tourist products tailored to their 
needs. But what do Europeans and Americans like about Quebec? 
The great outdoors, which Claude Gauthier described as made up 
of lakes and rivers. Quebecers have always been proud of the 
great outdoors, which still constitute an important tourist 
product. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Besides the wide open spaces, there is also adventure. Adventure 
is now an important tourist attraction. 
This was developed in the regions by small businesses who, 
through our network overseas, work day in and day out to attract 
tourists who would like what Quebec has to offer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is rather odd. Its objective is to establish a Canadian 
tourism commission but we already have an agency called 
Tourisme Québec. I worked there for a few years. I know that 
tourism is a priority for Quebec. Furthermore, the Parti 
Quebecois government established the Department of Tourism in 1994. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At first there was just a junior minister in charge of tourism 
policy, but later on a senior minister was appointed to head a 
full department with all the necessary powers to develop tourist 
products. Tourisme Québec was given an impressive mandate to 
promote Quebec's tourist products, including facilities, 
infrastructure and tourist attractions.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to mention one of the mandates of Tourisme Québec. It 
must, among other things, guide and co-ordinate public and 
private initiatives on tourism. This is important. Unlike what 
happens in all other sectors, this does not imply a fragmented 
marketing strategy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To attract clients, there must be co-ordination in the marketing 
of the projects, in the way what is available in the tourist 
industry is advertised. Tourisme Québec co-ordinates this tourist 
supply and how it is marketed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another important element is to promote awareness of tourist 
products and knowledge of tourist clienteles. 
We know that we must do more than simply develop tourist 
products; we must ensure that specific clients are made aware of 
the tourist products developed in our regions. All the Tourisme 
Québec advertising campaigns abroad were aimed at ensuring 
development of tourist products. That is the role of Tourisme 
Québec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another mandate of Tourisme Québec is to support the improvement 
and development of Quebec's tourist supply. Another is to 
organize and support the promotion of Quebec and of its tourist 
products on various markets. This is another important element 
in the mandate of Tourisme Québec. Tourisme Québec must also 
inform clients on tourist products in Quebec and build and 
operate public tourist facilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tourisme Québec has a very clear mandate. 
It contributes to developing the tourist product, to guiding and 
co-ordinating the supply, to organizing and supporting the 
promotion of Quebec as a tourist destination. I fail to see why 
the Canadian government wants to establish a Canadian tourism 
commission when Tourisme Québec is doing a fine job promoting 
tourist products and tourist supply in Quebec, under a well 
designed marketing strategy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the House that we have developed what we call in Quebec 
the Associations touristiques régionales to co-ordinate, to organize 
and ensure adequate development of tourism in Quebec. For 
Montreal, where my riding is, the situation is somewhat 
different. We do not have an Association touristique régionale 
but we have an office du tourisme, as does Quebec City. Big 
cities have an office du tourisme to promote them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I have to say that I am rather worried. There 
will be overlapping in the activities of this new commission and 
those of Tourisme Québec. The new commission will duplicate work 
done by a public organization with a clear hospitality and 
clientele co-ordination marketing strategy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The commission's goal also worries me. If Tourisme Québec is 
doing a good job, why establish the Canadian tourism commission 
if not to set up a federal promotion and propaganda machine? 
That also worries me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why fix what is working in Quebec? Why establish a new structure 
when the most recent figures released by the Quebec tourism 
minister and department are very interesting? Tourism in Quebec 
is doing well. 
We have no need for a new structure to reach new objectives when 
we are already reaching the existing ones.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of

speak at second reading of Bill C-24. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think most hon. members would agree that few issues are more 
timely and few areas of action more compelling than taxation. 
The operation of our federal tax system affects virtually every 
Canadian and every family, each company and organization.  It 
impacts our standard of living as individuals and our ability to 
compete and grow as a nation. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the reason why, having put the country's financial house 
in order and eliminated the deficit, our government adopted 
concrete measures to start reducing the personal tax burden of 
Canadians. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Broad based income tax reduction is not and cannot be the only 
arena for action.  From the start of our first mandate, this 
government has been active in ensuring that we provide a tax 
system which is fair, a system which eliminates unnecessary 
loopholes and confusion, and a system which provides targeted 
assistance to sectors and groups, such as charities and persons 
with disabilities, that deserve our assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the goals and opportunities underlying the legislation 
before us to make our tax system more simple and fair not only 
for individual Canadians but for Canadian businesses as well. 
Another goal we have consistently pursued is to sustain and 
enhance our federal tax system in a manner which promotes 
federal-provincial co-operation and harmonization.  This bill 
does just that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members will recall that when the harmonized sales tax, the 
HST, was implemented in 1997 with three Atlantic provinces, Nova 
Scotia, New Brunswick, and Newfoundland and Labrador, it was a 
successful example of federal-provincial co-operation. It also 
presented creative solutions to some of the challenges that we as 
Canadians will face together as we head into a new century.  This 
bill builds on the spirit of that initiative. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even if this bill is specifically designed to improve the GST, 
the goods and services tax, and the HST, it also contains 
important proposals concerning the tax on certain products. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this regard Bill C-24 contains measures with respect to the 
taxation of tobacco products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I trust that hon. members are aware of the government's 
commitment to reduce smoking rates, particularly among younger 
Canadians.  One of the concrete planks in this commitment has 
been the national action plan to combat smuggling which we 
launched in 1994. This plan has had a significant impact on 
contraband such that we have been able to increase taxes on 
tobacco products in 1995, 1996 and 1998 in co-operation with the

</I></B></P><P align=left>Today's legislation puts in place another increase of 60 cents 
in federal excise taxes per carton of 200 cigarettes for sale in 
Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward 
Island, the five provinces that are action plan partners.  These 
provinces are also increasing their taxes on cigarettes by 
comparable amounts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Excise taxes on tobacco sticks will also be increased in 
Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island, 
re-establishing a uniform national tax rate on tobacco sticks for 
sale in all provinces and the territories.  Furthermore, the bill 
proposes to make permanent the current 40% surtax on the profits 
of tobacco manufacturers. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a related matter, as it was mentioned in the federal budget 
of February 1999, Bill C-24 contains measures intended to 
implement a reduction of the tobacco export tax exemption. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The intent of this measure is to reduce the supply of Canadian 
made tobacco products intended for export but which are 
potentially available to smugglers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposals contained in the bill relating to the taxation of 
tobacco products reaffirm the government's commitment to reduce 
tobacco consumption in Canada while maintaining vigilance in 
combatting the level of contraband. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An important component of Bill C-24 is that it reflects the 
government's responsiveness to the health and social needs of 
Canadians.  For example, the government recognizes that many 
Canadians are providing care for family members, very often an 
elderly parent or disabled child. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-24 proposes an exemption from sales tax for these respite 
care services.  This would mean that services—care and 
supervision—for persons who have limited capacity for 
self-supervision and self-care due to disability would be exempted 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This proposal will enhance federal support for those Canadians 
who are striving to meet the growing demands of caring for family 
members with an infirmity or disability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to individuals with disabilities, I trust that hon. 
members would agree that these Canadians face many challenges. In 
past budgets the government has introduced numerous measures to 
assist these individuals.  The bill builds on such actions and 
the significant level of tax assistance that is already 
available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposals contained in Bill C-24 extend sales tax relief to 
the purchase of specially equipped motor vehicles for 
transporting individuals with disabilities.  The proposed sales 
tax rebate will ensure that all individuals and organizations get 
tax relief on the additional cost of purchasing vehicles that 
meet their special needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other measures in the area of health care that are contained in 
the bill include the continuation of the goods and services tax 
and the harmonized sales tax exemption for speech therapy 
services.  Under the GST and HST, harmonized sales tax, the list 
of exempt health care providers is limited to those regulated as 
a health care profession in at least five provinces.  The 
proposals contained in the bill will allow the speech therapy 
profession more time to meet the eligibility requirements for the 
provision of tax exempt services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also ensures that providers of osteopathic services are 
exempt from sales tax.  In addition, Bill C-24 corrects an 
inequity with respect to providers of psychological services by 
ensuring that the sales tax does not discriminate against duly 
qualified psychologists. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I indicated in my introduction, the government is committed 
to making the taxation system more equitable for Canadians. 
Bill C-24 shows that commitment in a number of different areas. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In recognizing the important role played by charitable 
organizations in assisting Canadians and enriching our 
communities, the bill addresses the special circumstances faced 
by designated charities whose main purpose include the provision 
of care, employment, employment training or employment placement 
services for individuals with disabilities.  Specifically the 
bill provides these charities the capacity to compete on an equal 
footing when selling goods or services to GST registered 
businesses.

<A HREF="#LINKT15"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-24 also refines the rules for the streamlined accounting 
method for charities.  In addition, it implements the decision by 
the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador to extend the 50% 
rebate of the provincial portion of the harmonized sales tax, 
which is already available to charities in that province and to 
certain public service bodies such as hospitals that are also 
charities.  The extended rebate would be available to those 
entities in relation to the activities undertaken in their 
capacity as charities. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thus, a hospital board in Newfoundland, operating as a 
charitable institution, might also manage a care home.  The 
proposed amendment would enable them to apply for a 50% rebate 
of the HST paid on expenditures relating to the care home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of the amendments proposed in Bill C-24 are aimed at 
clarifying and enhancing application of our sales tax systems. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the bill contains amendments aimed at clarifying 
the sales tax treatment of transactions between natural resource 
producers and exploration companies.  Amendments such as these 
will ensure consistency and fairness in the application of the 
goods and services tax and harmonized sales tax in a number of 
key areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should like to take a moment to point out that the amendments 
in the proposed legislation were developed in response to 
representations from tax professionals, business communities and 
Canadians.  As I mentioned earlier, this reflects the 
government's ongoing commitment to making the tax system fairer, 
more efficient and easier for businesses to comply with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of the collaborative process between the federal 
government and businesses in the energy sector, the bill proposes 
a number of changes which streamline the operation of the goods 
and services tax and the harmonized sales tax in that sector. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the measures proposed facilitate export 
transactions which involve exchanges of gas and oil between 
Canadian and foreign suppliers. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These changes will help to ensure that Canadian businesses 
remain competitive in the international marketplace.  With 
respect to other international commercial transactions, the bill 
also proposes to make air navigation services provided to 
carriers tax-free in relation to international flights and refine 
the rules for exports of goods by common carriers. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take this opportunity to state that the federal 
government acknowledges the importance of the travel and tourism 
industry to the Canadian economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has contributed to promoting Canada as a tourist 
destination and to supporting the tourist industry as a source 
of employment. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members are no doubt aware that the federal government 
provides rebates of the goods and services tax and harmonized 
sales tax to non-residents on eligible goods exported from 
Canada, short term accommodation and certain goods and services 
used in the conduct of a foreign convention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In consultation with the tourism industry the visitors rebate 
program was reviewed.  These consultations highlighted the fact 
that the program is generally seen as an important tool in 
promoting tourism, in particular the accommodation and convention 
measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of the review the 1998 budget contained several 
proposals to improve the visitors rebate program.  Bill C-24 
proposes further enhancements to the design and delivery of the 
visitors rebate program to better promote Canada as a destination 
for tourists and a site for conventions, for example by reducing 
the the GST and HST costs associated with providing conventions 
to non-residents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the subject of tourism the bill also proposes changes aimed 
at providing consistent tax treatment between tax-free 
international transportation services and various separate 
charges that relate to such transportation. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another change will eliminate the requirement that payment for 
air travel from the United States to Canada be tendered outside 
Canada for the transportation service to be tax free. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I emphasize that the federal government will continue to consult 
with the business community to improve the operation of our sales 
tax system.

<A HREF="#LINKT16"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that regard Bill C-24 contains a number of proposals to 
improve the rules relating to certain business arrangements and 
ensure that the legislation is consistent with the policy intent. 
As well as clarifying certain sales tax issues in the area of 
financial services, Bill C-24 provides a more level playing field 
in the retail debt sector by repealing bad debt relief for 
closely related financing companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In response to industry concerns, the bill also proposes an 
important measure that will correct an inequity with respect to 
multi-employer pension plans.  The bill proposes that a rebate be 
provided to trusts governed by such pension plans, which will 
place them on a comparable footing with single employer pension 
plans in relation to the sales tax they bear. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our government is continuing as well to improve the 
administration and application of our sales tax system.  Bill 
C-24 amends a number of provisions in these areas to ensure their 
conformity with existing administrative practices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the bill proposes greater harmonization between 
certain administrative and application provisions in the various 
laws on taxes and charges. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also contains proposals to improve the efficiency and 
effectiveness of the assessment, appeals and corrections 
provisions overall. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned earlier that Bill C-24 contains measures relating to 
other specific levies on certain products.  In accordance with 
the 1997 decision of the World Trade Organization, the bill 
contains the amendment that repeals the provisions relating to 
the excise tax on split-run editions of periodicals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to customs tariffs the bill implements proposals to 
increase certain duty and tax exemptions for persons returning to 
Canada after a minimum period abroad.  These proposals will make 
it more convenient for travellers to clear Canadian customs. This 
is just another example of the steps we have taken to improve 
service for visitors and for Canadians returning to Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government remains committed to enhancing aboriginal 
self-government and has often reiterated its willingness to put 
into effect taxation arrangements with first nations interested 
in exercising tax powers.  In this context through the budget 
implementation acts of 1997, 1998 and 1999 the government 
introduced legislation enabling certain first nations to impose 
GST-like taxes on specific products such as alcoholic beverages, 
fuel and tobacco. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill proposes that technical amendments be made to the laws 
I have just mentioned to increase the harmonization of the sales 
tax of first nations with the GST and to ensure the definitions 
in these laws are consistent with the definitions used in other 
federal laws. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, the measures contained in Bill C-24 I have outlined 
today propose to refine, streamline and clarify the application 
of our tax system. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill also tackles social issues that are important to 
Canadians. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore urge hon. members to consider the bill and give it 
their full support. 
<P><A NAME="LINK35"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am honoured to stand to give my point of view with respect to 
Bill C-24.  It is important for everyone who is listening, both 
in and outside the House or perhaps someone who may be reading 
<I>Hansard</I> some time in the future, to know what is going on 
here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-24 is actually a budget implementation act.  I begin my 
speech by saying that a very strange thing happens in Canada when 
it comes to the implementation of budget measures. There is the 
day when the Minister of Finance stands and there is a bunch of 
hoopla.  All the media come and set up their big tractor trailer 
units with their dishes.  The cables that run into this place are 
twice as thick as usual. 
It is called budget day.  On that day, the minister announces all 
the determinations that are going to appear in the new budget 
rules which, for all intents and purposes, means this is how we 
are going collect money from Canadians and this is how we are 
going to spend it for them.  That is the big picture of the 
budget.  Of course, everyone pays close attention to it and 
wonders how it will impact on them.

<A HREF="#LINKT17"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I find difficult to understand and accept is that the 
budget is announced prior to any real input from Canadian people 
or from parliamentarians.  I know that all the Liberals in the 
House would protest that if they were so inclined.  They would 
say that we have had prebudget consultations, we have listened to 
the people and we are implementing the things that the people of 
Canada want.  I think most of the members in the House presently 
would probably be silent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would however point out that this really is a very one-sided 
affair.  The Minister of Finance in conjunction with the top 
people in the finance department actually write that budget 
speech and determine the budget provisions well in advance of the 
budget being made.  When it is announced in the House of Commons 
instantly becomes de facto law.  We can call that a democratic 
process if we want to but I seriously question that because of 
two things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the one I have already mentioned, is that there is no 
meaningful input or debate in the House prior to the budget.  We 
go through some machinations of doing that but we very seldom see 
the actual minister or his departmental officials.  How it is 
transmitted to them I do not think is much beyond some political 
considerations.  These decisions are made behind closed doors and 
then it becomes de facto law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second part, which shows that this is very one-sided and 
dictatorial, is that there is to my knowledge no record of a 
parliament ever reversing anything that the Minister of Finance 
has said on budget day.  In other words, what he says is then 
law.  When we come to vote on the budget, the government members 
are all whipped into voting for these measures.  Whether they 
agree with them or not and whether they understand them or not, 
they just do it.  We have new rules imposed on Canadians without 
any real input. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Traditionally the members on the opposition side will speak and 
vote against those parts of the budget that they find 
objectionable, and in our party, we will speak in favour of the 
things that we support.  We are then asked to vote, usually on 
its entirety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the dilemmas we face with the bill before us today is 
that with one vote we will have to either vote for some of the 
things we agree with, thereby giving our assent to those that we 
profoundly disagree with or, on the contrary, we will vote 
against Bill C-24 because of the objectionable parts of it. The 
political spin from our opposition on the other side will be that 
we voted against giving a tax break to people who have extra 
expenses because they are handicapped. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a great dilemma. I in fact would like to say yes.  I am 
in favour of those provisions in the bill that provide for 
reduced taxation for those who have special costs because they 
are physically or mentally handicapped or whatever their needs. 
However, it is as if I had gone to a restaurant where the waiter 
brings me a beautiful steak and instead of having it surrounded 
with potatoes and vegetables, it is surrounded by gravel. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1135"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT19"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT19"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1135

<A HREF="#LINKT18"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I now have a beautiful steak with gravel around it and I have to 
ask myself “Am I going to take it or not?”  As good as the 
steak may appear and as hungry as I may be, I can look at the 
plate and say “That steak is so appealing.  Yes, I would love to 
eat it but the gravel, the sand and the other garbage around it 
makes it unpalatable.  I have to send it back to the kitchen and 
maybe the cook can try again”. That is probably what will happen 
with Bill C-24. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have said, there are some admirable and commendable things 
in this bill.  I would like to be on record as being in favour of 
it but I do not think that will be an option because of the 
objectionable things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>About 1994, if I remember correctly, the third party, as we were 
called at that time, brought forward a motion on the budget. 
During that parliament, as in this one, the Liberals had a 
majority and could do pretty well what they wanted to do.  The 
Reform Party at that time moved some amendments to the budget 
which were truly not substantive but very symbolic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the motions we moved would have reduced the expenditures 
of several departments by a small amount.  As I recall, our 
motion called for the expenditures to be reduced by $20,000.  I 
hesitate to say that is a small amount because people in my 
riding and elsewhere in Canada are being taxed to death by the 
government and to them $20,000 is by no means a small amount. 
However, in comparison to the billions that the government taxes 
out of Canadians and spends, sometimes very foolishly, $20,000 is 
a very small proportion of the total budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We therefore moved a motion that one or two departments have 
their total expenditures reduced by $20,000 as a symbolic 
statement simply to demonstrate that parliament did have control 
over the budget.  We thought that was an important first step. If 
that could have been established, we would have proceeded to the 
next step and taken some real control as parliamentarians over 
the budget process.  We would have been able to tell the 
bureaucrats how much money they could spend instead of them 
telling us how much they were going to take from Canadian 
taxpayers and spend in government departments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that every Liberal member at that time voted against 
our motion.  We gave the Liberals an opportunity to demonstrate 
that parliament had control over the budgetary process but they 
chose to vote against it.  They said that they would not reduce 
departmental budgets even by $20,000 because they wanted to 
continue the dictatorship that comes from the Minister of 
Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another reason that it is very difficult to hold the 
government accountable.  I will illustrate this by taking one of 
the cases in the particular act that we are studying today.  We 
have an issue in Bill C-24 where the government proposes to 
exempt from taxation part of the accommodation costs made by 
people who come into Canada as visitors. 
This simply exempts and adds to the exemption people who are 
coming in as tourists and who are using the campgrounds as 
accommodations.  Up until now campgrounds were not included in 
this.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to read this clause in the bill because it illustrates to 
Canadian taxpayers, and to people who happen to be listening to 
this debate or who will be reading it later on, how difficult it 
is for us to keep the government's feet to the fire so to speak 
because of the convoluted language that is used even in such a 
simple matter.  I refer to section 252 of the act which is being 
amended by clause 68 of Bill C-24.  It states that section 252 of 
the act is replaced by the following: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>“camping accommodation” means a campsite at a recreational 
trailer park or campground (other than a campsite included in the 
definition “short-term accommodation” in subsection 123(1) or 
included in that part of a tour package that is not the taxable 
portion of the tour package, as defined in subsection 163(3))— 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is how it starts. I will go back and read the first part 
again but I will miss the brackets this time.  It reads: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>“camping accommodation” means a campsite at a recreational 
trailer park or campground— 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>And then we have this parenthetical phrase: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—that is supplied by way of lease, licence or similar 
arrangement for the purpose of its occupancy by an individual as 
a place of residence or lodging, if the period throughout which 
the individual is given continuous occupancy of the campsite is 
less than one month.  It includes water, electricity and waste 
disposal services, or the right to their use, if they are 
accessed by means of an outlet or hook-up at the campsite and are 
supplied with the campsite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“tour package” has the meaning assigned by subsection 163(3), 
but does not include a tour package that includes a convention 
facility or related convention supplies. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is how this thing starts but then it becomes convoluted. 
Perhaps I should not read all this but it now begins to define 
“non-resident”.  I previously said that this is the part in 
Bill C-24 that proposes to exempt from taxation the taxes on camp 
fees that are charged to non-residents.  It states: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>a non-resident person is the recipient of a supply made by a 
registrant of short-term accommodation, camping accommodation or 
a tour package that includes short-term accommodation or camping 
accommodation,— 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It further states: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>a particular non-resident who is not registered under Subdivision 
d of Division V is the recipient of a supply of short-term 
accommodation, camping accommodation or a tour package that 
includes short-term accommodation or camping accommodation. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, do you know what I said?  Do you understand what I 
just read?  I hate to admit this publicly but I am not sure I 
know what this means.  However, I will vote on it and so will all 
the Liberal members afterwards.  Of course it is easy for them 
because they will just stand when their string is pulled. 
However, as a member of the opposition I have to somehow try to 
make sense of this and figure out whether this is a good thing or 
not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to urge people out there in the real world to get 
on the Internet and call up Bill C-24.  They just have to go to 
the parliamentary site, www.parl.gc.ca, look for government 
business, look at the bills, pull up Bill C-24 and try to read 
it. I defy them to read it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know there are not many Liberals listening to me right now but 
maybe there is an accountant listening. 
Maybe that accountant could phone me back and say “I read that 
and I understood it perfectly”.  I would like to meet that 
person.  That is only one example.  It goes on and on.  I 
hesitate to punish our interpreters, whom I value so highly, by 
reading more of this.  These are really strange things.  It goes 
on and on for four or five pages.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another strange thing that happens.  Different parts of 
the bill come into effect on different dates.  Subparagraph 
252.1(13) states that subsection (1) is deemed to have come into 
force on February 24, 1998, which is a little over two years ago. 
There are other parts of the bill which I scanned through while I 
was sitting here that have implementation dates all the way back 
to 1990.  Even though this is a bill that primarily implements 
the provisions of the budget in the last year or two, or three, 
there are some sections which go back further than that.  For 
example, the top of page 98 states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(5) Subsection (2) is deemed to have come into force on November 
26, 1997”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(6) Subsection (3) is deemed to have come into force on April 1, 
1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(7) Subsection (4) is deemed to have come into force on December 
17, 1990. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is over 10 years ago.  We are implementing a budget 
provision that, when the bill is passed, will retroactively be 
deemed to have come into force on December 17, 1990.  Most of us 
cannot even remember where we were on that day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do this to illustrate how convoluted the Income Tax Act is. 
The whole bill is full of this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is anything that has urgent need, it is the 
simplification of the Income Tax Act.  I despair of a government 
which has as its goal to fleece Canadians of as much money as it 
can and then selectively, through all of these different 
provisions of the Income Tax Act, make provisions from which one 
person or another is exempt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I resent the tax exemption on camping facilities.  I resent the 
fact that non-residents can come into Canada and rent the same 
space that I and my fellow Canadians can rent and pay a lower 
price for the same space.  If the space is worth it, we should 
all pay the same amount.  Non-residents are exempt because it 
helps to make us competitive in the travel industry.  It is 
ironic that the bill discussed prior to this was the tourism 
bill. Tourism is very important to Canadians.  It is a large part 
of our economy and it must be competitive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Bill C-24 we have a move to make it more competitive, but 
what about Canadians who choose to travel in their country, to 
enjoy their parks?  They are priced right out of it.  After they 
have finished paying their income tax, property tax, sales tax 
and their daily expenses, Canadians scarcely have enough money 
left to even consider going on a vacation.  If they do go on a 
vacation they pay taxes on everything that happens when they go 
to different places, including parks.  They pay huge fees now to 
the Government of Canada to enter a national park and then they 
pay the GST on top of that fee.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking of the GST, I distinctly recall that the Liberals, when 
campaigning for the 1993 election, made some statements about not 
liking the GST.  In fact, there were some members of the Liberal 
team who campaigned on trying to get rid of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know if you were one of those, Mr. Speaker.  I know 
that you ran under the Liberal banner and, of course, due to the 
neutrality of your position I am not able to draw you into these 
partisan debates.  However, I think of all those other Liberals. 
Should I call them the green foreheaded Liberals over there?  At 
least I see a lot of green, so that must reflect their foreheads. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of them ran under the campaign which said “We will kill 
the GST.  We will eliminate it.  It will be gone”.  In fact, the 
hon. member who is now the Minister of Canadian Heritage, who in 
the last parliament was the Deputy Prime Minister, was actually 
forced to resign because day after day the press and the 
opposition kept reminding her of how she had said she would 
resign if the GST did not disappear.  Finally, one day she had 
that critical moment when she went to her banking machine and it 
gave her a tinge of conscience.  It said to her “You had better 
resign because you said you would if the GST was not gone, and it 
is not gone”.  The Canadian taxpayers in her riding got to fork 
out another approximately $100,000 to run a byelection.  They 
paid for the fact that she and all of her colleagues broke that 
election promise.  They paid again.  They paid for the election 
campaign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, it was well reported at that time that prior to her 
making this decision which showed that she had such a deep 
conscience there was some polling done, paid for by the 
taxpayers, which determined in advance that if, having resigned, 
she were to run again that she would be re-elected.  Then she was 
able to fulfil her tinge of conscience and resign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I sometimes wonder what would have happened if that poll had 
said that if she had resigned over this GST issue she would not 
have been re-elected.  I wonder if she still would have followed 
through on that deep pang of conscience.  I wonder if maybe she 
would have just invented more excuses in order to hang on to 
power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point I making is this.  There was a commitment to kill the 
GST, to eliminate it.  It would be gone, the people were told, if 
they voted Liberal.  I sometimes wonder how many Canadians voted 
Liberal in the 1993 election based on that promise alone.  I 
think there were many of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Conservatives brought in the much hated GST in 1990.  I have 
never before in my life—and I have lived quite a long time—seen 
a tax which has gained such enduring hatred of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every week there are advertisements in the papers in Alberta 
where one store or another has a big sale and the biggest banner 
on the sale announcement is that there is no GST, but in smaller 
letters it says that the store will have to pay the GST because 
it is a legal requirement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of saying there will be a 7% reduction in prices, which 
would bring in only a few people, they put up a big banner that 
says “No GST” and the people flock there to avoid the GST. The 
stores find that they get more people coming to storewide sales 
when they have a no GST event than if they were simply to say 
they would reduce the prices by 7%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The GST is a very much hated tax. 
I sometimes think that the Liberal government sits in the 
position of power in Ottawa based on, dare I say it—and it is 
not attributed to any individual—based on a fraud.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people on the government side in the election campaign said 
they would eliminate the GST if elected.  That is why Canadians 
voted for them.  The government turned around and not only kept 
the GST, but harmonized it in those provinces participating.  It 
is now a 15% tax instead of a 7% tax.  We all know it is a 
harmonized tax and some of the revenue goes to the province, but 
I think it is also fair to say that instead of eliminating the 
GST in the participating provinces the government effectively 
doubled it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the Liberal record on the GST.  Bill C-24, which we are 
debating today, has included in it a number of GST provisions.  I 
said at the beginning of my speech that I am not opposed to some 
of those provisions.  There is an increase in tax on cigarettes, 
which is another topic.  Bill C-24 reduces or removes the GST on 
a number of health care related services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to share this with hon. members.  We recently had a 
funeral in our family.  My beloved sister passed away about a 
month ago and we had the funeral.  We did not pay much attention 
to this issue that I am now going to mention at the time of my 
sister's funeral, but I had a grieving constituent phone me 
because his wife had just passed away and he said “In the middle 
of my sorrow, I go to buy a casket for my wife, and the casket is 
$3,000 and the government wants another $210 in taxes, in GST, on 
the casket.”  He was very upset.  I was not able to comfort him 
in his loss, nor was I able to promise him that there would be no 
GST on caskets tomorrow, because there is, the government has 
arranged it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I noticed in Bill C-24 that there is a change concerning burial 
plots and the GST as well, but I do not quite remember what it 
is.  It is one of those convoluted things that I tried to read, 
but could not really figure out from the bill whether the GST 
will be increased on burial plots or whether it applies to 
non-residents, or what it was.  However, there are some 
revisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The GST is everywhere.  It is there when you are born, it is 
there when you live, and it is there when you die.  The 
government has no intention of reducing or removing it.  It loves 
the revenue.  There is nothing that the government does not like 
to tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is an interesting one.  I want to say a bit about the tax 
on cigarettes.  It was about three, four or five years ago that 
cigarette smuggling was a huge issue, so the government decided 
to reduce the taxes on cigarettes to make the price differential 
between smuggled cigarettes and those purchased at the store less 
so there would be less demand for the black market, thereby 
reducing smuggling.  The government tells us that this has had 
some effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-24 will once again increase cigarette taxes.  It also 
provides for a rebate system to retailers in the cigarette 
marketing industry, but I will not go into that detail.  However, 
I have to ask the question:  If high taxes were part of the 
reason for developing the smuggling industry in the first place, 
would it not be possible that by increasing these taxes, as Bill 
C-24 will do, the problem will return?  I think that is something 
the government should think about.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk a little about some of the other provisions in 
Bill C-24.  One that comes to mind has to do with non-residents, 
cross-border transactions and the work of conventions.  This bill 
talks about provisions for collecting taxes on gas and other 
utility transmission and generation. The bill also provides for a 
tax rebate for charities. Charities can get a tax rebate on the 
money they raise in bottle drives and things like that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real thing happening is that we are meddling.  We are once 
again increasing the complexity of the Income Tax Act. There is 
no real change here.  Nothing here will substantially change the 
tax level of Canadians.  That is what is regrettable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to see the Liberals actually implement their 
election promise.  Perhaps we should have a motion again in the 
House calling for the elimination of the GST.  As a matter of 
fact, Mr. Speaker, I think that if you were to ask for it right 
now, perhaps we could get unanimous consent that the GST be 
eliminated.  I would ask for that.  Sure, why not? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon. member for 
Elk Island has requested unanimous consent to move a motion. Does 
the hon. member for Elk Island have the unanimous consent of the 
House to move the motion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am surprised.  When I tried 
to fulfill their election promise, Liberal members came out of 
the bushes and said they did not want to do it.  I am really 
surprised. They ran on that election promise.  I thought they 
would be quite willing to accept the motion that the GST be 
eliminated because that is what they ran on.  It would have been 
done and they could have gone home and said, “Look, we have 
fulfilled our promise”, just by staying in the bushes behind the 
curtains when a member of the official opposition moved that 
motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also have a general statement about Bill C-24.  It is 
illustrative of the things the government does.  The budget is 
much more of a PR exercise than most people are aware.  The 
announcements made in the budget every year by the Minister of 
Finance are numbers which are really designed to make people feel 
good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were announcements in last year's budget for example 
restoring $13.5 billion to health care.  Canadians felt so good 
about that.  Wowee, after all the money that has been taken out 
of health care.  We all know how our health care system is 
suffering and now the government is putting back $13.5 billion. 
That is the messaging the Liberals do.  What people do not know, 
and I guess it is the job of the opposition to point this out to 
Canadians and we need to repeat it over and over again, is that 
is a cumulative total over five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my humble opinion it is bordering on dishonest in a one year 
budget to use numbers like that.  It implies that $13.5 billion 
per year is being restored to health care when that is not true. 
It is $2.5 billion in the budget year, $2.5 billion the next 
year, $2.5 billion the year following, and then a couple of other 
payments in the next two years.  Over five years the government 
will manage to put $13.5 billion into health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It makes us wonder why the government did not say $20 billion 
spread over 10 years or $40 billion spread over 20 years. 
Why did it not do that?  The government could have got a bigger 
kick out of saying $40 billion instead of $20 billion or $13.5 
billion.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-24 very much illustrates this because over and over it 
talks about implementing measures that were introduced in the 
1999, 1998 and 1997 budgets.  By voting in favour of this bill, 
if anybody does, they are simply saying to the Liberal government 
that it is okay for it to lie to the Canadian people and to 
totally misrepresent the budgetary facts by putting these things 
into place and talking about them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Way back in 1997 there was the announcement of the millennium 
scholarship fund.  The government got three years of kick out of 
it but did not put any money into it.  The students' lives were 
not made any easier; their tuitions and costs did not go down. 
Meanwhile the government had this $3 billion millennium 
scholarship fund and all of the young people said, “The Liberals 
must truly be wonderful because they are giving us $3 billion”. 
But they did not.  Over the objections of the auditor general, 
they billed it to that year's expenditures but they are simply 
taking it, hoarding it and putting it aside somewhere to spend in 
the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same thing is true with many of the other issues the 
Liberals come forward with.  What about the tax cuts?  In this 
year's budget the Minister of Finance said that there would be 
$58 billion of tax cuts.  Even Canadians like me feel like 
jumping up and kicking our heels because $58 billion of tax cuts 
is pretty exciting.  Those are the words they used. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at our pay stubs.  Is there any effect there?  No. 
Our total taxes have actually gone up because the CPP premiums 
went up.  The reductions are way down the road, five years from 
now.  It is very presumptuous of the finance minister to do 
things like that.  How does he know if he will even be in power 
five years down the road?  The Liberals' mandate ends in the next 
year or two.  It is very presumptuous of him to make promises of 
accumulated tax cuts. However, he gets the PR kick out of it and 
people feel good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, feeling good does not affect our economy. It is 
only when we physically leave more money in the pockets of the 
taxpayers that our economy gets the real kick.  Only then can 
Canadians buy the things they need for their families thereby 
promoting the economic well-being of businesses in their 
communities and the economy takes off.  That only happens when 
they actually get the tax cut. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Meanwhile the Liberals are so interested in all of this spinning 
that we end up on May 9, 2000 implementing parts of the 1997 
budget speech. Finally we are implementing the things that they 
promised three years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The conclusion is simply that Bill C-24 is not good enough.  It 
is a bill that has one or two good provisions as I said.  I would 
love to vote in favour of them, but I cannot because of the other 
things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The overriding issue of course is that in many areas we are 
revisiting and revising the implementation of the GST provision 
when in fact the government promised that it would eliminate, 
kill and destroy the GST.  It has not happened.  The Liberals who 
stand up and vote in favour of Bill C-24 will once again be 
standing in front of Canadians and saying “You cannot trust us. 
You cannot really believe what we say because we are implementing 
exactly the opposite of what we promised in the election 
campaign”.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
going to pick up on the conclusion of the Canadian Alliance 
member.  We too are unable to support Bill C-24, which implements 
the 1997, 1998, and 1999 budgets, or certain important measures 
contained in them, for reasons similar to those of the Canadian 
Alliance member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to go over the key features of the three budgets 
mentioned in Bill C-24.  First, we characterized the Minister of 
Finance's 1997 budget as lazy and blatantly election-minded.  We 
do not normally resort to this sort of vocabulary over nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the 1997 budget, we said that the Minister of 
Finance could have done much more than he actually did to combat 
the unemployment and poverty at the time, particularly when he 
rose in the House, placed his hand over his heart and said that 
he was full of compassion for the thousands of Canadian children 
living in poverty and that he was prepared to do all sorts of 
things for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 1997 budget, with forecasts already pointing to large 
surpluses, we expected the Minister of Finance to immediately 
take stock of the increasing poverty, especially of Canada's 
children, and use these surpluses to help these children and 
particularly their parents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We kept telling the Prime Minister that in 1997 the federal 
government would not be facing a deficit as large as he was 
saying, but rather a surplus. 
I remind the House of what the Minister of Finance was saying at 
that time. He said he was anticipating a $14 billion deficit for 
1997. Guess what he got at the end of the fiscal year. We were 
telling him that the surplus could be close to $4 billion, and 
that is in fact what happened. At the end of the 1997 fiscal 
year, the surplus was $3.5 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By hiding the truth behind the figures, by hiding the surplus, 
the Minister of Finance could say “Listen, we still do not have 
the means this year to relieve poverty and to improve conditions 
for the unemployed, to substantially lower employment insurance 
premiums and also to increase benefits. We will wait till next 
year”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In reality, and this is why we had called the 1997 budget a 
blatantly election-minded budget, all the good news announced in 
the 1997 budget were for the 1998-99 fiscal year. A few weeks 
after the Minister of Finance brought down the 1997 budget, the 
Prime Minister and member for Saint-Maurice called an election. 
This demonstrated that the criticism we voiced on budget day was 
right. The Bloc Quebecois' contention that this was a blatantly 
election-minded budget was confirmed, as we were entering an 
election campaign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals fought their election campaign on promises to 
reduce taxes, to improve the employment insurance plan and to 
reduce EI premiums. They said that they had to be re-elected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1997 budget gave us a preview of what this government 
intended to do in the following years with the huge surpluses 
generated by making cuts at the expense of the provinces, 
particularly in the Canada social transfer, which is designed to 
allow the provinces and the Government of Quebec to fund social 
assistance, higher education and health, and also with the money 
that the government had been collecting year after year in the 
employment insurance fund, to which it contributed nothing. The 
EI surpluses were generated by the contributions of employers 
and workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We began to see how the Minister of Finance would behave once he 
had all these surpluses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1997 budget was also a lazy budget, as the minister had 
promised a tax reform. He had told us in this House “Wait. 
I am setting up a committee that will make recommendations and I 
will start a review process of all the Canadian tax provisions, 
which have not been reviewed since 1967”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We expected the Minister of Finance to come up with something in 
the 1997 budget. But no.

<A HREF="#LINKT26"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>True to his proverbial laziness, the Minister of Finance 
preferred to stay put, to miss an opportunity and do nothing to 
eliminate the existing inequities in the tax system, 
particularly for low and middle income earners. Incidentally, 
these inequities still exist, even though the minister announced 
in the last budget that full indexation of tax tables would be 
restored. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are being asked to support Bill C-24, to support measures that 
will implement large parts of the 1997 budget. Members will 
understand that we cannot support this bill, since we soundly 
rejected the 1997 budget, which was a smoke and mirrors budget, 
a blatantly election-minded budget, and also a lazy budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us now turn to the 1998 budget. We cannot support the 
measures this budget implements either. I remind the House of 
what the Bloc Quebecois said about this budget “Once a Liberal, 
always a Liberal.” Why did we say that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1998, budget surpluses began to grow a bit, even if the 
Finance Minister did not yet acknowledge the existence of 
staggering surpluses and was bold enough to make a real farce of 
this budget by referring to a balanced budget, or zero surplus 
for the following three years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government was beginning to have quite interesting 
surpluses, which could have been used to restore the Canada 
social transfer payments to provinces in order to finance social 
assistance, post-secondary education and health, which had been 
drastically cut by the Minister of Finance two years before in a 
plan, in effect until 2002, which provides for annual cuts of 
several billion dollars in social transfer payments to the 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of giving back the money which it had stolen from the 
provinces, the Minister of Finance, who had also robbed the 
poorest, the sick and students, preferred to start implementing 
policies which were then seen and still are seen as unacceptable 
encroachments on provincial jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, they rob provinces of their money and they use 
it to duplicate, overlap and encroach on provincial 
jurisdiction. There was a gross example of such an intrusion in 
the 1998 federal liberal budget, and that was the famous Canada 
millennium scholarship fund, worth $2.5 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Never before had a federal government dared to encroach so 
blatantly and on such a way on an area, namely education, which 
is clearly a provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government decided to encroach in a heavy-handed way 
on an area which was clearly Quebec's jurisdiction, a 
jurisdiction recognised in the constitution. They seem to have 
acted in this manner to flatter the Prime Minister's ego. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everybody has an ego; some have a big one, some have a smaller 
one, but generally we all have one. The Prime Minister's ego is 
gigantic. He wanted to leave his mark with the millennium 
scholarships and chose to interfere in an area under provincial 
jurisdiction, thereby creating endless quarrels. I think this is 
typical of this Prime Minister, whose career is based on 
quarrels between the Quebec government and the federal 
government,  constitutional and jurisdictional quarrels, 
quarrels about the federal government's interference in areas 
under provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the millennium scholarships, which were introduced in the 
1998 budget, the Prime Minister showed that he was on an ego 
trip. He wanted to leave his mark. I suppose he is hoping that 
his face will appear on a bank note one day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Negotiations with the Quebec government lasted several months. 
The quarrelling lasted several months. 
At the end of the day, the students are the ones who had to wait 
and who had to pay because of this interference by the federal 
government and because of the Prime Minister's ego trip. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No distinction has been made between the situation of students 
in Quebec and of students in Canada. There has not even been any 
recognition of the existence of a loans and scholarships system, 
which was consolidated at the 1964 constitutional conference 
between Mr. Pearson and Mr. Lesage.

surpluses accumulated in the employment insurance fund. That 
year, surpluses were over $6.4 billion. And the federal 
government, and particularly its Minister of Finance, who wants 
to be the leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, shamelessly 
took this money and put it in their pockets, as though it 
belonged to them. 
The government did something else instead of compensating the 
unemployed, which would normally be the ultimate objective of 
this fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the House that we started getting quite disturbing 
statistics that year about the employment insurance coverage, 
with fewer and fewer unemployed people being entitled to 
employment insurance benefits. More and more people were 
marginalized from the labour market and were driven to poverty, 
although they had been employed before being laid off, because 
they were not entitled to any benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The following year, statistics were appalling: 43% of the 
unemployed were entitled to employment insurance benefits. 
I repeat it, and the Bloc has also said so numerous times and 
has fought an extraordinary battle in that regard, when a system 
does not serve the majority of the clients it is supposed to 
serve, we must toss it out and start all over again, go back to 
the drawing board and take our responsibilities. This important 
system is supposed to help workers temporarily affected by the 
economic conditions who need help and support. It is not 
intended to push them aside, marginalize them or threat them as 
abusers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not forget that it is not only because the EI qualifying 
criteria have been tightened that 43% of the unemployed now 
qualify and, more importantly, that there is a $6 billion dollar 
surplus. It is mainly because, since 1997 and particularly 1998, 
the unemployed have been considered as potential abusers. 
They have been hunted down. Some even received calls as early as 
5:45 in the morning, checking if they would be available for an 
interview that same day, to see if they were ready to re-enter 
the job market. They have been hunted down like criminals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what the 1998 budget was all about. And now the 
government is asking us to support the measures that give effect 
to this budget. We will never do that. It would be a shame and 
we would lose sleep over it. If the Minister of Finance can 
still look at himself in the mirror after the drastic cuts that 
he has made in the social programs and after the role that he 
has played in exacerbating the problem of rising poverty in 
Canada, good for him. But on this side of the House, we have too 
much social conscience and sense of duty to be able to do so. 
We will never support this budget, nor others of the same ilk, 
nor any Liberal party measure that is not in the public 
interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us move on to the 1999 budget, for Bill C-24 contains some 
measures which concretize part of the 1999 budget.  It goes from 
bad to worse.  I will repeat the main thrust of our analysis 
from that time.  When the Minister of Finance introduced his 
budget, we described it as being evidence of one thing: the 
federal Liberals were not ones to keep their word.  Why such a 
severe judgment once again?  As I have already said, we in the 
Bloc Quebecois do not make such statements lightly.  This is a 
documented fact.  This time there was no shortage of 
documentation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we said back in 1999, the Liberals do not keep their word. 
Why?  Because, with no warning, the Minister of Finance decided 
to change the formula for determining the distribution of funds 
under the Canada Social Transfer to the provinces and the 
Government of Quebec.  He did so unilaterally, without any 
warning, without any advance notice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, contrary to what had been the practice in the past, when 
provincial need was the main criterion, when for instance a 
poorer province was entitled to more funding for welfare and the 
criterion of provincial need was self-evident, the decision was 
made to change this, with the stroke of a pen, in favour of 
solely population size. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is ridiculous, shameful—if somebody could die of shame, the 
Minister of Finance would be long dead; of course, I do not wish 
anyone dead, this is just a figure of speech—to have changed from 
this method to a strictly population-based approach, which will 
mean that, in the next few years, Canada's most heavily 
populated province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ontario, which is also richest province, will receive 
approximately 47% of the new transfers allocated by the Minister 
of Finance in the 1999 budget and the 2000 budget. 
Of the additional $11.2 billion dollars allocated in 1999, 47% 
will go to Ontario, while Quebec will get 8.3%, because the 
formula takes into account adjustments in cuts already planned, 
as well as various criteria that will evolve between now and 
2002.

<A HREF="#LINKT28"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, under the new formula, which takes into account the relative 
population of the provinces instead of other criteria, which 
balanced population with the needs of the provinces, Ontario 
will end up with 47% of this new funding and Quebec 8.3%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this unilateral change in the method of allocating funding, 
we have the following situation.  Quebec will absorb about 50% 
of the unilateral cuts planned by the federal government between 
1995 and 2001, 2002.  In addition to not getting any new funding 
from the federal government and having a proportion 
corresponding to one-third of its demographic weight, Quebec will 
absorb about 50% of the cuts announced by the Minister of 
Finance and the Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This decision reinforces our opinion that the Liberals are not 
true to their word, that they honour neither their word nor their 
signature, and that we are witness to a real attack against the 
Government of Quebec.  I remember very well that the President of 
the Treasury Board, sometime in 1997 or 1998, said, as reported 
in <I>Le Soleil</I> that what the federal government most do is hurt 
the Government of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The President of the Treasury Board said, speaking for 
his government, that “when Bouchard has cut in health care, 
social transfers and education, the federal government will come 
along as the protector and show itself to be the great social 
democrat in this country, full of compassion and having a better 
fate for the most disadvantaged at heart”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what lies behind the three budgets of the Minister of 
Finance. All of this was behind that, nothing more, nothing less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1999 budget is also the budget of shame, because in 1999, 
the Minister of Finance had the means to immediately initiate a 
reform of the tax system so that the people and families who 
should be in the middle income bracket did not find themselves 
below the poverty line, once federal income tax was paid. He 
could have corrected this injustice.  He could have had the tax 
thresholds raised.  Let me explain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He would have had the means in 1999 to ensure that a single 
income family of two adults and one child, paying federal tax on 
an income above $13,700 only, would pay income tax when it had an 
acceptable income.  In Quebec, a family pays taxes only on an 
income of over $30,000. At the federal level, it is $13,700.

<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance could have corrected that situation in 
1999. He could also have corrected it in the last budget, the 
year 2000 budget. He did not do so. Why? Why do we have a 
situation where federal taxes in this supposedly wonderful 
country are so high that they turn what should be a middle income 
into a low income, an income below the poverty level? This does 
not make any sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 1999 budget, the budget of shame, the minister told us 
“A tax reform is underway. I can already tell you that there 
will be tax cuts”. Yes, but what exactly are these tax cuts? 
This is what we have to look at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance is a millionaire and a shipowner who 
passes laws that benefit him, or at least we suspect so. He 
proposes tax cuts that benefit his buddies, that benefit the 
millionaires of this country. He told us he would eliminate the 
5% surtax on personal income. He was very proud to announce that 
measure, because it was going to provide relief to taxpayers, who 
would have a little more leeway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But those who have more leeway are not the taxpayers who are 
experiencing real problems. Rather, it is those who earn $250,000 
or more annually. In 1999, these people enjoyed a $3,800 tax cut. 
They are the lucky ones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By comparison, that same year, those who earned $30,000 or less 
got a $90 tax cut. 
There is talk of fair taxation, there is great pride in 
announcing tax cuts to benefit the most disadvantaged, when in 
fact the target group is the millionaires.  Is this normal? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is this a budget whose implementation could be acceptable, when 
it is totally unacceptable as far as its main principles are 
concerned, condemnable and fit for the trash can? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Very few people here recall the latest statistics on the 
increase in poverty in Canada, which came out in 1999.  At that 
time we learned that there were no longer in excess of one 
million poor children in Canada, as there had been in 1993.  The 
number had increased to 1.4 million, that is 400,000 additional 
cases because of this government, because of the harsh measures 
taken by a harsh and heartless minister, the Minister of Finance, 
and his shameless government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been three shameful budgets: 1997, 1998 and 1999. Any 
others could have been described in the same way.  It was clear 
that there was only one way the Minister of Finance could find to 
put this country's finances back on an even footing: the 
provinces were asked to contribute 60% of the effort via deep 
slashes to the transfer payments used to fund health, higher 
education and social assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The taxpayers of Canada were asked to contribute 30%.  As hon. 
members are aware, in four years, 1994, 1995, 1996 and 1997, by 
not reforming the tax system, the Minister of Finance ended up 
with close to $25 billion extra in taxes in his coffers, among 
other things by not indexing the tax tables.  That is how the 
country's finances were put back on an even footing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was not his talent or intelligence.  A puppet could have done 
the same thing. 
It is easy to sit down and watch the train go by, to do nothing 
to correct the injustices in the tax system and to see that these 
injustices translate into billions of dollars in revenue going 
into the federal coffers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is easy to sit on one's fanny, watch the train go by, pinch, 
steal, money from the employers and the employees in the 
employment insurance fund, to stuff that in one's pockets and to 
create a good impression.  It is easy to sit and keep the 
expected adjustment of the government machinery, the talk was of 
19% in reduction of the machinery, to 8%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the supreme intelligence of the federal Liberals in the 
management of public finances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one is to be congratulated on these three budgets. We 
certainly do not have to support them. If I did, I could never 
sleep, I could not look at myself in the mirror, because I would 
always be ashamed.  I wonder how they manage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would now like to give a little dry and somewhat technical 
demonstration, which is worth the trouble. It represents $2 
billion for Quebec.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In Bill C-24, there is also a clause that implements the 
agreement reached April 23, 1996 between the federal government, 
the Minister of Finance in this case, and three maritime 
provinces—New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Newfoundland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On April 23, 1996, the Minister of Finance signed a memorandum of 
understanding with these three maritime provinces so they would 
harmonize their provincial sales tax with the federal GST.  In 
this process of harmonization, it was clear that some would have 
to adjust their tax system, because in some provinces the sales 
tax was 12% or 14%.  They had to bring this provincial tax down 
to 8%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In direct terms, looking at the tax revenue from provincial 
sales tax, these three provinces came up short.  The Minister of 
Finance therefore decided that they should be compensated. 
Admittedly, this is a political decision.  Nevertheless, it is a 
decision which, based on the formula used, is unfair to Quebec, 
and I will explain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1991, the Government of Quebec, which did not wait for 
Canada's other provinces to make the move, decided to harmonize 
the GST with the TVQ for reasons of operation and cost to 
businesses in Quebec.  Ultimately, it was about making Quebec's 
businesses competitive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, the then Progressive Conservative government had 
appealed to the provinces to harmonize their PST with the GST so 
that all Canadian businesses could face the music, be 
competitive and efficient, as well as enjoy the benefits of a 
harmonized regime, which is less difficult to manage.  In short, 
there were all sorts of good reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Quebec did not wait, and immediately began the 
process of harmonization.  But when it did so, it had to adjust 
its tax structure.  How did the Government of Quebec do that? 
By increasing certain taxes payable by businesses in Quebec. 
Let me give an example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following the harmonization of the GST and the QST in 1991, the 
tax on profits generated by small and medium size businesses 
rose from 3.45% to 5.75%, a rather drastic increase of 66%, 
because of the shortfall suffered by the Quebec government as a 
result of that harmonization. Taxes on the profits of these 
businesses had to be adjusted. That was a necessary measure to 
maintain a stable tax base. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Taxes on profits in general were also increased, from 6.3% 
before harmonizing the GST and the QST in Quebec, to 8.9%. Taxes 
on gasoline and cigarettes also had to be adjusted. If that new 
tax had been added to the existing excise tax on cigarettes and 
gasoline, the rate would have been so high for gasoline that it 
would have been too big a shock for the Quebec economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, because of the adjustments that had to made to the Quebec 
government tax structure, some costs were absorbed partly by 
Quebec and partly by the companies, through the tax increases to 
which I referred. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These adjustments are estimated at about $725 million a year for 
the Quebec government and businesses. That was achieved by using 
the same bases for calculation that the Minister of Finance used 
with the maritime provinces, but by looking at all the 
adjustments that had to be made to the whole tax structure, and 
not only the adjustment at the provincial sales taxes level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is where the fundamental difference lies. When the Minister 
of Finance signed the MOU, he looked at the shortfall directly 
related to the reduction of provincial sales taxes in the three 
maritime provinces and determined a compensation on that basis. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1240"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT32"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT32"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1240

<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as compensation is concerned, they were saying that any 
shortfall in excess of 5% between provincial sales tax receipts 
as they existed in the maritime provinces before harmonization 
and afterward was compensated for by the federal government, but 
only when it exceeded 5%.  When the calculations were done for 
the maritime provinces, the figure reached was $964 million for 
the next four years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we do the same calculation, taking into consideration that 
the federal government would have to compensate for 100% of the 
shortfall in excess of 5% the first two years, followed by 50% 
for the third year, and 25% for the fourth, the figure we get for 
the first year is a loss of $725 million, taking into account the 
whole adjustment to the taxation system.  The second year, taking 
into consideration the payment that should come from the federal 
government, which is again 100% reimbursable by the federal 
government after the first 5% of the harmonized tax as compared 
to the original tax, the figure would be an additional $725 
million.  The third year it would be $363 million and the fourth, 
corresponding to 25% of the shortfall, would be $181 million, for 
a grand total of $1.9 billion, or very nearly $2 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These calculations were presented to specialists outside of the 
federal and Quebec governments, and they agreed with us. As well, 
in 1997, the provincial premiers supported the Government of 
Quebec in its crusade to obtain justice in this matter.  The 
federal government turned a deaf ear.  At the 1996 summit in 
Quebec, there was unanimity.  Along with talk of the battle 
against the deficit, there was also talk of the $2 billion the 
federal government was obstinately refusing to pay the Government 
of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This led to another problem.  The fact that we were not entitled 
to compensation to which we were legitimately entitled—and our 
calculations are above reproach—had another result.  When 
harmonization of the GST with the Quebec sales tax was carried 
out, the harmonization was not complete. This would have cost the 
Government of Quebec and the businesses of Quebec too dearly, 
given the shortfall, and given the lack of federal government 
contribution to this harmonization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though the Government of Quebec manages the collection of 
its harmonized provincial taxes and the GST for the federal 
government, and Quebec businesses have only one form to 
complete, they have, however, different calculations to do when 
the time comes to claim the input tax credit at the federal 
level or in the harmonized provincial sales tax system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The list of input credits for some industries is not the same as 
the list of items that permit a return for federal government 
input tax credit.  So that Quebec businesses cannot fully 
benefit from the harmonization of the GST and the provincial 
sales tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the federal government would stop being obtuse, if it paid 
attention to our analyses, our demonstrations, if it 
acknowledged we were right—because we were right and it was 
wrong—we could conclude this harmonization. Quebec businesses 
would be a lot more competitive in an environment where the talk 
is of liberalization and globalization.  This is an important 
factor when we are talking about taxation and red tape and 
especially when we are talking about returns for input tax 
credits that Quebec business is entitled to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are therefore not pleased to support a measure that treats 
Quebec and, more importantly, Quebec business, unfairly and 
unjustly in connection with the harmonization of the GST and the 
QST, with the provincial sales tax of these three maritime 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support the principle of harmonization since Quebec was the 
first, oddly enough, without asking for anything, to harmonize 
or at least to try to harmonize its provincial sales tax totally 
with the federal GST.  Afterwards, when the time came to claim 
some support for this adjustment, like it did with the three 
maritime provinces, it sent Quebec packing.  How are we supposed 
to support Bill C-24, which implements this memorandum of 
understanding of April 1996?  We cannot.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It cannot be said that businesses from the maritime provinces 
increased their competitiveness compared to their Quebec 
counterparts, in spite of the help of federal funds to which we 
did not have access, even though we had a right to such funds. 
We have no choice but to oppose this provision of Bill C-24, just 
like we were opposed to the Liberal mismanagement displayed in 
the 1997, 1998 and 1999 budgets, for the reasons that I 
mentioned earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say a word on the year 2000 budget. That budget did 
not solve any of the problems that I mentioned. 
The federal government turned a deaf ear, in spite of the fact 
that opposition parties in the House were unanimous in asking 
for employment insurance reforms, for leaving the employment 
insurance surpluses in the EI fund for the unemployed, for 
respecting contributors by not stealing their contributions, 
particularly since the government contributes nothing. The 
federal government also turned a deaf ear in spite of the 
unanimity among opposition parties regarding the level to which 
social transfers should be restored. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the year 2000 budget, the government announced the 
elimination of certain cuts. However, by the year 2002, the cuts 
that were originally expected to total $40 billion will be 
around $33 billion. And we should thank this government for 
cutting social transfers, transfers for education and health, 
when it continues to make cuts and when it is making 
election-minded announcements about bogus increases in transfers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government did not solve any taxation problems in Budget 
2000, any more than it did in the 1997, 1998 and 1999 budgets. 
Since our arrival here in 1994, since the first budget, we have 
been calling for this taxation reform.  We have good reasons for 
doing so.  Federal taxation is antiquated, unfair to low and 
middle income earners and too generous to certain big 
corporations, which take advantage of loopholes.  These 
corporations have the resources to hire the best tax experts, 
who know the ins and outs of taxation and who put them to work 
for their clients. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look just at the clause having to do with taxes deferred 
by these large corporations, and at another clause concerning 
the accelerated depreciation of technological inputs, we find 
ourselves with a situation where businesses will never pay any 
taxes. 
These businesses are proud of the fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the money that they do not contribute in taxes is 
squeezed out of individual taxpayers, the families I mentioned 
earlier, with two adults, one child and a single income, who 
start paying federal taxes at $13,000.  This is the family that 
is making up for what big corporations like Bell Canada or Bell 
Canada Enterprises, Mr. Monty's business, are not paying. I keep 
thinking about Mr. Monty and I do not know why.  Probably for a 
number of reasons, but for that one in particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was looking at the latest statistics available on Bell Canada 
Enterprises compiled by the CTC, which show that BCE has 
deferred taxes owing and unpaid.  Normally, over the years, it 
should have paid these taxes, but it owes around $2 billion or 
$2.5 billion. 
BCE owes $2.5 billion in back taxes, which it will likely never 
pay, because of the clause to which I have referred: accelerated 
capital cost deduction and tax deferral. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That $2 billion is precisely what it took to acquire CTV.  Hon. 
members will recall that Mr. Monty made a $2.3 billion offer to 
acquire CTV.  This prompts me to comment that, if Bell Canada 
Enterprises were to acquire CTV, it would belong to everyone. 
It would belong to the families made up of two parents and one 
child who pay federal tax starting at $13,000.  They would own a 
piece of it because they are the ones paying to compensate the 
big guys, BCE and the like. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is unfair.  The minimum taxation levels are unfair.  The 
Government of Quebec did an excellent job in this area. 
In the last three years in particular, we have brought the 
minimum tax level down to a reasonable level.  A family of two 
adults, one of them the wage earner, with one child will start 
paying taxes at the $30,000 annual income level.  The federal 
cutoff is $13,700.

promise.  In this case it is one of parliamentary reform to 
provide a more reasonable time period within which budgets would 
be implemented, as opposed to talking about these changes three 
years after an actual budget is presented by the Minister of 
Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another area of the specific legislation which magnifies some of 
the broken Liberal promises is the fact that we are discussing 
some measures relative to the changes to the GST.  Everyone in 
the House remembers, particularly the Liberal members opposite 
who ran in the 1993 election, campaigning on a Liberal commitment 
to get rid of the GST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current government promised at various points during the 
1993 campaign to eliminate, to scrap, to abolish the GST.  The 
finance minister in 1989 once said in the House of Commons that 
the GST was a stupid, inept and incompetent tax.  As a candidate 
for the Liberal leadership he was quoted as saying that he was 
committed to scrapping the GST and replacing it with an 
alternative. Since then the Prime Minister during foreign travels 
has not just embraced the GST but has actually told foreign 
dignitaries that it was his idea in the first place and that it 
is a great tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the Liberals today to embrace the GST after campaigning 
vociferously against it qualifies them for the award of the 
patron saint of hypocrisy in the Canadian parliamentary system. 
For Liberals to have fought against the GST and now take credit 
for it and benefit as a government from the proceeds of the GST 
is one of the reasons Canadians are so skeptical and cynical 
about politics in general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The <I>Economist</I> magazine 1998 year preview stated quite 
clearly that credit for the deficit reduction in Canada belonged 
largely to structural reforms made by the previous government. 
The <I>Economist</I> magazine went on to list them.  They included 
free trade, the GST, deregulation of financial services, 
transportation and energy.  If I remember correctly, the Liberals 
campaigned vociferously against all those policies in previous 
elections.  The current government has utilized those policies to 
eliminate the deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not suggesting that I would have been happier had the 
government reversed those policies.  In fact I am quite pleased 
that it maintained them.  The only thing worse than the Liberals 
blatantly stealing Conservative policies and taking credit for 
the results would be if they were to implement Liberal policies 
which would probably be far more deleterious for the Canadian 
economy. 
Instead of trying to creatively develop Liberal policies we are 
pleased that they had the good sense to embrace and support the 
sound policies of the previous government.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go further and say that this is a government of sound 
and original ideas.  Unfortunately its original ideas are seldom 
sound and its sound ideas are never original. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the GST was an appropriate tax measure and appropriate 
tax reform at the time, we have not seen any meaningful level of 
tax reform under the current government.  We could look at other 
countries with which we are competing and the degree to which 
they are using tax reform and tax reduction as vehicles to create 
greater levels of economic growth.  I suggest that we look at 
what Izzy Asper, former leader of the Liberal Party in Manitoba, 
the CEO of CanWest Global Communications Corporation and head of 
the Global Television Network, said when he spoke recently at the 
BCNI meetings in Toronto. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said that the Canadian tax system we were living under was 
last reformed 32 years ago, that it was obsolete and that the 
world it was designed to deal with no longer existed.  He went on 
to say that the system was a nightmare of complexity and a sea of 
uncertainty, and that the tax system was anti-business, 
anti-private sector and anti-entrepreneurial. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He asked a question of the Minister of Industry who spent some 
time speaking to corporate leaders.  The Minister of Industry 
responded by saying that there could be no significant level of 
tax reform in Canada and that tax reform would require a complete 
consensus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously we will never have complete consensus on tax reform or 
on any other major public policy reform or issue.  The industry 
minister and the whole government are so focused on poll driven 
incrementalism and focus group economics that they cannot really 
embrace the courageous visionary changes and steps toward the 
more competitive economy which is necessary now because it would 
involve political risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have an industry minister who is credited by some as being 
one of the most commonsensical in terms of his recognition that 
the private sector plays a role in the economy.  He actually 
believes there cannot be any tax reform unless there is 100% 
complete consensus on tax reform issues.  I think that is a sad 
state of affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada needs a significant level of tax reform.  Such reform 
should be used as a vehicle for tax reduction.  It is not just 
personal taxes.  We need a significant level of corporate tax 
reduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most recent budget reduced corporate taxes somewhat over a 
period of years.  However, prior to this budget we had the second 
highest corporate taxes in the OECD.  After the full 
implementation of budget measures over a five year period we will 
still have the fourth highest corporate taxes of 31 OECD 
countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not really a very significant step in the right direction, 
particularly given that 27 of the 31 OECD countries have stated 
plans to further reduce their corporate taxes.  While we are 
taking baby steps in the right direction on some of these issues, 
other countries with which we are competing are taking gigantic 
leaps. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the hypercompetitive global information highway upon which 
individual Canadian companies are trying to compete and succeed, 
we run the risk of becoming road kill unless the government 
actually embraces some of the realities of the future as opposed 
to always dealing with reforms around an economy that no longer 
exists.  That is part of the difficulty in discussing and making 
these types of changes so long after a budget is introduced.

Now is probably the worst time in Canadian history to have a 
caretaker, cruise control kind of government that is more focused 
on next week's polls than on the challenges and opportunities for 
the next 20 or 30 years.  My fear is that Canadians will continue 
to be held back by this weak leadership that is not focused on 
the real issues facing the private sector and all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should be moving more significantly toward reducing and 
ultimately eliminating capital taxes in Canada.  The taxation of 
capital in itself is of dubious benefit. It creates significant 
disadvantages to accumulating capital in Canada and some 
significant competitive disadvantages for our Canadian financial 
services sector and banks.  Some 7.5 million Canadians are 
shareholders of those banks directly or indirectly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The capital gains tax issue needs to be addressed.  The 
government's recent budget would reduce capital gains inclusion 
rates from 75% to 66.6%. That is a step in the right direction 
but it still leaves Canadian entrepreneurs with a 13% 
disadvantage in terms of effective capital gains tax rates over 
the U.S.  A 13% disadvantage is certainly not something to crow 
about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The capital gains tax issue particularly in the new economy is 
important because of the degree to which stock options are used 
as compensatory assets.  There is no reason to suspect this will 
not continue to be the case even with the recent volatility.  The 
new economy is going to continue to depend on stock options as a 
very important compensatory vehicle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As such, when we maintain a 13% disadvantage over the U.S. in 
terms of the way we tax capital gains, the resultant gain from 
exercising a stock option, we are driving entrepreneurial talent 
from Canada.  We are sending the risk takers and the great minds 
who are capable of building better companies and better 
opportunities and thus a better country, somewhere else.  That 
better country may not be Canada.  It may be the United States of 
America or somewhere else because of the wrong-headedness of the 
government and its inability to get with it in terms of embracing 
the realities of the new economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are several revenue neutral changes in Bill C-24 which 
relate to the goods and services tax, the GST, and the harmonized 
sales tax, the HST.  These measures were announced on March 20, 
1997.  Most of them relate directly to Atlantic Canada and Nova 
Scotia in particular.  It is notable that these were introduced 
on March 20, 1997, just a few short months before the Liberals 
were turfed from Nova Scotia.  I am not suggesting that the 
unanimous decision in ridings across Nova Scotia to remove the 
Liberal representatives from their seats was a reflection of this 
issue specifically, but I think it did play a certain role. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By and large the measures are revenue neutral changes. Some of 
them are positive. Assistance to charities that employ 
individuals with disabilities and charities that are involved in 
bottle recycling, enhancements to visitor rebate programs and 
changes benefiting small businesses that sell products to direct 
sellers are positive measures and we in the Progressive 
Conservative Party can support them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The general tax direction not just of this legislation but of 
any Liberal government legislation in recent years has been so 
flawed by a fundamental lack of vision and initiative that it is 
very difficult to support almost any tax package brought forward.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been some changes on the tobacco tax regime and also 
the tax regime on split run magazines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to speak to some of the things that are not 
addressed in this legislation and which I would like to see more 
of in Liberal fiscal and economic policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time to significantly raise the basic personal exemption 
in Canada.  It is absolutely atrocious how much people are being 
taxed.  The most recent budget would have raised the basic 
personal exemption to $8,200, the amount at which the government 
feels it is appropriate to start taxing Canadians. In the U.S. 
the basic personal exemption is not hit until someone earns 
approximately $11,000 Canadian.  Here we are in Canada which 
supposedly is a less harsh country and we actually tax people at 
$8,200 per year. That seems fundamentally unfair and needs to be 
addressed, but the government clearly has not set that as a 
priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada needs to redefine its middle class. Currently the top 
marginal tax rate is hit at $60,000.  The most recent budget 
would increase that to $70,000.  The fact is in the U.S. an 
American does not hit the top marginal tax rate until he or she 
is making $420,000 Canadian.  As a result, we are taxing at 
$60,000 and the government with the full implementation of the 
most recent budget would increase that to $70,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Using $70,000 as the amount, at $70,000 the government feels it 
is appropriate to tax Canadian families as if they are rich. That 
creates immense pressure for those people earning $70,000 to 
$100,000 to be drawn south of the border to greater opportunities 
and lower taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example a software designer or a knowledge based worker in 
Vancouver making $70,000 per year will pay 52% of his income in 
combined federal and provincial income taxes.  Less than an hour 
and a half away in Seattle, a software worker or a knowledge based 
industry worker making the same amount of money, about $70,000 
Canadian, will pay 26% of his income in combined state and 
federal taxes.  An hour and a half away in the United States, the 
same individual in the same industry will pay half the level of 
taxes that he would pay in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The argument that is used quite frequently, and to a certain 
extent there is some validity to it, is that of medicare. That 
argument has been reduced significantly in recent years as the 
government particularly since 1993 has cut, slashed and decimated 
the Canadian health care system which for a long time defined 
Canadians.  The health care system played a large role not just 
in protecting the health of Canadians but also in defining to a 
large extent the Canadian psyche. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government through its draconian cuts since 1993 has created 
immense havoc in every province in the country.  Every province 
has had to deal with the significant level of cuts for health 
care funding that the government has perpetrated. As a result of 
the cuts, the percentage of federal commitment to health care has 
declined steadily to a point that some estimates are that the 
federal government is paying around 13% of every dollar spent on 
health care in Canada. Clearly that is unacceptable and that is 
part of the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the tax side, the Canadian advantage with medicare really 
does not exist any longer.  What we have seen develop in Canada 
is a fairly mediocre system for everybody. 
While it is egalitarian, it is a poor system.  As a result, those 
who can afford it are increasingly being drawn toward making the 
choice of seeking health care elsewhere or to actually live 
elsewhere. Many of the professionals who have been drawn away by 
the brain drain work for companies that provide health care 
insurance so it is less of an issue.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to consider this from a competitiveness perspective.  We 
have to ensure that we are not allowing economic symbolism to 
define us.  Economic performance is more important than economic 
symbolism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to get our fundamentals right.  We need a sound tax 
structure which is more reflective of the current realities.  We 
also need a more effective health care system which recognizes 
the current realities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that Canada already has a two tier health care 
system.  Around 30% of our health care costs are in the form of 
costs covering pharmaceuticals, much of which is already paid for 
privately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The changes in health care which have occurred and to a large 
extent the rising costs of pharmaceuticals, the increased level 
of sophistication in biotechnology and the pharmaceutical 
industry have already led to rising costs and an increased level 
of participation by the private sector. Add to that the fact that 
many Canadians are drawn to the U.S. for health care treatments 
in private sector facilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need significant levels of economic reform on the fiscal 
front.  We need sound and firm debt reduction targets. We need 
lower taxes, better tax reform and a better health care system. 
That is only going to be accomplished with a more visionary, 
courageous government.  Unfortunately, I have lost faith in the 
members opposite to provide that type of leadership. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>]

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened with 
great interest to the comments of the Progressive Conservative 
Party member.  Like him, I am worried. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot understand this talk about inventing tax reform.  Mr. 
Charest, a former Progressive Conservative who has come to 
Quebec, seemed to want to get away from the equation whereby 
government revenues, whether from individuals or corporations, 
are spent on services and generally the revenues pretty much 
balance out the services provided to the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another phenomenon where work must not contribute to 
poverty, so that the more you work, the poorer you get. 
This is another given.  Reducing corporate taxes because it is 
the combination of the two, the corporate and the individual 
taxes.  Of course, there are by-products of taxation such as 
sales tax, duties and taxes and so forth, but the fact remains 
that the government weighs the necessary balance between 
revenues on the one hand, and expenditures on the other. 
Expenditures are services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last tax reform was in 1971.  That was the last, as far as I 
recall.  Of course, there was the GST, which was introduced in 
1984, I believe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the fact remains that this is the sort of thing governments 
must face.  In the tax reforms to date, whether the government 
digs into the right pocket or the left, it is still the same 
pair of pants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite all my efforts, I cannot see what these new sources of 
revenue would be.  If we are speaking of individuals, it would 
be a disincentive to work. 
If we are speaking of businesses, it would discourage 
investment, entrepreneurship and so forth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So perhaps the government has to decide to take an approach 
other than tax reform.  I do not know what.  We might be faced 
with worse choices, including in the health care sector and 
other sectors that are important to us, such as education.  It 
must not come to that. 
I ask the member to tell me what the magic formula is.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps he has already had a chance to speak with the current 
leader of the opposition in Quebec City, Mr. Charest, who was in 
his party at one point.  I wish he would enlighten me.  I am 
honestly confused.  I cannot imagine anything other than what we 
have now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not a tax expert and I humbly ask him to enlighten me.  I 
am open to his comments. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for his excellent points and questions.  He has raised a couple 
of very important issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the last significant overriding tax reform was around the 
time of the Carter commission back in 1971.  The changes were 
introduced by the Carter commission which reported in the late 
sixties, approximately 30 years ago.  Since then we have seen 
amazing changes in the Canadian economy.  It is clear that we do 
need some level of reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The GST was a significant change as well.  The Minister of 
Industry said in a speech at the BCNI that tax reform was a 
non-starter for the government because it could not get consensus 
on tax reform.  There was a consensus on the GST.  Unfortunately 
it went against the governing party and resulted in not just 
significant tax changes but significant political changes in 
1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question the hon. member had was relative to how we balance 
tax reduction and the other needs.  Ideally, there should be tax 
reform and it should be based, in my opinion, on growth and not 
greed.  We should be looking at tax reform from the perspective 
of what taxes can we reduce to create the greatest level of 
economic growth and opportunities here in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can point to a few examples.  In Ireland much of the tax 
reduction that has occurred has been in corporate taxes.  By 
reducing corporate tax rates, Ireland has actually increased 
corporate tax revenue by attracting companies from around the 
world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are examples closer to home.  I would argue that Quebec 
has been very successful under Bernard Landry with many of his 
tax policies, particularly those focused on the new economy.  One 
of the most innovative aspects of the Quebec tax policy has been 
on the provincial income tax not being paid by research 
scientists, the Ph.D.s coming from other places to Quebec to 
participate in research.  The new economy, whether it is in 
e-commerce or biotechnology, needs those Ph.D.s and researchers. 
As a result of the policy by the Quebec government, it has 
effectively been able to reduce the personal tax rates for these 
minds that Quebec and Canada need to U.S. levels, which has been 
very innovative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would argue that we can reduce some types of taxes without 
reducing revenue overall.  Another example of that is capital 
gains taxes.  When we reduce capital gains taxes there is often a 
resultant unlocking of capital which actually leads to a greater 
level of capital flow and a greater level of taxes being paid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately tax reform is usually based on political criteria 
as opposed to economic criteria.  We often build tax reform 
around what is politically palatable or what is popular and do 
not think of what will lead to the greatest levels of economic 
growth.  It is not always the same thing, but in many ways the 
Quebec government has pursued some policies that have been quite 
innovative in terms of attracting the type of industries that are 
necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to see the national government be a little more 
amenable to that kind of thing.  Some of these successes have 
resulted of course in the recent move of NASDAQ to Montreal.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I listened to the comments by 
the member for Kings—Hants and I heard a different 
interpretation and variation of history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One interpretation I found particularly intriguing, although I 
forget his exact wording, was when he said that the former 
Progressive Conservative government built the architecture for 
the fiscal results of this government.  In reflecting upon that, 
I looked at the growth in the deficits.  In fact, when we came 
into office in 1993 the deficit was at $42 billion.  There had 
been no action on the deficit whatsoever. The public debt had 
increased significantly.  Taxes had been increased, the EI 
premiums to name one, and other taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the member could actually describe the architecture 
that was built by the former Progressive Conservative government 
that lead to the very good fiscal results of this government 
since 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for his question.  I look forward to being on that side of the 
House and having him lob similar softball questions across to us 
once we are back in government.  That was indeed a softball 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Mulroney Progressive Conservative government was successful 
in reducing the deficit as a percent of GDP from 9% when it took 
office to 5% by the time it left office.  It was kind of like 
that old country and western song, <I>Give Me 40 Acres and I'll 
Turn This Rig Around</I>.  That previous government inherited an 
18-wheeler that was going down the road at 200 miles per hour in 
the wrong direction.  Somebody had to slow it down and somebody 
had to implement the types of structural economic changes that 
were necessary to enable this visionless government to 
effectively cruise through the last several years and, through no 
fault of its own, to have fairly decent economic results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those were not my words crediting the Progressive Conservative 
for the reduction and elimination of the deficit.  Those were the 
words of the greatest news journal in the world, in my opinion, 
the <I>Economist</I> magazine out of the U.K., which said very 
clearly that credit for the deficit reduction in Canada belongs 
largely to structural reforms made to the Canadian economy by the 
previous government.  I would not be so audacious as to say that 
myself.  I was just quoting a wonderful news publication that 
brings a very objective view to the situation here in Canada. 
<P><A NAME="LINK40"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, thank 
you for the opportunity to get back into the order and the flow of 
things.  I missed my opportunity at the end of the Bloc Quebecois 
speech to add our contribution to this debate.  I appreciate the 
latitude shown to let me speak to this now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should come as no surprise to anybody here that the NDP 
caucus is in opposition to Bill C-24.  Members look shocked that 
we do not fully concur with the Liberal Party tax policy.  I want 
to use my time to point out just how strongly we oppose Bill C-24 
and other recent developments from the most recent budget that 
dealt with tax relief and tax reform, if one can call it that. We 
have been calling for true tax reform since we have been in the 
House but we have yet to see it.  Frankly, we have seen more in 
the same direction and a continuation of the same economic policy 
and philosophy which we think does not serve ordinary Canadians 
and does not serve working Canadians well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By way of beginning my remarks, it is useful to look at a direct 
quote from the majority report of the finance committee.  It is 
just a few short lines so I will read it.  The majority report of 
the finance committee states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Committee has chosen to use tax reform/relief as the primary 
vehicle for promoting increased productivity not because we know 
that there are very specific and definitive links between 
productivity and taxation, but primarily because of what we don't 
know. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals are almost jumping into this avenue of economic 
policy by virtue of what they do not know will be the predictable 
results and consequences.  That should not give Canadians any 
comfort.  It should worry Canadians very much if that is the sort 
of research that has been done.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will read this again because a lot of Canadians will probably 
not understand how significant and indicative this is.  It says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Committee has chosen to use tax reform/tax relief as the 
primary vehicle for promoting increased productivity not because 
we know that there are very specific and definitive links between 
productivity and taxation, but primarily because of what we don't 
know. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That sounds like nonsense. It is also very worrisome for 
ordinary Canadians who may pick that up and read it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing I can say is that there is no empirical evidence 
anywhere in the country that proves tax relief creates jobs. That 
is a myth that has been perpetrated.  It is something that we 
might like to believe, because it would give us some sense of 
surety that we are confident about the direction in which we are 
going, but there is no empirical evidence anywhere.  There has 
been no academic study.  There has been no proof that tax relief, 
as such, creates jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also no proof anywhere, as the committee admits, that 
tax relief per se increases productivity.  We do not know if the 
two are related, and the committee readily admits that in its 
paper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These words of the majority report of the finance committee 
delivers its empty rationale for recommending $46 billion in tax 
cuts for high income earners as a priority for upcoming budgets. 
It can only be called blind faith in the virtue of tax cuts for 
the wealthy.  We believe it is typical of the Liberal 
government's position in the debate about what to do with the 
predicted federal surpluses.  It is the worst form of 
trickle-down economics, blind faith in an obsolete ideology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Frankly, ordinary working Canadians are used to being trickled 
on.  We have been trickled on a lot in recent history and it is 
not water that is trickling down from above and it certainly is 
not revenues and pennies from heaven.  We are being trickled on 
in the most mean-spirited ways often and frequently. These 
trickle-down economics are a continuation of the same line of 
thinking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to tax cuts, the debate we should be having should 
be about setting goals for improving the quality of life for all 
Canadians not just tax cuts for the wealthy.  We should be taking 
steps that move us forward.  A lot of us believe that society 
does not move forward unless we all move forward together. It is 
one of the basic tenets of the NDP philosophy that society does 
not move forward unless we all move forward together.  We are 
against anything that further builds that gap, the great divide, 
between the rich and the poor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having set and met financial targets on eliminating the deficit, 
one would think that the prospect of large surpluses would now 
allow Canadians and the government to meet such emergencies as 
the crisis facing the homeless, for instance.  That would be a 
laudable pursuit.  We would have liked to have heard more in the 
budget about the crisis facing the homeless in the country. That 
would be worthwhile and we would stand up and applaud budget 
initiatives in that regard.  Another crisis would the family farm 
crisis in the province I come from.  Those are the types of 
missed opportunities that we believe the government is taking 
part in with its policy on how to deal with the generous 
surpluses it is looking forward to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another idea I have is that we could try to meet the target we 
set for ourselves 10 years ago to eliminate child poverty.  That 
would be a laudable concept.  Giving tax breaks to the wealthy 
does not do anything to eliminate child poverty in the country. 
I defy the government to show me the connection, unless it is 
relying strictly on that famous old trickle-down theory of an 
economic system with lots of millionaires and surely some of that 
money will spill over from their coffers and fall onto ordinary 
Canadians.  It is a cruel myth and a lot of people are tired of 
being the brunt of that myth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about taking steps to ensure that all our children are 
given the best possible start in life?  In the newspaper today 
there was a very interesting article about how youth crime and 
youth violence can be so directly connected to the problem of 
fetal alcohol syndrome, FAE/FAS children.  This is an emergency 
in our schools.  It is an emergency in our criminal justice 
system.  It is an emergency in the inner city of our big cities, 
in small communities and on reserves right across the country. We 
have seen nothing to address that issue specifically in this 
budget or in any policy that we have debated in the House of 
Commons.  This is a worthwhile emergency on which we could in 
fact be spending some of our surplus instead of on tax relief for 
the wealthy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a growing movement and concern in Canada that we are 
losing our cherished not for profit public health care system. 
We are losing it to the spectacle of a two-tiered American style 
health care system which we know does not work. 
Instead of using this flourishing, blossoming surplus on 
protecting and strengthening our universal public health care 
system, again we are seeing the idea of tax cuts for the wealthy. 
I guess if the wealthy had more of their disposable income left 
in their pockets they could afford to buy the health care they 
need when they need it.  That is fundamentally contradictory to 
the NDP philosophy and I am glad to be able to express that 
today.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another worthwhile initiative that we are completely 
ignoring and that is to provide Canadians access to world class 
post-secondary education.  One would think in this high tech age, 
or the age of e-commerce, et cetera, that we would value more and 
make access to post-secondary education a number one priority for 
Canadians instead of burdening students with debt that is 
paramount to carrying a small mortgage when they finally graduate 
from university.  That is not a priority.  We have not heard it 
expressed here.  Instead, again, we are talking about the 
implementation of bills that give tax cuts to the wealthy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are all kinds of other worthwhile spending initiatives, 
whether it is our infrastructure, our roads or our transit 
systems.  We need these things to assure the continued growth of 
our economy and we are not hearing about it.  To offer, in 
balance of these priorities, needed tax relief, we would not mind 
having that debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us list these priorities and address ways to deal with them 
and talk about tax relief.  Frankly, there is nothing 
contradictory to the NDP talking about tax fairness.  We have 
been talking about tax fairness since day one because we believe 
that working people pay too much tax.  We believe that working 
people pay too much tax because others are not paying their fair 
share of taxes and it is an inequitable situation.  One tax 
relief initiative that we would welcome, endorse and support is 
the gradual reduction toward the elimination of the GST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that if the government were serious about universal 
tax relief which would benefit all Canadians, that to reduce the 
GST by 1% this year would be a good first step in at least making 
some effort to keep the promise made in 1993 to eliminate the 
GST.  We would certainly welcome that, but we are not hearing 
that today in the debate on Bill C-24, we did not hear it in the 
budget speech and we did not hear it in the majority report of 
the finance committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance committee preferred the message of the Business 
Council on National Issues, the BCNI, that the real urgency was 
to give more and bigger tax breaks to those who need them the 
least.  It was completely 180 degrees backward to any 
conventional thinking on true equality, or to flattening the gap 
between the rich and the poor, or to addressing many of the 
urgent social issues I have outlined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a quote from the report of the Business Council on 
National Issues to the Standing Committee on Finance which states 
that the greatest economic gains will be achieved when marginal 
tax rates, especially the highest ones, are reduced.  In other 
words, we are allowing the BCNI to set social and economic policy 
for the country.  It is an unelected body.  I am surprised, 
frankly, that my colleagues from the Canadian Alliance are not up 
in arms about this.  We are taking specific direction from 
unelected representatives of corporate Canada over the opinions 
and the economic outlines of elected officials like those of us 
in this Chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People call Thomas d'Aquino the unofficial prime minister. 
Those of us who are cynical are certainly starting to think that, 
given the access that the BCNI has to power and the fact that the 
Liberal government is charting policy based on the needs of Bay 
Street and certainly not based on the needs of Main Street. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP caucus rejects the committee's unbalanced approach.  We 
recommend that a key priority be to make the investments 
necessary to help reverse the erosion of Canadian living 
standards, the growing divisions in Canadian society and the 
growing gap between the rich and the poor.  That would be a 
laudable pursuit for the government, but that is not a key 
objective.  It is taking steps today, even with Bill C-24, that 
will expand the gap between the rich and the poor.  It will make 
that rift even wider.  It is completely contrary to NDP policy 
and philosophy.  We believe that society moves forward genuinely 
when we all move forward together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We include in Canadian living standards investment in our 
children, investment in our communities, investment in our health 
care and education systems and investment in the environment. 
Has there ever been a more ample opportunity to finally do 
something about cleaning up the environment in Canada?  We have a 
surplus budget situation.  The Minister of Finance is in the 
enviable position of having money to spend on important 
priorities for Canadians.  What could be more important than to 
act now to clean up the toxic waste sites in this country and to 
deal with small communities that still need basic sewage and 
water treatments centres? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1335"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT42"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, my colleagues from Sydney—Victoria and Bras 
d'Or—Cape Breton live near what is arguably the worst toxic 
waste site in the world, the Sydney tar ponds.  Is there money 
budgeted and allocated to clean up, finally, the Sydney tar 
ponds? Have they started to scrape the toxic effluent off 
Frederick Street so that people can live there again?  Or, are we 
satisfied to have a Cape Breton version of the Love Canal?  Is 
that one of the legacies the Liberal government wants to leave in 
Atlantic Canada, that even though it had the money to prevent it, 
it allowed this toxic site to poison more Nova Scotians?  I do 
not think so.  I think the Liberals will pay a political price 
for being that negligent to the real needs of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is useful to look at where the government's budget surplus 
actually came from.  There is a lot of debate going on about how 
the budget surplus should be spent, but people are forgetting 
where this fantastic pile of money came from.  One of the most 
significant sources, I would like to remind Canadians, is the EI 
surplus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The employment insurance system is broken.  It is completely 
defunct.  The wheels have fallen off.  It does not work any more. 
It is only a cash cow for the government.  Working people have to 
pay into it, and yet working people have a less than 40% chance 
of actually receiving any income maintenance should they become 
unfortunate enough to find themselves unemployed.  What kind of 
an insurance fund is that?   Who in their right mind would design 
an insurance fund like that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, what if it was mandatory that you had to pay 
insurance on your house.  You had to pay it every month.  Yet if 
your house burned down you would have a less than 40% chance of 
collecting any dividend.  You would think you had been cheated. 
You would think you had been robbed.  You would be outraged.  Mr. 
Speaker, you would be standing in your place and screaming bloody 
murder that you had been cheated.  That is exactly the situation 
in which working people find themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, the figures are worse than that.  The average worker 
has a less than 40% chance of collecting any EI benefit.  The 
average woman has a less than 25% chance of collecting any EI 
benefit.  The changes to EI disproportionately affect working 
women because there are more part time working women.  Youths 
under 25 have a less than 15% chance of collecting any EI 
benefits at all.  Yet faithfully every paycheque those people 
have to pay the premium, and faithfully every paycheque their 
employers have to pay 1.4 times the amount that the employees 
pay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No wonder there is a surplus.  If the government takes and takes 
and never pays anything out, of course it will have a surplus. 
That surplus is $600 million per month; not per year, per month. 
There is $7 billion per year in EI premiums alone that the 
government takes in and fails to pay out in benefits.  To use 
that money for anything other than income maintenance for 
unemployed workers, I suggest, at the very least, is being 
dishonest.  At the very worst it is fraudulent.  To take 
something from a person's paycheque for a specific purpose and to 
use it for something else is a breach of trust. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To take it one step further, to take money away from those most 
vulnerable in society, unemployed workers who paid into the fund, 
and hand it over as tax cuts to the wealthy is nothing short of a 
perverse version of Robin Hood.  To rob from the poor to give to 
the rich is absolutely unconscionable and somehow the government 
is getting away with it without a huge hue and cry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tonight there will be a vote on this issue.  The member for 
Acadie—Bathurst has a private member's bill on EI reform which 
will be voted on tonight.  Liberal members of parliament will 
have to stand to say whether they agree with this absolute cash 
cow that is the EI fund, and they will be counted.  The public 
will notice them and they will pay a political price for voting 
against EI reform.  We know where the money came from that gave 
this budget its surplus.  It came out of the pockets of working 
people.  It came out of the benefits that should have been paid 
to unemployed people in this country.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole issue of tax reform is a necessary debate.  As I said, 
it is nothing against NDP policy to talk about true tax reform. 
It is frustrating to some of us that some would deny the fact 
that the NDP is concerned about tax fairness.  We are very 
concerned about it.  We believe that the tax system is one of the 
great economic instruments we have to redistribute wealth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can give an example of what a difference fair taxation can 
make.  I can give the House the state of the nation in terms of 
the way we use taxation in the country to try to make a more 
equitable society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the distribution of market income in 1997, the 
ratio of the top fifth income earners to the bottom fifth is 
24:1.  That is grotesquely unfair.  The ratio is 24:1 of the top 
fifth income earners to the bottom fifth income earners.  After 
taxes and transfers, that ratio falls to 8:1.  It is still 
obscene by anybody's standards, but a huge improvement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we factor in the value of public services, which we equally 
enjoy and do not have to dig into our pockets to purchase, the 
ratio of income in equity falls to less than 4:1.  Starting out 
at 24:1, we now have it down to 4:1.  Some would still say that 
is fundamentally wrong, that we should be a lot more equitable 
than that.  We believe that changes should be made in that 
direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It points out how the tax system can be used as an instrument 
for economic fairness, justice and equality.  Yet we have chosen 
to go in the opposite direction.  The changes in the current 
budget take us further in the opposite direction; not toward tax 
fairness, but growing the inequality between rich and poor.  We 
have been sold a bill of goods that has told us it is necessary 
to let the wealthy keep more of their money and ignore the 
situation of the lowest fifth of the economic scale. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a very cynical point of view, and the same is true in 
American politics, but there is no point in targeting a political 
message or an economic policy to people in the bottom fifth of 
the economic social scale because they do not vote.  They are so 
marginalized and disenfranchised that they do not vote at 
election time.  Why would government waste its largesse on 20% of 
the population which, frankly, would not vote for it anyway? 
They have given up on the electoral system as a vehicle or a 
means by which to improve themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That might sound cynical, but I accuse the government of having 
gone through that thought process, in the same way the Americans 
have in their political system, that there is no sense in wasting 
messaging on people who really need it because they are so 
disenfranchised and marginalized they do not vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to voice our strong opposition to Bill C-24.  It takes us 
further away from the idea of tax fairness.  It will accentuate 
and augment the inequalities in our tax system and further 
institutionalize those inequalities for another couple of years 
until we can do something to convince the government to take 
steps otherwise. 
<P><A NAME="LINK41"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to comment on two 
matters raised by the member for Winnipeg Centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, is the member aware that in 1985 the auditor general told 
the government of the day, when the EI had a deficit of about $5 
billion, that it would distort the public accounts if the deficit 
was not included in the consolidated accounts of the government? 
The auditor general said that the deficit must be included in the 
consolidated accounts and the government of the day did that. 
The EI surplus of today, if he wants to call it that, is really 
incorporated within the consolidated revenues of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member also know that the EI notional account has been 
in a deficit for 11 years of the last 17 years?  Does he 
understand that the Canadian taxpayers supported that deficit for 
11 years?  Therefore, when the account has a surplus, why should 
the Canadian taxpayers, generally, not be able to use that 
notional fund for the benefit of all Canadians? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member talks about tax relief for rich or wealthy Canadians. 
Is he confusing this with the tax policy proposals of the 
Alliance, which talk about a flat tax, which would clearly move 
the tax burden from the high income earners to middle and low 
income earners? 
The government in its last three or four budgets has delivered 
tax relief to low income and middle income Canadians. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1345"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT44"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>From where did the member pick up the notion that the government 
was providing massive tax relief to high income, wealthy, rich 
Canadians?  The facts do not support that.  Is he mixing it up 
with the flat tax proposal of the Alliance Party? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the member opposite clarify his understanding that the EI 
notional surplus has been in deficit 11 out of 17 years?  How can 
he justify not using that surplus today to benefit middle income 
and low income Canadians? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am happy to be able to 
answer a very good question that has its basis in actual fact. 
The EI fund was in deficit.  The Canadian taxpayer propped it up 
over that period of time by a total accumulated backfill of $13 
billion.  The total accumulated surplus will exceed $39 billion 
at the end of this year.  In other words, we paid back the 
original debt of $13 billion and another $26 billion is being 
hived off, again going into consolidated revenue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member is absolutely right again.  There is no separate EI 
fund.  All the money goes into general revenues.  Our point is 
that any surplus above and beyond what we owe the consolidated 
revenue fund should be used toward income maintenance for 
unemployed workers, as it was intended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If an amount is deducted from a person's paycheque for a 
specific purpose and then used for something completely 
different, at the very least it is a breach of trust.  In the 
worst case scenario it is out and out fraudulence.  We believe 
there has been a structured and deliberate abuse of the EI 
program that went far beyond paying back the $13 billion and now 
is being used as a cash cow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member asked if I understood the nature of the tax cuts 
being proposed by the government.  I do.  I understand the 
finance committee recommended four major components: reducing the 
capital gains tax, dropping the middle income tax rate, 
eliminating the 5% upper income surtax and raising the threshold 
for the top two tax rates.  I wonder if the hon. member realizes 
that these four measures would make a difference in various 
income brackets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those making $475,000 a year would get $11,650 in tax breaks 
with these measures.  Those making $42,000 a year would get 
$1,140 in tax breaks with these measures.  Those making $20,000 a 
year would get a $3 tax break.  Who is this benefiting the most? 
Obviously the high income earner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member from Surrey spoke to me before I gave my speech. 
He pointed out that his daughter made $8,000 last year.  At the 
end of the year she received a bill for $200 for taxes owing. The 
kid made eight grand and still owed $200, even after paying taxes 
on her paycheques. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My mother makes $21,000 a year from all her sources of income 
such as old age pension, her husband's CPP and widow's pension. 
She pays $600 per quarter in taxes every year.  At the end of the 
year she owes $1,500.  Something is fundamentally wrong, I would 
put to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance. 
<P><A NAME="LINK42"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is very clear to many Canadians, 
particularly young summer employees and so on, that this is not 
an insurance.  It is a tax and it goes into the federal coffers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should like to inform the NDP member who just spoke that a 
terrible thing is happening with EI payments.  There is a large 
oil well operation in my constituency.  It is a cyclical 
industry. When it is up, it is hiring, and then it goes down.  If 
a young person from the city of Weyburn or Estevan hires on in 
the oil industry and then gets laid off, he can draw EI 
insurance.  However, if someone is laid off and returns to the 
family farm to live with his parents, he collects zippo. 
I am quite used to seeing farmers being abused, but when the 
government taxes them and they have to pay the taxes it is wrong 
that they cannot qualify.  It should be corrected.  I brought it 
to the government's attention but it made no difference.  I would 
like the hon. member to comment on that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I could not agree more with 
the hon. member.  If one is forced to pay into something one 
should have a reasonable expectation of collecting what was 
promised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The example I used before was of people with mandatory fire 
insurance on their homes.  They have to pay into it. They have no 
choice.  Yet if their houses burn down there is less than a 40% 
chance of being able to collect.  They would think they had been 
cheated, that they had been robbed.  That is fundamentally wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member pointed out some kind of geographical 
discrimination in a sense.  There are other inequities in the 
program which are just as glaring.  For instance, an unemployed 
woman has less than a 25% chance of being able to collect 
employment insurance because women are more likely to be in part 
time work, and part time workers are disproportionately affected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A youth under 25 years of age, and the young people listening 
today should be aware of this, has less than a 15% chance of 
collecting any benefits, even though it is mandatory to pay into 
the program.  The hon. member is right.  It ceases to become an 
insurance program.  It is really another tax on the paycheque. 
<P><A NAME="LINK43"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney—Victoria, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
in listening to the government talk about projected GDP and since 
we are on fiscal matters, would my colleague be prepared to 
comment on the way we measure the wealth of the country in terms 
of taxation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, we do not ever talk about the real cost of 
production.  We do not talk about environmental degradation when 
we talk about growth.  We do not talk about the effect on poor 
families when we talk about social housing.  I think there are 
questionable ways in terms of how the government measures growth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I agree that the GDP is a 
flawed instrument to use in trying to measure the growth of the 
country.  If there is a hurricane or a tornado the GDP blossoms 
in the area.  That does not mean it was good for Canadians.  It 
just means that a bunch of economic activity had to take place. 
We can tie GDP to disasters, for heaven's sake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To say that Canadians are not productive because of the ratio of 
workers to GDP is a complete misnomer.  Productivity is not the 
issue.  Canadian workers are some of the most productive in the 
world.  Productivity as a ratio to GDP and employment is a flawed 
way of viewing our economic well-being.  It is misleading and I 
would say intellectually dishonest.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to participate in the debate on Bill C-24 
which deals with some tweaking and fiddling the Liberal 
government is planning to do with regard to the GST and the HST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As is typical with the government opposite these changes were 
actually announced in 1997.  Finally it is getting around to 
exempting a few items from the GST.  It is interesting that in 
the last few months, just before it brought in the bill, it added 
a few other items that will now be taxed at an increasing level 
which were not taxed before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Overall the particular bill points out a credibility shortfall 
on the other side.  It was mentioned by the previous speaker. The 
actions on the particular bill and on the GST by the Liberal 
government have eroded public confidence in elected officials. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me refer to some comments made by the current Prime Minister 
regarding the GST years ago.  The bill before us is a fine tuning 
or a tweaking of certain aspects of how the GST and the HST are 
applied. 
It is amazing so many years after these election promises by the 
current Prime Minister and his government that we are still doing 
this dance with the GST.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1990 the current Prime Minister said that he was opposed to 
the GST, had always been opposed to it and will always be opposed 
to it.  In 1992 the thinking was, according to the Deputy Prime 
Minister, that they wanted to get rid of the GST.  On January 23, 
1992, they said that there was no doubt they would replace it. 
Also the Prime Minister said that we would know they have 
replaced the GST when we see their budget.  All the way through I 
have many quotes from the Prime Minister who said that it would 
be gone in two years, just before the election in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we are some seven years later and we are still looking at 
the GST.  We had an election promise in the red book.  Canadians 
were led to assume that they would not have the GST.  They voted 
often on that basis.  Many people may have voted a different way 
but had promises and guarantees from the leader of that party 
that the GST would be gone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When that is the platform, when that is the promise, it is not 
unreasonable for Canadians to have the expectation that when the 
government comes in with a majority it will implement one of the 
key pillars of its platform.  We can understand that may not be 
in the first year or the second year.  Maybe there has to be some 
time to consider how to phase it in.  For goodness' sake, we are 
seven years past those promises and there has not been one real 
movement dealing with the GST.  We expected to see some results 
from that election promise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not surprising that Canadians feel overburdened by taxes 
from the government.  It throws lots of optics around some small 
tax relief.  On the other hand it is taking more and more out of 
our pockets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The GST is a good example.  I met with the mayor of the city of 
Calgary who told me that out of all the services Calgary gets 
from the federal government and all the money it sends to Ottawa 
there is a net outflow every year to Ottawa from Calgary of $4 
billion.

Speaker, marriage breakdown is often a difficult and sad occasion 
and even more so when children are involved.  Listen to the story 
of a non-custodial father who lives in my riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few years ago his former wife took their two children and 
moved to the east coast.  Subsequently he was laid off from his 
job and it took three full years for the courts to acknowledge 
the change in his employment status.  In this case the court 
system pushed this father to the edge of financial ruin and 
dropped him into the abyss of deep emotional anguish, often 
aggravated by the fact that his wife repeatedly denied any access 
to his children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For many, the emotional trauma brought on by inefficient, 
expensive and sometimes unfair court orders proves too much to 
bear.  Darrin White from Prince George, B.C., committed suicide 
in March after a court gave him limited access to his children 
and ordered him to pay his estranged wife twice his take home pay 
in child support and alimony each month. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All legislators at all levels of government, all family law 
practitioners and all family court systems realize their 
decisions have human consequences.  Too often, however, the court 
system fails to deal adequately and quickly with changing home 
situations.

draw the attention of the House today to the election of Nycole 
Turmel as the first woman president of the Public Service 
Alliance of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ms. Turmel, a native of Quebec, was elected on the first ballot 
with a very comfortable majority.  As well as being the first 
female president in the 34 years of PSAC's existence, she is the 
second francophone to hold the position.  The 140,000-member 
Public Service Alliance of Canada is the main federal public 
service union.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the veterans affairs minister's worst 
fears have been realized.  ACOA has already become the Atlantic 
Canada overblown agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at who got some cash:  the Royal Bank, Canada 
Packers, Bombardier, Irving Pulp and Paper, CP hotels, IBM, 
General Dynamics Corp. and McCain Foods.  These are not exactly 
small fries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is taxpayer money being used to subsidize these massively 
profitable corporations? 
<P><A NAME="LINK85"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. George S. Baker (Minister of Veterans Affairs and 
Secretary of State (Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency), 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the federation's report today looks 
somewhat similar to the Reform-Alliance agenda.  It wants to cut 
all regional funding agencies.  It agrees with the flat tax.  It 
says that medicare is too expensive.  It says that EI should be 
done away with.  In fact, if we asked the federation or the 
Reform-Alliance to pass judgment on ACOA it would be like asking 
Count Dracula to manage the blood bank. 
<P><A NAME="LINK86"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, let me make it clear.  What we would 
like to do is end the abuse and let Atlantic Canadians oversee 
their own situation and not send money to Ottawa.  This 
government confiscates Canadians' money through high taxation. It 
assigns the money to one department.  It transfers it to another 
department, like the Business Development Bank, then it kicks it 
out to companies that do not need it and calls it job creation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is this government's job creation limited to bumble, fumble 
and boondoggle? 
<P><A NAME="LINK87"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. George S. Baker (Minister of Veterans Affairs and 
Secretary of State (Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency), 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member listed off a group of 
large businesses that received grants under ACOA.  This is 
absolutely correct but it was under the Tory administration when 
all those grants were given to all the companies listed.  I 
wonder if the Leader of the Reform-Alliance today still wants to 
unite with the Tory Party when it has a record like that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK88"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, he said that I listed off businesses. 
I would now like to list off some labour unions.  It seems that 
the federal government would like to spread the cash around.  It 
is not just limited to huge corporations and more government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How about the Canadian Auto Workers?  How about the New 
Brunswick Federation of Labour?  How about the teacher 
associations and the teamsters.  Jimmy Hoffa would be proud of 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the government handing taxpayer money out to groups that 
do not need it? 
<P><A NAME="LINK89"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. George S. Baker (Minister of Veterans Affairs and 
Secretary of State (Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency), 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, here they go again.  They want to cut out 
all regional development agencies in rural Canada.  They are 
opposed to any assistance at all to our fishermen.  They are 
opposed to assistance to our farmers in western Canada, not one 
penny. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This Liberal Party will fight this anti-rural Canada attitude on 
the part of the Canadian Alliance Party. 
<P><A NAME="LINK90"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I do not think that minister would know a farm if he saw 
one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday the minister responsible for ACOA told the House that 
the first thing the Liberal Party did with that agency was to 
discontinue the practice of giving out grants.  Access to 
information documents show that ACOA handed out 123 grants 
totalling $12 million between 1996 and 1999; grants, not loans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the minister not know the difference between a grant and a 
loan?  Maybe he should spend more time looking after his 
department and less time on his drama lessons. 
<P><A NAME="LINK91"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. George S. Baker (Minister of Veterans Affairs and 
Secretary of State (Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency), 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to reiterate to the hon. member 
that when the Liberals took over the first thing we did, on the 
suggestion of the auditor general, was to change all grants and 
all forgivable loans to simply loans.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the last five years we have been giving only loans which 
have to be paid back.  That has been the case for every business, 
every commercial enterprise.  The grants were given under the 
Tories. 
<P><A NAME="LINK92"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, that is very interesting.  Under access to information, 
I have a list of 123 grants given out by this government in 1996, 
1997, 1998 and 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the Canadian Taxpayers Federation, 72% of the funds 
disbursed by ACOA were in the form of non-repayable grants and 
contributions.  What is more, 35% of the loans the minister talks 
about issued by ACOA have been written off over the past 10 
years.  It only gets worse.  In the last two years the default 
rate has risen to 50%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why has the minister continued the abuse of taxpayer money under 
ACOA under his watch? 
<P><A NAME="LINK93"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. George S. Baker (Minister of Veterans Affairs and 
Secretary of State (Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency), 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, on the write-off question, which the hon. 
member says is 34%, the actual write-offs contained in the public 
accounts show that since 1995 the write-off of loans by the 
Government of Canada is 0.4%.  Since 1987 the write-off has been 
4.2%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the opposition party does not start doing its homework it 
will be written off in the next election.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques,

paid out for no reason to the firm Modes Conili Star, since 100 
of the 118 employees covered by the job creation grant were 
transferred to the firm Paris Star. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the government once again waste over $700,000 of public

would harm Canada-U.S. relations if Canada did not participate in

Mr. Speaker, if the hon. member had been paying attention, even 
though there has been no request made for participation the 
United States has not decided on its own participation at this 
point in time.  All that is being done is a series of very 
important questions that are being raised, questions about the 
participation in NORAD and equal questions about the importance 
that it has to the broad question of arm's control and nuclear 
disarmament.  I suggest the hon. member engage in the debate 
rather than ask spurious questions.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan—Coquihalla, Canadian Alliance):</B>

defence program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Professor Jim Fergusson, an expert on defence issues from the

say.  He testified before the defence committee last week that

testify before the defence committee, before the foreign affairs

there might be problems and they were studying it.  Most recently

there is no problem with bill 11.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>   Mr.

nothing happens which will imperil our Canadian health care 
system.  In particular, if bill 11 is adopted nothing in its 
implementation will imperil the principles of accessibility and

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the minister of fisheries.  The minister is well 
aware of the difficulties some small boat fishermen are having 
with the regulations pertaining to boat lengths and how they 
affect their abilities to catch their quotas and earn livings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this moment fisheries officers in Newfoundland are actually 
telling fishermen that they have to cut a piece off their boats 
to meet the boat length regulations if they want to fish.  Will 
the minister put an end to these costly and insane regulations 
and allow fishermen to harvest their quotas in the boats of their 
choice? 
<P><A NAME="LINK171"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of Fisheries and 
Oceans, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, one of the things that is 
extremely important is boat safety.  This is an area we are 
looking at very closely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We as a government made a huge number of commitments to reduce 
the capacity so that we would have a sustainable fishery.  We do 
not want to increase the capacity.  We spent large amounts of 
taxpayer dollars to reduce it so that we would have a sustainable 
fishery.  Safety is an important concern.  It is something I am 
looking at to ensure that when fishermen fish safety can be an 
important component.

has been extremely positive. 
I have received more feedback from constituents on it than on the

the work of the legislative counsel.  This will not take long, 
and I know it will be of interest to you. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the months of March and April, I introduced a series of 
amendments to a bill that has not yet reached the report stage, 
but my purpose was to prepare for that stage.  The bill in 
question is Bill C-3, the Young Offenders Act.  It has not yet 
passed the committee stage and the clause by clause examination has 
not yet begun. 
In order to provide the legislative counsel with some 
assistance, I tabled several hundred amendments through 
Mr. Louis-Philippe Côté. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In late April, legislative counsel Richard Dupuis— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</B> During the months of March and April, I 
gave hundreds of amendments to Louis-Philippe Côté, the 
legislative counsel, to have him prepare them in due form for me 
to then table them.  Perhaps I will not table them, but I want 
to be sure I have everything going for me.  I gave them to 
Mr. Côté, so he could prepare them for report stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of April, I got a call from Richard Dupuis, the 
procedural clerk.  He called my office to discuss the amendments 
I intend to table pertaining to the Young Offenders Act at 
report stage.  He even sent me by fax, in proper form, at report 
stage, amendments that I tabled with the legislative counsel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is still the same: How is it the procedural clerk of 
the House of Commons has the amendments I have yet to table, 
which are at the drafting stage and which he is discussing with 
heaven knows who.  One thing is sure, he has them, because he 
faxed them to me.  He is discussing them with people to find out 
the point of my amendment, how I want to go about it or 
whatever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what I would like you to answer, Mr. Speaker.  Given

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be remiss if I passed over the comments by the member 
for Kings—Hants just before Oral Question Period. 
He praised the Government of Quebec's fiscal 
policies, rightly so I might add, mentioning the benefits of the 
policies the PQ government has put in place to attract high-tech 
industries, among others, to Quebec.  We know that the City of 
Montreal and his region, of which we have a proud representative 
in the person of the member for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, is now one 
of the centres of the new technology, not just in Canada and 
North America, but worldwide, of course. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be remiss if I did not mention what the member said, and 
quite rightly, about the fiscal policies of Bernard Landry, one 
of the greatest finance ministers Canada or Quebec has ever had, 
provincially or federally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, Bill C-24 is a bill which we vehemently oppose.  One 
of the main problems—I would even say the main problem—of the 
Canadian federation right now is fiscal imbalance.  While the 
federal government is swimming in enormous surpluses, and the 
Minister of Finance talked about surpluses of $95 billion over 
five years, our view, which is shared by most of the experts—the 
member for Sherbrooke agrees with me—is that it will be more like 
$137 billion to $140 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tax imbalance is such that while the federal government is 
enjoying huge surpluses, all the provinces have trouble just 
keeping their heads above water. Ottawa and the provinces have 
needs to meet. For example, because of the ageing population, we 
know that expenditures can only increase in the health sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But, since 1993, the federal government has been cutting the 
transfers to the provinces for health. What is the result of 
these cuts? The result is that the provinces are feeling the 
crunch. 
Then the federal government acts like a saviour and says “Here, 
we will give you more money, but we are the saviours of Canada's 
health system”, when, in fact, it is the federal government that 
axed health all across Canada. It is only through the heroic 
efforts of all the provincial governments that we are managing 
fairly well. But the primary source of the problems in health is 
the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could go on like this in several areas. Worse still is the 
fact that the federal government's surpluses were generated not 
only at the expense of the provinces, as I pointed out, but also 
of the poor. For example, six out of ten people no longer 
qualify for employment insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet, the term insurance implies that if we have a problem, we 
are protected, we have a safety net. 
But no, the federal government organizes things so as to get the 
money out of the most disadvantaged, the unemployed for 
instance, to fill up its pockets and then to use their money for 
purposes other than those intended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When most Canadians and most Quebecers look at their pay stubs, 
they can see that a certain amount has been taken off in the 
employment insurance column each month.  Anyone looking at it 
can say to himself “If I lose my job, I should be able to access 
employment insurance”, but no.  No, because this government is 
stealing from the unemployed to fill its coffers with money that 
ought normally to go back to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We find ourselves therefore in a somewhat unbelievable situation 
in which transfers to the provinces are being cut, in which the 
provinces are doing their best to deliver the services for which 
they are responsible, and then Ottawa comes along saying “Come 
now, dear provinces, I can give you some more money, but you 
will have to adhere to this or that national standard”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian federation is more centralized than ever, and one 
symptom of this massive centralization is the agreement on 
social union which the provinces, with the exception of Quebec 
of course, the only one to stand up for itself, felt obliged to 
sign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is serious.  The provinces are obliged to sign off, to 
abandon huge chunks of the sovereignty in order to get their 
hands on some few million dollars temporarily.  Unfortunately 
for them, they have been bought off.  That is what has happened. 
Only Quebec had the honour, the dignity and the courage to 
stand up for itself and to say no, but that is the way Canadian 
history has always gone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have already been other instances of this type of dirty 
financial dealings by the federal government. 
For example, there is the harmonization of the GST with the QST. 
We know that the Government of Quebec had harmonized its sales 
tax with the GST.  A few months later, the maritime provinces 
reached an agreement with the federal government and were 
compensated for harmonizing their sales tax with the GST, 
something the Government of Quebec was not.  This is another 
example of the perverse desire of this government to see that 
Quebec does not get its due. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, in order to compensate the Atlantic provinces for 
the financial losses they will suffer by harmonizing the sales 
tax, the federal government paid $961 million in compensation to 
them.  This aid represents $423 per inhabitant.  In Quebec, this 
would mean a figure of $3.1 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not what Quebec is asking. 
The Government of Quebec rightly said that it would accept $2 
billion. However, if the criteria used with the Atlantic 
provinces were used, the Government of Quebec would be entitled 
to ask for $3.1 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Quebec asked for $2 billion in compensation. 
The harmonization cost everyone a lot, not only the Government 
of Quebec, but businesses in Quebec as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reform of the QST occasioned by the harmonization, resulted 
in significant financial costs that necessitated increases in 
corporate taxes and the retention of certain restrictions on 
refunds of taxes for corporate input. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec businesses have not benefited and are still not 
benefiting from the harmonization with the GST, because, once 
again, of the ill will of the federal government. 
The federal government's compensation to the maritimes adds to 
the economic and fiscal competition these provinces represent 
for Quebec, since Quebec does not receive comparable assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, Bernard Lord's predecessor in New Brunswick, Frank 
McKenna, who is of the same political stripe as the government, 
took out full-page ads in newspapers and economic reviews in 
Quebec inviting companies to set up business in New Brunswick, 
saying that his province's fiscal policies were competitive and 
that they would be better treated than in Quebec.  Of course, 
because, among other things, they are entitled to compensation 
from the federal government, while the Government of Quebec is 
not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec taxpayers subsidized, as it were, the Government of New 
Brunswick's attempt to steal jobs from Quebec.  It is a 
completely ridiculous system. 
It is utterly surrealistic, but it is the way Canadian 
federalism works.  This is just one example of why we want to 
get out and are fighting to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, at the suggestion of the Bloc Quebecois, the 
government said  “Perhaps we are not right.  We think we are, 
but we are prepared to submit the dispute to arbitration”.  The 
federal government and the Government of Quebec could have 
jointly appointed an arbiter, a judge, call him what you will, 
to determine who is right.  The government completely refused 
this overture from the Bloc Quebecois because, of course, it 
knew that the request from the Government of Quebec, and the 
Bloc Quebecois in particular, because it was the Bloc Quebecois 
that introduced the idea, was right.  It was reasonable and it 
was right.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am delighted to see the Liberal member nodding his approval. 
Through you, Mr. Speaker, I tell him “Ask the Minister of 
Finance to submit the dispute to an unbiased person. That is 
what he should do instead of pitting the Quebec government 
against the federal government”. I would bet, I was going to say 
$1,000, but thanks to the Bloc Quebecois, $1,000 bills are being 
withdrawn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would bet $100, Mr. Speaker, that the Quebec government 
would be proven right. 
I do hope that you will accept the challenge, which I throw out 
in all friendship, to you and to the two members who are hanging 
on my every word, because they, too, know that the request of 
the Bloc and of Quebec is legitimate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask them to put pressure on the Minister of Finance to have 
him submit this issue to arbitration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another issue on which the Bloc has worked hard concerns the 
increase in the price of gasoline. Such issues show how a party 
sticks to reality and listens to people. The Bloc Quebecois has 
launched a vast campaign throughout Quebec to help consumers 
affected by the drastic increase in the price of gasoline in 
Quebec and Canada last winter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like my colleagues from Témiscamingue and Sherbrooke, we ask 
that the federal government temporarily waive the excise tax of 
10 cents per litre on gas and 4 cents per litre on diesel fuel 
until such time as the price of gas has returned to an acceptable 
level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether we lower the taxes or not, this increase in gas prices 
will have been very costly for Canadian and Quebec households. 
Anyone who has a car—and most people need one—or has to buy 
heating oil for their house, their apartment or their condominium 
is affected by that increase. The federal government took 
advantage of that increase to fill its pockets, raking in 10 
cents per litre of gas and 4 cents per litre of diesel fuel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many times, the Bloc Quebecois asked repeatedly that the federal 
government waive the application of its tax but, again, it 
preferred to rake in the money instead of giving it back to the 
Canadian and Quebec taxpayers to whom it belongs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those who drive to work or heat their homes are affected. But, 
heartless as it is, the federal government decided to ignore the 
request of the average citizen defended by the Bloc. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I personally circulated a petition, which was very popular in my 
riding. It was circulated to gas stations, community groups and 
several people. It is incredible how sensitive people are where 
their money is concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why give tax breaks when they do not mean anything? Why should 
the government say that it is reducing taxes for Canadians, as 
the Minister of Finance is bragging about, when it is raking in 
more money with the increase in gasoline prices? It does not 
matter whether the money comes from the right pocket or the left 
pocket, it still comes out of the same pair of pants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, this shows how this government is completely out of touch 
with reality, and it is just one more reason why we will strongly 
oppose Bill C-24. I call upon all my colleagues, including the 
two Liberal members who are here, to put pressure on the Minister 
of Finance to get him to listen to Quebecers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, in closing, I will ask you to make sure that there 
is a quorum for the next speaker.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White:</B>   Somebody is calling “stand up”. 
Members on that side of the House claim to have the world 
monopoly on tolerance.  Listen to them calling things like that. 
They really need to rethink their approach entirely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It took three or four minutes to get a quorum which illustrates 
very well that this is not a place of the people.  It is not the 
place it is supposed to be, a place where the people of Canada 
have their laws passed, where the people of Canada have their 
will passed.  This is a place of the parties. People do not even 
have to be here because they know the debates are meaningless. As 
one of my colleagues said years ago when we first came here, the 
outcome of every vote is non— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I draw your attention to the fact that the member opposite, who 
was the only person on his side over there, is calling attention 
to numbers on this side.  The pot should not call the kettle 
black. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  What a testy group 
we are today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it does not change the 
situation I was describing, which is that this is a place of the 
parties.  It is irrelevant whether anybody is here at all because 
the fact is we know the outcome of every vote before the debates 
begin.  They are not true debates.  The things that are being 
said here today have no impact on the final vote.  We know that. 
When Bill C-24 comes up for the vote, everybody knows exactly 
what is going to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps one of the most distressing things is that some of our 
constituents out in the real world, the people who actually pay 
our salaries, truly believe that we do something democratic here, 
that we have real debates, that we talk about what is good about 
a bill and what is bad about a bill, and that we actually make 
sensible decisions about the content and vote on that. Mr. 
Speaker, you have been here long enough to know that is not the 
case.  I can see you smiling and frankly, it is almost a joke. 
This place is almost a joke.  It is a house of illusions rather 
than a House of Commons. I certainly hope I can stick it out long 
enough to see some changes that make this place truly democratic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moving a little more to the point of Bill C-24, just to remind 
the members who are here and people who are watching on 
television, Bill C-24 is the sales tax and excise tax amendments 
act, 1999. 
The purpose of the bill is to implement measures relating to the 
GST and HST announced in previous budgets.  It also increases the 
excise tax on cigarettes.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As soon as I read that, it took me back to 1994.  In February 
1994, when the Deputy Prime Minister was the solicitor general, 
he said that 700 RCMP officers would be dedicated to the 
anti-contraband tobacco smuggling operations and that anyone 
participating in the tobacco smuggling trade in any capacity 
whatsoever would be subject to the full range of sanctions and 
penalties provided under the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the Deputy Prime Minister to stand in his place 
right now and tell us why not a single person has ever been 
charged in connection with the cigarette smuggling which took 
place that year through the Akwesasne Indian reserve.  Will he 
stand in his place right now and answer that question?  I can see 
that he just sits there and does absolutely nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to mention to him that in late December 1998 an 
affiliate— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I am sorry but I 
need to interrupt the member.  It is not proper to refer to the 
absence or presence of any particular member of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recall that in the United States senate something of the same 
nature was done.  When the person did not respond because they 
were not there to respond, it created an ugliness and meanness 
that has persisted to this day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we can have fun, we should not put people in a position 
where they cannot respond if they are in fact not able to 
respond.  I know the hon. member for North Vancouver would not 
want to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would then ask the Deputy 
Prime Minister to take under advisement that in late December 
1998 an affiliate of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company plead guilty 
in the United States and was fined $15 million for helping 
smugglers to slip exported Canadian cigarettes back into Canada 
across the Akwesasne reserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How much longer will it take the Deputy Prime Minister's 700 
RCMP officers to get around to charging someone in Canada?  Is it 
that the RCMP are incompetent?  Is it that we need more than 700 
RCMP officers to find the people responsible in Canada?  Is it 
perhaps that the government side does not want anyone charged 
because all these executives are actually golfing buddies of the 
Prime Minister?  I just hope the Deputy Prime Minister can give 
us an answer to that question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be helpful, instead of just going ahead and increasing 
taxes on cigarettes, if the government could explain what it has 
done to prevent the smuggling that may start again as a result of 
its increased taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In California about six weeks ago there was a set of referendum 
questions on the ballot on which voters had an opportunity to 
vote at the same time as the primaries.  One of the questions had 
to do with cigarette taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Californian people had an initiative in November 1999. They 
put a question to the people as to whether or not there should be 
an extra tax on cigarettes to be used for education purposes for 
young people.  That was passed strongly with about a 75% or 80% 
pass rate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The interesting thing about these referendums is that they force 
the government to use the money for the purposes designated.  It 
is not appropriate and in fact it is impossible for the 
government to take that money exerted as a tax on the tobacco 
companies and spend it on something else by popping it into 
general revenues.  It actually has to spend it on education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That makes me think of certain promised plans that came from the 
government side when it was reducing the cigarette taxes back in 
1994-95.  It promised this huge educational program to keep young 
people from smoking.  It never happened and the smoking rate for 
young people has climbed steadily since that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In looking at what happened in California, it was a 50 cents per 
pack tax which was passed in November 1999 by the people of 
California.  There was an attempt by the tobacco companies in 
March, about eight weeks ago, to repeal that.  They managed to 
get an initiative on the ballot.  It was voted on and defeated by 
72.1%. 
This is a good example of big business trying to reverse the 
initiative that was taken by ordinary people in California.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at some of the questions that were on the ballot in 
California in March, we can see that it is really the way for 
people to get things done.  It is a darn shame that in Canada 
citizens do not have the right to citizens' initiatives and 
referendum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give the House an example of some of the things that were 
achieved by California taxpayers in their referendum ballot 
questions.  There were actually 20 separate referendum questions 
but it gives us the idea that there is compassion and common 
sense that went into their decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, they allowed the state to borrow up to $150 million 
to renovate the state's two existing veterans homes and to build 
three new facilities.  This is an example of the people of 
California voting for a tax increase in order to support an area 
of their community that they felt required support.  The present 
veterans homes were getting rundown.  They needed to be replaced 
and additional facilities were required.  That passed by 63%, a 
very clear majority, and it went into action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at tribal gaming.  Voters were asked whether the 
state constitution should be amended to allow the state's 22 
Indian bands to operate Nevada style casinos, beginning with 350 
slot machines and then expanding to a maximum of 2,000 over 
several years.  Any band that did not want to operate casinos 
would be entitled instead to annual payments of up to $1.1 
million from tax receipts.  That passed by 65%.  This is another 
example of where people were willing to both help Indian bands to 
support themselves and to also guarantee a payment from the 
public coffers, if it was necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They got tough on juvenile crime.  They passed an initiative by 
63% that would increase the punishment for gang related felonies, 
home invasions, carjackings, witness intimidation, drive-by 
shootings and gang member recruitment, all associated with youth 
violence.  Among other things, it would require more juveniles 
to be tried in an adult court and ensure that some of the 
offences were counted under the already passed three strikes and 
you're out law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that <I>60 Minutes</I> had a program on last Sunday about 
the three strikes and you're out law.  It had people arguing that 
it was outrageous because now the prisons were full of people who 
had stolen bicycles or minor offences of some sort.  I do not 
believe, as the California voters do not believe, that is a 
reason to squash the three strikes and you're out law.  It may be 
a reason to adjust it so that it does not capture certain 
categories of crime.  The crime rate in California has dropped 
dramatically since the three strikes and you're out law was 
introduced.  It appears to be doing its job down there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In another initiative where they got pretty tough on crime, 
California voters voted by 72.4%, a very strong majority, on 
expanding the circumstances that would lead to the death penalty. 
I know that is pretty controversial up here, but 72.4% of 
Californians voted that those who kidnapped for a premeditated 
murder, lie in wait for victims and take them to a secluded spot 
to kill them, or commit arson for the purposes of killing a 
person would lead to the death penalty or life imprisonment 
without parole.  Does that not sound an awful lot like what just 
happened in B.C. in the last few days? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hear calls from my constituents for a much tougher approach to 
criminal activity.  Nobody has been found guilty for what 
happened to that nine year old girl in B.C. in the last few days. 
If the circumstances being explained so far turn out to be 
correct, I know there will be a lot more people in my community 
asking for tougher penalties from the government.  It was a 
terrible shame when we saw section 745 initiatives disappear in 
this parliament.  The issue to scrap section 745, the early 
release initiatives, has not been brought back. 
Bill C-24 involves the GST.  It has been a while since I have had 
the opportunity to remind the Prime Minister of what he said 
prior to the last election.  On October 29, 1990, almost 10 years 
ago, the Prime Minister said “I am opposed to the GST.  I have 
always been opposed to it and I will be opposed to it always”. 
He is still supporting it after all these years.

<A HREF="#LINKT67"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On December 21, 1992 the Deputy Prime Minister was quoted by the 
Toronto <I>Star</I> as saying “The thinking is that we want to 
get rid of the GST”.  It is a shame he did not put a date on it 
at the time.  In the Regina <I>Leader Post</I> on January 23, 
1993, when we were getting close to the 1993 election, the Prime 
Minister said “We will replace it, no doubt about that”. 
Unfortunately, again no date was given.  On January 29, 1993 the 
Prime Minister said “They will know about the GST when we have a 
budget”.  On and on it goes, quotation after quotation stating 
that the Liberals were getting rid of the GST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the most famous statement was made on May 2, 1994 right 
here in the House of Commons when the Prime Minister said “We 
hate it and we will kill it”.  The GST is still alive and 
kicking and collecting billions of dollars for the government.  I 
may be corrected by members, but I think it is collecting 
somewhere around $20 billion a year now.  While that is only half 
of what we pay in interest on our debt, it contributes quite a 
lot toward the debt payment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have here a booklet that was sent to me by one of my 
constituents, Mr. Ted Dunn.  It is about Canada's debt.  The 
title on it is “Budget '89”.  That was 11 years ago.  The 
preface of the booklet states that Canada's large and growing 
public debt is a serious threat to the future of all Canadians. 
It also states that at $320 billion and rising—this was in 1989 
and we all know now that it is close to $600 billion—the debt is 
putting an enormous strain on the economy and on our ability to 
afford vital social and other programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each year more and more of every dollar of revenue the 
government collects is spent just to pay interest on the federal 
debt.  We cannot go on spending more and more on the interest on 
the public debt and still afford to maintain services such as 
health care, training and environmental protection, services 
Canadians value and count on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is the real kicker.  The booklet also says that the April 
1989 budget takes the necessary action to ensure that the debt 
and its costs will be brought under control.  That was in 1989 
and it was signed by the Hon. Michael H. Wilson who was minister 
of finance at the time.  As we all know, he did an abysmal job. 
The debt continued to mushroom.  It also mushroomed under this 
government.  I know it claims all the credit for finally 
balancing the budget but it has been done at the expense of 
taxpayers through huge tax increases.  The government also had a 
huge spending spree in 1994.  It blew that deficit right up to 
the $45 billion level while it spent and spent on its friends and 
cronies, I assume. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This 1989 budget document also asks why we should be concerned 
about the debt.  It concerns all Canadians.  If we fail to get 
the public debt under control, everyone stands to lose with 
higher interest rates, weaker economic growth, fewer jobs, lower 
living standards and less money to maintain social, cultural and 
regional programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at what is happening here in Canada today with $40 
billion a year being spent on interest on the debt.  The Lion's 
Gate Bridge in Vancouver, just on the edge of my riding, is 
presently undergoing refurbishing.  This is costing approximately 
$200 million.  This means we could build 200 brand new or 
refurbished Lion's Gate bridges every year just with the money we 
pay on the interest on the debt.  We could probably build 100 
brand new ones.  The interest on the debt is enough to build that 
much infrastructure.  No wonder Canada's spending on 
infrastructure, on the Trans-Canada Highway and our roads, has 
deteriorated so much over the years.  It has dropped from the 
percentage of the budget it was in 1979 to an abysmal less than 
1% now. 
It is all because of this terrible debt.  The Liberals cannot 
claim to have kept that under control when they first came to 
office.  That huge spending spree they had when they first were 
elected added $45 billion to the debt that year.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of that our social programs are under stress.  There is 
a lot of talk in the House about the medicare system and how it 
is deteriorating.  The attacks I have heard from some members in 
this place on Ralph Klein, the premier of Alberta, for trying to 
help reduce the waiting lists in his province just amaze me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am looking at an article by Michael Campbell, who is a well 
known editorialist in Vancouver.  He asked which premier stated 
that the Canada Health Act may be counterproductive as we try to 
build a public health care system for the new century.  The 
answer may be a surprise because it was not Ralph Klein, it was 
Roy Romanow, leader of the NDP in Saskatchewan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would never know it from the protests in Alberta and the 
indignation of special interest groups, but what Klein has 
proposed in Alberta is a far less significant change than what is 
happening in Saskatchewan, which passed a private medicare bill 
over a year ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is almost hypocrisy what goes on here with the attacks.  It 
is simply not convenient for the left wing, for the socialists, 
to attack their own.  It is not appropriate for them to attack 
the NDP so they attack other premiers, like Ralph Klein, who are 
trying to do something. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bottom line, frankly, is that it does not really matter 
where the money comes from to support the medicare system. 
Whether it is provincial or federal, it is still coming out of 
the same taxpayers' pockets.  It is the taxpayer who pays.  All 
of the arguing and fighting over who it is who has provided the 
money or cut the money, in the end it is the taxpayer who pays. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we should be considering, because of the stress that 
has been created by the huge debt, private sector alternatives, 
and I congratulate the premiers who are willing to do that. 
Certainly I will be voting against Bill C-24.  It does not get 
rid of the GST.  It is a disgrace. 
<P><A NAME="LINK186"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the member opposite made, I certainly agree, some very 
important points about the debt, but I cannot help but intervene 
on his comments about referenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know he has a lot of faith in what the Americans are doing by 
holding referenda, but I would like to point out to him that the 
cost of popular justice, of popular referenda if you will, in the 
United States has involved basically the wild west, the 
lawlessness of the wild west and the genocide of the Indians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It involved Jim Crow laws in the southern United States, where 
the popular municipalities with the Ku Klux Klan led to all kinds 
of atrocities against people based on race.  Because of popular 
justice it was entirely impossible at that particular time, at 
the turn of the century, to bring these people to justice when 
they did these things against people because of race. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Jim Crow laws are again another reflection of popular sentiment 
translated into prejudice against individuals, whereas I remind 
the member opposite that the Canadian experience in these areas 
was entirely different.  We did not have a wild west, and we did 
not have a wild west because decision making was not vested in 
people at the grassroots.  It was vested in laws that were 
determined by members of parliament rather than referenda.  When 
people are elected, those people should be speaking from their 
own conscience and not simply as a result of popular pressure. 
That is the danger of referenda, as we see in the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member is perfectly correct.  The Americans love referenda. 
But it could also come back to the same kind of prejudice, hate 
and destruction that typified the kind of referenda we saw in the 
19th century and at the turn of the century against both Indians 
and blacks.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the arguments which have just 
been put forward by the member—and I thank him for giving me the 
opportunity to talk about them—are typical of the sorts of red 
herrings which are thrown in by people opposed to allowing the 
people who pay our salaries to have more say in the operations of 
this place.  They always draw on these historical events from 
donkeys years ago, at the turn of the century, when we all know 
very well that governments controlled all of the propaganda. 
Governments controlled all of the means of distribution of 
information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even here in Canada, as late as the 1970s, Francis Fox, a 
minister of the House, was trying to prevent people from having 
satellite dishes on their apartment buildings in Vancouver.  He 
was arresting people and putting them in jail for trying to get 
by the government propaganda and receiving news broadcasts from 
other places so that they could sift through the propaganda to 
find the truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no comparison whatsoever between the conditions which 
existed at the turn of the century, in terms of information 
available to people, and what exists in modern times, even from 
the mid-1970s, if we look at the results of referenda in the 
United States, which is our closest example, and in Switzerland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can understand why the member would be afraid of this because 
the outcomes are universally small <I>c</I> conservative in 
nature.  People exhibit their common sense by making wise 
decisions with taxpayers' money.  They keep their politicians 
under control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sometimes they make decisions that the politicians are unwilling 
to face.  For example, in Washington state at the end of last 
year the people decided to decriminalize the use of marijuana. In 
Canada that is a hot potato that we do not want to touch.  We 
would rather it just went away.  None of us want to say whether 
we are for or against it, but in Washington state it was taken 
out of the politicians' hands and the people did it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hear people criticize something like proposition 13, which got 
spending under control in California.  But the people of 
California have every opportunity to reverse that.  Anyone could 
have taken an initiative and reversed those spending controls. 
No one ever has.  The fact is that there is greater democracy, a 
greater standard of living, lower unemployment, and a greater 
satisfaction with lifestyle.  We have a lot to learn from places 
where there is a greater degree of democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of cost alone, there is a cost to democracy.  It costs, 
I believe, about $400 million to run parliament, with all of its 
staff, with all of the travel, with all of the spending.  I 
believe that is roughly the right figure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do the citizens of Canada get out of that?  They get the 
will of the Prime Minister's office imposed upon them.  That is 
what happens from this place.  The will of the Prime Minister's 
office is imposed upon them for $400 million a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at the debt of $600 billion, I cannot believe for a 
second that we would be in more difficult straits if the people 
of Canada had been controlling this place instead of the elected 
people, who, according to the member over there, use their 
conscience on what they should be doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe we would have a better country if the people of Canada 
had more input into what was happening in this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I cannot resist giving my 
colleague opposite a further lesson in history.  He should recall 
where the term demagogue comes from.  I am not referring to him 
as a demagogue.  I am not disparaging his remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A demagogue comes from ancient Greece.  The word referred to 
people who could influence the crowd, not by the weight of their 
arguments or the propriety of their arguments, but just by the 
weight of their rhetoric. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The difficulty with referenda and this type of popular response 
that the member is suggesting is that all of the people are not 
equally informed on an issue.  By eloquence and rhetoric, even 
though the facts may be twisted and distorted, people can be 
influenced.  That is why we had a situation in the United States 
that occurred in the late 19th century and early 20th century 
where the popular sentiment was manipulated by demagogues.  It 
led to terrible results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not really believe that we as human beings have changed so 
dramatically in 2,000 years.  As a matter of fact, if you are 
somebody who is interested in the Bible, you would appreciate 
that maybe we have not changed over 2,000 years.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The very point of all this is that demagoguery is a real thing. 
It was exercised in ancient Greece.  The ancient Greeks 
recognized it for what it was.  I admire the member opposite very 
much, but I am sorry, what he is proposing is government by 
demagoguery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we have advanced beyond that.  Each of us as politicians 
has a sacred duty, in my view, to act according to our conscience 
on the best information we get.  We cannot do that by referenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member opposite can claim 
he is operating on his conscience if he wants to.  I know the 
people in my riding have made it clear that they elected me to 
vote their will in this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He keeps hearkening back to history.  He even went back as far 
as the Greeks this time.  I will repeat that at the turn of the 
century there were very few people who had control of the 
dissemination of information.  We live in a totally different 
era.  He mentions that some of the people are poorly informed.  I 
suppose that is because they make a decision that is different to 
what he would like. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give him an example.  In March in California people were 
asked to make an interesting decision.  Someone proposed that 
“None of the above” be added to the bottom of the ballot so 
that people who did not want to vote for any of the above would 
mark “None of the above”.  The argument was that this would 
cause a greater turnout of voters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Arizona has that on its ballot, but it has never increased the 
voter turnout, so the citizens of California rejected it by 65%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I disagree that there is any evidence from Switzerland, from 
Washington State, from Oregon, from Arizona or from California 
that people do not think very carefully about their decisions or 
that they are not informed when they make their mark on the 
ballot.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from May 1 consideration of the motion that 
Bill C-31, an act respecting immigration to Canada and the 
granting of refugee protection to persons who are displaced, 
persecuted or in danger, be read the second time and referred to 
a committee.

pleased to speak today in support of Bill C-31, the Immigration

immigration legislation, which was supposed to happen last year.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Late or not, the bill is presented while many chronic problems 
and faults are surfacing at Citizenship and Immigration Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, I will address various issues relating to immigration and 
to the bill before us. According to the minister, the 
legislation will be tougher on criminals. I have my doubts. The 
provisions of Bill C-31 on security are inadequate. I will 
address the recommendations that my colleague, the member for 
Compton—Stanstead, made to the committee. I will also talk about 
the report on immigration that was published by the auditor 
general a few weeks ago. 
auditor general exposed a few problems of which the 
government had been aware for some time. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Progressive Conservative Party of Canada is aware of the 
abuse that occurs at immigration.  In the 1980s we introduced two 
controversial bills to deal with the imperfections in the system. 
These bills, one a piece of emergency legislation, were 
vehemently opposed by the Liberals.  This is hardly a surprise. 
Liberals loathe taking a stand on a certain issue out of fear of 
losing the next election.  When danger arose, we took action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Be assured that during the course of the debate on the 
immigration bill the Progressive Conservative Party will continue 
its tradition of fighting for an efficient and effective 
immigration system.  We are familiar with the immigration system. 
That is why this party looks forward to debating the clauses and 
provisions found in Bill C-31. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the biggest fears of this party and Canadians is the 
entry of foreign criminals.  The new bill purports to toughen our 
present stance on criminals.  Much more can be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the new legislation provision is made in clauses 31 and 32 to 
bar individuals from the refugee determination system. Clause 31 
deals with those inadmissible on the grounds of having violated 
human rights. Clause 31(1)(c) reads: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(c) being a representative of a government against which Canada 
has imposed or has agreed to impose sanctions in association with 
the international community. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the minister could clarify “a representative”.  Is a 
representative a government official or is it a national of that 
country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 32 of Bill C-31 sets out criteria for serious 
criminality.  We do not understand why a serious criminal is only 
deemed to be someone who has been convicted of a crime punishable 
in Canada by imprisonment of 10 years or more. Why these numbers? 
Is the minister telling us that offences for which someone could 
only serve nine years are not serious?  What does she mean by 
serious criminality?  Our party is baffled why the minister would 
not take all crimes seriously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even more, there is not necessarily consistency between two 
countries' criminal justice systems.  An offence punishable in 
Canada by 10 years imprisonment may not be punishable in another 
country at all.  The Progressive Conservative Party is not 
comfortable with the numbers as they are set out in Bill C-31.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the standing committee discussed its draft report on border 
security, my colleague the immigration critic, the member for 
Compton—Stanstead, was able to secure two amendments in the 
final report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One amendment was the requirement for all refugee claimants to 
be fingerprinted and photographed at the first point of contact 
with them in Canada. My colleague has reasoned that refugee 
claimants disappear and do not show up for their hearings.  One 
statistic from the Immigration and Refugee Board in Vancouver 
shows that 71% of claimants did not show up for their hearings. 
Where are they? How many criminals are passing through?  How many 
criminals are endangering our cities, our streets and our 
children?  How many are there and where are they?  As a national 
party, we are concerned about these potential criminals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Matthews:</B>  What is the hon. member talking about? 
Potential criminals? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean Dubé:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member from Newfoundland 
does not seem to be aware of the criminals walking the streets of 
Canada.  They are probably walking the streets of Newfoundland 
and affecting children there. That is why identifying these 
individuals at first contact is of prime importance.  In such a 
large country as Canada it is hard to keep track of every single 
person but we must at least make some attempt to be familiar with 
those coming in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The recommendation passed unopposed at committee.  Members were 
supportive that it be included in the bill.  Our party was very 
disappointed that the minister did not see fit to include the 
fingerprint and photograph recommendation in Bill C-31.  It is 
unbelievable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We later learned that fingerprinting and taking pictures of 
people would be carried out through departmental regulations. 
Fingerprints and photographs must be provided for in the new 
bill.  It must be law.  We should not allow such an important 
provision, unopposed by the standing committee, to be carried out 
only at the whim of immigration officials. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our party's second proposal at committee involved safe third 
countries.  A safe third country is one which a potential refugee 
to Canada has passed through on his or her way to Canada.  Safe 
third country provisions would be an efficient and fair means to 
deal with undocumented refugee claimants. These individuals would 
have a safe haven in a safe third country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The thinking behind the safe third country provision is that it 
is mutually beneficial.  Most important, the refugee claimants 
are given a safe haven in the country they pass through on their 
way to Canada.  Second, Canada is able to control its borders 
from undocumented arrivals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are pleased that Bill C-31 makes a provision for safe third 
country negotiations in section 95.  The government is willing to 
pursue the idea of safe third country provisions, but why has it 
not taken action?  Over the past seven years the Liberals have 
only negotiated safe third country provisions with one country, 
the United States.  Negotiations must be expanded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Progressive Conservative Party's 1997 election platform 
spelled out our commitment to end patronage appointments to the 
Immigration and Refugee Board.  In keeping with good Liberal 
tradition, in part 4, clause 150(1)(a) states in black and white 
that members of the IRB will be appointed by the governor in 
council.  No means ensuring meritorious appointments are outlined 
in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Numerous witnesses at the committee, including the Canadian 
Council for Refugees and the Canadian Bar Association, as well as 
our party have called on the government to end patronage 
appointments. 
The government again has cast aside this recommendation in favour 
of its own partisan interest.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is now almost one month since the auditor general released a 
scathing report on Citizenship and Immigration Canada.  Chronic 
problems exist therein, problems the Liberal government has 
attempted to solve.  Even worse, these are problems the auditor 
general has discussed before.  Allow me to explain these serious 
issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All newcomers to Canada must pass a medical to protect Canadian 
society from the risk of disease.  Criteria for medical tests are 
less than satisfactory and have been the standard for an 
unacceptable 40 years.  No tests exist for new diseases like HIV 
and hepatitis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, physicians do not determine medical admissibility; 
visa officers do.  Approved doctors carry out examinations and 
forward their advice to the officers.  What new diseases are 
routinely transported to Canada?  The auditor general underlined 
deficiencies in medical examinations 10 years ago.  How can the 
government delay?   This was going on 10 years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The immigration bill does not provide guarantees the health of 
Canadians will be protected any time soon.  Medicals and health 
provisions are given very little space in Bill C-31.  We are not 
satisfied that sufficient preventive measures are taken in the 
new bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When will the criteria for medical admissibility be updated? 
What health conditions does the minister consider to be dangerous 
to public health?   What diseases will excessively burden the 
health care system?  These are only a few of the many questions 
Citizenship and Immigration Canada failed to address in the new 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general also addressed the department's computer 
systems.  Simply put, the systems are inadequate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay:</B>   Have you read this speech? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean Dubé:</B>  Mr. Speaker, once again I see that the few 
members there are on the other side are very interested in what I 
have to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The systems are outdated and are not integrated.  Are these the 
kind of computer systems that aid in determining medical and 
criminal admissibility to Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has announced a new global case management system 
which she says will cost $200 million.  The department has 
received $579 million in new funding but $209 million has been 
spent.  This new funding will be eaten up very quickly.  Where 
does the minister expect to find all the extra funding that will 
be required for the case management system and the increased 
administration wrought by Bill C-31? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More frightening is that no one will ever know how many 
criminals are admitted to Canada.  Foreign police records may not 
be up to date or reliable.  Some countries cannot provide the 
information due to internal turmoil.  The department's solution 
to this is simply to not require police certificates from 40 
countries.  This is a preposterous means to deal with criminal 
admissibility to Canada.  That is not all.  In 1998 over 1,300 
ministerial permits were issued to people with criminal 
convictions.  What kinds of people are routinely coming to this 
country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Stiffer fines and longer jail terms may help in keeping 
criminals out of Canada but we need to start at the source.  We 
need to have better detection strategies in place abroad to 
screen criminals.  Simply not requiring certificates from 
unreliable countries does not take care of the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our party hopes the minister sees fit to take an introverted 
look at her department and fix it on the inside.  We hope the new 
global case management system will soon be up and running.

in-Canada processing.  Spouses, students and temporary workers 
will now be able to apply for permanent residency from right here 
in Canada.

<P><A NAME="LINK191"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo—Cowichan, Canadian Alliance):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to speak to Bill C-31, an act respecting 
immigration to Canada and the granting of refugee protection to 
persons who are displaced, persecuted or in danger.  In 
addressing the bill it is pertinent that we be aware of the 
immigration status of all of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us remember that the vast majority of all our families came 
from somewhere else, be it recently or many generations ago. 
Whether through persecution in a foreign country, economic 
deprivation, the fleeing of a wartorn nation or the search for a 
better life, most if not all families represented here can point 
to a time when they were not Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My Canadian Alliance colleagues and I agree that immigrants 
arriving in Canada today have come for the same reasons that our 
ancestors did in the past.  They aspire to a better life for 
their families and for themselves.  They seek a peaceful way of 
life that will allow them to practise their faith without the 
fear of persecution.  They do not want their children to grow up 
with the firsthand knowledge of war or, worse, the loss of a 
child due to war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can find no fault in any of those reasons to come to Canada, 
but unfortunately there are those who want to take advantage of 
our way of life.  There are those who would pay no regard to the 
laws of Canada.  These are people like the Snake Heads who have 
no regard for human life and only see the opportunity to make 
illegal profit through the smuggling of human cargo.  What a sad 
commentary on the state of mankind that is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issues surrounding immigration and refugees have been around 
for a long time.  Because of their heritage most Canadians want 
to welcome new immigrants to Canada.  However they also want to 
be sure that those who apply for immigration status meet the 
minimum criteria and that those who do not meet those set 
criteria are not entitled to the same rights as Canadian 
citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe I can unequivocally state that we would all welcome 
immigrants and genuine refugees to our country.  I believe I can 
further state that we all believe there should be a set of rules 
for everyone to follow when implementing and regulating 
immigration and refugee policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The biggest concern I have is that all the legislation in the 
world will not resolve the problems we see in the present 
legislation or the proposed law before us.  Legislation without 
the ability to enforce the regulations means virtually nothing. 
We can write, debate and proclaim endless laws on countless 
pieces of paper, but without the legal enforcement, without the 
ability to ensure that the laws are upheld, the laws are not 
worth the piece of paper they are written on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately that is what I see with most of this new 
legislation.  We are not even able to enforce our current 
immigration laws.  How on earth will we be able to enforce new 
ones without adding the necessary strength, power and ability to 
these newly proposed laws?  Unfortunately I do not see new 
enforcement guidelines written into the new legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be realistic for a moment.  Higher maximum penalties for 
human trafficking will have no effect on the flow of illegal 
immigrants to Canada.  The real organizers, the real kingpins 
behind the smuggling of humans, have no regard for the laws of 
Canada.  They operate outside Canada and have no plans to attend 
court dates in Canada. 
The ones who are in Canada attempt to live and operate outside 
the laws by which we abide.  They are seldom caught and rarely 
convicted for their crimes.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>High fines may seem like a deterrent, but the maximum fines 
under the old immigration act have never been applied. Therefore, 
why should anyone here believe that the new fines would be any 
more of a deterrent?  It simply will not happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>About one year ago Canadians witnessed boatloads of Chinese 
migrants entering Canada illegally.  They made a horrendous 
journey under appalling conditions.  The conditions under which 
some of them lived would not meet the same humanitarian and 
social structures we enjoy in Canada.  Some died and others 
suffered serious illnesses while en route. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my understanding that most of those who made it to Canada 
are still in detention awaiting their hearings.  It has been 
seven to ten months since some of these people arrived on our 
shores. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The future does not look any brighter.  Reality says that it may 
be as much as another two years before the process is complete. 
When I look to the new legislation before us, a reasonable 
expectation would be that this length of time would be 
significantly reduced.  Unfortunately all I can see is more 
disappointing news. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new legislation appears to do nothing to mitigate this 
lengthy waiting time.  This was one of the most obvious problems 
in the old legislation, and it has not been resolved in the new 
proposed law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no doubt that Canada needs to strengthen its 
immigration laws to seriously address this type of crisis.  This 
is necessary not only for our own protection but also to deter 
those who stand to gain monetarily from the business of smuggling 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We simply must take a firm stand and send a message to the world 
that Canada is not a haven for illegal immigrants and not an easy 
target for people smugglers.  Those who promote such activities 
should be subject to severe penalties without exception.  The 
penalties must be severe enough to thwart the usury and extortion 
currently being forced by the people smugglers.  Our laws should 
reflect compassion for true refugees, but they should also 
encompass legislation to expedite the process of deporting 
illegal immigrants and penalize the people smugglers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the boat crisis last summer I received a number of calls 
from Canadians in my riding who were outraged with the federal 
government's inaction on the question of illegal immigration. 
This inaction drew the ire of all Canadians right across Canada. 
Constituents have told me that they believe the federal 
government is failing them and their families by putting these 
illegal migrants ahead of the needs of ordinary Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the most interesting things I found was that the ones who 
voiced their opinions most strongly were in fact recent 
immigrants themselves.  To them the situation was very clear. 
They had applied and waited their turn to come to Canada.  In 
many cases they wanted to sponsor family members to join them in 
Canada.  Their anger was that while they were attempting to abide 
by the law, others were abusing the law in being able to stay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By not addressing this issue, legal immigrants are forced to the 
back of the immigration process.  What they really want to do is 
be reunited with family members.  Are we not then creating a 
double standard? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the crisis last summer the Royal Canadian Mounted Police 
on Vancouver Island told me that their Vancouver Island forces 
were drastically reduced as members had been called upon to guard 
the most recent illegal migrants at the Esquimalt naval base. 
This calls into question the level of efficiency for both law 
enforcement and case development that the RCMP is able to provide 
for the residents of Vancouver Island.  This is just one problem 
which highlights how unprepared we are for this ever increasing 
wave of humanity that will come to our shores either legally or 
illegally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This issue has been ongoing for far too long.  These are the 
issues which I believe need to be fully addressed under this 
legislation.  First, full charter rights should not be available 
to individuals until the immigration board has accepted them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, we should set new stringent penalties for those who deal 
in the smuggling of humans.  This is a serious crime and needs to 
be dealt with in the most serious manner possible.  International 
agreements should be used to pursue and convict Snake Heads and 
others like them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, we should ensure that full security and health checks are 
completed on each person wishing to enter Canada.  Canada's 
citizens demand to be safe from undue risks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, perhaps the most important issue is that of enforcement. 
We cannot expect our laws to be upheld if we do not have 
sufficient personnel and real regulations in effect to support 
them. 
Words alone will not stop Snake Heads from dealing in human 
cargo.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding office immigration is one of the top two issues 
with which my staff deals.  The other issue is taxation and the 
manner in which Revenue Canada, now called the Canada Customs and 
Revenue Agency, deals with people.  It is interesting that in 
both these matters a lack of humanitarian treatment appears to be 
the common factor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should like to take a few moments to describe several 
immigration cases with which I have been dealing over the past 
several months.  My colleague from Lakeland stated that he was 
certain that all members of the House had encountered the 
inadequacies of the current immigration legislation, and he is 
absolutely correct. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just listen to some of the events that have taken place of which 
I have become aware as a member of parliament.  In one case a 
lady in my riding invited a friend from China to visit her in 
1996.  Today that friend has still not been able to visit Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the meantime the Chinese applicant has been turned down for 
seemingly irrelevant reasons.  The Canadian letter writer has 
chronic lymphatic leukemia and was given the possibility of 
living for five years.  Her five years are up now.  Her health 
has been relatively good, but we all know that there are no 
guarantees in this life.  Offers of bonds have been made and 
rejected.  The Chinese applicant is not looking for a job and she 
is not looking to immigrate to Canada.  She simply has a Canadian 
friend who would like to be able to share a Canadian experience 
with her. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Letters to the minister of immigration have not resulted in any 
further positive results.  From what I have been able to 
determine in this case, individual bureaucrats have thwarted the 
plight of one potential visitor from China to this great land of 
ours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In another situation I have worked with an individual who has 
been waiting for over four years to receive landed status in 
Canada.  He is currently living here and would like to upgrade 
his skills.  However he is not able to do this until he receives 
his landed status. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all expect a reasonable length of time to process 
applications, but four years seems to be an abnormally long 
period of time.  In the meantime no full answers are forthcoming 
from either the minister of immigration or the Canadian Security 
Intelligence Service.  We ask the question why. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In another case a Canadian citizens married a Filipino.  Through 
inquiry after inquiry no full answers were received.  When visas 
were promised, applications were received.  When time lines were 
committed to, they were broken in short order.  After a series of 
pages of requests, letters and faxes I am pleased to report that 
this couple will finally be together.  It is unthinkable that 
they were forced to endure this process and to live apart for 
many years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the most heart wrenching and immediate saga is in my 
riding of Nanaimo—Cowichan.  Mrs. Jaswant Sekhon had six 
children.  Mrs. Sekhon was plagued by ill health, was on dialysis 
and was not expected to live for much longer.  Her last child, a 
son, Santokh Sekhon, was still living in Punjab, India.  The two 
of them had not seen each other in nine years.  For a year he 
applied to visit his mother for a one week period.  Yet 
Immigration Canada would not allow the married father of two to 
visit Canada initially on the grounds that he would not leave. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last fall Mrs. Sekhon became too ill to travel.  Unfortunately 
the mother and son were never able to see each other again.  Mrs. 
Sekhon died of a heart attack on March 12 and her wish to see her 
son in life was never fulfilled due to Immigration Canada's 
denial. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In dying, Mrs. Sekhon wanted her son to reunite with the family, 
be able to grieve and say goodbye to her in her death.  I 
contacted Immigration Canada asking for them to review this file 
to no avail.  The reason given to Mrs. Sekhon was that the 
official was not satisfied he could support himself while in 
Canada.  Mr. Sekhon only asked to be in Canada for one week. Does 
this sound like an unreasonable request?  It certainly does not 
to me.  Yet the answer was certainly unreasonable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us remember that all the family members except for one are 
Canadian citizens.  They have lived as productive participants in 
Canada for 10 years.  No family should have to endure the agony 
that this family has gone through because of our immigration 
system.  Yet this is not the only family to endure this type of 
hardship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thankfully there is a somewhat happier ending to this story. 
Nine days after his mother passed away, Mr. Sekhon received his 
visa authorization to attend his mother's funeral. Imagine what 
those nine days must have been like.  What a horrifying thought, 
what a tragic thing.

imposed upon them by a government ministry, an immigration 
bureaucracy that appears to be uncaring and unable to resolve 
problems.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This government is responsible for creating, causing and 
maintaining the shortcomings that are now before us in 
immigration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that every member of the House, even government 
members, would echo similar kinds of cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This department needlessly and negatively impacts countless 
lives and families.  We only need to read in the papers of 
concern and allegations of corruption at various levels.  This 
concerns not just illegal migrants, but also visa and counsellor 
services abroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must raise the question of regulations again.  From what I 
have seen in the proposed legislation, the situations that I have 
brought before the House would not be resolved.  I believe that 
Canadians should receive more than this when members of 
parliament debate legislation.  Unfortunately, they have come to 
expect even less with empty words and broken promises.  We have 
seen the lack of true public consultation and true problem 
solving in many prior bills, and this bill is no exception. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not new.  The 1990 auditor general's report identified 
serious problems within the immigration department.  Here we are, 
10 years later, and they have still not been addressed.  Overseas 
offices are grossly overtasked, resulting in waiting times of up 
to three years for approval. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Immigration plays an important role for Canada today, but under 
the present legislation and the present government what we see is 
really a department in chaos.  The proposed legislation will not 
resolve the big issues before us.  Bill C-31 requires a serious 
overhaul and the regulations must been seen in full in order to 
address the real immigration issues before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of these outstanding issues and others that other of my 
hon. colleagues in the House have mentioned, I am not able to 
support this bill unless it is extensively amended. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> It is my duty, pursuant 
to Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the questions to 
be raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows: the 
hon. member for Acadie—Bathurst, Training; the hon. member for 
Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, Human 
Resources Development.

<P><A NAME="LINK192"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, last year Canada had to deal with migrant boats.  That 
is something the hon. member made reference to in his speech.  I 
understand that now the snake heads are charging $60,000 per 
head, a marked increase from last year, which indicates that they 
feel as though the Canadian government has not dealt with the 
situation.  The Canadian government has sent the wrong signals to 
the snake heads and the people smugglers and, as a result, the 
demands are even higher and the snake heads charge even higher 
amounts of money per person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the hon. member think of the dollar figure rising 
because of the lack of action by this government?  In the 
minister's responses to questions in the House, she seems to be 
claiming that basically since they have not seen any boats quite 
just yet there really is not a problem.  She says there is no way 
we can anticipate that there will be problems on the coast of 
British Columbia this summer with regard to migrant boats.  I 
would like the hon. member to address that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reed Elley:</B>  Mr. Speaker, having lived on the coast last 
summer I experienced firsthand what happened and the way it was 
handled by the government, or the inability of the government to 
handle the situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question that the snake heads and others who are 
getting rich on this kind of activity would see Canada as an easy 
target.  They see that people get in and are helped by our 
government.  They become dependent upon our social welfare system 
and our health system.  They are taken care of from that 
standpoint and not simply turned away and sent back.  Because of 
this they will, of course, get more business. 
It gives them the opportunity to say to people in China and other 
places “This works.  Line up.  We will take your money and we 
will be glad to get you to Canada because when you get there they 
will take care of you really well”.

<A HREF="#LINKT78"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think we have a problem with taking care of people, but 
this encourages this kind of thing and allows us to be seen in 
the sort of underworld international community as an easy mark. 
It is no wonder the price has gone up and the snake heads make 
more money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other point the member mentioned was a very famous quote 
that was attributed to the Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration during the time the boats were coming over.  It 
seemed to be a very simplistic answer to the whole situation: 
“Pretty soon we will have the storm season upon us, winter will 
be upon us and that will take care of the waves of boats that are 
coming over”.  If that is the way the Minister of Citizenship 
and Immigration, who is supposed to be a very responsible person 
in the Government of Canada, views the situation and if that is 
the kind of answer she has to deal with it, then it is no wonder 
we are in serious trouble. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The storms are getting less frequent on the coast.  There is 
good weather coming to Vancouver Island and I suspect that this 
will be repeated again, and it will probably be even greater than 
it was last year.  I do not think this legislation will prepare 
us for that and it will be even worse.  We will have to see what 
happens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders:</B>  Mr. Speaker, just to follow up on that 
question, my understanding is that the People's Liberation Army 
of the People's Republic of China, otherwise the communist 
tyranny that is the Chinese mainland government, is directly 
involved in much of this snake head and people smuggling 
operation and that Canada is seen as a weak link in the military 
alliance that makes up Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the United 
States and Great Britain.  ANZUS, I believe, is the title of 
that organization.  The People's Liberation Army and the snake 
heads are in a sense doing some of these things to raise funds so 
they can infiltrate the military network known as ANZUS to be 
able to access information which they feel they cannot get through 
the other partners of that military alliance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reed Elley:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the government's answer to 
an allegation like that was to send the minister and a couple of 
Liberal members to China to negotiate with the government.  You 
and I were not privy to that negotiation.  We do not know what 
went on, but the government would have us believe, of course, 
that it has it all under control.  We will see. 
<P><A NAME="LINK193"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, listening to the member made me think of my riding, 
which has a high percentage of refugee claimants.  Unfortunately, 
a high percentage of them turn out to be criminal refugee 
claimants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people simply arrive at our borders to claim refugee 
status and then are released into society.  However, since almost 
all of them have to change planes in Frankfurt, Heathrow or Miami 
to get here, there has always been a question in my mind that 
they are not legitimate refugees by virtue of the fact that they 
did not claim in the first safe country they reached.  I wonder 
if the critic could comment on the ways in which we could solve 
that problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reed Elley:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is very clear, as my hon. 
colleague has pointed out, that there are many illegal immigrants 
who come into this country through airports, certainly far more 
than come in through the boat route.  There were somewhere in the 
neighbourhood of 25,000 illegal immigrants who came to the 
country last year.  Probably 98% of them came in through 
airports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How do they get in?  How do they maintain that they are legal 
immigrants when they do not declare their intentions in the 
country of origin? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1640"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT79"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happens, I am sure, even though I have never been on a 
plane to see this happen, is that they simply take their identity 
cards and flush them down the toilet.  By the time they get here 
they can say that they have no record of who they are, that they 
are displaced people who want to claim refugee status. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When those people come to these shores we should have something 
in place immediately to determine very quickly whether they are 
legal immigrants.  If they are not, then they should simply be 
sent back to the country of origin and from there go through the 
proper procedures to make sure they enter this country in the 
right way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we have this scenario 
whereby people would like to come to this country.  Of course we 
always wonder whether it is for legitimate purposes in 
circumstances where they would not qualify as independent class 
immigrants, et cetera. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does the hon. member feel about having bonds posted, for 
whatever amount, maybe $10,000 or more?  I have heard people 
suggest as high as $50,000.  Those bonds would be forfeited if 
they did not return to their country and if they violated the 
promise they gave to Canadian officials. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reed Elley:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think that is a very 
interesting suggestion.  I am just wondering if the government 
has ever taken it under consideration.  I think we need to have 
all of the good wisdom and suggestions from members on both sides 
of the House.  We should pool our resources to come up with the 
very best, and this may be one of the solutions. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK194"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am very happy to take part in the debate on Bill C-31 to amend 
the Immigration Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That bill was long overdue to say the least. Members will 
remember that the Bloc requested a reform of the Immigration Act 
several times in the House. If my information is correct, the 
Immigration Act has been amended about 20 times in the past. I 
think it was high time we had an overall view of immigration, and 
I congratulate the minister on her initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, the bill is far from perfect and I know that we can 
count on the courage and determination of the young member for 
Rosemont to work toward that aim in committee. We will even be 
able to count on the opposition, the Bloc Quebecois, to make the 
bill as perfect as can be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Immigration is not an insignificant factor in the life of 
countries like Canada or Quebec. Let us just think that Canada 
and Quebec have always been extremely open to immigration. My 
colleague will understand if I say that Quebec has all it needs 
to be a country, but I realize that, for the time being, very 
large parts of the immigration policy, and especially its 
administrative aspects, are under federal jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the post-war years up until now, Canada has accepted an 
average of 150,000 to 250,000 immigrants. There are four major 
countries across the world that are what we would called 
countries of immigration. I am talking of course about Canada, 
the United States, Australia and New Zealand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at the effort these countries have put into their 
immigration policy and we compare it with what Quebec is doing 
in that area, we see that Quebec is comparing well with the 
United States on a per capita basis.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Minister Boisclair, now the Minister of Social Solidarity, was 
the Minister of Relations with the Citizens and Immigration 
three years ago, when he issued a policy statement on 
immigration that revealed that we accept roughly the equivalent 
of 0.8% of our population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a considerable effort. Quebec accepts between 50,000 and 
65,000 immigrants every year. This raises questions about 
integration policies, because it is important to have a generous 
immigration policy, especially since Quebec and Canada, like 
many countries on this side of the hemisphere, are societies 
that do not carry the seeds of their natural renewal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For nearly 15 years, if not 20 years, the natural growth of our 
population has not been enough to ensure us of the new 
generations. It would take a fertility rate of 2.2% instead of 
the current 1.8%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I invite all my colleagues—I will try to do my share directly or 
indirectly—to reflect on the importance for a society to 
reproduce itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an important issue that was hotly debated in the past and 
which is far from resolved. Some believe we need tax incentives. 
Others say we need not only tax incentives, but also a real 
family policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having children is something that one plans for in one's life. 
Take for example our colleague from Longueuil, whose son is now 
20 months old. 
She planned to have a child. It may not change the world, but it 
definitely structures your life. I do not want to linger over 
biographical details, which could lead us to release information 
which is protected, so to speak. I am talking about the 
information, not the partner of our colleague from Longueuil. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Historically, like other societies, Quebec has been quite open 
and generous when it comes to immigration policies. It is a 
basic component of our society. However, our fellow citizens 
must realize that, unfortunately, because of its current 
constitutional status, Quebec does not have control over all the 
levers that would allow it to have a real immigration policy of 
its own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know how immigration works. 
Under the act, every year in the month of October, and I 
understand this requirement will not be modified, the Minister 
of Citizenship and Immigration releases a public report on the 
number of immigrants the country will be receiving. Their number 
is between 200,000 and 250,000. These newcomers, who will 
ultimately become Canadian citizens, are divided into three main 
categories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are, of course, those who immigrate for humanitarian 
considerations. These people are persecuted in their own 
country. There is reason to fear for their bodily security. 
Either because of their religious or political beliefs or 
because of their economic distress, they have to leave their 
country and claim asylum. I will come back to this category. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1650"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT81"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are those who come to Canada and Quebec to join their 
family. These cases are in the category of sponsoring. Their 
brothers or sisters, their mother or father, their sons or 
daughters who came here before them as to sponsor a member of 
their family. This is the family reunification category. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also a more economic type of immigration. Governments 
in Canada, Quebec, Germany, France and other countries have been 
seduced by economic immigration in recent years. They have tried 
to establish a link between the employability profile of people 
choosing a country of adoption and the resulting immigration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This economic immigration category can include independent 
workers and investors. Some people come to Canada or to Quebec 
because they want to invest money, to set up businesses and to 
create jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There again, members know about the handicap created by Quebec's 
constitutional status. I will digress for a moment to recall with 
pleasure that, during the 14th convention of the Parti Quebecois 
held last weekend in Montreal, the Premier of Quebec pointed out 
that Quebec sovereignty, which should mobilize all Quebecers in 
the months to come, will be on the constitutional and political 
agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason we want to become a country must be reflected in the 
current debate because, again, Quebec does not have full control 
over its immigration policy. In saying that, I say that Quebec 
has nothing to say as to how many new immigrants will come to its 
territory and what the entry procedures will be, but in the end, 
Quebec has a complete and clear responsibility as to their 
integration. Members will understand the gap between the 
objectives that Quebec wants to pursue and the means at its 
disposal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the reasons we want to achieve sovereignty is of course 
because we want control over immigration, like France, Germany, 
United States, Japan and all the great powers of the world. 
Speaking of great powers, I cannot avoid mentioning that a 
sovereign Quebec would be the fifteen economic power on this 
planet. If we look at the countries that have the means to become 
sovereign, Quebecers can be fully confident in their destiny and 
in their capacity to control their future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would not want to digress too much from the subject at hand. 
We support the principle of the bill. We acknowledge that the 
Immigration Act and the Citizenship Act were in need of a 
comprehensive reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues from Louis-Hébert, Longueuil and Drummond—this makes 
me the only man in this House to be surrounded with women—will 
recall that I was the immigration critic for about two years. I 
have pleasant memories of those days. Back then, we did not have 
a plethora of issues, but everything will not be settled by this 
bill. It was a nice experience meeting people who had chosen 
Quebec as their home. I also had the opportunity to witness the 
difficulties they were experiencing with a piece of legislation 
that was badly outdated in many ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We endorse the bill, and I will indicate which points we 
consider positive. The first one is obviously the consolidation 
in a single structure of the refugee status determination 
process and of the adjudication process. This is a positive 
goal. The government deserves our congratulations for this. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1655"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT82"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The refugee status determination process was for many years a 
real nightmare for successive governments, as much under Prime 
Minister Mulroney—whose party is now represented by just a few 
members in the House, but who knows what the future may have in 
store—as under the current Prime Minister. The Immigration and 
Refugee Board of Canada is the most important administrative 
tribunal in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It may easily take an average of two years or two and a half 
years between the moment when a refugee sets foot in Canada and 
meets a Canadian official, and when a decision on his refugee 
status is made. 
Members will understand that all of this is not negligible as far 
as the costs to society are concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to digress to say that 90% of all claims for asylum 
claims and political refugee status concern three major Canadian 
cities, Vancouver, Toronto and Montreal. Slowly, a kind of pocket 
is beginning to emerge in Winnipeg, but the three big immigration 
centres are, of course, Vancouver, Toronto and Montreal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the inefficiency of the operating procedures of the 
Immigration and the Refugee Board of Canada costs the Quebec 
treasury on average between $70 million and $90 million. So, it 
is important to have an act that we will allow processing of 
these files as diligently as possible. We—myself in 
particular—also welcome the inclusion in the bill of the 
recognition of same sex partners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members will recall that, at the time of the introduction 
of Bill C-23 we considered recently—and allow me again to thank 
all my hon. colleagues who supported this bill willingly and 
enthusiastically—we were told “We cannot recognize same sex 
partners in this omnibus bill because, in the area of 
immigration, they cannot be recognized in the same way that they 
are in the Income Tax Act or the Criminal Code”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we can all see, a new person has taken over the chair. In 
spite of all the appearances of continuity, each of these 
persons has his or her own style. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I myself had concluded that it was not desirable, in the bill 
under consideration, to recognise same sex partners. Why? The 
question is worth asking and I am convinced that my colleagues 
are itching to ask. Well, here I go. Why was it not desirable, 
immigration wise, to recognise same sex partners? The answer is 
that, two people cannot establish that they are living in a same 
sex relationship in the same way, in Canada and abroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about recognizing same sex partners, a certain 
number of factors are involved: cohabitation, recognition as a 
couple and mutual support. 
Obviously, if one's partner lives in Cuba and one is living in 
Montreal, the cohabitation criteria does not apply. Recognition 
as a couple begins to be a bit remote and mutual support is of 
course a little more of a monthly thing instead than a daily 
thing. Therefore, we needed evidence that was different from 
what we usually get. These are the positive aspects of the bill. 
However, I repeat, the bill is far from complete. It can be 
greatly improved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third positive aspect worth mentioning is the series of very 
tough measures concerning people trafficking and smugglers who 
bring into Canada people who do not deserve the status they 
claim.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The former Minister of Immigration and member for 
Westmount—Ville-Marie said on numerous occasions in the past that 
one of things that characterizes the 21st century is the 
trafficking in human beings.  There is not just a trade in goods 
and in capital.  There is an illegal trade in people, an 
underworld black market.  This forces us to be extremely 
vigilant and severe toward those who are involved in trading 
human beings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore wish to focus attention on the clause of this bill 
that will provide very heavy punishment for those involved in 
this trade.  The bill puts all the odds on the side of the law 
for dismantling these trafficking networks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So much for the positive aspects of the bill. 
There are some a bit less positive, which is why the Bloc 
Quebecois will be bringing in some amendments, via the charming 
and dynamic member for Rosemont. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I personally worked on this issue when I was immigration critic. 
Obviously, there is the whole issue of the 8, 9 and 10 year-olds 
being brought into Canada by the traffickers.  They are detained 
far too long in prison.  This approach is contrary to the 
international conventions of which Canada itself is a signatory. 
I will come back to this point at a later time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since I have only one minute left, I will now conclude, although 
I have the impression that I have barely touched on everything I 
wanted to say.  The question of detaining young people is a 
problem for us.  The lack of explicit reference in the bill to 
Canada's international obligations—and by this I am of course 
thinking of the conventions on refugees, on torture and on the 
rights of the child—is also problematical to us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also wish to state that we have a problem with the added 
powers assigned to immigration officers and the potential 
discretionary nature of some of the decisions to be reached. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I trust the government will be open to the amendments by the 
Bloc Quebecois.  We will be bringing our customary serious 
approach to the work in committee.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>IMMIGRATION AND REFUGEE PROTECTION ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK202">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-31, an 
act respecting immigration to Canada and the granting of refugee 
protection to persons who are displaced, persecuted or in danger, 
be read the second time and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK203"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak to Bill C-31, the immigration 
and refugee protection act.  This is a very important bill for 
Canada.  It has been in the making for a long time.  We are 
pleased to see that it has been presented because it gives us an 
opportunity to talk about immigration and its impact on Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who are we talking about?  We are talking about people.  The 
government has released the total number of refugees into the 
country.  When some 187,000 immigrants are coming into Canada it 
is important to recognize what is happening. 
They are human beings.  These are people who have needs.  Like 
any other issue that deals with human beings it has an emotional 
aspect.  It deals with relationships, with aspirations and all 
such things.

<A HREF="#LINKT84"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We recognize what is happening.  We have come to the very sad 
conclusion that our immigration system is falling down rapidly. 
More and more people are genuinely coming into the country.  They 
have made the effort to come to our country but are facing 
problems.  They get discouraged and walk away.  At the end of the 
day Canada is the loser when this happens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general reported on the immigration department. What 
do we see?  We see what every MP knows, I would presume. There is 
something seriously wrong with our immigration system.  As a 
matter of fact I have a full time staff, as do other MPs, trying 
to solve the immigration mess.  It creates horror stories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Old ladies have come to me crying because our system, despite 
what the government says, is inconsistent and allows people to 
abuse it.  It is inconsistent in terms of what is going on in the 
country.  It creates doubt among immigrants and upsets Canadians 
when they see that the system is subject to so much abuse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem as far as I am concerned is that the government has 
made a habit of listening to self-interest groups.  In this case 
I am talking about immigration consultants and immigration 
lawyers who try to hijack the agenda because it is in their 
interest.  If the system is not functioning they are the 
beneficiaries, and the government agrees to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about consultants.  Anyone can be a consultant in 
this country.  They just have to open up an office and say they 
are immigration consultants.  Do they know about immigration 
rules?  No.  All they care about is money.  This is happening in 
my own riding.  Immigration consultants take money and give wrong 
advice to immigrants or to refugees, resulting in them coming to 
us to solve this mess. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Our staffs are better consultants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai:</B>  My colleague is absolutely right. Yes, 
they are experts.  They could become immigration consultants and 
do a better job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not putting down all immigration lawyers.  There is 
definitely a need for consultation, but the government has made a 
habit of listening to these people and then trying to draft 
legislation which is weak and leaves many loopholes.  Who takes 
advantage of those loopholes?  We all know that.  All we have to 
do is look at the stories in the newspapers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Chinese boatloads came here because of a loophole in the system 
created by the government.  Everywhere around the world it is 
becoming quite clear that the loopholes existing in Canada are 
numerous, which has created human smuggling that plays with 
people's lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister of immigration has said that she would be very 
tough on human smugglers.  The bottom line is that a market was 
created for human smugglers because of our lax law. Our lax law 
has given them a market of which they are taking advantage and 
playing with people's lives.

<A HREF="#LINKT85"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we had a tighter or a speedier law, or if we had a procedure 
with which we could address these things very quickly and 
rapidly, would the human smugglers have a market?  No, they would 
not.  We would do people a favour if we had a clear-cut, concise 
and fast processing system.  We would do a favour for people who 
cross the oceans and threaten their own lives so that human 
smugglers and drug abusers can take advantage of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me talk about what is wrong with the current immigration 
system.  The auditor general said it was mismanaged and 
backlogged.  We do not keep track of what is going on, and that 
is absolutely true.  From the experience in my office I can say 
that is absolutely true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about spousal applications.  The minister says that 
it takes six months for a spousal application.  I am saying that 
it does not take six months.  It takes over a year and a half 
before Canadians who marry outside Canada can bring their spouses 
into this country.  Yet the government talks about a system which 
it says is fair and will take only six months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People have left this country, lost their status, and want to 
come back with a returning resident permit.  Everything takes 
time, time, time.  From the time I was elected in 1997 until now 
all I have seen is a longer process, and this is for legitimate 
immigrants to Canada.  When we talk to immigration officers and 
our counsellors overseas only one point comes up, that they do 
not have the resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister of immigration says she will bring in 300,000 
people.  She says that is our new target.  We are only at 178,000 
because there are no resources.  Because there are no resources 
immigration officers cannot do their jobs.  Haphazard decisions 
are made.  People fall through the cracks.  People take advantage 
of that and walk into the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any immigration officer will tell us that.  I have visited New 
Delhi.  I have visited Sydney. I have talked to immigration 
officers in Africa, and the simple point is a lack of resources. 
Some say that they want more, but as my colleague said the 
current system should be fixed first before anything else is 
done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give another example.  The immigration department may 
allow people with professional degrees into this country but they 
cannot get jobs.  There is an inconsistency.  What is the point 
of getting professionals to come to the country if they cannot 
work? They cannot work here because we have professional 
associations that do not allow them to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should tell them that we need immigration and that we need 
professional people.  We should ask them how many they can 
accommodate.  Then we should go ahead and do it.  They should 
make arbitrary decisions because they are playing with people's 
lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about visitor visas.  I have to use the minister of 
immigration's offices to get visitor visas approved.  Canada has 
a huge population from every corner of the world.  Naturally they 
have families.  Naturally they have ties outside the country.  It 
is a common sense situation.  They would like their family 
members to come.  There is nothing wrong with that.  A Canadian 
can go to India with no problem, but the poor guy who wants to 
bring someone from India here is denied entry into Canada. 
He is denied entry into Canada because the government says we 
cannot trust him to go back.  We cannot trust him to go back.  We 
do not know whether he will go back based on our past experience.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where did the problem originate?  The problem originates here. 
We allow them to stay here.  We allow them to come to this 
country and make a claim and they can stay here for two and a 
half years.  It takes two and a half years to process a refugee 
claim.  Within two and a half years people can stay in this 
country and not go back.  Where did the problem originate?  The 
problem originates here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a very small number.  It is not a high number but others 
pay the price for it.  Genuine visitors who want to come here pay 
the price for it.  Over three-quarters of my files are people who 
want to come here on visitor visas to attend marriages and 
funerals.  Why can we not look at the facts for those who come 
over here and want to make an application, even if it is a 
refugee claim.  If there was a faster system, all these problems 
would not be there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I am talking of refugees, let us talk about our refugee 
determination system.  Despite the fact that we have an appeal 
process and an IRB that is supposedly an independent one, the 
whole refugee determination system is bogged down.  It takes two 
and a half to three years before a refugee's claim is heard, 
genuine or non-genuine.  He has all that time to do whatever he 
wants to do.  The so-called Honduras drug dealers in Vancouver 
sell drugs.  Why is there not a faster process? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nobody denies that a refugee has the right to flee persecution 
and come to our country.  We are proud of that tradition.  There 
is nothing wrong with that tradition.  That is not the problem. 
The problem is it takes two and a half to three years to process 
a claim. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an individual in my riding who has been here for the 
last three and a half years as a refugee.  The man was actually 
crying in my office and asking me to please tell him what it 
takes, why was he in limbo, why was he in no man's land.  His 
wife and child are overseas.  His wife suffered a heart attack. 
He cannot go back home because he fears being persecuted there. 
He cannot go back home but his wife has had a heart attack.  His 
claim cannot be processed so he cannot bring his wife here.  Why 
are we allowing all this human tragedy to be caught up in the 
bureaucratic mess we have created? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why can we not have a faster process? If we are going to have an 
immigration and refugee policy, then let us implement it the way 
it is supposed to be implemented, not mismanage it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about some of our immigration officers.  It is 
amazing.  I actually tell people that their visas to Canada will 
be approved depending on which side of the bed the immigration 
officer got up.  If he is in a good mood, they are in; if he is 
in a bad mood, they are out. There is no consistency.  I have 
seen similar cases where one said yes and one said no.  Then what 
happens?   It is okay for the immigration officer overseas to say 
no but it throws the Canadian party into an appeal process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The appeal process is expensive in hiring an immigration lawyer 
and going before the IRB.  And we do not know when the IRB will 
hold its hearings.  It could take six or eight months. 
It could take a year and a half for an immigration officer to 
make a decision.  The poor guy has to wait for two years and then 
the immigration officer after assessing it says “Sorry, you do 
not follow this in my view”.  I repeat that it is in his view. I 
agree he should have some view, but there has to be more 
consistency.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have started to hire local officers. Local officers do 
interviews up front to allow people to come here as visitors or 
as immigrants. That is because the government cut the funding. 
They are local personnel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is Canada's desire? What do Canadians feel about how our 
system is run?  I have encountered local immigration officers. We 
write to them and they ignore the missives of members of 
parliament.  I had to write back saying that it is a democracy in 
this country.  The people of Canada speak through their elected 
officials; they do not speak through their bureaucrats.  These 
people do not understand.  They do not know what is Canada's 
desire and who wants to come here.  But these people are making 
decisions and throwing people into an appeal process which costs 
them pain and money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More and more people are coming to my office saying to abandon 
the claim, that they are sick and tired of the whole process. 
This did not happen before, but it is becoming more and more 
common.  The delays are becoming more and more common.  But there 
is no problem for the guys who want to abuse our system.  They do 
it and they do it fast.  They are in the country. This creates 
tension because Canadians hate to see their laws being abused. 
They hate it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had call after call after call when the boat people came here. 
Every member of parliament did. What was the reason behind those 
calls?  That our laws were being abused.  It bothered Canadians 
that our laws were being abused.  It bothered people who had 
applied for family members to come here or people in general who 
wanted to come to Canada.  It bothered everybody, prospective 
immigrants, recently arrived immigrants, Canadians who have been 
here for generations. The bottom line was that the laws were 
being abused. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Have we tightened up the law?  Have we even improved it?  The 
bill begs the question, have we improved anything?  I do not 
think so.  I do not think anything has been improved. We are back 
to the same old system.  I will be back out there listening to 
the cries of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are travellers.  They find new partners around the 
world. There needs to be sincerity.  Immigration officers need to 
understand that Canadians travel.  Sometimes Canadians find 
spouses overseas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary, I go back to the main point that bothers our party, 
the official opposition.  Has the bill cleaned up anything?  Has 
it done anything to fix the old system?  I say to the Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration, please fix the old system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition will keep a strong watch on this.  My 
colleague the immigration critic will be bringing a lot of 
amendments to the committee when we study this bill which will 
give us more opportunity to discuss this important issue. 
<P><A NAME="LINK204"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I have several questions for my colleague, but I will 
limit it to one for now.  If I get a chance I will certainly come 
back and ask another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague brought up the issue of visitors visas. 
What does he think the impact will be on people who apply for 
visitors visas as a result of the change to the Immigration Act 
through this legislation which will allow people to apply for 
permanent residency from within Canada?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In certain select cases such as students who have completed an 
education in a field which is in demand in this country, this may 
make sense.  However, a fairly broad and general change in law 
which would allow people to apply for permanent residency from 
within the country has failed in the past.  It has caused huge 
backlogs which the system cannot handle.  Immigration officials 
know it is happening.  They know that anybody applying for a 
visitors visa may decide he or she wants to stay and will add to 
that backlog, which reflects poorly on them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What impact does the member think this change which will allow 
people to apply within the country will have on people applying 
for visitors visas?  My colleague already expressed a concern 
that the system is not working now and he is right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai:</B>  Mr. Speaker, my hon. colleague is 
right in mentioning there are certain circumstances such as 
students.  He is also right to point the finger at the visitors 
visa issue.  Will the bureaucrats apply the law in such a manner 
that visitors who want to come to Canada will be denied entry? 
How it is going to be interpreted is the biggest question on this 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said in my speech, the immigration officers will interpret 
the law in whatever manner they want.  He is absolutely right. 
This is where the danger lies.  There will be more cases of 
people being denied visitors visas to come into the country. The 
impact on the bureaucrats who will be making the decisions must 
be studied very clearly.  Are they going to deny entry to more 
people?  If they are going to deny entry to more people then what 
is the purpose of this? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague is absolutely right. The impact on visitors visas 
to come into the country is an issue we have to study before we 
think it is good. 
<P><A NAME="LINK205"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I thank my colleague for his comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my constituency of Surrey North, I too have a very high 
caseload, about 80% of which is immigration files.  A large 
number of those tend to deal with the whole visitors visa 
problems.  One of the main problems we see is with people who are 
trying to have relatives come over for a funeral, a wedding or 
for any number of reasons.  Of course, we want our front line 
officers to be vigilant to make sure that people are properly 
screened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have had cases where I suspected the applicants were perfectly 
reasonable but they were denied.  At this end, people have 
actually offered to sign affidavits to put up tens of thousands 
of dollars in bonds.  People who have made the application in the 
country of origin have agreed to put up tens of thousands of 
dollars or the equivalent size bond.  For some reason Immigration 
Canada is loath to accept these bonds and has denied entry to 
these people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does my colleague have any comment on the bond issue?  Should it 
be explored and opened up a bit more? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai:</B>  Mr. Speaker, my colleague underlined a 
very basic point on the issue of bonds.  This issue is 
frustrating to individuals because they cannot get their 
relatives or friends into Canada for whatever reason.  They go to 
extremes and say “Please let them come. I am willing to pay the 
money”.  That is not the most important issue.  The more 
important issue is the process in Canada. 
When a person comes to Canada with a visitor's visa and applies 
for refugee status, if the process were faster we would have less 
refugee claimants applying from overseas.  This would make 
visitor's visas easier to get and would provide open entry for 
immigrants because they would know that they cannot stay here.

the amendment and of the amendment to the amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK209"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney—Victoria, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
we are resuming debate today on a private member's motion that 
was brought forward by the member for Acadie—Bathurst dealing 
with the restoration of unemployment insurance benefits to 
seasonal workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should take 
immediate action to restore employment insurance benefits to 
seasonal workers. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member's riding, like my own and like many ridings in 
Canada, would be considered by the government to be a rural 
riding.  It is interesting to note that in many of these ridings, 
the workers have suffered as a result of the changes to the 
Employment Insurance Act that the government introduced before 
the last election.  Understandably, the workers were upset by 
that and showed their displeasure with the changes by voting 
against the governing party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question would have to be asked:  Has the government learned 
from the voter's verdict on the changes to the unemployment 
insurance system?  One would think that it may have learned 
somewhat of a lesson. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those who watched the Liberal convention that was held some time 
ago heard the Prime Minister, probably to the chagrin of his 
Minister of Finance and certainly to the chagrin of some of his 
cabinet ministers sitting here today, admit that perhaps the 
people were right.  He stopped short of saying that perhaps the 
NDP was right.  We knew all along that the government's changes 
to the EI program were wrong.  The Prime Minister did not want to 
give us too much credit so he, kind of appropriately, went over 
our heads to the sovereign people who sent a message to the 
government, especially those in Atlantic Canada, that the changes 
made them suffer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One would think that the Liberals would welcome the motion from 
the member for Acadie—Bathurst.  It would allow them to vote in 
favour of this motion and admit that they learned their lesson. 
They could say that they are listening to the Prime Minister and 
are prepared to restore the funding to employment insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead, in what is, I would say, a tricky manoeuvre, the 
Liberals moved an amendment.  The amendment to the motion would 
make it read as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should review 
employment insurance benefits for seasonal workers. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not need a review.  The people of Atlantic Canada do not 
need a review.  The people who are seasonal workers in every part 
of this country, whether they are working in the woods in British 
Columbia, in the tourism industry in Alberta or in any industry 
across Canada, do not need another review. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The changes to the unemployment insurance act were imposed by 
the government under former minister Doug Young who is now a 
member of the Canadian Alliance Party, I guess.  A review took 
place in 1995 when a working committee was set up to examine the 
issue of seasonal work and employment insurance.  In terms of the 
Liberal amendment, the review has taken place.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The working group found some interesting statistics and reports. 
First, and this needs to be said, the report found that what is 
seasonal is not the workers.  We refer to seasonal workers, but 
it is the jobs that are seasonal.  The working group also found 
that the needs of that particular group in the labour force were 
largely ignored.  Moreover, it noted that there was a negative 
attitude toward seasonal workers that was emerging in society and 
that the workers themselves were somehow considered responsible 
because of the fact that their jobs were temporary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are certain realities in this country.  We live in a harsh 
climate.  There is certain work that can be done in the summer 
that cannot be done in the winter.  There are tourist seasons 
that are not year round.  It is not the workers who are seasonal. 
It is that in certain parts of the country employment follows 
things that are beyond our control.  One of those factors is 
weather.  Another is where investment falls. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, it is not the workers who say “I think I'll get up in 
May since I've hibernated for the winter and I'll go get a job”. 
They also in the fall do not say “I've had it with work and I'm 
going to sit down”.  These are hardworking people who want work 
but the reality is that in the part of the country where they 
live the work tends to be seasonal in nature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The working group also found that the Liberal government of the 
day warned that changes to unemployment insurance would 
disproportionately affect seasonal workers.  I have already 
commented on that.  It is clear that it did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the working group predicted that the EI reform would 
have a negative impact on women.  We already know that study 
after study has indicated that it is in many cases women who have 
lost their eligibility for employment insurance.  They have paid 
into the fund and have been discriminated against by the changes 
to the employment insurance program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as the amendment goes, while it is perhaps a friendly 
amendment, there is no need for us to study any more.  This to me 
sounds like an election ploy. It is kind of like what the Prime 
Minister said at the convention when he said that we needed to 
review the Employment Insurance Act.  A review can mean anything. 
It can mean that the act will be even more draconian at the end 
of the review, once and if the Liberals lucky enough to get 
another mandate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us have a show of faith here this evening on this member's 
motion.  Let us see members put their votes where their comments 
were at the Liberal convention and let us see them vote in favour 
of this member's motion.  I do not think it will happen.  I would 
be readily surprised if it did, but one never knows.  We have 
been surprised in the House before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me also comment on the value of seasonal work to the 
economy.  People tend to think that seasonal work is perhaps not 
on that high of a plane because it is seasonal in nature. 
However, when we look at it, tourism ranks 12th among the major 
sectors of the economy.  While I am discussing tourism, it is 
important for me to comment a little bit about my own 
constituency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is ironic that we should be debating this motion the day 
after the government invoked closure on Bill C-11, an act by the 
government to take away the jobs of miners in Cape Breton.  What 
is the government's solution to the economic problems in places 
like Cape Breton where it is challenged with helping to develop 
an economy?  It says that tourism is the answer.  The government 
should talk to the women, in particular, who work in the tourism 
industry in my riding in towns like Baddeck and Ingonish.  I know 
my colleague from Bras d'Or—Cape Breton would echo the same 
thoughts for the women who work in the tourism industry in her 
riding, as would all my colleagues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me say that many people in the tourism industry in 
particular, but also in the construction trades, the fishing 
trades, the agriculture industry and the lumber industry rely on 
employment insurance to see them through.  That is only natural. 
They pay into an insurance fund.  It used to be called 
unemployment insurance until the government decided to play word 
games and call it employment insurance.  They pay into that with 
their hard-earned money and surely at the end of the season they 
are entitled to get that money back.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo—Cowichan, Canadian Alliance):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to join in the debate on Motion No. 222 
which reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should take 
immediate action to restore employment insurance benefits to 
seasonal workers. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I note that there has been an amendment by the Liberal member 
for Miramichi and a further subamendment by the member for Bras 
d'Or—Cape Breton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In beginning my participation in the debate, I wish to assure 
hon. members present that although seasonal workers are often 
referred to in speeches on the east coast, I am very familiar 
with the impact of seasonal employment.  My own riding of 
Nanaimo—Cowichan has its share of seasonal workers.  These 
workers are primarily found in three different occupations: 
fishing, tourism and, although members may not believe it, in 
forestry today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we all know, the fishing industry has been particularly hard 
hit on both the east and west coasts.  Declining fish stocks 
brought about by poor management, changing water temperatures, 
cyclical changes and other factors all resulted in a loss of jobs 
for fishermen and the support industries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The forest industry actually is no different.  Due to the poorly 
drafted softwood lumber agreement, the crash in the Japanese 
economy, the glut of newsprint on the worldwide market and the 
slowdown in the number of housing starts all across Canada, many 
forestry workers are faced with seasonal work rather than the 
level of full time employment that they once enjoyed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tourism is fast becoming the number one source of new jobs in 
Canada today.  Indeed, tourism is truly seasonal employment. 
Many cities and towns are doing what they can to build upon and 
expand the resources that they have in their communities, all in 
an effort to draw tourists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have previously spoken in the House about my own home town of 
Chemainus, the little town that did, and the enormous number of 
tourists that arrive every year between May and October, about 
400,000 of them.  The Nanaimo Dive Association is about to sink a 
second artificial reef just outside the harbour.  Why would they 
do that, one may ask.  It is simply because the first artificial 
reef has attracted thousands of divers every year since it was 
sunk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do I talk about these three industries today?  I know that 
seasonal workers are found in each one of these industries.  I 
also know that each one of our ridings has its share of seasonal 
workers.  Whether they dig potatoes in the Fraser Valley, pick 
peaches in the Okanagan Valley, custom seed or combine across the 
Prairies, work in summer camps or vacation lodges in Ontario and 
Quebec or are part of the tourism trade in the maritimes, each 
one of our ridings is certainly affected by seasonal workers. 
This is a very real problem and one that each of us should take 
very seriously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We may have different solutions however.  Most of us can agree 
that there are problems within the system.  It appears to me that 
one of the problem areas is the so-called intensity rule.  As 
hon. members will know, the intensity rule was introduced in the 
1995 Employment Insurance Act and distinguishes between frequent 
and infrequent recipients of EI benefits.  Those who are frequent 
users of EI have their benefits reduced.  While the intention 
appears to have been to discourage the frequent use of EI, I do 
not believe that the intensity rule has really worked in this 
manner.  On this issue I do agree with the government amendment 
that there is a need to review employment insurance benefits for 
seasonal workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately the limits of time in this debate are not 
sufficient to adequately address nor seek solutions to the 
problems that are part of the 1995 Employment Insurance Act. 
Systemic problems require more than a cursory debate in order to 
be resolved.  While I see a need to review and address the 
problems within the EI system, I believe that the wording of the 
original motion will not solve any of the real problems.  Rather, 
it will perpetuate them.

<A HREF="#LINKT92"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In resolving the inadequacies of the EI system there are a 
multitude of issues that must be researched and resolved, issues 
such as how businesses are using or abusing the EI system, the 
rates of benefits for frequent and infrequent users, as well as 
the premiums for businesses that are frequent and infrequent 
employers of seasonal workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I note that the 1998 EI monitoring and assessment report 
produced by the Department of Human Resources Development 
acknowledges that communities with high levels of seasonal 
employment were more likely to have industries that showed 
declining benefit levels.  The concern I have regarding this is 
that the data used in writing the report would appear to have 
been gathered in the time immediately following the 
implementation of the revised 1995 EI act.  I would question what 
has changed since that time.  Is the data all relevant?  Do the 
assumptions and conclusions in that report remain true today? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government clearly hoped that with the implementation of the 
intensity rule the workers would have an incentive to move out of 
seasonal industries and regions.  I question whether the 
rationale of seasonal workers receiving lower benefits has moved 
anyone out of seasonal work altogether.  While some may have 
moved out of seasonal work, no doubt there are others who have 
moved in simply to take their place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why has the implementation of the intensity rule not changed the 
number of seasonal workers?  Simply put, most seasonal workers 
state that they have few employment options outside their 
current seasonal jobs.  According to the 1998 monitoring report, 
the intensity rule did not appear to be an incentive to look for 
non-seasonal work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As part of an intensive review of EI legislation we must begin 
by looking at what was the original intent of employment 
insurance.  If employment insurance was intended to protect 
workers against the risk of temporary, involuntary unemployment, 
we must ask ourselves whether the program is working.  If it is 
not working, what are the options to fix the system?  Should 
companies that hire primarily seasonal workers be assessed higher 
premiums?  Does this place an unfair burden on some businesses 
but not on others? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to seasonal workers, is it not a matter of risk that 
they will be unemployed?  They already know that when they begin. 
Seasonal work clearly has different factors affecting it than 
full time work.  Some of those factors may be due to the size of 
the crop or the length of the season. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be clear in this debate.  I believe that Motion No. 222, 
as originally struck, may prove to stifle any efforts to find 
real solutions in the debate over seasonal EI recipients. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are markets that are and will remain seasonal and they 
should not be unduly penalized.  There are other markets that 
would appear to be taking advantage of the current legislation 
and, of course, this is not right either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Employment insurance should not be used as a wage subsidy 
program.  I understand that the original role of the EI program 
was to be protection against involuntary and temporary job loss. 
There is no question that the EI program has assisted many 
individuals and families and this should not be overlooked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As part of this debate we must note that there are other factors 
to contend with.  The use of excessive EI premiums by the 
government to fill the finance department coffers is 
inappropriate.  I must wonder, if the premiums were not excessive 
and the money left in the pockets of the businesses, could the 
businesses better afford to hire additional workers?  If this 
were the case, would some of the seasonal workers actually have 
the opportunity to become full time employees? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I strongly believe that money left in the pockets of the 
businesses and workers of this country is the wisest investment 
that government could ever make.  Canadians are wise people and 
know when they are being taken advantage of.  Currently they know 
they are being overtaxed.  Businesses and individuals alike are 
not prepared to work under a prohibitive taxation structure.  The 
flaws that we have before us will not be resolved by this one 
motion, but it could be a starting place if we can look at it 
systemically and not just in isolation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the hon. member for his motion and for the opportunity

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski—Mitis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to take part in the third hour of debate on Motion No. 222 
tabled in this House by the hon. member for Acadie—Bathurst and 
seconded by the hon. member for Bras d'Or—Cape Breton. It reads 
as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should take 
immediate action to restore employment insurance benefits to 
seasonal workers. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That motion was later amended by the hon. member for Miramichi, 
seconded by the hon. member for Oak Ridges. 
The amendment does not ask for benefits to be restored, but 
rather for the issue of employment insurance benefits for 
seasonal workers to be reviewed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then the member for Bras d'Or—Cape Breton, seconded by the 
member for Winnipeg Centre, came back with an amendment to the 
amendment asking that the review take place as part of 
country-wide public hearings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should the motion take the form suggested by those who 
participated in the debate and proposed an amendment and an 
amendment to the amendment, it would read as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should take 
immediate action to review, in country-wide public hearings, 
Employment Insurance benefits for seasonal workers. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The seasonal workers issue is a real problem for the people 
affected by this blatant injustice, which completely distorts an 
insurance scheme to which people do not even have the right to 
abstain from contributing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, the government makes it mandatory for every worker and 
employer to contribute to the EI fund from the very first hour 
of work. Everybody contributes in case the employer were to 
decide he or she does not need the worker's services any more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, there are people who have to face unemployment every 
year and at the same time of the year. They are categorized as 
seasonal workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the second world war until the Liberals came to power in 
1993, seasonal workers were sure to get unemployment benefits 
for the whole duration of their seasonal layoff. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the Liberal reform, the government is not providing an 
insurance scheme for the unemployment period but for the 
employment period which has not been changed for seasonal 
workers. The workers are not the ones deciding that their work 
will be seasonal, but rather the local economic structure that 
determines the working conditions in any given region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The lower St. Lawrence—Gaspé—Magdalen Islands region, for example, 
is struggling with the seasonal workers issue, as are our 
colleagues in the maritimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why representatives of the RCM faced with this situation 
submitted to the Minister of Human Resources Development a pilot 
project aimed at trying out new ways of helping seasonal workers 
who, year after year, find themselves in what we call the black 
hole, or spring gap, namely a period of up to 10 weeks where they 
go without a paycheque between the time when their benefits run 
out and when their seasonal job starts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a geographical problem as it is tied to the very 
nature of the economic structure of the area, as I mentioned 
earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is this pilot project that was submitted to the minister 
all about? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government could use section 109 of the current Employment 
Insurance Act and grant a special status to seasonal workers. The 
project could run for three years, as provided under section 110 
of the same act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, the pilot project could cover areas where seasonal 
work is very prevalent, such as the lower St. Lawrence region, 
the Gaspé and the islands. It would allow the government to test 
beforehand changes to the current employment insurance scheme 
regarding seasonal workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned it earlier, a seasonal worker is a worker who 
makes a claim for the current year at approximately the same time 
as the previous year. These claimants have to apply for benefits 
because the work they do can only be done during a given season.

<A HREF="#LINKT94"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seasonal workers are greatly affected by the intensity rule. In 
the lower St. Lawrence region, the type of unemployed workers 
registered with Human Resources Development Canada in Rimouski 
matches the profile of seasonal workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our region has a resource-based economy in important areas such 
as logging, peat production, agriculture and agri-food, tourism 
and commercial fishing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In December 1999, 17,983 unemployed workers applied for 
benefits. Of that number, 14,353 were frequent claimants, which 
means that they are affected by seasonal variations in 
employment. The lower St. Lawrence region has a 80% frequent 
claimant rate, compared to 20% for the Montreal region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this context, a pilot project is necessary, because seasonal 
workers are penalized by the intensity rule, whatever the reason 
is that forces them to rely on employment insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, many of them have to live through the so-called “black 
hole of spring”, which refers to the period of up to 10 weeks 
without benefits before they are called back to work, as I was 
saying earlier. It is very important to understand what it means 
to the seasonal worker to receive no money for a certain period 
of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This situation is a consequence of the calculation of the 
benefit period based on the regional unemployment rate rather 
than on the number of hours worked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A pilot project giving special status to seasonal workers would 
encourage them to keep their jobs, to upgrade their skills and 
to participate in the development of the local economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A stable labour force would encourage businesses to invest more 
readily in personnel training, so that employees can better 
contribute to the increased efficiency and profitability of the 
business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How would that pilot project to give a special status to 
seasonal workers work? Simply as follows. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The seasonal workers would obtain the following advantages: 
first, the intensity rule would disappear; second, the 
admissibility would no longer be determined by the unemployment 
rate in the region, but rather by the minimum number of hours 
required by the present Employment Insurance Act, that is 420 
hours. The workers would receive benefits during the total 
unemployment period, which would mean no more spring gap with no 
cheque.  Fourth, the exclusion of small weeks rule would remain. 
Fifth, the basis for calculation would be the actual number of 
weeks worked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the government will agree with this motion, which is 
extremely important for our seasonal workers.  I invite all my 
colleagues in the House to massively support the motion when we 
vote on it later. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK212"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
want to say a few words in support of the hon. member's motion. 
Two of my colleagues from New Brunswick have already spoken to 
this motion, and I want to say a few words on behalf of seasonal 
workers in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, let me make one thing absolutely crystal clear.  The 
Liberal government's changes to the unemployment insurance 
system, the so-called employment insurance system, were and still 
are a direct attack on seasonal workers in Atlantic Canada in 
particular and in rural Canada in general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The insurance system for the unemployed has been gutted.  We are 
all very much aware of that.  The changes to the UI system, the 
so-called reforms, introduced by the Liberals make it harder to 
qualify for benefits.  When one does qualify, it is for fewer 
benefits and for a shorter period of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can see why they dropped the word unemployment from the title 
of the new program.  In 1989, 87% of Canada's unemployed 
qualified for benefits.  Today only 36% of Canada's unemployed 
qualify for benefits in a system that has a multibillion dollar 
surplus.

<A HREF="#LINKT95"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is no longer workers' insurance against becoming unemployed. 
It has become a system which has forced 50,000 Newfoundlanders to 
pull up stakes and move to other provinces in central and western 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If people cannot or will not move from their home communities in 
rural Newfoundland, there is only one option.  If work is not 
available, then they have to go on social assistance.  For those 
who cannot move away it has become welfare insurance, not 
employment insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In rural Newfoundland and many other places in Atlantic and 
rural Canada there are not many job options available.  Most of 
the work which is available is seasonal work.  At one time people 
could work seasonally, draw unemployment insurance and head out 
to look for jobs elsewhere.  If they could not find jobs they 
would have the assurance of returning to their seasonal work when 
it became available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me remind hon. members that it is not a crime to be a 
fisherman.  It is not a crime to be a logger.  It is not a crime 
to be a construction worker.  These are trades that make valuable 
contributions to the people of Newfoundland and valuable 
contributions to the people of Canada.  They should be recognized 
that way, but it has all changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If people are lucky enough to find seasonal work and they do 
qualify for EI benefits, then in all likelihood the benefits will 
not carry them to the point of returning to the seasonal work. 
People will live part of the year with no income at all.  At that 
point they must deplete their savings.  They probably have to 
turn to extended family for support and help, or they have to 
move away to find work.  If that option is not available, they 
have to go on social assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would not sound so bad if the EI system were broke, depleted 
of benefits by the unemployed, but the system is not broke.  It 
is awash with cash.  The system is not broke, it is broken.  It 
was deliberately broken by the governing Liberals.  That was a 
piece of cold, calculated, social engineering on the part of the 
Liberals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Their plan proved to be quite effective.  Their strategy was to 
tighten up the EI system, making it impossible for someone to 
earn a livelihood at seasonal work, which would force the 
migration of Atlantic Canadians to areas of higher employment, 
and let welfare take care of the rest of the people who could not 
move or who would not move. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That piece of social engineering has cost my province about 
10,000 people a year over the past few years.  It has cost the 
Liberal Party all of its seats in Atlantic Canada.  It will 
continue to cost the Liberal Party all of its seats in Atlantic 
Canada unless it does something about the EI system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This piece of social engineering has cost the province of 
Newfoundland and Labrador $1 billion in lost EI revenues since 
the Liberals came to power in 1993.  The city of St. John's, just 
to give a small indication of how it is spread out, is losing $78 
million annually.  My riding of St. John's East, which is 
comprised of the eastern part of the city of St. John's and the 
rural area along Conception Bay, is losing $50.2 million 
annually.  St. John's West, where the Liberals hope to win the 
byelection on Monday, is losing $56.3 million annually. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the riding of Burin—St. George's.  Joining the 
Liberal side was supposed to be good for that riding.  How much 
is it costing the people of Burin—St. George's in lost EI 
revenue?  It is costing them $81.7 million a year.

they have had to go on social assistance.  For the most part 
there was no new work in the area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>EI cheques, believe it or not, were not replaced by cheques from 
shiny, new, year-round factories.  This money has simply gone 
from the local scene.  It is sitting in the pot right here in 
Ottawa to help the finance minister balance his budget.  This is 
money no longer being spent in restaurants, gas stations and 
grocery stores in Atlantic Canada and rural Canada.  As I said, 
in Newfoundland we have lost $1 billion in EI revenue.  In an 
economy the size of ours that has to hurt, and it has hurt many 
families and many communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Much has been said about the Liberal Party wanting to regain 
seats in Atlantic Canada in the next election.  The Liberals have 
been promising to restore some of the benefits which they took 
away under the old UI system, but so far all they have come up 
with are a lot of empty words, a lot of empty rhetoric.  I have a 
feeling that is the way it will remain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last budget the government made a lot of extending EI 
sponsored maternity leave from six months to a full year.  What 
the government did not say in the budget was that with its new 
hours based EI system only 31% of unemployed Canadian women 
actually qualify for these benefits.  Given the fact that it is 
harder to qualify for maternity benefits than regular benefits, 
that is very cold comfort indeed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's so-called reforms to the UI system and its 
creation of the new EI system was a deliberate and well planned 
attack on rural and Atlantic Canada, and unfortunately Canadian 
women as well.  These changes might have gone down well in the 
more prosperous parts of the country, but they have been 
devastating to Atlantic Canada in general and to Newfoundland in 
particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seasonal work is not a crime.  As I said a moment ago, it is not 
a crime to be a logger, it is not a crime to be a fisherman and 
it is not a crime to be a construction worker.  It certainly is 
not a valid excuse to force the migration of rural Canadians. 
However, this is what the government has done, and quite 
deliberately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the last election the Liberals paid a very stiff price for 
what they did to Atlantic Canadians.  If they want votes in 
Atlantic Canada and in the province of Newfoundland next time 
they had better change their tune.  The fishermen, the loggers 
and the construction workers of Atlantic Canada will not stand 
for what the government has done to them over the last three, 
four or five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support the motion and I commend the member for having brought 
it to the floor of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Before I recognize 
the hon. member for Oak Ridges, I thought the debate was finished 
at 6.30 p.m.  It is not.  It is supposed to be finished at 6.15 
p.m.  Is there unanimous consent to go to 6.15 p.m. with the hon.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bryon Wilfert (Oak Ridges, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will 
not take issue with you at this point, but I would indicate that, 
in fairness, the government needs to respond and the government 
will respond to both the motion and to the amendment that was 
proposed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point out to all members of the House that we all share 
concerns with regard to seasonal workers.  The original motion 
called upon the government to restore EI benefits to seasonal 
workers.  I reject the premise that EI benefits have been taken 
away from these workers. 
I would support, however, the amendment proposed by the member 
for Miramichi.  His proposed amendment would ask us to take 
immediate action to review EI benefits so that workers with 
seasonal jobs could continue contributing to the economy and 
building a better quality of life.  I think this is important for 
everyone.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians and seasonal work remain an important factor in 
government social and economic planning.  An estimated 327,000 
Canadians worked in seasonal jobs in 1997, about 3% of all paid 
workers.  In Atlantic Canada the numbers were obviously higher 
than the national average. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, within certain industries themselves there is 
greater seasonality in Atlantic Canada than elsewhere in the 
country.  In other words, employment fluctuates more with the 
seasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must recognize that seasonal industries are a large factor in 
the Canadian economy and indeed we must recognize the increased 
importance to the Atlantic region in general.  Obviously the 
treatment of seasonal workers on employment insurance is an 
important concern to the government and will be treated as such. 
However, it seems that whenever EI comes up for discussion in the 
House we must return to the basics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why was the EI system introduced in 1996?  We had to make the 
system fairer.  There had to be greater incentives to work.  We 
wanted to increase assistance for low income families with 
children and we wanted to ensure the future viability of the 
program.  Overall, we wanted a balance in the system, redirecting 
resources to help unemployed Canadians get back to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The EI program introduced in 1996 included measures to achieve 
these ends, but it was never designed, nor should it have been, 
to be the sole solution, the sole guarantee of well-being for 
Canadians in any region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Concern for unemployed workers has always been a priority of the 
government.  We must ensure that EI benefits continue to provide 
income while unemployed individuals look for a new job.  In 
addition, EI provides active re-employment measures like career 
counselling, self-employment and skills development to help 
improve the employability of individuals.  Indeed, active 
re-employment measures are now helping people to return to the 
labour market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While a strong economy was the result of the creation of 383,000 
full time jobs last year, we have nevertheless maintained our 
efforts to help those workers, regions and industries which face 
special challenges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We introduced EI to help contribute to the adjustment in the 
fishery.  We created small weeks adjustment projects at a cost of 
$225 million to help workers, many of whom are seasonal workers, 
collect higher benefits and maintain a hold on the job market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have established a working group with the provinces and 
territories to examine ways to address the specific needs of 
seasonal workers, including options for pilot projects to create 
employment opportunities in the off season.  We have invested $30 
million over two years to launch pilot projects to help workers 
maintain a strong attachment to the workforce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has recognized this and she has committed her 
regional officials to work closely with these workers to better 
appreciate local needs and explore how we can better help 
communities help themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The redesigned EI plan introduced the hours based system rather 
than the previous system based on weeks worked.  The hours based 
system is much fairer in that every hour of work counts toward 
eligibility of benefits.  Remember, seasonal workers tend to work 
a large number of hours in a given week, so the EI system 
benefits them particularly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Evidence is building that many seasonal workers are in fact 
finding the extra work needed to qualify for longer benefits. 
Keep in mind as well that we are attentive to working families 
with low incomes.  Seasonal workers in this situation receive 
higher benefits with the family supplement.  If they receive the 
family supplement, they are exempt from the intensity rule. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, many seasonal workers are receiving increased benefits 
because of participation in small weeks projects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the point we should be bearing in mind during debate on this 
motion is that the effects of various changes introduced in the 
EI package can only be measured as they are played out over time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The EI program and its efforts are being monitored continuously, 
and there is a requirement for annual assessment reports for the 
five years following its introduction.  The third report has just 
been released and it provides a more up to date assessment of how 
the program is working. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The EI reforms cannot be looked at in isolation from what has 
been happening in the Canadian economy and the labour market. 
Unemployment rates have declined dramatically across the country 
and unemployment is at its lowest level in decades.  Job growth 
was particularly strong for women and youth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not immediately apparent what this has meant for seasonal 
workers, since EI data seldom differentiates between seasonal and 
non-seasonal workers.  However, there is a great overlap of 
seasonal workers and frequent EI users. 
Data for these groups are often very similar.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1998-99 frequent claimants received about 43% of all regular 
and fishing benefits, up from 41% in the previous year.  Benefit 
payments to these claimants were $3.4 billion, virtually 
unchanged from the previous year. At the same time, benefits paid 
to unemployed workers in most seasonal industries increased 
substantially with the highest increases taking place in fishing 
and trapping which was up 70% and mining, oil and gas which was 
up 52%.  While the percentages of benefits received by frequent 
claimants increased, the number of regular and fishing claims 
made by frequent claimants declined 5.7% to 604,000 due in part 
to a general decline in claims overall. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will sum up by saying I believe the third annual monitoring 
and assessment report demonstrates that the EI regime does indeed 
provide better coverage for seasonal workers compared to the 
system it replaced. Therefore the amendment moved by the hon. 
member for Miramichi is more in keeping with what is happening 
with regard to the EI regime.  We should indeed be monitoring EI 
benefits not only for seasonal workers but for all workers. This 
is what we are doing.  With respect to the proposed subamendment 
that the review include cross-country hearings, while the 
intentions may be honourable, the net result would only add to 
the cost of the existing process. The government certainly will 
support the amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I thank you for allowing me a bit of leeway with

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie—Bathurst, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
colleagues from all parties who took part in this debate on 
employment insurance and seasonal workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion specifically concerne rural areas in this country. 
It is of paramount importance for all workers in seasonal 
industries who were penalized by employment insurance reform. 
Furthermore, this reform had devastating effects on regional 
economies throughout our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, in the riding of Acadie—Bathurst, the local economy 
was deprived of $69 million a year as a result of employment 
insurance reform. 
This means that the small and medium size businesses were 
severely affected by this reform. This is a huge sum for this 
rural area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean Dubé:</B> Doug Young's reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin:</B> The same thing is happening in every region in 
Canada whose economy is based on seasonal work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At their convention, even the Liberals passed a motion 
acknowledging the harm that employment insurance reform had done 
to seasonal workers. The Liberals acknowledged that, whereas the 
changes made to the Employment Insurance Act during these last 
ten year have affected in a disproportionate manner the workers 
of the Atlantic Region in seasonal industries and their families— 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At their convention in March, even the Liberals acknowledged the 
harm they had done to seasonal workers. 
That said, the Liberals recognize that the law must be revised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard the comments of the members of all parties in this 
House.  They have all underscored the importance of seasonal 
industry in the economy of our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take the case of the loggers at home.  What message do 
the Liberals want to send to the loggers?  I listened to my 
colleague saying that the employment system worked, that it 
encouraged people to go to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Have members ever seen a logger go to work when the forest is 
closed?  Have they ever seen blueberries being picked in winter, 
in December?  These are some of the seasonal jobs in the rural 
regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Have members seen the fish biting in Caraquet when the bay is 
frozen over?  This is the problem we have with seasonal jobs. 
This is what the government has to understand. 
It is not enough to say they will support an amendment to have a 
review without any change.  I hope that this evening they will 
act in all good faith. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If they want to pass this motion, it is to make changes that 
Canadians across the country have been waiting for.  Real 
changes have to be made for workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do members know what the black hole created by the employment 
insurance reform represents?  It represents children who get up 
in the morning to go to school without having anything to eat. 
This is what the black hole the Liberals created in 1996 is all 
about.  This has to change.

</I></B></P><P align=left>They are saying to workers and loggers at the moment “You, 
because you are in a black hole every year, sell your 
motorcycle.  You should not have one.  Sell your skidoo, because 
you are going to be on welfare.  When you are on welfare you are 
not entitled to have a skidoo or a motorcycle.  You are not even 
entitled to have a car”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what the Liberals are telling forestry workers; that is 
what they are telling workers in the fishery and in the tourism 
industry, where people work for only ten weeks a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why I am asking the House this evening to vote in favour 
of my motion. But more than that, I am asking the federal 
government, the Liberals opposite, to make the real changes that 
Canadians need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I travelled across the country examining the human impact 
of EI, I noticed that Canadians throughout Canada were 
suffering. 
Whether in Ontario, Regina in Saskatchewan, British Columbia, 
the Yukon, the Gaspé, Newfoundland or Cape Breton, everywhere, 
those who have lost their jobs are stuck in a black hole, I can 
guarantee it.  It is a black hole and not just for the worker 
but for the children, the family and everyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the House for giving me an opportunity to say a few 
works to wrap up the three hours of debate on my motion about 
EI.  I hope that it will not be a partisan vote, but that 
parliament will express its opinion and that the government will 
take action to review employment insurance because it recognizes 
the wrong it has done Canadians. The government must make real 
changes that will help workers and their families, who have to 
contend with seasonal employment in Canada.

<P><A NAME="LINK219"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie—Bathurst, NDP): </B>Mr. Speaker, on 
February 28, I asked the Minister of Human Resources Development 
the following question in the House: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, the Ottawa Citizen announced today that, according 
to the government, learning is an “individual responsibility”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the heels of student debt and the enrichment of the banks 
with liberal cuts to education, we have the Liberal government 
wanting to divest itself of its responsibilities for training. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the Minister of Human Resources Development reaffirm the 
federal government's commitment to training? 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue has become a real problem throughout the country. We 
can see the gap, once more, between the rich and the poor. And I 
must accuse the liberal government of creating this gap in the 
Canadian society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, our young people need a college or university education, 
with all the expenses involved and the borrowing they have to do, 
because the government has completely divested itself of its 
responsibility to provide students with financial support. 
Consequently they get into debt. The rich, however, do not have 
that problem, because they have money and can afford to pay for 
their children's education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Until recently, the government used to help the less fortunate 
young people make their way through college and university. It is 
now turning it back on them and forcing them to get into debt. It 
does not even help them repay their school debt. The government 
could exempt them from paying interest. But no, it asks the 
banks, the credit unions and other financial institutions de deal 
with that, and they are the ones collecting the interests, while 
we are forcing young Canadians into debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sometimes, I am scared when I hear the Minister of Finance say 
that he wants to balance his budget, eliminate the deficit and 
pay off the debt. In fact, he is doing that on the backs of 
students. He says he does not want future generations to have to 
shoulder the debt. Instead, he is putting it on their shoulders 
now, that is a big problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding, for instance, some young students graduate from 
university with a debt load of $50,000. They come to my office 
and tell me: “I cannot find a partner and get married. If I do, 
I will be $100,000 in debt”. This is what the government has 
done to the youth of our country. It is driving them into debt 
and continues to do so. The poor are falling on hard luck. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In years to come, our country will be divided between the rich 
and the poor. The poor will not receive the education they need.

<A HREF="#LINKT105"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure we can all agree that today education is of paramount 
importance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only 25 years ago, I would not say young people did not have to 
go to school or university, but if they did not, manual labour 
was still plenty. They could work in a mine, in the fishing 
industry or in construction. Young workers did not need a degree 
as is the case today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nowadays, they virtually cannot enter the labour market without 
a grade 12 education, a college or university degree. These young 
people are caught between a hard place and a rock. They have to 
borrow money and the federal government does not give them any 
support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Human 
Resources Development to tell us what are the plans of the 
government to help young Canadians and to ensure they do not go 
deeper into debt year after year as they are doing today. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK220"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I reassure 
the member for Acadie—Bathurst that the government is very 
committed to both post-secondary education and training as the 
best methods to ensure that our young people are equipped to 
participate in the modern world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under post-secondary education the millennium scholarship fund 
is particularly focused on those who are unable to pay.  The 
Canada student loans program is also offered by the government. 
There are large transfers to the provinces for post-secondary 
education which they pass on to universities and community 
colleges.  In addition, in the last budget we strengthened the 
post-secondary system to a system of special chairs which are 
funded at the universities and our centres of excellence program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are acting to ensure that all Canadians have the skills, 
knowledge and experience needed to succeed, but there is more 
than one way to get things done.  One of the best ways we have 
found is by working in collaboration with our provincial partners 
to ensure that labour market programs best meet local needs. That 
is why we have transferred responsibility for labour market 
development programs to the provinces and territories.  At the 
same time we modernize those programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the new employment insurance system we now invest $2.1 
billion a year in active measures, tools with proven track 
records of getting people back to work.  One of those tools is 
the skills development benefit which enables unemployed 
individuals to select, arrange for and pay for their own 
training. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is fulfilling its responsibility to help 
individuals obtain the training they need, and we are doing it 
with the help of our provincial and territorial partners.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les 
Basques, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, on February 24, I asked a question 
about a company from the riding of Rosemont which had moved to 
the riding of Saint-Maurice. At that time, we were told that 
there were no problem with that. But afterwards, there were a 
government inquiry on the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The horror story at Human Resources Development Canada 
continues. Instead of having the independent public inquiry that 
we, in the Bloc, have been requesting since the beginning and 
that the opposition has unanimously demanded, we are forced to 
raise all the unacceptable cases one by one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On February 24, we talked about the company from the riding of 
my colleague from Rosemont. Today, I bring to your attention the 
case of another company, Conili Star, which is in the textile 
sector. It received a $700,000 grant not to create jobs, but to 
transfer employees to a new employer. Employees from a company 
were transferred to another company at a cost of $700,000 for the 
taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the parliamentary secretary to tell us when will 
the federal government finally recognize in front of the 
population that the situation made public by the internal audit 
cannot be corrected by the six point plan of the minister, but 
that she will have to go much deeper to turn things around? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must get to the bottom of this to see if the scandal at the 
Department of Human Resources Development is simply due to 
administrative problems, to administrative laxness, to basic 
management errors made by people who have held the position of 
deputy minister, which means that they were responsible for this 
department, or if there may have been, on top of that, 
situations where public funds were used for partisan purposes, 
as we can see in the example of Conili where, strangely enough, 
the same business that received a $700,000 grant contributed 
$7,000 to the Liberal Party election fund.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We are faced with a situation where, as opposition party, we 
will continue to expose these cases day after day. We would 
expect a more responsible attitude on the part of the federal 
government, particularly on the part of the minister responsible 
and the parliamentary secretary representing her. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When will we see the kind of attitude that will allow us to shed 
some light on this whole situation so we can restore the 
credibility of job creation programs? The current attitude of 
the government seriously undermines the credibility of those 
programs and brings people like members of the Canadian Alliance 
to claim, based on the government's poor management record, that 
these programs are useless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When will the government take responsibility and when will it 
make all the available information public and order an 
independent public inquiry so we can tell the difference between 
the programs themselves and the unacceptable way the federal 
government has been managing them?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, HRDC is 
committed to ensuring that proper administrative practices are 
applied and that this information is transparent and available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the particular file mentioned by the hon. member 
opposite, he will know that we have looked at this file as we 
said we would.  As a result of this review we engaged Kroll, 
Linquist, Avey of Toronto to conduct a forensic audit on this 
particular project. The firm's report was received and based on 
its recommendations it was referred to the RCMP the very same 
day.  The project is now part of an ongoing police investigation 
and we will await the results before making any further comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member opposite has also claimed that his party is 
doing a case by case review thereby leaving the wrong impression 
with Canadians that it is the Bloc Quebecois that is doing this 
review.  The department itself as part of its six point plan is 
reviewing every single file. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is any evidence of questionable practices, the next 
step is to call in an auditing firm to do a forensic audit as I 
have just described.   That is the process.  If we find any 
behaviour that could be considered inappropriate, any worry about 
the money, we call for a forensic audit. If we can establish an 
overpayment, we will get the money back, as has been the case. 
In quite a few of the files we have retrieved the money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians should know that the Department of Human Resources 
Development is indeed conducting a case by case review of all its 
files. In some cases it will result in a repayment of funds and 
in other cases, in very serious cases, they will be referred to 
the police.

House is now deemed to have been adopted. Accordingly, this 
House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m., pursuant to 
Standing Order 24(1).
