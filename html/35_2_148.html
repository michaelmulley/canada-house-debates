	The House resumed from March 17 consideration of the motion 
and of the amendment.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Calgary Centre has 
four minutes left.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Campbell:</B> Mr. Speaker, I wanted to clarify that we had 
concurred earlier at the time the debate was wrapping up that the 
hon. member for Calgary Centre had four more minutes. He was 
quite insistent in debate on several occasions that he had been done 
out of that time.
<P>
	We are very happy to yield to him those four minutes that remain 
in his debate and then to carry on with the government side.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Would members of the Reform Party 
indicate if the hon. member for Calgary Centre is available?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, the member for 
Calgary Centre is not available. Therefore he will relinquish his 
four minutes.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lebel:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like some clarification. Will we 
not be moving on to the rest of the routine proceedings, the tabling 
of reports and so on?
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> No, no. We have moved on to government 
orders.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lebel:</B> So we are talking about Bill C-70?
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Right.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to rise to speak to Bill C-70, which has come back from the Senate 
with the amendments we had proposed as the elected members of 
this House forming Her  Majesty's official opposition, but that the 
government had refused to hear.
<P>
	And so, after a short trip to the Senate, where 104 non elected 
individuals made recommendations that mirrored the ones 
proposed by the official opposition and by my friend the member 
for Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, the bill is back, and the inclusion of 
the GST in the cost of consumer goods is delayed accordingly.
<P>
	The official opposition contested the provision to include the 
GST in the price for the simple and valid reason we gave the 
government: ``Face up to your obligations. When you advocate 
something, at least have the courage to say it was your idea''. The 
fact that the cost of the GST will now be hidden in the price of the 
product is something public opinion, with the avalanche of 
information it is buried under, tends to lose track of. This is what 
the Liberal government was hoping for in starting to include the 
amount of the GST in the selling price immediately.
<P>
	What still leaves me a bit perplexed is the fact that, when we in 
the Bloc proposed this amendment to the bill, nobody listened. And 
now 104 non elected individuals representing the parties in power 
more than the Canadian public, these honourable individuals are 
proposing to the government what we proposed. In a gesture of 
submission to a non elected authority, the government proposes to 
pass the bill as returned to this House with a provision for delaying 
the inclusion of the GST in the selling price.
<P>
<B>(1055)</B>
<P>
	Let me tell you, Mr. Speaker, and through you, tell the Minister 
of Finance-who I know understands and approves what I am 
saying-that it leaves a bitter taste in our mouths because it flies in 
the face of democracy.
<P>
	When we go to the people seeking to get elected, we tell them 
that the House of Commons is where the decisions are made and 
legislation passed, the show place of democracy where ideas are 
tossed about in a spirit of camaraderie and unfailing honesty. Now 
we have a situation where a proposal was rejected out of hand when 
originally put forward by the official opposition, but reinstated 
after consideration by the Senate, these 104 non elected 
representatives who impose their will on this House. The worst of it 
is that, while number of senators is almost the same as the number 
of members of the official opposition and the third party combined 
in the House, the Senate has more influence. That was my comment 
regarding the fact that the bill was sent back to the House.
<P>
	This week, my colleague, the hon. member for 
Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, asked the Minister of Finance, who was 
here at the time, when he would be compensating Quebec for 
harmonizing the GST. At second and third reading, Bloc members 
had raised and discussed this issue repeatedly and at great length. 
In  response to another question by my collegue from 
Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot at 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9244"> 9244 </A></B>
<P>
the beginning of the week, the minister said, again rather evasively, 
that Quebec had not lost anything by harmonizing and he therefore 
did not feel the need to compensate Quebec for losses that were not 
incurred.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance knows full well that the provinces have 
the power to levy taxes on commercial activities, on the provision 
of goods and services, and so on. Within their jurisdictions, the 
provinces have the power to levy taxes, and it is always up to the 
provincial government to decide, for example, whether or not to 
increase personal income tax so that the sales tax can remain 
somewhat lower, which, in turn, promotes trade and boosts the 
economy. It is up to the provincial government to decide not to hit 
the taxpayers with an excessively high sales tax, but rather to draw 
its revenues from income tax.
<P>
	In other provinces, like the maritimes, where unemployment is 
high and the labour force is much smaller than in central provinces 
like Quebec and Ontario, taxing the income of workers was not 
producing enough revenue, as opposed to sales tax. They therefore 
chose to keep income tax relatively low, but to make up it with a 
very high sales tax.
<P>
	The minister contends that harmonizing their sales tax with the 
GST, which involved lowering their sales tax, created a 5 per cent 
shortfall. That is a totally arbitrary figure. I ask the Minister of 
Finance: Why 5 per cent? Why not 4 per cent or 8 per cent? Why 5? 
Because that is what he has agreed to with his friend, Premier 
MacKenna. They worked out the McKenna formula together and 
decided on 5 per cent to get a round figure of approximately $1 
billion.
<P>
<B>(1100)</B>
<P>
	This government hit the maritimes hard, more specifically in the 
fisheries sector and when it reduced personnel on military bases. 
Since it now wants to make up for this before the upcoming 
election, it has decided it would be 5 per cent. It could also have set 
the rate at 4 or 6 per cent. The government never really explained 
why it opted for 5 per cent. Where did that 5 per cent come from? 
Did it come out of the blue, or is it the result of some accounting 
method? We were never able to find out. The minister said to the 
hon. member for Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot that God probably told 
him to set the rate at 5 per cent, and I do not doubt that for one 
moment.
<P>
	In any case, this is profoundly unfair to Quebec, which willingly 
harmonized its tax with the federal GST, but did not get any 
compensation for doing so. Yet, this Liberal government has made 
all kinds of cuts in Quebec, just like in the maritime provinces. It 
did a number on Quebec, notably by closing the military college in 
Saint-Jean, thus depriving the local economy of millions of dollars. 
This decision was just as devastating to the  residents of Saint-Jean 
as the downsizing of military bases in Nova Scotia and New 
Brunswick was to the people in those provinces, but Quebec was 
not compensated. Quebec is not compensated because it is Quebec. 
It is the Prime Minister's home province. The Prime Minister can 
do anything he wants without being accountable to Quebecers. He 
took for granted not only his riding of Saint-Maurice but also 
Montreal's West Island, from west of St. Laurent Street all the way 
to the Ontario border, and that was enough for him.
<P>
	So, Quebec was never compensated for the blows and the cuts it 
had to put up with. However, it is a different story for the 
maritimes. Thirty-two of the 33 seats in these provinces are 
currently being held by Liberals, and the government wants to keep 
them. It got a warning last fall when, contrary to all expectations, a 
Conservative government was elected in a maritime province. This 
is basically the reason why the Minister of Finance opted for that5 per cent.
<P>
	Quebecers must understand that. The decision whether to 
increase income taxes or the sales tax rate is a political one made 
by the provincial government. Quebec chose to increase income 
taxes, because it has a much larger workforce than all the maritime 
provinces put together. Therefore, it had the option of increasing 
income taxes while keeping its sales tax as low as possible, so as to 
revitalize the economy. However, this is not what happened.
<P>
	From this point of view, the official opposition will never ask 
this government for enough. It is simply a question of justice. I 
have trouble understanding how a federal finance minister, such as 
the current one, can back the decision taken by certain maritime 
provinces to hang on to a separate sales tax and stand in Quebec's 
way when it prefers to raise income taxes and go with a lower sales 
tax.
<P>
	But it amounts to the same total. Arbitrarily, without consulting, 
arrogantly even, the minister says: ``No, Quebec has lost nothing; 
Quebec is losing nothing by having harmonized, so I owe it 
nothing''. In reality, he wanted to win points with Acadians and 
Maritimers who were extremely disappointed because of lowered 
fishing quotas and EI reform. People in the maritimes are the 
hardest hit by EI reform because they have the highest 
unemployment rate in Canada.
<P>
<B>(1105)</B>
<P>
	So he had to do something with the election coming up; he had to 
be able to tell Maritimers: ``It is true, you have lost some ground 
with respect to UI, because now you will have to work more hours 
for less UI, and in many cases you will not receive any at all 
because you will not have accumulated enough hours to qualify for 
benefits''. All this left people pretty frustrated and irritated. I 
remember seeing the present Minister of National Defence heading 
off to speak at a public meeting in his riding and having to be 
escorted by RCMP  officers who were armed because they were 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9245"> 9245 </A></B>
<P>
worried about a popular uprising in the riding. When a minister has 
to travel with a quasi-military escort in his own riding, that is proof 
enough that people are not happy.
<P>
	I also saw the member for Beauséjour make a speech to people in 
his riding and get treated to quite a chorus of boos. People were 
unhappy because they felt they had been taken advantage of, 
cheated. With an election coming up, the government had to try to 
turn the public's attention elsewhere and the ingenious solution it 
came up with was to tell the maritime provinces: ``Harmonize your 
sales tax with our GST and we will give you a cool $961 million 
that you can dole out to try to pacify a bunch of unhappy people''.
<P>
	This is why I am among those predicting that an election will be 
called this spring. It is the same with a Christmas present. You 
remember it on Boxing Day, but come May or June, something you 
received the previous December 25 may have fled your mind.
<P>
	In many cases, you can ask someone, even right after the 
holidays, what he got for Christmas. He will try to recall, but may 
have forgotten. It is the same with the government: it hands over 
$961 million-my, but we are generous-and then decides the time 
is right to call an election.
<P>
	It is like someone who wants somebody to forgive him for 
something. I have handled many matrimonial cases in my time and 
sometimes had to play the role of umpire. For example, I would 
often see a husband who had treated his wife rather violently, and 
she would be threatening to leave with the kids, and to demand 
division of the family assets. Then the guy would suddenly wake up 
and say to himself ``Oops, it is time to do something''. So he would 
send her roses, along with a card asking for forgiveness of course, 
and then everything would be fine.
<P>
	That is a bit like the attitude of the present government. I do not 
wish to be vulgar in this House, but it gave the Maritimers a real 
kick in the pants, and now it is saying ``If I want to be able to go 
back there and walk unashamed in the streets, I am going to have to 
buy back favour somehow''. That is the explanation for the $961 
million.
<P>
	Quebecers can learn a lesson from this, particularly those who 
are represented here by Liberal members, from the West Island for 
the most part: that a vote gained is a vote gained. They have no 
need to earn that vote, no need to deserve it, no need to gain these 
people's confidence, it is a given. They do not need to make any 
promises to them, to be nice to them in any way; they can even 
thumb their noses at them, for they know they will get their votes 
anyway.
<P>
<B>(1110)</B>
<P>
	That is the attitude the present Liberal government has toward 
those Quebecers who have what I consider the misfortune of 
having elected Liberal MPs. Madam Speaker, you are indicating 
that my time is coming to an end, but I still have enough time to tell 
the Quebecers who voted Liberal out of fear, fear of the threat of 
secession, fear that the sovereignists were a bit too strong, that they 
have shot themselves in the foot. Perhaps it is time for them to start 
thinking that they too are important, that they too ought to be 
involved, that they too need to be able to have an MP who is up to 
the challenge of representing and defending them.
<P>
	Where were the Liberal MPs in October 1994, the Liberals 
representing the West Island of Montreal, when there was an 
unprecedented attempt by Ontario members to break the Drug 
Patent Act regulations? Not a one was visible. They all disappeared 
into the woodwork. They were no more talkative than the fish in 
my aquarium: not a single word.
<P>
	And where were they when raw milk cheese was being discussed 
this past spring? There was even a cheese tasting here in the 
rotunda, and the Quebec Liberal MPs were so scared to commit 
themselves that they would not even show their faces and taste the 
delicious cheeses the Caron family from my riding had brought in. 
They were absolutely magnificent cheeses, but what the Liberals 
would like to see on our tables from now on, as our premium 
cheese, is Kraft Cheez Whiz.
<P>
	These attitudes must be spoken out against, but these folks do 
not make a move, because people will vote for them anyway. We 
know that people in certain ridings are so scared of the sovereignist 
threat that they will vote for them. They often add insult to injury 
by dozing off in their seats. I would ask them to reconsider 
Quebec's request. You owe us $2 billion, when are we going to get 
it?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
first I want to assure the hon. member that Canadians do not treat 
Quebec with disdain. I am sure most Canadians would agree that 
Quebec is a very important part of a united Canada and that we all 
share, enjoy and own a piece of every part of Canada.
<P>
	In his comments the member, as other Bloc members have, 
talked significantly about the issue of some sort of a subsidy or the 
billion dollars. I am wondering whether the member is aware of the 
facts concerning the three provinces that are harmonizing. Just to 
refresh his memory, in Newfoundland and Labrador the current 
provincial rate is 12 per cent. The combined federal-provincial rate 
is 19.84 per cent and when it is reduced down to 15 per cent it is a 
savings of 4.84 per cent or a reduction in provincial revenues of 
4.84 per cent. Similarly for Nova Scotia it is a 3.77 per cent 
reduction in provincial revenues. For New Brunswick the reduction 
is 3.77.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9246"> 9246 </A></B>
<P>
	In Quebec the combined rate is 13.96 per cent. The member 
will quickly appreciate that there was a significant loss of revenue 
to those three provinces. Quebec harmonized on a voluntary basis 
in advance of everyone else. The member knows that Quebec has 
benefited significantly particularly in terms of its exports because 
of the harmonized sales tax in Quebec of 13.96 per cent.
<P>
	Is the member aware of the differential in the combined rates? 
Does he understand that the subsidies are not an indication of 
disdain for Quebec but rather a reflection of the adjustment or 
equalization of the revenue realities to the provinces involved?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lebel:</B> Madam Speaker, here we have a fine example of 
someone who prepared his question yesterday, I suspect, and is 
putting it anyway.
<P>
	I have just explained in detail the very thing he just asked me in 
the form of a question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pomerleau:</B> Absolutely. He did not understand.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lebel:</B> He is doing exactly what is done at other points in 
the stages of bills before they are sent to the Senate. I have just 
explained the government's choices, that the Government of 
Quebec chose to raise income tax and keep its sales tax low, 
whereas the maritime provinces kept their income tax low and their 
sales tax high.
<P>
<B>(1115)</B>
<P>
	With the sales tax lowered, his question is dumb. You did not 
understand anything. That is the problem. That is what I am doing 
my darnedest to explain to him. Clearly, however, he prepared his 
question yesterday or last week and he decided to put it anyway, 
even though I had just showed him in black and white that they 
were wrong in this.
<P>
	Yes, indeed. I repeat, you are in the process of buying the 
maritimes' vote. That is what you are doing. At least have the 
courage to say so.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I was 
listening with interest to the member's speech. When Bloc 
members speak, I always wonder what happens to co-operative 
federalism which is that we all try to work together to create a 
better country. They always seem to say if everything is flowing 
toward Quebec they are happy and if it is flowing away to 
somebody else then they have a problem. I guess that is what they 
use to support their separatist position.
<P>
	The point is this idea of the federal government's paying any 
province or the three Atlantic provinces the better part of a billion 
dollars to buy into the Minister of Finance's policy is quite 
repugnant. To think that Quebec would want to tie on to the same 
type of subsidy is just  as repugnant for the separatists who want to 
get money for their province.
<P>
	I would have thought that if this policy of a harmonized sales tax 
was a good policy, the provinces would have bought into it, the 
people in these provinces would have bought into it and the 
premiers of these provinces would have bought into it, but they did 
not. That is why we have had a long debate.
<P>
	Then of course the Minister of Finance was adamant that it 
would be tax in pricing. When the other House went down to 
Atlantic Canada and held these hearings, we found out that the 
premiers there did not like tax in pricing, the people there did not 
like tax in pricing and now the other House is asking us to 
reconsider. In order for the Minister of Finance to accomplish his 
agenda, he acquiesced to a request from the other House so that it 
can all be put in place.
<P>
	The member talked about the harsh period in the province of 
Quebec. Look around at the growing economies elsewhere. In the 
province of Ontario it is going to be booming next year. An article 
in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> this morning stated that the economy in 
Alberta, where I am from, is going to lead the country in growth. 
Surely if they would abandon this whole notion of separatism, 
work toward co-operative federalism where they can take 
advantage of their unique opportunities in Quebec, work with the 
rest of the provinces to build prosperity, to create jobs, to ensure 
government is the smallest we can have, then people can prosper.
<P>
	Why does the hon. member keep talking about the harsh 
problems in Quebec when most of us realize that they are caused by 
the lack of confidence in Quebec, caused by the fact that there are 
so many separatists sitting here and we have a separatist party in 
the legislature in Quebec? If they would endorse co-operative 
federalism things would improve.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lebel:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the member for St. Albert. 
He at least prepared his question after my remarks. He did not write 
it three weeks ago.
<P>
	On the other hand, when he tells me what constitutes Canada, I 
agree. There is a Chinese saying: ``Feed a man a fish, and you feed 
him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime''. 
That is sort of the way it worked with the provincial transfers the 
federal government has always made to Quebec. It gave us transfer 
payments to buy our groceries. Ontario gets the about the same 
amount, but in the form of industrial infrastructures, things that, as 
in the case of my Chinese fisherman, help provide a living.
<P>
<B>(1120)</B>
<P>
	That is the nuance the Liberals make. I see the member for Sault 
Ste. Marie jumping up. He will never  admit it, of course, but that is 
the essence of the problem in the Canadian federation. Quebecers 
get a bit of money to stock their fridges, Ontarians get money to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9247"> 9247 </A></B>
<P>
build industries, to get people to work and process raw materials. 
There lies the injustice at the heart of this federation. What hurts 
the most is having a francophone who is in the process of losing his 
status shout at you that you are wrong. I am sorry, but that is 
Canada's history.
<P>
	The member for St. Albert may be upset-it is his 
prerogative-but I say: ``Be fair. Start treating Quebecers fairly. It 
is about time-you are 100 years late. Perhaps Quebecers will 
change their thinking about you''. Perhaps it will be easier to reach 
agreements.
<P>
	It will not be by assimilating and frustrating us, as you have done 
for the past 100 years, especially as concerns Quebec's industrial 
development, and by setting up little tariff barriers. Free trade hurt 
you? Why? Because, now to stock my fridge I can buy from you or 
go elsewhere if you are too expensive. I could not do that before. 
That hurt you. Think about it.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Godfrey (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for 
International Cooperation, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I rise in 
support of the harmonized sales tax. I see it, as many speakers have 
said before me, as being part of a more efficient system of national 
taxation. I see it as being part of the wider construction of an 
economic foundation for Canada, allied with our efforts on deficit 
reduction and program review.
<P>
	To me the real significance of the harmonized sales tax is the 
message it sends out to Canadians about our ability to work 
together. The real significance is the progress we have already 
made with the province of Quebec and with some of the Atlantic 
provinces in establishing the basis for a national harmonized sales 
tax.
<P>
	If we can work together, as we have, on such a thorny question as 
the harmonized sales tax, what other good things can we achieve in 
that same spirit? What is the foundation that we are building and 
what is the future which we will build on top of that foundation?
<P>
	We have to move beyond these economic foundations to some 
kind of view of ourselves which is grander and more important than 
the ones we have been concentrating on to date. We have to realize 
that out there beyond the harmonized sales tax is a series of greater 
projects, national projects which will allow us to attain greater 
goals. In order for that to happen, as we have done with the sales 
tax, we need to set timelines and priorities. We need to measure 
progress and outcomes.
<P>
	Most of all, we have to recapture the spirit of working together in 
the execution of these projects because it is only by working 
together that all of us can recover our collective sense of optimism 
and hope as a country.
<P>
	In his 1996 budget the finance minister set out a vision of 
Canada for the new millennium. Successful countries do more than 
occupy a place on a map. They live in the souls of their people 
because they are relevant to the betterment of their lives. So for 
Canada it is time to set goals anchored in our shared values and our 
shared aspirations.
<P>
	We have done that throughout our history, in the days when we 
dared speak of a national dream and then built it, in the days when 
we aspired to a kinder society and then created it. We have set great 
national challenges, not small ones, because it is only by reaching 
as high as we are able that we will discover how far we can go.
<P>
	Why can we not decide together in the House and in this country 
that ten years hence Canada will be regarded as a world leader in 
the new industries of the new economy, in biotechnology and 
environmental technology, and in the cultural industries of the 
multi-channel universe? Why not decide that ten years hence 
increasing child poverty rates will be a thing of the past, that 
illiteracy will be erased from our communities and that when it 
comes to international tests our students will not simply do fine 
work but will be the very best? Why can we not decide together that 
medicare ten years hence will not simply survive but that it will be 
the most successful system in the world, a system which will be 
second to none?
<P>
<B>(1125 )</B>
<P>
	Why not decide that 10 years hence our streets will be the safest 
they can be, not because we have the largest number of prisons or 
police but because we have faced squarely the causes of crime? I 
ask with the finance minister why not indeed.
<P>
	Moving from that vision and those goals will require what the 
Prime Minister referred to last year as a domestic Team Canada. It 
simply means all of us working together. The harmonized sales tax 
has been an example, a difficult, trying example of us working 
together with the provinces to achieve a more efficient and fairer 
Canada.
<P>
	National goals and national projects are not simply federal, they 
are national. They require all levels of government, federal, 
provincial and municipal, to work together. Beyond the kind of 
co-operation we have had with the harmonized sales tax, national 
projects require the participation of the public and private sectors, 
of trade unions and social activists, of professionals and volunteers. 
Above all, national projects demand the full participation of 
citizens.
<P>
	National projects are of a scope and scale that no one sector of 
society can achieve in isolation. National projects allow us to 
mobilize all our resources as a country to achieve a great collective 
purpose. National projects remind us of why we need a country in 
the first place.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9248"> 9248 </A></B>
<P>
	The role of the federal government, as it was in the case of the 
harmonized sales tax, in promoting national projects, is to think 
of the interests of all Canadians. The federal government must put 
before Canadians a series of goals and invite their comments and 
participation, as we did in 1993 with our red book. The federal 
government must act as a strategic broker in forming the 
partnerships that can achieve national projects. The federal 
government can neither dictate, implement nor fund national 
projects by itself.
<P>
	National projects demand that we put aside our differences and 
see Canada as a collective enterprise, a fate sharing vessel. We 
have to see ourselves as a society of mutual obligation, not simply 
a collection of provinces, interest groups and individuals. It 
requires thinking of ourselves as a national society to reach 
national goals by creating national projects.
<P>
	In the 1996 budget the finance minister outlined an ambitious 
series of goals for the next decade. Our task as a government for the 
next four years, if we should be re-elected, is to choose four or five 
of these national projects which will have the strategic effect of 
fundamentally improving the lives of Canadians.
<P>
	One such national project would be to set for ourselves the goal 
of making Canada the best country in the world for the care and 
nurturing of young children. If we could say of Canadian children 
from birth to the age of six that Canada has the lowest poverty rate, 
the lowest rate of child abuse, the best prenatal programs, the best 
parenting courses, the best child care programs, the best rate of 
school readiness by the age of six, the positive consequences for 
Canada would be enormous.
<P>
	By this single national project we would have gone a long way to 
achieving many of the goals set out by the finance minister. Not 
only would we have reduced child poverty, we would have 
dramatically improved literacy rates and we would create solid 
base for future academic success and for employment success in 
the new economy.
<P>
	If we could produce six year olds with the best coping and 
learning skills in the world, this would be the single greatest 
investment in improving subsequent adult health status that any 
society could make. These same competent six year olds will 
dramatically lower drop-out rates, delinquency rates and crime 
rates as they grow older.
<P>
	What would be required to achieve such a project? Nothing less 
than a mobilization of all our resources, professional and voluntary, 
public sector and private, community by community, province by 
province, coast to coast. By enumerating and configuring all our 
existing assets, by setting goals, objectives and timelines, by 
measuring and monitoring our progress, by sharing results 
nationally through the Internet and by each level of government 
and each sector of society taking their share, eliminating 
duplication, co-ordinating efforts and filling gaps, this national 
project is eminently achievable.  Why indeed should we not 
attempt such things in our next mandate?
<P>
	The harmonized sales tax creates a climate of working together 
which makes such national projects possible. It has been difficult 
but it shows us that such things can be done and that what we have 
to do is broaden our vision of a better Canada for the 21st century.
<P>
<B>(1130 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I hold my hon. colleague in high esteem since he always 
makes very intelligent comments. I would like to hold up some of 
his comments to some factual statements made by members from 
the maritimes.
<P>
	The hon. member mentioned in his speech that Bill C-70 would 
increase efficiency and provide a climate of working together. I 
want to take the time to quote some statements from our provincial 
counterparts.
<P>
	Ontario finance minister Ernie Eves said that the blended sales 
tax using the GST base would cost Ontarians over $3 billion in 
extra taxes and put a kibosh on any other harmonization schemes. 
In the business community, the Retail Council of Canada said that 
by forcing stores to bury the new tax in prices, the harmonized tax 
regime was going to cost retailers at least $100 million a year. The 
Halifax Chamber of Commerce predicted that the harmonized sales 
tax would push up new house prices by 5.5 per cent as well as force 
municipalities to raise property taxes. I have other examples. I am 
sure this is no news to the hon. member opposite.
<P>
	In view of the statements I have just made, which contradict 
what the member said, I would certainly like to know how he can 
stand in the House and say that Bill C-70 and the harmonization of 
the tax is actually going to increase efficiency and provide a 
climate of co-operation. Clearly many members in the business and 
political communities in the maritimes and the rest of this country 
are blatantly against it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Godfrey:</B> Madam Speaker, there are three parts to the 
answer.
<P>
	Any system which removes a layer of administration, that is to 
say so that a tax is put together and collected by only one group of 
tax administrators, must by definition be more efficient than two 
separate tax regimes. That is the first answer.
<P>
	The second answer is that opinions are clearly divided regarding 
the efficiency and ultimate consequence of this tax because those in 
other provinces such as New Brunswick, take a totally different 
view. They see this as a tremendous economic advantage.
<P>
	The third response is that the government has shown itself to be 
remarkably flexible in wanting to accommodate the wishes of the 
individual provinces to overcome the deficiencies that may be 
present in such a  scheme. It is that third element of flexibility, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9249"> 9249 </A></B>
<P>
negotiation, reasonableness and working together which I would 
wish to emphasize, because it is in that spirit that this country will 
move forward.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> Madam Speaker, the 
hon. member brought forth examples from New Brunswick and 
said that New Brunswickers are in favour of this. I would like to 
cite some examples from New Brunswick.
<P>
	The Canadian Real Estate Association said that the 
harmonization will increase the cost of a new house by $4,000 in 
Nova Scotia and by $3,374 in New Brunswick. The GST 
harmonization will be responsible for the closure of five Greenberg 
stores and a loss of 79 jobs in Buctouche, Dalhousie, Moncton, 
Sussex and Saint John. The management of this chain said that 
there is a 50-50 chance of further store closures and a loss of 71 
jobs in such places as Shediac and Moncton. These are very 
specific examples of what the harmonization will do in the 
province of New Brunswick.
<P>
	Again, I would like to ask how the hon. member can say in this 
House that the harmonization of the GST is actually going to 
improve efficiency and increase co-operation when provinces in 
the maritimes are blatantly against it.
<P>
	I agree with the hon. member that a harmonization with a 
decreasing tax base would benefit the provinces and individuals but 
it has to be a substantial decrease in the taxation on individuals.
<P>
	Furthermore, I would like to bring to the hon. member's 
attention that the government is actually nibbling around the edges 
on this issue. Since being elected the government has introduced 36 
tax increases. What has been the impact of the 36 tax increases that 
his government has introduced over the last three years on people 
not only in the maritimes but also in the rest of Canada?
<P>
<B>(1135 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Godfrey:</B> Madam Speaker, let me turn first to the opening 
comments in that question which deal with the whole question of 
efficiency.
<P>
	The devil is clearly in the details. The purpose of the GST was to 
replace the manufacturers sales tax and to create a more efficient 
tax to net out the same amount of money. In harmonizing the sales 
tax we retained that goal of wishing to have exactly the same 
amount of money but arrived at in a more efficient way. This will 
indeed allow us to lower the overall tax rate in the direction which 
was supported by the hon. member.
<P>
	As to the hon. member's second point about 36 tax increases-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> I am sorry the 
time has expired.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Etobicoke North, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
am pleased to rise today to speak in support of Bill C-70. Passage 
of this bill will be a major step forward in our efforts to reform the 
goods and services tax.
<P>
	As of April 1, 1997 the harmonized tax will replace the GST and 
provincial sales taxes in the provinces of Nova Scotia, New 
Brunswick, and Newfoundland and Labrador. This new system will 
benefit both consumers and businesses in these provinces for the 
following reasons:
<P>
	Consumers will have lower tax rates and on many goods will pay 
lower taxes. Businesses will have to deal with only one tax, one 
rate, one base, one set of forms and one administration. Businesses 
will not have to pay taxes on goods which they export from their 
province. That means more exports and more exports means more 
jobs. Businesses in the three Atlantic provinces will be able to 
compete on an equal footing with businesses elsewhere in Canada 
thanks to a national approach to interprovincial sales.
<P>
	The detailed agreement between Canada and these provinces 
means more efficient and less costly government. It will eliminate 
existing duplication and overlap in the administration of sales taxes 
in Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Newfoundland and Labrador.
<P>
	Let me now outline what harmonization means for consumers. 
Consumers in the Atlantic provinces who have endorsed this 
agreement have to pay provincial and federal sales taxes, but the 
existing system is very cumbersome, costly and complicated. The 
new harmonized system will be simpler, cheaper and more clear. 
The detailed agreements announced by the federal government and 
the governments of the three participating provinces will benefit 
consumers in a number of different ways.
<P>
	First, it will mean a lower combined tax rate. To be specific, in 
Nova Scotia and New Brunswick the new combined rate of 15 per 
cent-7 per cent federal and 8 per cent provincial-will effectively 
be four percentage points lower than it is now. In Newfoundland 
and Labrador the combined rate will effectively be five percentage 
points lower.
<P>
	The new system will mean lower prices on most goods not only 
because the combined rate will be lower, but because hidden 
provincial sales taxes will be eliminated. Under today's provincial 
retail sales tax system, businesses are taxed on items they buy to 
make their products, deliver their services and keep their 
businesses going. That will no longer be the case as of next month.
<P>
	It is true that the new system will mean that consumers will pay 
tax on a broader range of goods and services. At the same time, 
spreading the tax burden in that way makes it possible to keep the 
HST rate at a reasonable level. Taxpayers will have the assurance 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9250"> 9250 </A></B>
<P>
that their federal and provincial governments are working more 
effectively by eliminating needless and costly duplication.
<P>
	What does harmonization mean for business? The new sales tax 
system will be simpler, less costly and more efficient. It means one 
tax, one rate, one base and one administration.
<P>
	A harmonized system will be particularly advantageous for 
small business which bears disproportionately higher costs today, 
the costs of dealing on a daily basis with two separate sales tax 
systems. For example, under the new system small businesses with 
less than $30,000 in taxable sales will no longer have to register for 
either the federal or the provincial sales tax.
<P>
	For all businesses there will be no separate requirement to 
register for the new harmonized tax. Businesses registered for the 
GST will automatically be registered for the harmonized tax. In 
addition, there will be no requirement to report separately tax 
collected and remitted at the 15 per cent rate or input tax credits 
claimed at the 15 per cent rate. Tax remittances will be made on the 
existing GST return.
<P>
<B>(1140 )</B>
<P>
	The new sales tax system will help to make businesses in Nova 
Scotia, New Brunswick and Newfoundland and Labrador more 
competitive. That is because exports from these provinces will be 
free of existing provincial retail sales tax on business inputs. 
Furthermore, they will be free of that tax when they compete with 
imported goods.
<P>
	Because of the amendments proposed by the other House, we 
will have to postpone tax included pricing until such time as more 
provinces have harmonized their sales taxes. This delay is very 
regrettable because Canadians have told us in no uncertain terms 
that they prefer tax included pricing. However, the more important 
objective at this time is to implement the harmonized sales tax on 
April 1 so that the Atlantic provinces can begin to reap the benefits 
of this new sales tax system.
<P>
	I should point out that this legislation we are debating today 
incorporates a vast number of technical amendments to the Excise 
Tax Act that will benefit all Canadians. It is important to proceed 
without delay for this reason also.
<P>
	As I said earlier, businesses will be able to claim back all the 
sales taxes paid on the goods and services they purchase. Currently 
they can only get credit for the GST they have paid, not the 
provincial sales taxes they have paid.
<P>
	We can be sure that the premiers of the Atlantic provinces 
understand very well that the harmonized sales tax will allow 
businesses in those provinces to have a competitive advantage over 
businesses in those provinces that have not harmonized.
<P>
	Notwithstanding the comments of my colleague from 
Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, sometime ago the premier of Ontario 
recognized that harmonizing the sales tax in Ontario was the 
direction Ontario should take. He is on record as having endorsed 
harmonization. He may have flip-flopped later but we are getting 
used to that. Frankly, I am not sure what the delay is. By delaying 
harmonization in Ontario, the province is depriving consumers and 
businesses in Ontario of the benefits of harmonization.
<P>
	In terms of construction, some in the construction industry 
would like to see the GST eliminated. To do that we would have to 
raise taxes or we would not be able to deal with the deficit. The 
reason the construction industry is working so hard today and 
business is up in absolute terms an incredible amount is because of 
the fiscal policy of this government and the fact that we have been 
able to reduce interest rates to 40 year lows. To say that the 
construction industry is not in favour of this tax is really stretching 
the point.
<P>
	Businesses in Ontario now pay $2.8 billion in hidden taxes to the 
Ontario government. Exporters in Ontario will also gain with a 
harmonized tax because goods produced in Ontario will no longer 
have these hidden taxes embedded in their price when they are 
shipped abroad. It is the export sector that has been creating most 
of the jobs in Ontario over the past few years. In fact, international 
exports now account for 44.5 per cent of Ontario's economy. That 
is why it is vitally important to make our exports as competitive as 
possible: exports create jobs.
<P>
	Although exports are non-taxable, it is estimated that the value 
of Ontario exports includes about $825 million a year of embedded 
provincial sales tax. We better believe that Mr. McKenna in New 
Brunswick understands that very well.
<P>
	With these delays, businesses in Ontario, in particular small 
businesses, are unable to simplify their tax reporting procedures. 
Independent studies have suggested that Ontario businesses, again 
notwithstanding the comments earlier of my hon. colleague from 
Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, could save between $200 million and 
$300 million as a result. These are independent studies; this is not 
the Ontario government speaking. In addition, the Canadian 
Institute of Chartered Accountants estimates that it costs the 
Ontario government about $40 million a year to run the provincial 
sales tax system.
<P>
	What are the consequences if businesses are not competitive? If 
businesses in Ontario are not as competitive as companies in the 
Atlantic provinces and Quebec-because Quebec has harmonized, 
much to its credit-then over time this will translate into fewer 
jobs for Ontarians.
<P>
	The efficiencies that would result from a harmonized sales tax in 
Ontario could mean that a combined tax could be implemented at a 
rate of 14 per cent, not a 15 per cent combined rate. This effectively 
means that the  GST could be reduced by a full percentage point 
right now in Ontario. If the political will existed at Queen's Park, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9251"> 9251 </A></B>
<P>
that could happen. As I said earlier, harmonizing the sales tax in 
Ontario would provide the opportunity to reduce the GST by one 
point right now through increased efficiencies.
<P>
<B>(1145 )</B>
<P>
	A number of organizations in Ontario have endorsed 
harmonization. I will not refer to them all, but some of them are the 
Canadian Health Care Association, the Association of Universities 
and Colleges of Canada, the Canadian School Boards Association, 
the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants, the Canadian 
Manufacturers' Association and a range of other ones. For these 
reasons I urge members to support the bill.
<P>
	I would like to turn briefly to general tax reductions because 
some political parties in Canada are advocating general tax cuts. 
The government is saying that it would like to move to tax 
reduction at some time. It has already made some targeted tax cuts 
for those in need and in important strategic areas.
<P>
	It would be irresponsible to make general tax cuts now. At the 
very least we have to wait until the deficit is under control and we 
have invested in our social programs to the extent needed.
<P>
	I urge all members to vote in favour of Bill C-70.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I thank my colleague for his speech and would like to ask 
him a number of questions on some important issues he addressed, 
in particular on improving the export potential of Canada.
<P>
	Our standard of living is largely dependent upon our ability to 
export. Competitiveness in export markets relies on lower taxes, a 
strong educational system and a situation that decreases the 
barriers to trade. Over the last 3.5 years the government has seen fit 
to pursue a strategic economic course that has increased taxes 37 
times. The most recent one is the increase in CPP which basically 
took $10 billion out of the hands of consumers.
<P>
	With respect to education, the backbone of our ability to be 
competitive in the world, the government has chosen to remove $7 
billion from transfer payments to the provinces. This has 
significantly compromised the ability of students in Canada to get 
the training they will need in the future to compete with students 
from as far away as Tokyo and Moscow.
<P>
	Barriers to trade are a significant deterrent to our 
competitiveness. Why has the government chosen to nibble around 
the edges of the issue of interprovincial trade barriers to such an 
extent that today there are fewer barriers north-south than 
east-west? It is absolutely essential for all companies in the country 
be able to work in an environment free of egregious government 
control.  Interprovincial trade barriers are probably the greatest 
deterrent to our companies being competitive.
<P>
	How can the member can stand in the House and talk about 
competitiveness when the government has done numerous things to 
make Canadian companies uncompetitive?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cullen:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the member for 
Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca for his comments.
<P>
	I believe firmly that exports are a key to Canada's growth. Our 
government has done an incredible job in this area. Our exports to 
the United States have reached record highs.
<P>
	To accomplish that we have travelled abroad with Team Canada, 
which resulted in the landing of a huge number of business deals.
<P>
	In addition, in terms of trade barriers the government has been 
very active in breaking down trade barriers around the world and in 
forming regional trading agreements with NAFTA, Chile and 
Israel. There are more on the way.
<P>
	The member mentioned a number of points including the CPP. 
The government is investing in the Canada pension plan to make it 
actuarially viable in the future. It is not unlike the pension plans of 
many corporations that are out of date with respect to the age mix 
and the demographics. The population is getting older.
<P>
	As a government we are not doing anything different from what 
many corporations are doing. We see on their balance sheets that 
their pension plan is actuarially underfunded and they will build up 
the fund over a number of years. This is the responsible course to 
take.
<P>
<B>(1150 )</B>
<P>
	With regard to transfer payments, our transfer payments to the 
provinces after considerable warning have been coming down at 
the rate of 4 per cent to 5 per cent per year while we have been 
cutting our own programs by 8 per cent or 9 per cent.
<P>
	If we look at federal transfers in Ontario they comprise 2 per 
cent to 3 per cent of total government revenues. If Ontario is having 
some difficulties in funding health and education, it has nothing to 
do with federal transfers. It has everything to do with the 
Conservative government's provincial tax cut. It has made those 
choices and has set those priorities.
<P>
	I agree with the member that we need to bring interprovincial 
trade barriers down but not in the high handed manner proposed by 
the Progressive Conservative Party. We have to be assertive but we 
have to work co-operatively with the provinces.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak on Bill C-70 which deals with the 
harmonization of the GST.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9252"> 9252 </A></B>
<P>
	I would like to discuss a number of issues concerning the 
competitiveness of Canada's economy and the inability of 
government to provide small and medium size Canadian 
businesses, the economic backbone of our nation that employs 
most people, with the tools to enable them to be competitive not 
only within the nation but outside the nation.
<P>
	It has been a great disappointment for me to see the government 
repeatedly ignore constructive suggestions made by our party and 
other parties, indeed by backbench MPs of all parties through 
private members' bills. We have given the government 
opportunities to make our country greater and stronger. It has 
repeatedly played politics with the economics of the country. 
Rather than trying to do the right thing, it has chosen to do the 
political thing.
<P>
	Competitiveness relies on a number of issues. It relies on a 
strong education system. It relies on strong investment in research 
and development. It relies on a taxation structure that does not hang 
around the necks of Canadians and corporations like a noose which 
is pulled progressively tighter and tighter until individuals and 
companies cannot take any more. It also relies on a structure of 
rules and regulations that do not inhibit the ability of our private 
sector to function.
<P>
	It is unfortunate that over the last 20 years a series of Liberal and 
Conservative governments have taken it upon themselves to do the 
exact opposite of what is necessary to make our economy stronger.
<P>
	The government has chosen to eviscerate education by removing 
$7 billion in transfer payments to education, health and welfare. 
That is not the way to build a strong economy.
<P>
	Our students do not only compete with students in Toronto, 
Vancouver, Quebec City, Montreal and Moncton. They compete 
against students in Tokyo, New Delhi, Cape Town, London and 
New York. The world has a global economy. The traditional nation 
state borders have virtually disappeared. The globalization that has 
taken place has made it such that nation states are secondary to the 
movement of capital and the rules and regulations among different 
groups of countries.
<P>
	It is imperative for the government to take a leadership role to 
maximize the ability of students in secondary and post-secondary 
institutions and of people in the workplace. They should have 
access to the skills that will enable them to be competitive. We 
have to continue to learn to keep our skills up and to ensure that 
companies are competitive.
<P>
<B>(1155 )</B>
<P>
	It is an unfortunate statistic the money invested in training 
workers is among the lowest of OECD nations. I believe Canada 
places 33rd of all OECD nations in its ability to train its workers. 
That is an absolute embarrassment.
<P>
	Over the last 15 to 20 years our competitiveness has repeatedly 
and consistently gone down. Our competitiveness now ranks along 
with that of Italy. This is an ignominious statistic and not one that 
we should be proud of.
<P>
	The solutions to these problems are not rocket science. As I have 
said before, they have been repeatedly presented by members of the 
House over the last 3.5 years.
<P>
	With respect to research and development I congratulate the 
government for putting $800 million into research. It is the first 
time that has happened in a long time and I hope it continues. 
Research is another underpinning of our economy and the ability 
for us to be competitive.
<P>
	With respect to taxes the government has done an absolutely 
appalling job and the HST is but an example. I have demonstrated 
in my questions that the HST will not provide for tax relief for 
Canadians or for our companies. It will not do anything of the sort. 
In many instances it will actually increase taxation levels and the 
burden upon companies.
<P>
	The Canadian Federation of Independent Business indicated 
what it felt was important about harmonization and where the 
proposal of the government under Bill C-70 actually failed. It 
indicated that a properly harmonized system of sales taxes was far 
more preferable to the mess we currently have. However, it 
continued, properly harmonized is defined by the small business 
community as having one sales tax system across the country at a 
lower rate than would occur by simply combining the GST with the 
respective PST with one set of rules and one set of audit 
procedures, a single remittance requirement and one tax collector.
<P>
	That does not occur here at all. That is quite unfortunate. The 
government has had an opportunity. It must provide a harmonized 
sales tax and decrease the inefficiencies in the system. We are in 
favour of doing it in the manner in which the Canadian Federation 
of Independent Business has put forward to the government and to 
the finance minister. However it was ignored. It is essential, if the 
government is to harmonize, to bring taxation levels down.
<P>
	This again is just nibbling around the edges. If the government 
were truly interested in eliminating that which compromises the 
ability of our companies to be competitive, the taxation levels, it 
would not have increased taxes 37 times since it was elected. It is 
utterly disingenuous for the government to tell Canadian taxpayers 
that it has not increased taxes. Just a few weeks ago the Minister of 
Finance increased the CPP payments by 10 per cent over the next 
few years. The contributions are akin to a tax increase that removes 
$10 billion from the hands of companies and individuals. That will 
cost jobs all over the country.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9253"> 9253 </A></B>
<P>
	On the one hand we have the government nibbling away on a 
harmonized sales tax which will not do anything to increase 
efficiency and reduce the tax burden. On the other hand, on a much 
larger scale it has increased the tax burden on Canadians. Every 
family has had its taxes increased by thousands of dollars since 
the government was elected.
<P>
	That is part of the reason we have an underground economy 
which is growing by leaps and bounds. It is part of the reason why 
when we talk to small and medium size businesses they say they 
cannot hire anybody because all they do is work and give their 
money to the tax man. That is what is happening.
<P>
	In 1992 the government of the day chose to decrease taxes. What 
happened? The economy was stimulated. Revenues to the 
government actually increased. What did the government do then? 
It started to tax wildly. This does not make any sense.
<P>
	There are numerous examples from around the world to 
demonstrate that there are ways in which to decrease our taxation 
system. It can be done in such a way that government revenues will 
increase and it will be a stimulus to the economy.
<P>
<B>(1200 )</B>
<P>
	The other object in trying to make our companies more 
competitive is the government getting its own fiscal and monetary 
house in order. Three and half years ago we provided the 
government with a concise, specific, detailed and logical plan to 
bring our deficit down to zero and produce a surplus budget. Right 
now we would not have deficit spending if the government had 
chosen to take up our plans. But the government did not adopt our 
plans and as a result we have a debt that is $100 billion higher 
today than before.
<P>
	We have a situation where instead of spending 25 per cent on the 
moneys taken in by the government, the government now has to 
pay 40 per cent, that is 40 cents out of every dollar it takes in just 
on interest on the debt. That is the single greatest threat to all our 
social programs. If we liken the situation to a pie, when we were 
elected in 1993, only a quarter of that pie went toward payment of 
interest on the debt. Now it is 40 per cent and soon enough it will be 
50 per cent. As time time passes, as our debts increase, as our 
interest payments on those debts increase, less and less money will 
be available to pay for health care, education, welfare, the 
guaranteed income supplement, old age security, all of those fine 
social programs we have. All these programs that protect people 
who do without, who have not, that are meant to protect them so 
they do not suffer, are being compromised.
<P>
	Government members like to claim they are the great white 
knights, that they are the compassionate ones, that they are the ones 
who are trying to protect the poor and the underprivileged. 
However, they are actually doing an  absolutely huge disservice to 
Canadians, in particular the poor, by not getting our fiscal house in 
order.
<P>
	Fiscal irresponsibility, not getting our deficit down to zero which 
would produce a surplus budget and bring down the debt, is the 
single greatest threat to our social programs and the single greatest 
threat to the poor and the underprivileged. It is the single greatest 
threat to our ability to provide health care to Canadians in a timely 
fashion. However, the government continues to play political 
football with these issues and not lead from the front. It is leading 
through polls and focus groups but it is not saying what it is going 
to do.
<P>
	Perhaps the flavour of what the government has been doing in 
the last three and a half years can be summarized by an Italian 
politician from the 19th century who said something like this: 
``There go my people. I had better find out where they are going so 
I can lead them''. In effect that is what this government has been 
doing for the most part over the past three and a half years.
<P>
	However, the government has done some good things. I 
commend the government members on their ability to increase free 
trade, in particular in the new Canada-Chile free trade agreement. I 
applaud them in trying to establish links with other countries. This 
is very important and they must continue to pursue that as part of 
their agenda.
<P>
	There are other issues the government has failed to do which 
compromise all provinces. In particular, it has compromised the 
people of Quebec on the issue of Quebec sovereignty. If we look 
back at history we find that the issue of Quebec nationalism and 
Quebec sovereignty is something like a sinusoidal curve with 
public interest on the <I>y</I> axis and time on the <I>x</I> axis. Public interest 
and political interest increases to a fervour at referendum time. As 
soon as the referendum is over interest declines to a nadir.
<P>
	Unfortunately the premier of Quebec, Mr. Bouchard, and the 
Parti Quebecois are working very strongly to pursue an agenda for 
separation. Given this very obvious fact, the government is doing 
nothing to improve interprovincial relations, devolve some federal 
powers to all provinces, not just Quebec, in a way that would 
improve the efficiency services like housing, education, manpower 
and training, health care, which provinces already have 
responsibility for but which the government attaches strings to.
<P>
<B>(1205 )</B>
<P>
	These are all issues from which all provinces can benefit. If the 
government were to take a leadership role, it would sit down with 
all the provinces and ask them what it does best as a federal 
government and what they do best as a provincial government and 
then devolve those responsibilities. The feds should do what they 
do best and the provinces should do what they do best. This  would 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9254"> 9254 </A></B>
<P>
increase efficiency and decrease the burden on the taxpayer 
through decreasing costs.
<P>
	Instead of taking this initiative, the government has done 
absolutely nothing since the last referendum on this issue. Despite 
what some people might say, the threat of separation and the threat 
of a unilateral declaration of independence is causing great 
uncertainty and is crushing the economic lifeblood out of Quebec.
<P>
	It is a sad thing for me to see what a wonderful city Montreal 
was-it still is-an incredible, lively, vibrant and economically 
strong Montreal when I lived in Toronto in the 1970s and 1980s, a 
place everyone looked to as being a magical place which had so 
much to offer to Canada. Unfortunately the threat of separation has 
gutted its economic ability and has decreased the moral of people 
there. It is a very sad thing to see. It is compromising their ability to 
get on with their lives and build a strong city not only for Quebec 
but for all of Canada.
<P>
	Furthermore, it is compromising the ability of all people of 
Quebec to be socially and economically strong and stable as 
individuals, families and communities.
<P>
	I challenge members again to look at the proposals the Reform 
Party put forward prior to the last election. They are sensible 
proposals, fair proposals and proposals that are for all Canadians 
across the country equally. They are not predicated on a distinct 
society for one province. They are not predicated on providing laws 
and regulations and privileges for one province over another. They 
are based on giving an equal hand to all provinces and all 
Canadians for the betterment of all people.
<P>
	I encourage everyone to do this because if the government does 
not take this issue seriously, if it does not address this issue now, 
when the next referendum comes along the government will be 
scurrying to put forth a plan and it will be too late. We will help put 
forward a good plan for all Canadians. We will help build a 
stronger Canada for all Canadians. However, we ask this 
government's co-operation.
<P>
	We also ask for the co-operation of all honest, well meaning 
people in Quebec that if they are interested in building a stronger 
province for themselves, their families, their children and their 
communities, if they are interested in building a stronger nation, 
they must join with all of us to do this.
<P>
	It would be interesting for them to know, if this ever gets out to 
the people of Quebec, that the issues, fears and aspirations that the 
people of Quebec have, by and large, are very much the same as 
those shared by Canadians in every single province.
<P>
	I do not care whether someone lives in Cache Creek, British 
Columbia or in Nanaimo, Victoria, Baie Comeau, Toronto, North 
Bay or in Shediac, the aspirations and the fears of having a job, 
living in a safe environment, having a future for oneself and one's 
children and having  a stronger future for everybody are shared by 
all Canadians.
<P>
	It is within that area of communality that we must come together 
to build a stronger nation. If we continue to divide this country up 
into areas, the west, central Canada, the maritimes, Quebec, 
francophones, anglophones, immigrants, hyphenated Canadians, if 
we continue to do that then we will have a balkanized nation and 
we will be just but a shadow of what we can be as a nation.
<P>
<B>(1210)</B>
<P>
	If, however, we lead from that front and come together in an area 
of common interest, shoulder to shoulder to build a stronger nation, 
indeed that is what we will have. We will rightly take our place in 
the international community as one of its leaders.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Etobicoke North, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
thank the hon. member for Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca for his very 
considered comments. I would like to talk to the hon. member's 
comments with respect to taxation and some of the myths he and 
his party have been promoting about the government's increasing 
taxes.
<P>
	I would like to speak briefly on the question of skills, training, 
research and development and how that is so important to 
achieving our competitive position in the world and creating more 
prosperity for Canadians.
<P>
	While I would not say that in R and D and training we have and 
are doing everything that we should as a government, we are 
providing some leadership in these areas. For example, I attended 
an award ceremony in my riding for 14 young students who had 
just come through an internship program.
<P>
	They had been offered internship positions in companies and 
they were able to develop their skills on the job at Humber College. 
They were then in a position to go into these companies full time. 
The companies took the risk, gave them the chance to development 
their skills and now they have a job. They have some experience 
and they are employed. I am sure they will add value to these 
companies. That is the kind of thing we should be doing more of 
because young people today are in the dilemma of not being able to 
find jobs because they lack experience.
<P>
	In the last budget we introduced there were 19,000 new 
internship positions created. This will allow young people to enter 
the work force and create the skill sets that are going to be needed.
<P>
	I am working on a project in my riding, the telecommunications 
learning institute, which will create the skills that are going to be 
needed by the telecommunications industry in the future. These 
initiatives are very positive. We are doing much but we could be 
doing more perhaps.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9255"> 9255 </A></B>
<P>
	In the area of innovation the hon. member graciously 
acknowledges the $800 million the government has put into the 
Canadian foundation for innovation. This is a hugely beneficial 
initiative that will help to build our technology infrastructure and 
allow us to be very competitive.
<P>
	With respect to taxes there is a lot one could get into but without 
the time I will not do that. I have not looked at the statistics lately 
but it is my understanding that direct foreign investment into 
Canada is still very strong and positive. If the tax burdens in 
Canada were so bad for business why would they not stay away? I 
find it mischievous to say the least that the hon. member and his 
party talk about the government's increasing taxes. I do not know 
how many times I have seen our finance minister stand up with his 
budget and say the words no new taxes. I did not see the parties 
opposite challenge him then.
<P>
	I think they are playing on words with respect to indexing of 
deductions and personal exemptions which are effectively in their 
jargon or in their political rhetoric. We have increased taxes to the 
banks. We have closed loopholes and we have a much larger tax 
base because of a much stronger economy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I commend my colleague from the Liberal Party for his 
innovation and initiatives in his riding. It is a very important thing 
to do. Canadian youth are looking for leadership in their political 
leaders in pursuing that.
<P>
	However, let us talk about taxes for a moment. There have been 
37 tax increases and I will give a couple of examples. The last was 
the CPP increase which is going to remove $10 billion from the 
pockets of Canadians and is going to cost jobs, jobs, jobs.
<P>
	Second, the increased gasoline taxes have spread across to all 
Canadians. Those who hurt the most are those who are poorest 
because they are on fixed incomes.
<P>
<B>(1215)</B>
<P>
	I also raise the cold, hard salient fact that our country has been 
burdened by the highest, consistent level of unemployment at10 per cent since the government was elected. Those are facts and 
that is the state of affairs of our economy.
<P>
	I am sure the hon. member goes into his riding to speak to 
businessmen. He cannot get a message that is different from what 
the rest of us hear. They must tell him that their greatest restriction 
in their ability to be competitive is the taxation levels that are 
crushing the daylights out of them. The government has done 
nothing about it.
<P>
	One need not look any further than at the underground economy 
which is growing by leaps and bounds. Members do not have to 
take my word for it. They can go into their own ridings to find out. 
It is the  palpable, factual evidence that we have to demonstrate the 
economic proposals of the government have not improved our 
economy but have crushed it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
want to touch on the issue of the CPP as a tax increase. We all know 
we are talking about semantics. Generically we refer to deductions 
on someone's paycheque as payroll taxes.
<P>
	As a chartered accountant I look at the income statement or the 
revenue and expenses of a government. If Canada pension plan 
contributions by employees and employers are collected by the 
government, why it is that those premiums do not get added to 
government revenues?
<P>
	Let us look at the definition of a tax. A tax is something that 
increases government revenues. The member will well know 
Canada pension plan premiums do not increase government 
revenue. They go into an investment fund for the future benefit of 
those contributing to the Canada pension plan.
<P>
	In order to sustain the Canada pension plan program for all 
Canadians and put it on a stable footing forever premiums have to 
go up. Today's pensioners are getting about $8 for every $1 going 
in. If the premiums go up for individuals, all other things remaining 
equal, it is a greater deduction on their personal tax returns. This 
means they will pay less tax on the same level of income, which 
again reduces government revenue.
<P>
	Even corporations that have to match the employee's 
contribution to CPP will be paying a little more over the years as 
the premiums increase to make sure those benefits can be provided. 
That means the deductions for businesses on employee benefits 
will go up. Corporations will pay a little less income tax than they 
otherwise would, all other things remaining equal.
<P>
	On balance, we know the CPP premiums do not go into revenue. 
We also know that individuals and corporations are paying less tax 
because of the CPP increases, which means that the deficit actually 
has increased for the Government of Canada simply by raising CPP 
premiums.
<P>
	The irony, though, is simply that CPP premiums do not go to 
government revenue and do not reduce the deficit. I ask the 
member to answer this question. If it does not go to government 
revenue and it does not reduce the deficit, how can we call it a tax?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
am very glad my hon. friend actually agrees with me that CPP is a 
payroll tax.
<P>
	By an extension of his argument he would also have to agree that 
employment insurance is a tax and employment insurance is 
running a $6 billion surplus.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> That goes into government revenues.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9256"> 9256 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> That goes into 
government revenues. The member cannot have it both ways. 
Where the money is going is not the issue. The fact is that this 
money has been yanked out of the pockets of individuals and 
companies. It is a price they must pay.
<P>
<B>(1220 )</B>
<P>
	Interestingly enough this is not the end of it. The chief actuary 
has said that the CPP is actuarially unsound. This increase is not the 
end. As the baby boomers start to retire it is quite likely it will 
increase from 10 per cent to 14 per cent. As I said, it is money that 
comes out of the pockets of individuals and companies.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, BQ):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I too am pleased to speak to Bill C-70, the Senate 
amendment and the government's response to this Senate 
amendment, on which we are being asked to vote.
<P>
	At this stage of the game regarding Bill C-70, the GST bill, it 
may be useful to review a bit of the history of the bill, so that our 
listeners know exactly where things stand.
<P>
	First of all, one must realize that Bill C-70, together with the 
Senate amendment and the positive response from the government, 
is the result of an election promise. That is how the GST bill got its 
start.
<P>
	In the March 11, 1996 edition of the <I>Globe and Mail</I>, the Deputy 
Prime Minister was quoted as saying:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``I have already said personally and very directly that if the GST 
is not abolished I will resign''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We will recall that the Deputy Prime Minister made that 
commitment precisely because a promise had been made to kill the 
GST. The cost of this empty promise, at least inasmuch as it relates 
to the Deputy Prime Minister's decision: $500,000. That is how 
much the byelection in the riding of Hamilton East cost. Strangely 
enough, although the Deputy Prime Minister had made a promise 
to all Canadians and Quebecers, she let the people of Hamilton East 
settle the issue on behalf of all Canadians.
<P>
	During the 1993 election campaign, the current Prime Minister 
said, and I quote: ``We will scrap the GST''. To scrap means to kill, 
to eliminate, not replace the tax with more of the same, just by 
changing the name of the tax, to make it look like the election 
promise was kept.
<P>
	On May 2, 1994, the Prime Minister made the following 
statement about the GST: ``We hate it and we will kill it''. On the 
basis of this election promise, as we know, the Deputy Prime 
Minister was later forced to resign and run in a byelection.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance has said openly both in this House and 
outside: ``We should never have made such a promise. It was a 
mistake''.
<P>
	As for the Prime Minister, he maintains he never promised any 
such thing. We have the videos, and the press clippings, in French 
and in English, to prove he did, but he still maintains he never said 
it. We now know what people think of this unfulfilled promise 
about the GST. In fact, there are many unfulfilled commitments 
made by the Liberals, including: tearing up the free trade 
agreement that was signed; recognizing Quebec as a distinct 
society and giving it a veto, something that was never done, as 
Quebecers know; deprivatizing Pearson airport, and we are all 
aware that this issue has become a real mess; creating jobs, but the 
number of unemployed is just as high as it was when the Liberals 
took office, while there are an additional 500,000 children living in 
poverty.
<P>
	These were promises made during the election campaign. I 
remember taking part in a debate, in my riding of 
Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, with my opponents of the time. 
People asked each and everyone of us what we would do with the 
GST.
<P>
	I remember that the Liberal candidate of the time, Normand 
Biron, said the GST would be abolished, which was his party's 
official position.
<P>
<B>(1225)</B>
<P>
	I have no grudge against Mr. Biron, who is an excellent person. 
He is also a good, intelligent and strong candidate, who is familiar 
with the issues and who is very involved in the local community. 
Strangely enough though, the Liberals are trying to get rid of him. 
They have chosen someone from Quebec City to run againstMr. Biron for the Liberal nomination. That person will have to 
resign in Quebec City to run against Mr. Biron. I find it sad that the 
higher ups in the Liberal Party are trying to get rid of one of their 
best people.
<P>
	What did the Liberals have to say about the GST when the 
Conservatives were trying to put it in place, and when they formed 
the opposition? Here are some excerpts from the November 1989 
Liberal minority report on the GST. These comments were made 
when the Liberals formed the opposition. On page 283, and again 
these remarks are from Liberal members, we find the following: 
``The Liberal members of the finance committee maintain that the 
goods and services tax proposed by the Tory government is bad and 
that no 'repair job' of any kind will make it fair for taxpayers''.
<P>
	What are the Liberals doing with Bill C-70, if not a repair job? 
The GST remains the same and its rate remains the same. In fact, it 
is the provincial tax that is being harmonized. The Liberals are only 
doing a repair job on the Conservatives' GST and, if we are to 
believe their own words, given that only the name of that tax was 
changed, this new HST is as bad and unfair for taxpayers as the old 
GST.
<P>
	Here is another excerpt from the Liberal minority report of the 
time. This one is from page 300, and I  quote: ``Sales tax reform 
cannot be undertaken independent from income tax reform, corpo-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9257"> 9257 </A></B>
<P>
rate tax reform, social welfare reform or independently of the other 
levels of government. Canada is in need of an overall tax reform 
that encompasses all forms of taxation and all levels of 
government''.
<P>
	The fact is that no tax reform took place. The Bloc Quebecois is 
the only party that tabled a comprehensive study on tax reform, for 
both corporations and individuals, which is a first in Canadian 
history. The fact is that on certain occasions governments have 
proposed tax reforms, but it has never happened, in the whole 
history of Canada, that an official opposition party has proposed 
these reforms to the government, after studying them with the 
resources available to the opposition for research, resources that 
are meagre compared to the absolutely enormous resources 
available to governments.
<P>
	After these broken election promises, Bill C-70 was introduced 
in the House, went to second reading, to committee, and then to 
third reading, as a cover-up for the unkept promises. We know that 
in many other cases, cover-ups have been the standard procedure.
<P>
	There is the tainted blood inquiry, the Krever inquiry. There is 
the Airbus affair, where top-ranking government officials sent 
letters incriminating Mr. Mulroney, treating him like a criminal, to 
Europe, when it is common knowledge that Canada has a very strict 
law known as the presumption of innocence. This law says that 
people are officially innocent-in the best sense of the word of 
course-until proven guilty.
<P>
	But these laws were ignored. In official letters from the 
government, outside Canada, Mr. Mulroney was called a criminal. 
There was the Somalia inquiry, which they are now gagging, while 
the judge in charge of the inquiry says himself that they will never 
get to the bottom of things if they are prevented from investigating 
further.
<P>
	The minister tells us that this inquiry has already been granted 
two extensions and that they want to wrap things up. They were 
nice, they allowed more time. But let it not be forgotten that the 
reason a little more time was needed for this inquiry, or for those 
conducting it, was precisely because for months and months and 
months the army concealed documents that were being looked for 
everywhere. If extra time was needed at one point, it was not 
because the government was being nice, but because the documents 
were not available because the army had hidden them.
<P>
	Bill C-70 contains the amendments allowing harmonization of 
the GST with three maritime provinces, and of course this is a 
cover-up to help the pill go down more easily. They are sending a 
billion dollars to the maritimes.
<P>
<B>(1230)</B>
<P>
	What is the government's motivation in doing so? We know very 
well. The Liberal government is, of course,  embarrassed that the 
Prime Minister and the Minister of Canadian Heritage broke their 
promise to scrap the GST, the tax they claim to hate.
<P>
	So, in order to have more than just excuses when questioned on 
this broken promise when the election comes, the Liberals want at 
all costs to reach an agreement with the maritimes, in order to give 
the impression that they have tried to do something about keeping 
that promise. Even if this bad promise will cost Quebecers and 
Canadians close to $1 billion, what counts for the Liberals is to get 
the fat out of the fire, and to do so as promptly as possible.
<P>
	This new harmonized sales tax, the HST, will be included in the 
price, or at least that is what the government was proposing before 
the Senate returned the bill with an amendment that states 
otherwise.
<P>
	To return to the 1989 Liberal minority report, what did the 
Liberals have to say about this suggestion to include the GST in the 
price? On page 298 they state as follows: ``If the GST is 
camouflaged in the price, it will be far easier for the government to 
raise it later on''. They put a serious damper on the idea of 
including the tax in the price. Until just recently, they wanted to do 
exactly the opposite of what they claimed in 1989 was not a good 
idea.
<P>
	What is more, some years ago the Minister of Finance was 
saying the exact opposite of what he has done in his bill. The new 
GST is hypocritical, because it is camouflaged in the price of goods 
and services. On this subject, the 1994 Liberal majority report 
stated, and I quote: ``It would simply be improper to ``hide'' from 
Canadians the amount of tax they pay to their governments, and 
hiding the tax interferes with the ability of taxpayers to make 
government accountable for the taxes it levies and, to a lesser 
degree, for how it spends the revenues''. That is what the latest 
Liberal report said, yet they are about to do just the opposite.
<P>
	In 1994, the Chamber of Commerce of Canada surveyed its 
members, 70 per cent of whom were opposed to the idea of hiding 
the tax in the sales price. This survey is still valid today. In 
February 1996, the Chamber of Commerce conducted the same 
survey again, just to realize that 76 per cent of its members now 
held that opinion.
<P>
	Through all the stages-second reading, committee study, third 
reading-the Bloc Quebecois expressed a number of concerns 
about this bill. We suggested the government should meet with the 
people of the maritimes before imposing a harmonization they 
clearly did not want. In spite of the work done in committee, and 
repeated requests from the Bloc Quebecois, all our arguments fell 
on deaf ears.
<P>
	The Bloc also recommended that the HST not be included in the 
sales price. This is another point made by the Bloc that the 
government ignored until the Senate  came up with this proposal to
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9258"> 9258 </A></B>
<P>
delay tax included pricing until 51 per cent of Canada's population 
agrees to include the GST in pricing.
<P>
	The changes proposed by the Senate are identical to those 
previously proposed by the Bloc Quebecois and rejected by the 
government. How will the government respond to the Senate? This 
is what the motion before us today is all about. It reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House, while disapproving of any infraction of its privileges or rights by 
the other House, in this case waives its claim to insist upon such rights and privileges, 
but the waiver of said rights and privileges is not to be drawn into a precedent-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	They disapprove, but agree just the same.
<P>
<B>(1235)</B>
<P>
	So, the government made sure to tell the senators: ``We accept 
your amendment, even though we rejected the same amendment 
when it was proposed by the Bloc Quebecois. We accept it, 
provided you will not see this as a precedent''. But, as was pointed 
out by my colleagues, it is very disturbing to see the government 
accept a legislative amendment from a House whose members 
were not elected, after rejecting the same amendment when it was 
proposed by elected members of this House.
<P>
	Unfortunately, the senators did not do as we did in this matter. 
We in the Bloc Quebecois also demanded that the government 
pay-and yesterday again we asked questions on this issue to the 
Minister of Finance and to the Prime Minister-$2 billion in 
compensation to Quebec for having harmonized its own tax with 
the GST, long before any other province. In so doing, Quebec 
showed that it was perfectly able to get along with the federal 
government, in fact more so than the other provinces. Yet, the 
maritimes received $1 billion, while Quebec got nothing at all. We 
are owed $2 billion, and the hon. member for Chambly clearly 
explained why Quebec is justified in making that claim.
<P>
	In the end, what was the cost, to Quebecers, of this whole 
operation to cover up unfulfilled promises? Again, let us look only 
at the costs which can actually be estimated. First, the re-election 
of the Deputy Prime Minister cost $500,000. As you know, Madam 
Speaker, 25 per cent of Canada's revenues come from Quebec, 
which means that 25 per cent of federal spending in Canada is paid 
by Quebecers. Therefore, the re-election of the Deputy Prime 
Minister, who was forced to resign as a result of an unfulfilled 
promise, cost Quebecers $125,000.
<P>
	Let me explain, for those who are listening to us. We understand 
what $25 represents. Billions of dollars is a lot of money: one 
billion dollars is equal to 1,000 million dollars. So, 2,000 million 
dollars is owed to Quebec for having harmonized its tax with the 
GST, but it will not get one penny. So, $125,000 to elect the Deputy 
Prime Minister, 2,000 million dollars that should come our way for 
the GST, plus the $1 billion they are giving to the  maritimes. Once 
again, I repeat that 25 per cent of everything Canada pays out 
comes from Quebec; of the $1 billion going to the maritimes, $250 
million comes from Quebec.
<P>
	This is common knowledge. It has come up in oral question 
period. It is still getting a lot of coverage in the newspapers. What 
is Mr. McKenna doing in Quebec? He is wooing away our own 
businesses with money we provided that was transferred to New 
Brunswick.
<P>
	So, the total cost of this operation, of this broken promise to 
scrap the GST, leaving us with a botched Bill C-70, is $125,000 to 
elect the Deputy Prime Minister; 2,000 million dollars due Quebec 
that it will probably not receive; and $250 million of Quebecers' 
money going to the maritimes. All so that the maritimes can 
conduct their corporate raiding in Quebec.
<P>
	In the case of all bills tabled in the House, the Bloc Quebecois 
has done the work it was elected to do, which was to defend 
Quebec's interests ahead of all else.
<P>
	It is extremely tiring in the long run to defend oneself daily, to go 
after dribs and drabs of rights and powers, or to try to hang on to 
dribs and drabs of rights and powers, when the only way out, for 
Quebecers, is to have full rights and powers. For this to be possible, 
we must become a country.
<P>
	Each of the bills introduced here in the House-
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> You lost the referendum.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pomerleau:</B> I will come back to that. That is what I was 
going to reply to my colleague.
<P>
<B>(1240)</B>
<P>
	In fact, we lost the last referendum and I have often heard my 
colleagues in the Reform Party wondering why we did not respect 
the decision of Quebecers.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois and the Parti Quebecois are political parties 
advocating the sovereignty of Quebec. We are not the ones who 
decide, of course; that is up to the people of Quebec. To this end, 
we must hold referendums in Quebec. We cannot, however, hold 
referendums unless we have been elected to do so. In the end, 
therefore, it is the people of Quebec themselves who decide 
whether or not they want referendums by electing or by not electing 
the Parti Quebecois, which alone, of course, can make this 
proposal.
<P>
	We therefore have great reservations about this bill, another 
promise not kept.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, the 
Bloc separatists keep saying that the people of Quebec want all 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9259"> 9259 </A></B>
<P>
these things, that they want to separate, but they did lose the 
referendum. The people in Quebec  said they do not want to 
separate. If this government had done its job, of course the margin 
would have been far greater than it actually was; however, we will 
leave that debate for another day.
<P>
	They always seem to get back to the issue of money and how 
they have missed out on the billion dollars that has been given to 
Atlantic Canadians by the Minister of Finance. They feel that they 
are entitled to the same or more because they are in Quebec and 
have harmonized voluntarily with the GST. They feel that shucks, 
why do they not get money as well?
<P>
	Let us look at it. The Prime Minister signed an agreement with 
the province of British Columbia a few weeks ago to pay it more 
money for immigration. I do not exactly have my numbers right but 
I understand a lot more new immigrants are going to British 
Columbia than are going to the province of Quebec. However, the 
province of Quebec is getting a lot more money to handle 
immigration than the province of British Columbia. I do not hear 
Quebec members saying that it seems they are getting too much 
money and maybe they should give some of that money back. We 
do not hear that.
<P>
	The great equalization program has been part of our Canadian 
way of working with the provinces and has been around for about 
40 years. The provinces that are more prosperous pay money to 
those which are less affluent. As Reformers we do not disagree 
with that philosophy.
<P>
	The province of Quebec has always been one of the have not 
provinces and the money has been flowing to it. The have 
provinces are primarily Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia. 
Quebec and Ontario are right next to a fabulous market with 100 
million people on the eastern seaboard of the United States. Across 
the Atlantic, there are 250 million people in Europe, a phenomenal 
market for the manufactured goods of the provinces of Quebec and 
Ontario. Markets are opening up around the world but Quebec is 
still a have not province. It is a perennial have not province.
<P>
	The politicians in Quebec should say that they want to be part of 
this great country Canada and that they want to play their part in 
creating jobs for the people of Quebec and trade with the eastern 
seaboard of the United States through the free trade agreement. 
They should say that they want to trade with the rest of Canada and 
bring down the barriers that have been built between provinces, so 
that they can expand jobs, create jobs, create wealth, create 
opportunity and create hope for their children, rather than just 
saying that they want a subsidy too.
<P>
	When will the Bloc and the separatists start to see that there are 
far greater opportunities within Canada through participating in 
economic development rather than keeping the old, old story that 
they have been hard done by and please send them more money. 
That story  will not work. I think the people in Quebec and the rest 
of the country want jobs, an opportunity and an education. They 
want to prosper. That is what they want.
<P>
<B>(1245)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pomerleau:</B> Madam Speaker, first I would like to say to my 
colleague that we are not the only province, we are not alone in 
asking for compensation, since three provinces agree with us on 
this, and the BC premier acknowledges that Quebec should be 
compensated.
<P>
	I was listening to a colleague before me say, in response or in a 
question to another member who spoke before me, that the Reform 
Party's position is that the maritimes should never have been 
compensated.
<P>
	Had the maritimes not had any compensation, Quebec would not 
be asking for any. What we want is fairness. If a thousand million 
dollars are sent to the maritimes, we in Quebec are entitled to ask 
for the $2 billion due us, which the Liberal Party is denying us.
<P>
	As far as the sovereignist movement is concerned, I would 
remind my colleague that Quebec's demands have been known, 
clear and simple for 40 years. All Quebec politicians, whatever 
their party, have said the same thing. In the mid-1950s, Mr. 
Duplessis demanded his share of the spoils. Mr. Duplessis was a 
member of the Union Nationale party.
<P>
	He was followed by Mr. Lesage, a Liberal and a federalist, who 
talked of Quebecers being masters in their own home. Next came 
someone else from the Union Nationale, Daniel Johnson Sr., who 
called for ``equality or independence''. Then came René Lévesque, 
who said: ``We cannot go on fighting endlessly like this for 30 
years; what we want is Quebec's sovereignty''.
<P>
	Through all these movements and all these premiers, Quebec 
continued to make the same clear and simple demand. These 
people were federalists. Quebec has always asked to be recognized 
for what it is-a nation-with certain privileges in the Constitution 
enabling it to defend itself as a nation. Nothing more, nothing less.
<P>
	The refusal by the Canadian government and the Canadian 
establishment to accept this fact will mean that Quebec will 
become a country, in the long term. A look at the sovereignty 
movement in Quebec leaves no doubt that it is a growing 
movement. The Parti Quebecois was born in 1968. There were 
hardly any sovereignists in the early 1960s in Quebec. In 1968, the 
PQ was born. That was less than 30 years ago.
<P>
	In 1976, the Parti Quebecois was elected for the first time and 
formed the government in the National Assembly. Three 
referendums were held. In the first, in 1980, the no vote was 60 per 
cent and the yes vote, 40 per cent. In the Charlottetown 
referendum, it was the reverse: 60 per cent voted against the 
Charlottetown  accord. Canadians voted against the accord too, for 
reasons differ-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9260"> 9260 </A></B>
<P>
ent from ours: they thought we had too much already. In the last 
referendum, it was 50-50. So it is clear that the sovereignist 
movement has grown in the past 28 or 29 years.
<P>
	The government could stop this movement tomorrow, if it 
wanted. It would be very easy to do, by recognizing in the 
Constitution that the people of Quebec form a nation and, 
therefore, have the right to protect themselves and this concept of a 
nation.
<P>
	That is all Quebecers are asking for. Not me. Personally, I am an 
unconditional sovereignist, in that I fail to see any point in a nation 
living as a minority within another nation, because as a minority, 
you then have to do as you are told; you do what they want, when 
they want.
<P>
	I want to be independent. I want to make my own choices, speak 
on my own behalf and take my own responsibilities. That is how it 
should be.
<P>
	But that, we will never get from Canada. I will never be a true 
federalist, but if this kind of recognition was included in the 
Constitution, most Quebecers would go for it. They would sign the 
Constitution they have never signed, and I would democratically 
fall in with the people's will and stop fighting for sovereignty. But 
that will never happen because this Prime Minister and his 
predecessors have never stopped attacking Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
	Remember the long knives stuck in the back of René Lévesque 
by Trudeau and the little guy from Shawinigan, who will soon be 
calling an election and whom we will beat in his own riding.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, the 
member from the Bloc moved this debate into a very interesting 
area but not entirely on topic since we are discussing Bill C-70, the 
HST tax proposed by the Liberal government.
<P>
	I would like to say a kind word about the member. I noticed he is 
wearing a daffodil on his jacket. I want to mention, and I will be 
mentioning again later today, that the daffodils come compliments 
of CKNW-98, a radio station in Vancouver. This is a tradition it 
does every year at this time for the first day of spring. I thank the 
member for wearing that daffodil. I notice a few other members 
have them as well. They are set out nicely in vases in our lobbies as 
well.
<P>
	I would like to refer back to a government member who gave a 
speech approximately an hour ago. I had wanted to question him 
but unfortunately we ran out of time. During his speech he said 
what a wonderful job the Liberal government had done. He 
mentioned that exports were at record highs. He forgot to mention 
of course that is due to NAFTA which was one of those things the  
Liberals said they would oppose. They were going to renegotiate 
NAFTA, scrap it if necessary and here they are now trying to claim 
credit for something they did not want anything to do with.
<P>
	In addition, we have low interest rates that they constantly claim 
credit for and what a wonderful thing it is. And yet it was the low 
inflation policies of the Bank of Canada that gave us low interest 
rates, not the Liberals. They are very happy to take credit for all 
these things that they did not do and that they have even opposed. 
When they were in opposition they opposed the interest rate policy 
of the Bank of Canada and now here they are wanting to take credit 
for it.
<P>
	Through all of that they will not take any credit for the 
unemployment figures or that for their entire time in office the 
unemployment levels have remained at unacceptably high levels, 
10 per cent to 11 per cent through their entire mandate, making 77 
straight months now of unemployment levels, as high as the last 
depression.
<P>
	When we question them in question period the finance minister 
gets up, takes his glasses off and says ``we have the lowest interest 
rates in the whole world and it is wonderful and people are saving 
so much money on their mortgage''. Of course that is Liberal 
thinking. In order to get a benefit you have to borrow money.
<P>
	What happens to people who do not have a mortgage and are 
struggling to actually get into a house? What happens to the people 
who do not have a car and are struggling to get a car or other 
things? According to the Liberals the only way to save money is to 
actually borrow money and that is typical Liberal tax and spend 
type thinking which put us in the problems we are in today where 
we need a GST and now some sort of HST in order to help pay for 
all these bad decisions of the past, mostly by Liberal governments 
where they have borrowed, taxed and spent trying to make Canada 
prosperous. All they achieved in the end was a lot of misery and 
terrible problems we are facing now and trying to deal with in the 
budgets that come before the House.
<P>
	The HST we are debating today would not even be necessary if 
this government had followed Reform's zero in three plan that was 
proposed in 1993. We would be spending surpluses instead of still 
discussing these massive deficits.
<P>
	Two months ago I was dialling into the Internet via Sympatico, 
the service I use in B.C. It has an introduction page when you first 
dial in and it said: ``Question of the day: Now that the government 
has its deficit down to an excellent $19 billion should it begin 
spending again?''
<P>
<B>(1255 )</B>
<P>
	I almost blew a gasket. Excellent $19 billion deficit? A $19 
billion deficit is not excellent. A $19 billion surplus would be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9261"> 9261 </A></B>
<P>
excellent but a $19 billion deficit, excellent it  is not. You can be 
sure I very quickly put my comments on that chat line.
<P>
	If we had been following Reform's zero in three plan, we would 
be like New Zealand is today. It is running massive surpluses and it 
is able to give people terrific tax cuts instead of trying to introduce 
an HST, hiding the government's tax grab in a newly constructed 
tax that was only obtained by bribing Atlantic premiers with $1 
billion taken from other taxpayers throughout the country to 
subsidize the people in Atlantic Canada with this new HST which 
will end up being the worst tax of their lives. If we think the GST 
was bad, wait until they experience the HST.
<P>
	I mentioned that New Zealand is running surpluses. Many 
members know I am originally from New Zealand. I have watched 
with interest some of the developments there because New 
Zealanders have been through many of the fiscal problems that 
Canada still has to face. For the past three years New Zealand has 
run very healthy surpluses. Remember its economy is only about 
the size of British Columbia's economy, but this past year it ran an 
$8 billion surplus. As a result of that, the New Zealand government 
was able to give the average wage earner in New Zealand a tax 
decrease of $200 a month.
<P>
	Imagine if Canadians were offered today a $200 a month tax 
break instead of a new HST which would strip them of tax money. 
Think of the boost that would be to the economy. Think of the jobs 
it would create if people in Atlantic Canada had an additional $200 
a month in their pockets to spend instead of another tax grab of 
HST.
<P>
	This government should be ashamed of itself. We know that 
what we are going through today is a big hurry up on this bill to try 
to force it through by April 1 because it is the deadline. The 
government is trying to ram this bill through against the wishes of 
many retail groups that have already said that the HST will result in 
lost jobs because of closed businesses right across the province.
<P>
	The Retail Council Canada, independent retailers and many 
large national companies have complained that the tax inclusive 
provision of the legislation would create confusion and add 
additional costs. For example, Woolworth Canada estimated that it 
would consider closing one-quarter of its 126 stores with a 
resulting loss of 300 jobs.
<P>
	We have consistently heard from the finance minister who 
admits that high taxes kill jobs. So it is reasonable to ask, if that 
admission is there, why are we not working to get rid of the GST, as 
was promised by this government. There is a whole list of ministers 
and members on that side of the House who made the promises 
during the election campaign that the GST would be gone, history, 
toast. The most hated tax would be gone. They used the emotion of 
the GST to win power in this place and then let people down by 
breaking the promises.
<P>
	There is a court challenge going on in British Columbia against 
the NDP government for breaking its promises. The court 
challenge is going ahead and will be heard very soon. If the 
government there is found guilty of deceiving the voters by 
breaking its promises, by telling lies in effect, it will be thrown out 
of office and the election declared void.
<P>
	What a healthy thing it would be if we could have similar 
provisions at the federal level. This would force these people to tell 
the truth in their election campaigns. Then they would not say they 
will scrap, abolish, make the GST history, toast, gone forever in 
order to get elected. They would not fiddle around and change the 
rules and say ``all we really meant was to harmonize, to change it, 
not to give any tax relief to Canadians at all, not one cent of tax 
relief, but simply to increase taxes and invent this HST'', the 
horrible sales tax. That is exactly what it is. It is a horrible sales 
tax. It is worse than the GST that preceded it. Certainly constituents 
in my area of the country are very unhappy their tax dollars are 
being used to subsidize this change in the taxation process.
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	In terms of harmonizing and tax inclusive pricing, the average 
person by having a tax inclusive price loses the ability to see what 
portion of that price is government taxation. That is a very serious 
problem. Although it may be printed on the cash register tape, it 
requires a person to examine the printout to see what the taxes are. 
Maybe it will be printed there. That is fine. However when people 
look at the price of an item on the shelf, go to the cash register, 
hand the money over, accept the receipt, put it in their pockets and 
throw it away with the garbage later, they are not concentrating on 
what portion of the price is actually sales tax.
<P>
	It is very important for them to see when they are actually hit 
with the sales tax at the cash register which takes the price up from 
maybe $320 to $395 what the government is taking out of their 
pockets.
<P>
	For taxation to be fair it should be visible. People should know 
what they are paying to the government in terms of taxation. It is a 
bad precedent to have harmonized sales tax that hides the GST in 
tax inclusive pricing.
<P>
	Many retailers and small businesses are very upset that anything 
like this could be proposed. There has been a lot of opposition to 
the bill. Many groups are opposed to it.
<P>
	The Reform Party did a minority report as a result of the finance 
committee hearings on GST harmonization. They were the usual 
type of sham as most committee hearings are, dare I say all 
committee hearings are. Just like debates and votes in this place, 
we know before committee hearings start exactly what the outcome 
will be. That is a very unfortunate fact of life.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9262"> 9262 </A></B>
<P>
	Recently I was visiting New Zealand where there have been 
some quite dramatic parliamentary reforms which make it more 
democratic to work in its house. All committees of the New 
Zealand parliament must report back within six months on every 
piece of business that goes before them. They are not allowed to 
do what happened with the private members' bill that went 
through this place to get rid of section 745. That cannot happen 
under the revised rules in New Zealand. It would have to be 
reported back to the House and action would have to be taken.
<P>
	In addition, every private members bill is votable. The 
assumption is made that if people are intelligent enough or 
responsible enough to be members of the House they should be 
trusted to be able to bring forward pieces of legislation that would 
be voted on. If they have made an error in judgment and introduced 
a stupid piece of legislation, it will be cut down in the vote.
<P>
	Combined with that, there is now proxy voting for members in 
New Zealand. Members who are legitimately in their ridings on 
riding business or away on committees or other legitimate business 
associated with their activities as members of Parliament may vote 
by proxy. They call in their votes to the party whip who during the 
vote in the House stands and says that there are <I>x</I> number of proxy 
votes for or against an issue. That is a very civilized way to conduct 
business.
<P>
	Many of us in these modern days of easy travel and 
communications have to be away from this place doing other 
official duties that prevent us from being present on every vote. We 
are always following the debate because we have access to 
television and news wherever we are. It would certainly be very 
civilized to be able to call in a proxy vote on issues of importance 
to us and to our constituents.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	In addition the committees of the house in New Zealand, ones 
like the one that considered the HST, are structured to be much 
more democratic. Approximately 10 per cent of all chairs are 
selected from opposition parties based on a free vote. The 
vice-chairs of all the committees are selected from the opposition 
parties in proportion to the number of seats they have. That 
division of vice-chairs is arranged between the opposition parties 
according to the particular committees they would like to be 
vice-chairs of.
<P>
	There have been a lot of changes to the rules in that house that 
have made it much more democratic. Cross party voting is actually 
encouraged and not frowned upon at all. On a regular basis 
members vote with the other side.
<P>
	What a tremendous, refreshing thing it would be if we could see 
those sorts of reforms in this place. Then we would not be facing 
the situation we are today with time allocation. A bill is being 
rammed through this place.  Our debating time is being cut off. 
That would not be happening if this place was more democratic.
<P>
	If the government side was responsive to the input, if it truly 
cared about the feedback it was getting and if it allowed its 
members the freedom to truly vote according to the representations 
in front of them, we would not be faced with the time allocation 
problem we are faced with today.
<P>
	Some of the points that were made by our minority committee 
relating to the debate on legislation to harmonize and streamline 
the GST concerned integrity. The member for York-South Weston 
who was responsible for the private member's bill on section 745 
of the Criminal Code was banished from the Liberal Party caucus 
by the Prime Minister for voting on a matter of principle, on a 
matter of integrity, on a matter of promising to get rid of the GST.
<P>
	What a terrible shame to see such an infringement upon 
democracy. Members are not free to represent their constituents, to 
truly represent them or to vote on principle without suffering total 
banishment from his caucus. Their riding associations are stripped 
of money and virtually put out of party business. It is an awful 
thing to happen. It leads to the situation of today where members 
are afraid to vote against the government, if they are on the 
government side. They are afraid they will lose the nomination, 
lose all their funding, lose their riding association and somebody 
will be parachuted in to take their place.
<P>
	What an appalling comment on how our system is run. It has 
degenerated from the original idea of what Parliament should be. It 
should be a place where people come to debate and discuss the 
issues, come to a conclusion and tell cabinet what it will do. It has 
degenerated to a house of the parties, a place for fulfilling the party 
agenda. The government side of the House thinks that it owns the 
chairs we sit upon, that it owns the desks we sit at and that it can 
dictate to us how we vote.
<P>
	My constituents can be sure that the chair I sit upon and the desk 
I sit at belongs to them. They pay my salary in the House. They are 
entitled to have me represent them. Whenever they can show me 
they have a majority position that is against my party, against my 
personal beliefs or agrees with the government, they can be sure I 
will vote to represent them. I have proven that on three separate 
occasions when I voted against my party line. Once I voted against 
my own beliefs to represent my constituents.
<P>
	I did not get thrown out of my caucus. I did not get my riding 
association banished from the face of the earth. Democracy 
prevailed. In the event it is clear a majority of my constituents want 
me to vote in a certain manner I am obliged to do so by the 
constitution of the Reform Party. It actually requires me to do that. 
<P>

<B><A NAME="9263"> 9263 </A></B>
<P>
That is a major  break for democracy which I hope will gradually 
spread to other areas of the House.
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	I realize that my time has run out at this stage so I will deign to 
sit down. This was my first opportunity to speak to Bill C-70. I look 
forward to hearing more speeches later in the debate.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Kilger:</B> Madam Speaker, on a point of order. There have 
been discussions among the parties, which have agreed to let the 
Minister responsible for Francophonie make a ministerial 
statement on this day celebrating la Francophonie known as the 
Jounée internationale de la Francophonie, followed by the hon. 
member for Verchères, speaking on behalf of the Bloc Quebecois, 
and the hon. member for Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia, on behalf of the Reform Party.
<P>
	So, if you were to seek it, I believe you would find unanimous 
consent.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> Is that agreed?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (North Vancouver):</B> Madam Speaker, I rise on a 
point of order. Normally my speech would be followed by a short 
question and comments period. Will that be taken after the question 
period today?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> The hon. 
member will have 10 minutes of questions and comments.

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="JOURNéEINTERNATIONALEDELAFRANCOPHONIE">JOURNéE INTERNATIONALE DE LA FRANCOPHONIE</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Don Boudria (Minister for International Cooperation 
and Minister responsible for Francophonie, Lib.):</B> It is an 
honour for me as Minister responsible for Francophonie and as a 
French Canadian from eastern Ontario to address the House in 
order to call attention today to the Journée internationale de la 
Francophonie.
<P>
	This event is celebrated today in the prolific web of 49 countries 
and governments that share the use of French.
<P>
	We know that La Francophonie is very much alive in Canada, but 
it is as well in Eastern and Western Europe, Africa the Middle East, 
Asia, the Indian Ocean region and the West Indies.
<P>
	The Government of Canada has participated in La Francophonie 
since the outset, thereby saluting the  importance of the French fact 
in Canada. For this reason, it makes the international francophone 
community an integral and essential part of its foreign policy. We 
wish to demonstrate in this way our desire to highlight the 
contribution of the various Canadian francophone cultures in our 
great country. Whether in Moncton, St. Boniface, Hawkesbury, in 
my riding, or Ste. Marie de Beauce, in Quebec, French is alive and 
well in Canada.
<P>
	Canada is also a member of La Francophonie because it believes 
in the virtues of multilateral relations based on cooperation and 
exchanges. It is no accident that Canada belongs to a great many 
multilateral organizations; from the G7 to the Asia-Pacific Forum, 
from NATO to the Organization of American States, from La 
Francophonie to the Commonwealth, Canada's geography and 
linguistic make-up virtually invite such participation.
<P>
	There are other reasons as well for Canada's very active role in 
La Francophonie; the participating government status enjoyed by 
the provinces of Quebec and New Brunswick enables them to share 
fully in the activities of the francophone world and provides them 
with a way exhibiting their vitality and expertise.
<P>
	In addition, next May 19 to 21, an important conference on 
information highways will bring together in Montreal all the 
ministers of La Francophonie responsible for the information high 
way. This conference, jointly organized by the Agence de la 
Francophonie, the Government of Quebec and the Government of 
Canada, bears witness to the desire to enable the developing 
countries to participate in the modern world by putting the means 
of communication at their service.
<P>
	The Prime Minister of Canada, the Right Hon. Jean Chrétien, 
will go to Vietnam next November to participate in the Hanoi 
Summit and to help make La Francophonie an increasingly 
integrated community. It should not be forgotten that Canada 
hosted the 1987 Summit in Quebec City.
<P>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
	Need I add, especially in your presence, Madam Speaker, that in 
Hanoi, we will once again put forward our candidacy to host the 
Eighth Summit in 1999, this time on Acadian soil in Moncton, New 
Brunswick, a part of the country you know well.
<P>
	I would like to conclude by wishing the 8.5 million francophones 
and all the francophiles from one end of Canada to the other a 
happy Journée internationale de la Francophonie.
<P>
	I must also ask to be excused-I apologize to my hon. colleagues 
across the way-because, as they know, as we speak, there is a 
reception under way for key figures of the Canadian and 
international francophone community, which I am hosting.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9264"> 9264 </A></B>
<P>
	My hon. colleagues are invited of course, when their duties in 
the House of Commons permit, to join me there so that we can 
celebrate all together this great day, not only for the Canadian 
Francophonie, but for all of Canada and all Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
would like to assure the minister that I gladly excuse him, on behalf 
of the political formation I represent here in the House of 
Commons. I understand his obligations, and I certainly have no 
objections, since I know he will read our speeches carefully when 
he gets back to his office a bit later on.
<P>
	First of all, I would like to thank all of my House colleagues for 
allowing us to have this exchange on the Journée internationale de 
la Francophonie. It would, I think, have been terribly unfortunate if 
we were to let the day go by without marking the Journée 
internationale de la Francophonie.
<P>
	I am also extremely pleased to speak in this House today on the 
occasion of the Journée internationale de la Francophonie. To begin 
with, however, I would like to qualify what the minister has just 
said. Quebec was the one to initially show interest in the 
Francophonie, in the early 1960s, via its special relationship with 
France and its subsequent membership in 1971 in ACCT, the 
Agence de coopération culturelle et technique. Moreover, it 
managed to become a full-fledged member of ACCT as a 
participating government only after a great struggle with Ottawa.
<P>
	The federal government then thought up ways to trivialize 
Quebec's presence within the institutions of the Francophonie, 
going so far as to fund New Brunswick's participation in order to 
show the international community that Canada's membership in 
the Francophonie was not solely related to the French character of 
Quebec.
<P>
	Be that as it may, the Francophonie has undergone numerous 
major changes in recent years. The last was in 1996, when the 
ACCT finally became the Agence de la Francophonie. From that 
moment on, the Francophonie became a political body, with a 
Secretary General to be appointed at the Hanoi Summit later this 
year. In this connection, the name of former UN Secretary-General 
Boutros Boutros-Ghali is being circulated at the moment as the 
potential first secretary of the Agence de la Francophonie.
<P>
	This political tack which the Francophonie has taken shows how 
it has matured politically into an internationally recognized forum 
whose membership discusses vital issues. This new vocation also 
requires of us a greater solidarity, cemented together by language 
and culture.
<P>
	At the very moment we are celebrating the great francophone 
family, I find it hard to understand the government's guilty silence 
concerning the catastrophic situation that currently prevails in 
Zaire, where civilian populations are the primary victims of the 
raging conflict. How can we celebrate this day joyfully, when the 
values which we hold dear and defend, the respect of human rights, 
democracy and of the rule of law, are being trampled upon daily in 
a number of the member countries of the Francophonie?
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	Next fall, the Sommet de la Francophonie will be held in 
Vietnam. Canada has always given precedence to multilateral 
approaches for advancing causes it holds dear. Will it take 
advantage of this important occasion to raise certain points, 
including human rights, child labour and excessive defence 
spending in developing countries?
<P>
	Canada could also easily raise the case of Trân Triêu Quân, the 
Canadian citizen who has been unjustly imprisoned in that country 
for far too long already. Like the Commonwealth, the 
Francophonie is an important tool with which we can make the 
world a fairer and a safer place.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, it is an honour for me, 
as Canadian, to address this House on the Journée internationale de 
la Francophonie.
<P>
	I would like to say a word on the importance of multilateral 
relations. The benefits of such relations are the reasons why 
Canada belongs to a number of international organizations. The 
G7, NATO and the Commonwealth are all important structures for 
the promotion of our foreign policy. The Francophonie includes 45 
countries and a few other entities, including Quebec, for example, 
which have in common the use of the French language.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Membership in international organizations should be based on 
enlightened self-interest. It is to our benefit to help maintain 
international stability, but I have some fear that our financial 
contributions through CIDA to certain members of la Francophonie 
represent a disproportionate share of our foreign aid budget. 
Historically we have helped to prop up some very nasty and corrupt 
regimes for no apparent reason other than that the recipients speak 
French. We should perhaps be more careful with our national 
chequebook.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Since 1970, Canada has been a leader in the development of the 
Francophonie. It is also a founding member of the Agence de 
coopération culturelle et technique. Thursday, March 20, is the 
Journée internationale de la Francophonie. Happy Journée 
internationale de la Francophonie to all francophones and 
francophiles who have made Canada a better place.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion and of the 
amendment.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> We will now 
resume from where we left off with questions and comments with 
regard to the speech made by the member for North Vancouver.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
the member was talking about his birthplace of New Zealand and 
all the wonderful things that have been done there.
<P>
	My recollection of the New Zealand situation after it virtually 
went bankrupt was that it brought in a harmonized consumption 
tax. I believe it was 12 per cent and was applied to all goods and 
services, including food and prescription drugs, absolutely 
everything. I am also aware that some changes were made to the 
income tax structure as well which amounted to massive tax 
reductions to high income earners in New Zealand and shifted the 
burden of tax down to the low and middle income earners.
<P>
	I have read analyses of the impact in New Zealand. That scorch 
and burn approach used in New Zealand seems to be the kind of 
approach the Reform Party has been proposing in its budgets and in 
its false start program. It is the same kind of thing where the road 
kill of its citizens is increased poverty, poorer health care or quality 
of health care, poorer social services, higher suicide rates and 
higher family breakdown, all as a result of what the member 
describes as progressive government. Would the member like to 
reassess his position on the wonderful actions in New Zealand and 
maybe recant here and now?
<P>
<B>(1325)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I can tell 
by the comments from the hon. member that he has not visited New 
Zealand because if he had, he would know how foolish his 
comments are. Unfortunately, he has been listening too much to 
Maude Barlow who also has not made any logical analysis of what 
has happened in New Zealand. I can understand why she is opposed 
to it; her special interests are greatly threatened by the things that 
have taken place in New Zealand.
<P>
	In any debate on this issue I always say to people that if they can 
afford to go, please visit New Zealand. When they come back I 
know they will say to me that I was telling the truth and that those 
on the other side who have discredited it really were not.
<P>
	The member mentions such things as a higher teenage suicide 
rate. It is wonderful how figures can lie and liars can figure all of 
that stuff. I am not applying that to the member; I am applying it to 
the people who have used these figures.
<P>
	In one year in New Zealand a mass suicide took place in a Maori 
community. They were sniffing some sort of petroleum product. 
That bumped the suicide rate so high for one year because New 
Zealand has a relatively low suicide rate among youngsters. It was 
used as a basis for claiming that the suicide rate had gone up in 
New Zealand. It is a massive distortion.
<P>
	In addition, there are the crime rate statistics that are used by 
people like Maude Barlow. If the New Zealand police are asked 
about it they say the reason for it is that they changed the computer 
system and the way crimes were reported. Everything that comes 
over on the phone lines is now reported rather than under the old 
manual system when only actual convictions were reported. It 
looks as if there has been a crime rate increase, but there are many 
other things there.
<P>
	The hon. member mentioned the GST in New Zealand. It is true 
that when New Zealand went bankrupt a GST was introduced. That 
had to be done because it was an emergency situation. The 
International Monetary Fund was controlling things.
<P>
	I have had the benefit of sitting down for an hour and a half with 
former prime minister David Lange who was the labour prime 
minister at the time New Zealand went bankrupt. He was gracious 
enough to give me some of his time about two years ago. I never 
thought that I would have deep respect for somebody who was a 
labour prime minister.
<P>
	It was a very interesting and quite impressive discussion. He 
described how his philosophy took a 180 degree turn. He had to 
make a 180 degree turn with respect to what he had believed all of 
his life in terms of socialism. He came to the position that without a 
robust, healthy investor and private sector you cannot have social 
programs. What you end up doing is destroying your country. What 
a massive turnaround that was for him.
<P>
	He told me that once they began the cuts in New Zealand the 
people were so solidly behind them because just like here, they had 
seen the government waste for so long. They could not believe the 
government was actually doing something. It gave such 
tremendous impetus that the government went faster and faster. It 
got the job done so very quickly that very rapidly the recovery 
began.
<P>
	I was down in New Zealand about a month ago. Unfortunately it 
was not on pleasant circumstances because my mother-in-law had 
had a heart attack. I can assure this House that had any members 
been down there with me they would have been really impressed 
with the feeling of vibrancy, the really good feelings that are there. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9266"> 9266 </A></B>
<P>
People feel good about what has happened to their  country. It has 
become competitive internationally. Certainly there was a GST 
introduced and it is still there today.
<P>
<B>(1330)</B>
<P>
	What has happened is that there is a consumption tax. That GST 
is a consumption tax, which is very easy to do in a country that is 
isolated from other countries.
<P>
	In terms of income tax, there have been massive reductions in 
income tax in New Zealand. It should be across the board because 
New Zealand has recognized something that these members 
opposite do not recognize. It is the successful people who create the 
jobs and create the wealth for the country. If they are taxed to the 
point that they leave, their country is destroyed, their jobs are 
destroyed along with everything they stand for.
<P>
	I welcome the question. I am very pleased to have replied. 
Perhaps I was a little harsh on him at the beginning by saying he 
was foolish. That was unfair. I voluntarily retract that even though 
he has not asked me to.
<P>
	I would invite him any time to take a trip to New Zealand, 
hopefully not with a committee because that really is not fair. 
Sometime he should pay for his own trip to New Zealand. There are 
some wonderful deals to go there. Take a look for himself.
<P>
	As soon as he gets back, he can pick up the phone, call Maude 
Barlow and tell her she is completely out of line.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
listened enthusiastically to the member's statement. I was in the 
lobby for part of it. Then I came into the House and listened to the 
rest here. It is interesting to hear the New Zealand experience. It is 
important to express that time and time again.
<P>
	It is really interesting to see how this whole business of 
harmonization came about. I want to put this to the member for 
North Vancouver to address. It is a series of defaults on the part of 
the Liberal government that led up to this point of harmonization.
<P>
	The Liberal government was put into a corner, if you will. It 
started out in part by the heritage minister when she was forced to 
resign and seek re-election at a cost of over $500,000 to the 
taxpayer. It is all over this GST issue.
<P>
	The second point is the finance minister publicly begged 
forgiveness in his statement ``we made a mistake for misleading 
Canadians on the Liberal GST policy''.
<P>
	Then there was another row when the member for York 
South-Weston resigned. I should say he was banished from the 
Liberal caucus. Then the member for Broadview-Greenwood 
temporarily went into self-exile. All this happened over the GST 
issue.
<P>
	I would like to put this forward to the member and seek his 
comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (North Vancouver):</B> Madam Speaker, before I make 
comments about the defaults on the part of the Liberal government, 
while my colleague was speaking a member opposite was yelling 
out that the Deputy Prime Minister was not forced to resign, that 
she did it herself.
<P>
	As soon as my colleague said that it cost $500,000, the very 
same member yelled out: ``That was your fault. You forced her to 
resign''. They cannot have it both ways.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> I wish to 
inform the House that, because of the ministerial statement, 
Government Orders will be extended by 11 minutes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
indeed it is a privilege to debate this topic on GST, specifically the 
harmonization aspect.
<P>
	It was a very key issue in the last election, the hated GST and 
what was going to happen to it. Of course there were promises 
made by the Liberal government to scrap the GST. We heard the 
government's mandate as to how it would deal with it. It has built 
up to this point and again, looking toward the next election, it is 
still an issue. In fact, it is more of an issue now for some. It will 
directly impact the lives of people in Atlantic Canada.
<P>
<B>(1335)</B>
<P>
	All kinds of comments have been made and studies done on this 
particular tax. Is it a good deal or is it a bad deal? I will take the bad 
deal side because it is a bad deal. I have not heard much good about 
it. When we consider what business has said and many of the 
comments made by government leaders, it is a bad deal. The 
resignation of Premier Savage of Nova Scotia no doubt was 
partially due to the harmonization fiasco. Many call it the BST or 
the blended sales tax. That is how it is colloquially known in many 
areas. It is a bad deal.
<P>
	The Atlantic premiers were bribed into signing the deal with a $1 
billion shot in the arm from Canadian taxpayers. The harmonized 
version will amount to 15 per cent as opposed to the 18 per cent 
which the provincial sales tax and the GST amounted to.
<P>
	The tax will have a broader base. People who pay utility bills or 
who make any other purchases will now see the tax hit their 
pockets. It will cost them more. That is how it will impact on the 
average person. The tax will take away from their income.
<P>
	We are living in an age of high taxation. In Canada there is one 
tax after another. The so-called harmonized tax was promoted as a 
tax which would alleviate problems. However, the base is so broad 
that it is costing taxpayers even more.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9267"> 9267 </A></B>
<P>
	How can one justify adding another tax to the already depressed 
area of Atlantic Canada? The tax will not bolster its economy, it 
will do the opposite.
<P>
	What does business say about the tax? Three major retailers in 
Atlantic Canada have stated that their net annual retail deficit will 
total $27 million once harmonization is implemented. Is that not a 
warning sign?
<P>
	One private retailer in the Atlantic region was contemplating 
opening two stores in 1997 but has decided against it as a result of 
increased costs associated with harmonization. Instead of 
expanding and looking at the tax as alleviating some of the 
problems, that retailer is backing off.
<P>
	If someone is going to invest a dollar into business, they want a 
return on that dollar. They want to know that the investment will 
yield a return. That does not seem to be happening. The message 
that the retailers are getting from harmonization is the opposite. 
They are being very cautious about expanding their operations. 
They are being very cautious about investing in business.
<P>
	There are warning signs, but the government plods along and 
will impose this tax on a region which wants nothing to do with it.
<P>
	Both privately owned and publicly owned, traded stores are 
reluctant to explain the problems they face as a result of 
harmonization so as not to jeopardize consumer confidence and the 
value of their stock.
<P>
<B>(1340 )</B>
<P>
	What does that say? It says that this discussion is not as as open 
and as public as they would like it to be but they fear that people 
will withhold, that they will not patronize them, that they will not 
buy their product or that they will look at the operation as 
struggling or as having some significant problem in their affairs. 
That will directly impact on their profit line. It is the profit line that 
we talk about because businesses are only in business to make a 
profit; let's face it, the bottom line.
<P>
	The Retail Council of Canada submitted its findings which 
included this statement: ``By forcing stores to bury the new tax in 
prices, the harmonized tax regime will cost retailers at least $100 
million a year''.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> It is gone.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hanger:</B> Okay, if it is gone, it is gone. These items are very 
important. They show there is a concern expressed by many. Of 
course the retail council submitted those submissions and I agree.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> It is happy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hanger:</B> It is not totally happy, but I agree that as a result of 
its pressure some things have been done. That still does not take 
away from the fact that the tax is hitting a broad base of goods in 
that region. It will impact directly on the pocketbooks of the 
consumer.
<P>
	The Halifax Chamber of Commerce had meetings with the 
committee. It made predictions. One of its predictions was that the 
tax would push up new house prices by 5.5 per cent as well as force 
municipalities to raise property taxes. If the chamber is saying that 
in Halifax obviously that view will be shared by other regions of 
Atlantic Canada. It will impact directly on housing costs and lead 
to increased taxes which will be imposed on the consumer.
<P>
	As this effort continues to impact on the consumer, where is that 
going to put him? Is it going to create more jobs if housing goes 
down? Is it going to encourage those who have finances to go and 
spend? No, it is not. He will have less money to spend in the first 
place because his taxes are going up and house prices will 
definitely impact in that same region.
<P>
	The Canadian Real Estate Association says that harmonization 
will increase the cost of a new house by $4,000 in Nova Scotia and 
in Newfoundland to the tune of $3,374, and in New Brunswick. As 
any family would desire in terms of its own comfort to have a 
house, the opportunities will be slim because $4,000 is a lot. It will 
impact on the down payment. Regardless of how low interest rates 
are the cost of this is impacting right at the consumer level. It is just 
as I mentioned earlier. When you pay your utilities you will see that 
extra hit right there, a broad based tax that did not exist before.
<P>
	The GST harmonization is responsible for the closure of five 
Greenberg stores and the loss of 79 jobs in approximately five 
different locations. There are closures. This will not be the only hit 
in that region but it is one. Woolworth Canada also estimates that 
because of the tax inclusive pricing it might consider closing 126 
stores in the Atlantic region, which means a loss of approximately 
300 jobs.
<P>
<B>(1345 )</B>
<P>
	Another smaller but just as significant retail business, Carleton 
Cards, predicts that it will close 19 of its 37 stores in the region, 
throwing approximately 116 people out of work.
<P>
	It is government's business not to create jobs in the sense that 
they have to be government jobs. It should certainly create jobs by 
creating an atmosphere so business in turn can create jobs. The 
small businessman is the job creator and the engine in society that 
should be creating the jobs. I do not think this is the mandate of the 
government. The harmonization aspect of this tax is yielding other 
concerns. It will certainly impact directly on the whole job market.
<P>
	Management of Carleton Cards also indicates that there is a 
50:50 chance of further store closures and a loss of 71 jobs in eight 
different cities across Atlantic Canada.
<P>
	I have a question for the Liberal government. Why have these 
concerns not been addressed directly? Why have the fears of the 
<P>

<B><A NAME="9268"> 9268 </A></B>
<P>
business community not been put at  ease by the government saying 
this is not happening and the information is to the opposite effect?
<P>
	The bottom line is that consumers will pay more for funeral 
services. They will pay more for children's clothing. They will pay 
more for books, auto repairs, electricity, gasoline, home heating 
fuel, haircuts and myriad other things.
<P>
	In closing, this tax will certainly impact directly on the 
consumer. We are now looking at unemployment rates that are 
unacceptable. They will be a lot higher.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Julian Reed (Halton-Peel, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I want 
to point out one small matter and ask my friend a question as well.
<P>
	The debate over burying the tax in the shelf price or not is by no 
means unanimous. In the riding I serve a large number of retailers 
have begged us to proceed with harmonization. They actually want 
the tax buried in the sticker price and shown on the cash register 
receipt. The member should be aware that this is not unanimous.
<P>
	If a harmonized sales tax is such a bad deal, why are chambers of 
commerce coming to me asking why it is not in Ontario, when it is 
coming and who is holding it up? I have to explain to them the offer 
is open to Ontario to harmonize at any time. The provincial 
governments held harmonization in great favour before the were 
elected have since reversed themselves and are not proceeding with 
the harmonization the business community really wants.
<P>
	If the business community wants it, why is it such a bad deal?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hanger:</B> Madam Speaker, there may be some that seek it in 
the business community. I have heard that reflected from my 
colleagues during the debate. The bottom line is whether 
consumers want the harmonized tax and how it will impact on 
them. That is the important issue. The big retailers certainly do not 
want it.
<P>
<B>(1350)</B>
<P>
	The member keeps speaking about Ontario businessmen running 
to him wanting to know when it is coming into Ontario. Alberta, 
Ontario and British Columbia are not even willing to discuss this 
federal proposal. They know they will have to pay the shot for the 
provinces that cannot make up the difference like Saskatchewan, 
Manitoba and Prince Edward Island. They know they will bear the 
brunt of the difference when it comes to supporting weaker 
provinces.

	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, preventive 
medicine is very popular in Canada these days. With many acute 
care facilities closing it makes only good sense to do what we can 
to stop disease before it starts. Health foods, vitamins, nutritional 
supplements and alternative medical practices are tools to prevent 
disease. These are employed by many thoughtful citizens.
<P>
	The health protection branch and international Codex proposals 
threaten those choices in Canada. For example, melatonin has now 
been banned. Is there any proven harm? No. Is there any proven 
side effect? No. Is there any proven impurity? No.
<P>
	Reform's position on this issue is clear. An informed consumer 
is a far better judge of their health care needs than some distant 
bureaucrat in Ottawa. Our message is also clear to the health 
protection branch and to Codex. Get out of our faces.

	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
December 1994, Stephan Zbikowski, a Canadian citizen, was 
arrested for drug trafficking and is still in jail, in Tocyito, 
Venezuela. This maximum security penitentiary houses the 
country's most dangerous criminals, which raises concerns about 
the personal safety of Mr. Zbikowski, who has no criminal record 
in Canada. Moreover, no guilty verdict has yet been rendered in 
Venezuela.
<P>
	Close to 2,500 people signed a petition asking the Prime 
Minister and the Minister of Foreign Affairs to make 
representations to Venezuelan authorities, so as to bring this most 
preoccupying situation to a positive conclusion. At the request of 
Mr. Zbikowski's mother, I sent the petition to the Prime Minister's 
office.

	<B>Mr. Chris Axworthy (Saskatoon-Clark's Crossing, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the endangered species legislation is currently being 
studied by Parliament but there is one endangered species that is 
being ignored, the Canadian middle class.
<P>
	First, more and more Canadian families are slipping into poverty 
and more families cannot escape poverty.
<P>
	Second, wages have stagnated or declined in Canada over the 
last two decades at the same time as taxes have been consistently 
raised. Wealth and income in Canada has become increasingly 
concentrated in the hands of fewer and fewer people and the gap 
between rich and poor is at 19th century levels. In other words, the 
middle class has all but disappeared.
<P>
	I urge the government to include the Canadian middle class as an 
endangered species in the legislation currently before Parliament. 
Maybe if we can do that we can save the middle class from going 
the way of the dodo bird.

Mr. Speaker, on March 7, I had the pleasure of participating in the 
official opening of the Peel Regional Police community station in 
the Westwood mall in Malton.
<P>
	The opening ceremony was organized by the regional 
municipality of Peel, the Police Services Board and the  Peel 
Regional Police. The community station concept, which was first 
developed in Japan, allows for more accessible, less intimidating 
interaction between police officers and the general public. Not only 
will this station increase citizens' sense of safety and security, it 
will also enhance the current level of police enforcement in the 
region.
<P>
	I encourage the community of Malton to lend its full support and 
cooperation to officers working at the new station. Only by 
working together can we continue to maintain good law and order

<P>
	It has been my experience while appearing before the justice 
committee to witness a letter sent to the chair of the committee and

the bill.
<P>
	This letter bore the letterhead of the Canadian Bar Association

that this was not an isolated circumstance.

	<B>Mr. Philippe Paré (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, today, 
March 20, is the Journée internationale de la Francophonie. The 
Francophonie includes 134 million French speaking people living 
in 49 countries, on all five continents.
<P>
	French has been celebrated for 20 years. It all began when the 
ministers and chiefs of French speaking delegations attending an 
extraordinary session of the General Conference of the Agence de 
coopération culturelle et technique, in Paris, proclaimed March 20 
the Journée mondiale de la Francophonie.
<P>
	The Francophonie is, to use a line coined by Léopold Senghor, 
``this integral humanism which is being knit around the world; this 
symbiosis of dormant energies from all continents, all races, 
waking up to the new warmth''.
<P>
	The Francophonie is a human force which lives and flourishes on 
every continent. Let us pursue our efforts to make the 
Francophonie a haven for peace and solidarity.

spring always starts in the west where nice weather has ensured that

Argenteuil-Papineau, and the resolution was readily defeated.

	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we read in <I>The Gazette</I> today that the Department of 
Canadian Heritage has once again wasted taxpayers' money on 
propaganda activities. Option Canada, an obscure branch office of 
the Council for Canadian Unity, obtained $4.8 million between 
September 24 and December 20, 1995 right in the middle of the 
referendum campaign.
<P>
	Can the Prime Minister tell us just what this money was used 
for?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the member is certainly 
aware of the fact that the Government of Quebec-and I have in my 
hand a copy of the October 11 order in council-gave a total of 
$4.8 million to the Conseil de la souveraineté du Québec headed by 
Yves Duhaime, the great friend of the new leader of the official 
opposition.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Copps:</B> And the Government of Quebec declared in this 
document: ``Whereas the government's objective and mission is to 
advance the cause of Quebec's sovereignty with the people of 
Quebec-'' This was how the government justified spending$4.8 million during the referendum on the sovereignty of Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Government of Quebec hid nothing. If the member for 
Hamilton East would like to ask her friend Daniel Johnson to put 
these questions to the Government of Quebec in the National 
Assembly, let her do so.
<P>
	She is the Minister of Canadian Heritage. She manages the 
public's money. If she could just answer a question from time to 
time.
<P>
	Option Canada was incorporated on September 7, 1995. On 
September 24, 17 days later, the Department of Canadian Heritage 
gave it $1 million. The following October 2, the day after the writ 
was issued, with the referendum in full swing, Option Canada 
received another $2 million from Ottawa.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> It is rare to see the federal bureaucracy act so 
quickly. Tell that to the artists who are still waiting to hear from the 
Minister of Canadian Heritage.
<P>
	Three million in four days is quite something. Does the Prime 
Minister not find it strange that his government gave millions of 
dollars in grants to an agency that had just been incorporated?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9273"> 9273 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I would just like to stress 
the fact that, during the referendum, in an order in council dated 
October 11, 1995-and later we saw that there were other orders 
in council-the Government of Quebec handed over a total of $4.8 
million to Yves Duhaime to promote the sovereignty of Quebec. 
This was by order of the Government of Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, once again, nothing was concealed in Quebec City. That 
does not seem to be the case here, however.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> It is hypocritical.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> We ask the minister one question and she answers 
another; it is always the same. She is unable to carry out her 
responsibilities. Besides which, everything the Conseil de la 
souveraineté did, it did before the referendum period.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	But in this case, we do not know. And these grants in 1995-96 
from the Department of Canadian Heritage to the Council for 
Canadian Unity, and its branch office Option Canada, represent22 per cent of the total envelope that was supposed to be set aside 
for organizations representing official language minority 
communities.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister not find it shocking that money set 
aside for assistance to official language minority communities in 
Canada was diverted like this to secretly fund the federalist forces 
in the no camp during the last referendum campaign, because these 
expenses were never declared? Even the president of the Council 
for Canadian Unity was unaware of the existence of Option 
Canada. It is hard to believe.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, its existence was so secret 
that it appeared in the public accounts under the name Option 
Canada. Big secret.
<P>
	But if the member wants to focus on spending, when we see the 
difficulties of the Quebec economy right now, we would just like to 
point out what was spent by the Government of Quebec in 
connection with the referendum: secretary for restructuring, $9.4 
million; regional commissions on the future of Quebec, $8.5 
million; grants to the Conseil de la souveraineté, $4.8 million; 
mailings to all Quebecers during the referendum, $2 to $3 million; 
hiring firms of lobbyists, $0.5 million; money spent by the office of 
the chief electoral officer, $57.8 million. This comes to a total of 
$82.7 million, according to <I>Le Soleil</I>, which published this article 
when the referendum was over.
<P>
	So, when a government has financial difficulties and spends a 
minimum of $82 million on a referendum, they could have put this 
towards improving the economy, something Quebec really needs.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	An official spokesperson for Heritage Canada said he had no 
idea what use was made of the funds the federal government gave 
to Option Canada. Claude Dauphin, one of the founding presidents 
of Option Canada and the Liberal candidate approached to run in 
Notre-Dame-de-Grâce indicates that these funds were not used to 
fund the no side of the referendum campaign.
<P>
	What guarantees can the Prime Minister give us that the federal 
subsidy to the phantom Option Canada were not used in some way 
to subvert the Quebec referendum act?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, we followed the same 
route as the Conseil pour la souveraineté du Québec, which 
received $4.8 million from the Quebec government, but did not 
spend this money for referendum purposes.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, oddly 
enough, in addition to Claude Dauphin, the founding members of 
Option Canada also include three members of the Council on 
Canadian Unity: Michel Vennat, Jocelyn Beaudouin and René 
Lemaire.
<P>
	Is this incest, to say the least-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> Yes, ladies and gentlemen.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Venne:</B> -the real reason Option Canada obtained millions 
of dollars barely a few days after its incorporation, without having 
to provide any accounting of the use it made of this money?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the extended family of 
the new leader of the Bloc Quebecois includes Yves Duhaime, who, 
obviously, with his sovereignist option received directly a total of 
$4.8 million before and during the referendum period for these 
purposes. It seems to me, that if we follow the same route as the 
Conseil de la souveraineté du Québec, we are acting according to 
the same rules as Mr. Duhaime.

	Here are the facts: There are 1.5 million unemployed Canadians, 
just like with Mulroney, and 800,000 people are moonlighting just 
to make ends meet. Our largest trading partner has an 
unemployment rate half of what ours is. Despite the $6 billion 
infrastructure program, employment in construction actually has 
dropped by 40,000 jobs. Canadians have had a $3,000 pay cut 
because of the 37 separate tax hikes by this government.
<P>
	When is the light going to go on for the minister? When is he 
going to understand that taxes, taxes, taxes kill jobs, jobs, jobs?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
perhaps the hon. member would be interested in some of the 
economic indicators that came out this week.
<P>
	Real merchandise exports increased 4.3 per cent in January. 
Manufacturing shipments rose 2.2 per cent in January. Retail sales 
increased 1.4 per cent in January. The help wanted index rose 1 per 
cent in February. Real gross domestic product and market prices 
grew 2.9 per cent annual rate in the fourth quarter. The fact is that 
Canada is on a roll.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the sad 
fact is that many Canadians are on the dole.
<P>
	Let us look at those job growth figures the government loves to 
boast about. There has been a 25 per cent increase in temporary 
jobs since 1989. For half of those entering the workforce since 
December 1995 the only job they could get was a part time job. 
Fifty-five per cent of the people who did find a job are 
self-employed and they are the ones the government is going to hit 
hardest with the massive CPP tax increase.
<P>
	Can the minister explain how sucking $3,300 out of the pockets 
of the self-employed creates jobs? Why does he not admit that what 
he is really doing is killing jobs?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
how can the hon. member complain about the 9.9 per cent CPP 
premium rate that was arrived at by the federal government and 
eight of the provinces which have joint stewardship over the plan 
when the plan put forth by the member's party called for a rate of 
13 per cent to 14.2 per cent? How can the hon. member stand up 
here and complain about the Canada pension plan?
<P>
	Will he say what his party's super RRSP will do for Canadians 
who have an automobile accident and are suddenly disabled? I will 
tell him. It will do nothing. It will put that person on the dole. What 
will Reform do for parents who need maternity leave? Our Canada 
pension plan protects them; Reform abandons them. What will the 
Reform do if there is a market crash? The Canada pension plan will 
protect them; Reform will abandon them. That is the problem: 
Reform abandons Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the fact 
is that Reform's plan will give all Canadians better benefits at 
lower costs than the Liberal plan. The numbers the finance minister 
was quoting are probably from Liberia or Panama or somewhere 
else.
<P>
	The government's jobless record for youth is absolutely pathetic: 
16.9 per cent last month, up from 11.9 per cent in 1988, 12.7 per 
cent in 1990, a 40 per cent increase in joblessness for Canada's 
youth. As the last hired and the first fired they know the effects of 
job killing policies.
<P>
	To quote the finance minister, payroll taxes are a cancer on job 
creation. Can the finance minister explain again how his $10 
billion annual payroll tax hike is going to encourage jobs among 
our youngest Canadians? Can he explain how his job killing payroll 
tax is going to encourage businesses to hire more young people? 
We want an answer.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, if 
the Reform Party is so concerned about jobs, why did the leader of 
the Reform Party say in 1993 in Penticton that it would bring forth 
a financial plan that would cost the country jobs, not add jobs. That 
is what Reform members are prepared to run on. We have created 
795,000 jobs in the private sector since we have taken office. That 
is 795,000 jobs more than Reform said it was capable of doing.
<P>
	Look at the state of the country when we took office. Interest 
rates were going up, taxes were going up, the country was 
dispirited. As a result of the actions of this government and of 
Canadians, our interest rates are at an all time low. There is no 
longer a debate about rising taxes; the debate is about lowering 
taxes. The fact is there is hope in this land. Our exports are up, our 
inflation is down. Canadians know full well it is because we have 
confidence in them and Reform has confidence in nothing.

<P>
	Yesterday, in response to my question on the compensation owed 
to Quebec for harmonizing the QST with the GST, the minister 
finally admitted that the compensation formula used is not 
designed to provide harmonization assistance but rather assistance 
to the Atlantic region. This clearly shows that his bad decision is 
politically untenable.
<P>

nothing better to do, to provide assistance to  the Atlantic prov-

<HR>
<B><A NAME="9275"> 9275 </A></B>
<P>
inces, than to dig into the pockets of Quebec taxpayers to subsidize 
the maritimes and help them better raid Quebec businesses?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
stated unequivocally yesterday that mutual assistance between 
regions was an inherent part of the Canadian confederation. And, 
yes, helping a province or region through difficult times involves 
using taxpayers' money.
<P>
	Let us not forget that Quebec's equalization payments come 
from the taxes paid by Canadians, as does the financial support to 
Quebec's aviation industry.
<P>
	Looking at how Canada builds its strength, the hon. member 
should know that the regions are there to support one another. 
Therein lies Canada's strength, and it will continue to be a building 
block for Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am always baffled when I listen to the Minister of 
Finance talk about what he has given to Quebec. We are paying $30 
billion per year to the federal government. We are asking for what 
is ours. Nothing more.
<P>
	Why does the Minister of Finance not take the advice of the three 
premiers who support Quebec on this? Why not, for once, be fair to 
Quebecers and give them the $2 billion he owes them?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have explained time and time again in this House that 
compensation was offered to those provinces whose loss in 
revenues resulting from tax harmonization exceeded 5 per cent.
<P>
	I would like to quote some statistics now. In Quebec, in 1989-90, 
the sales tax brought in $5.1 billion in revenues. In 1990-91, the 
first year of the harmonized tax, $5.3 billion; in 1991-92, $6.1 
billion; in 1992-93, $6 billion; in 1993-94, $5.5 billion; in 1994-95, 
$5.4 billion; in 1995-96, $5.6 billion.
<P>
	Each year following harmonization, Quebec has brought in more 
money that before harmonizing. That is why, like some other 
provinces, Quebec is not getting any compensation.

	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, for 77 
months the unemployment rate has been over 9 per cent in this 
country, which is the highest rate for the longest time since the 
great depression. People are going bankrupt in record numbers. 
One number the Minister of Finance did not trot out in his long 
diatribe was the fact that 100,000 people's lives are in tatters in this 
country because they have gone bankrupt under the Liberal 
government's policies.
<P>
	What did the minister's parliamentary secretary say when the 
unemployment numbers were announced? He said: ``It is 
disappointing''. It is not disappointing, it is a tragedy. It is an 
absolute disgrace for people whose lives are being left in tatters 
because of the policies of this Liberal government. Will the 
Minister of Finance tell us when he is going to make a real 
commitment to job creation and family security by reducing taxes?
<P>
<B>(1435)</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the fact is that in our budget we dropped taxes by $2 billion over 
three years. We did it directly to help those Canadians who need the 
help.
<P>
	We should understand that the debate between the Reform Party 
and ourselves is not over a desire to reduce taxes. Every single 
Canadian in this country, including every member of this caucus 
and this government, wants to reduce taxes. The issue is when and 
under what circumstances and at what cost.
<P>
	Let us understand what Reform would do to reduce taxes. In 
order to reduce taxes and justify its tax cut, Reform will cut old age 
pensions by $5 billion. That is the difference between Reform's 
projections in its original budget and the projections it is making 
today. Reform members will cut equalization payments by $3 
billion and will cut all kinds of people off in the seven receiving 
provinces. Reform has essentially said that it will cut the Canadian 
health and social transfer by $3.5 billion in order to justify its tax 
cuts.
<P>
	In other words, the tax cut Reform is offering is a tax cut for the 
rich and it will eviscerate the programs that help the poor and the 
middle class in this country. We will not do that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, if you 
would give us the time, we could refute each and every one of those 
statements because they are not true.
<P>
	The minister has no concern for the people who are worried 
about a missed mortgage payment and the desperation they feel 
when they go another month without a job. He has no concern for 
the pain of a taxpayer trying to explain to his children that the 
government can take his taxes but it cannot give him a job and that 
his little kids have to go without their soccer and hockey practices 
because they cannot afford it.
<P>
	Canadians are feeling a lot of pain and the minister has nothing 
new to offer to them. In all good conscience, how can he preach 
about an improved economy and how his policies are going to 
deliver a better life when 1.5 million Canadians have no jobs and 
millions more are struggling to put food on the table and trying to 
make ends meet?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
there is nobody in this government, in fact there is no right thinking 
person in this country who is happy  with the level of unemploy-

<P>
ment. The fact is that there is great pain and suffering out there. 
Young Canadians are looking for jobs.
<P>
	We ought to understand the different approaches the respective 
parties are taking. We have created over 790,000 jobs in the private 
sector. At the same time it is important to understand that since we 
have taken office we have created 550,000 full time jobs.
<P>
	I can tell this House exactly what Reform policies would lead to. 
Now that we have seen very clearly that the Conservatives are 
battling the Reform for bragging rights over the extreme right 
wing, let us look at what happened under its administration. 
Reform policies as practised by the Tory party: compared to the 
550,000 jobs that we have created, in the last Tory mandate it lost 
150,000 full time jobs. That is what these guys would do.

on the people of the Magdalen Islands, with a big red ribbon, on the 
eve of the election.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> It is an old tub.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier (Gaspé):</B> Is the minister waiting for the election 
campaign to finally find a safe and lasting solution, or is he waiting 
until after the election to give the bad news to the people of the 
Magdalen Islands?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Transport, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, as I just said to the hon. member, we want to replace the

million we set aside.
<P>

Mr. Speaker, the media report today that one of my constituents has 
again confirmed that the Governor General of Canada, the 
Commander in Chief of the Canadian Armed Forces, pays no taxes 
but our troops serving under the Governor General have had their 
pay frozen and have suffered 37 tax increases by the government.
<P>
	Why will the Minister of National Defence not treat our troops 
properly, fairly and with respect? Why will he not give them their 
long overdue pay raises? Why will he not do what is right?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, again the hon. 
member does not do his party any service in the preamble to that 
question. No doubt the fate of the Canadian forces and their 
appropriate requirements to be cared for in an adequate way are 
some things that we have under active consideration.
<P>
	The hon. member will know that we have asked the Standing 
Committee on National Defence and Veterans Affairs to look into 
the people needs of the Canadian forces. There will be an in depth 
study over the next few months to ensure that we respond to those 
needs.
<P>
	In the interim I can tell the hon. member that I will be 
announcing some improvements in the situation for the Canadian 
forces next week. I only regret the Reform Party has not made any 
contribution to the process of reviewing the future of the Canadian 
forces.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, once again the minister is spewing forth typical 
Liberal rhetoric: strike up a committee, make a study, spend 
millions of taxpayers' dollars and wait for a report. That is the 
Liberal way.
<P>
	Currently there are Canadian Armed Forces pay and benefit 
recommendations before Treasury Board. The defence minister is 
letting them collect dust while he drags his feet.

Why will the minister not just do what is right?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> This is pretty scary stuff, Mr. 
Speaker. I fear the hon. member speaketh with forked tongue.
<P>
	Yesterday the hon. member and his party refused to co-operate in 
arranging for the Standing Committee on National Defence and 
Veterans Affairs to travel across the country to meet with members 
of the Canadian forces to be able to see exactly what the people 
needs are in the Canadian forces. That is something I have done 
from coast, to coast, to coast. I have visited with the Canadian 
forces. They know there are needs they would like to have 
addressed.
<P>
	Instead of spewing whatever it was that the hon. member has just 
got finished with, it is too bad he would not spew the truth some 
time and support the Canadian forces instead of yap about it.

	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	The new human rights commissioner tabled her first annual 
report this morning. She criticizes the government's lack of 
constructive action in a number of areas, including the lack of 
follow up to the report of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal 
Peoples.
<P>
<B>(1445)</B>
<P>
	As regards foreign policy, does the Prime Minister, who still is 
refusing to raise the issue of human rights publicly on Team 
Canada trips, acknowledge that his government is much better at 
high-sounding rhetoric than practical action, as the Canadian 
Human Rights Commission argues?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, what the member has said is totally wrong. Each time I 
went to countries where there were human rights problems, I raised 
them-in China, in Indonesia and elsewhere. He cannot say we did 
not raise these issues abroad.
<P>
	Today we received the commissioner's report, and we will note it 
carefully. We received a 4,000 page report from the commission on 
aboriginal peoples. The minister has already put a number of 
recommendations into effect. He was doing so in fact even before 
the commission report came out, because he was in contact with the 
heads of the commission.
<P>
	The report has just come in. It is a very important report, and we 
have said it requires consideration and consultation, before a full 
policy may be proposed. We had already implemented several 
recommendations, before the publication of the report.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the least we can say is that when the Prime 
Minister raises human rights issues he makes few waves abroad.
<P>
	We will come back home for my supplementary. The 
commission strongly criticizes the government's inaction in 1996 
on the issue of people with disabilities. Perhaps the Minister of 
National Defence would care to pay attention.
<P>
	It stressed the fact that, apart from a few isolated breakthroughs, 
1996 was for many of them-persons with disabilities-a year of 
almost total stagnation, with certain hard won gains actually being 
lost.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister acknowledge that the election goodies 
he offered people with disabilities do not make up for all the many 
cuts he has made, which are behind the deterioration in the 
situation of people with disabilities?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I find that particularly deplorable, because the 
government made provision in its budget to help people with 
disabilities deal with their specific problems, as was recommended 
by a committee of the House of Commons. The hon. member 
probably does not want to recognize it, but we acted immediately in 
the latest budget on the recommendations of the committee.
<P>
	In society, there are always problems to be solved. We solve a lot 
of them, but I know they are interested in only one thing-a form 
of destruction-while we are trying to build a society to everyone's 
benefit. That is why we did something in the latest budget for 
people with disabilities.

<P>
	The Canadian Polar Commission held a conference on 
contaminants in the Arctic environment last fall. Because of the 
potential risk to human health the Department of Health was 
invited to participate.
<P>

from his department participated in this important Arctic 
conference?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of

that Health Canada is concerned about the health of all Canadians.
<P>

<P>

<P>

aboriginal people and other sister agencies at the federal and

the Arctic environmental strategy and the international Arctic 
monitoring and assessment program.
<P>
	The member will also recognize that the Canadian Polar 
Commission is actively in receipt of resources from the federal 
government. In fact the conference received supplementary 
benefits from the government.
<P>
	In the spirit of co-operation, when the specific health officials 
who had been invited found that they could not meet the timetable 
required they contacted the lead health agency in the area, the 
Northwest Territories department of health, and arranged to have 
the health sector represented by health officials from the territories.
<P>

	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, biker 
gangs are a scourge and a blight on our society. Gangs like the 
Hell's Angels and the Rock Machine exist for one reason only and 
that is to commit crime.
<P>
	In Quebec the biker gangs are killing for control over the 
lucrative drug trade and prostitution. The same thing is happening 
in Toronto, Vancouver and Winnipeg. In fact it is happening in 
every major city in the country.
<P>
	It is pretty strong evidence that the government's soft on crime 
approach to criminal justice is an unqualified failure. To make 
matters worse, the justice minister refuses to debate the benefits of 
anti-gang legislation.
<P>
	If the minister will not allow Parliament to consider anti-gang 
legislation, what specific steps will he take to crush the criminal 
activities of the Hell's Angels and the Rock Machine not only in 
Quebec but right across the country?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the hon. member for his question.
<P>
	As he is aware, the Minister of Justice is meeting in Quebec 
today with provincial counterparts, mayors and police agencies. He 
has indicated that as a result of meetings held last fall a number of 
changes were being considered to the Criminal Code of Canada. 
These changes would give the police the tools to crack down on this 
type of organized criminal activity.
<P>
	You were in error to suggest that the door was closed on 
considering measures to deal with anti-gang legislation. It is 
possible, and the minister indicated that this request would be 
reviewed.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I remind members to always address their 
remarks through the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, all 
the Liberal government seems to do is review, review, review. In 
the meantime the lives of Canadians right across the country are in 
jeopardy. Canadians are living in fear.
<P>
	The only way to deal with organized crime is to rip the heart out 
of its operation. It exists to make a profit. The government has had 
3.5 years to do something about it and has failed to do so.
<P>
	Canadians want safe streets and clean neighbourhoods. They 
will not tolerate having their lives held hostage by a few lawless 
people.
<P>
	If the justice minister is serious about cleaning up biker gangs, 
will he enact legislation giving the RCMP and the prosecutors 
special powers to wipe out organized gangs like the Hell's Angels 
and the Rock Machine?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
federal government introduces and deals with legislation through 
the Criminal Code. The administration of justice is the 
responsibility of provincial governments. It is the responsibility of 
municipal officials and their police departments to enforce the laws 
that are in effect.
<P>
	Murder is a crime. Bombing is a crime. Drug trafficking is a 
crime. What is needed is strong enforcement at that level. The 
federal government, provincial governments and municipal 
officials need to work together to solve the problem.
<P>
	This has been a problem for a considerable period of time. It is 
amazing that finally the Reform Party has figured out that it is a 
problem.

<P>
	A rare occurrence: last Friday the Minister of Transport 
managed to gain unanimity, but it was against him. When he 
announced the federal withdrawal from police services in ports 
from Vancouver to Halifax, including Montreal and Quebec, there 
was a general hue and cry against his method of unilaterally 
announcing, without any impact study, that this withdrawal would 
take effect before next fall.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9279"> 9279 </A></B>
<P>
	How could the minister have presented a so-called new model 
of port policing without reaching any agreement with the 
provinces concerned?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the ports police issue was examined in great detail by a 
Coopers &amp; Lybrand study. It proposed a new model for the policing 
of our major ports.
<P>
<B>(1455)</B>
<P>
	To make sure the study done by Inspector Mann was confirmed 
we had another study done by the former chief constable of the city 
of Vancouver, Mr. Stewart, and the former head of the RCMP 
detachment for North Vancouver, Mr. Gill Yard. They came to the 
same essential conclusion that more effective policing could be 
done. More effective means more security for the Canadian public.
<P>
	As the hon. member mentioned Vancouver, I have to mention 
that British Columbia did not take part in that study although every 
other affected province did. We therefore waited until a study was 
done by Superintendent William Neill, the former Saskatchewan 
RCMP head. He did a study for the province of British Columbia 
which came to the same conclusions.
<P>
	There have been three studies by senior police officials which 
say we can get more security for the Canadian public by a new 
model that uses municipal policing, customs services, immigration 
and security services. That deals with criminal problems much 
more effectively than the existing model we are using now.

	<B>Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of

	<B>Mr. Chris Axworthy (Saskatoon-Clark's Crossing, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I have a question for the minister responsible for 
Canada Post.
<P>
	When the Canada Post mandate review report was made public 
last October, the minister promised that Canada Post would not be 
privatized as long as it continued to fulfil a public policy role. The 
report strongly recommended that the corporation should not be 
privatized.
<P>
	However, in a study that the minister commissioned by TD 
Securities she has asked the firm to evaluate whether withdrawing 
from competitive operations is consistent with the objective of 
possibly ``privatizing Canada Post''.
<P>
	Does the minister agree that Canada Post should remain a crown 
corporation, which is what she said last fall? Or, is she seriously 
considering privatization which is suggested in the terms of 
reference in the present study?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I stand by what I said 
last fall. As long as Canada Post serves a public policy purpose

	<B>Mrs. Daphne Jennings (Mission-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, today I made reference to a letter in my Standing Order 31 
statement. I would like you to seek unanimous consent of the 
House for me to table the letter.
<P>
<B>(1510 )</B>
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Does the hon. member have the consent of the 
House to table the letter?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>

	<B>The Speaker:</B> Colleagues, I am now ready to rule on the 
question of privilege raised by the hon. member for 
Hamilton-Wentworth on Tuesday, March 11, 1997 concerning the 
scheduling of the consideration of the subject matter of Bill C-46, 
an act to amend the Criminal Code (production of records in sexual 
offence proceedings), by the Standing Committee on Justice and 
Legal Affairs.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I thank the hon. member for Windsor-St. Clair, the hon. 
member for Berthier-Montcalm, the hon. member for Winnipeg 
Transcona, and the hon. member for North Vancouver for their 
comments in this matter.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In his submission, the hon. member for Hamilton-Wentworth 
argued that his rights as a member of Parliament had been breached 
by the Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs. He 
claimed that the committee had misinterpreted and misused 
Standing Order 108(2) by scheduling that morning a meeting to 
consider the subject matter of Bill C-46 when he believed that 
second reading debate on the bill was to resume in the House that 
same afternoon.
<P>
	He maintained that in order to participate in a more relevant 
manner in the committee's meeting, it was important for him to be 
present in the House that afternoon for the second reading debate 
on the bill. Thus he claimed that his rights and privileges to appear 
and participate in the committee's deliberations had been denied.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	As members are well aware, important procedural reforms have 
evolved from the recommendations contained in the report of the 
Special Committee on  Reform of the House of Commons, 
commonly referred to as the McGrath Report, which was tabled in 
June 1985. One of the main features of the report was its proposal 
<P>

<B><A NAME="9282"> 9282 </A></B>
<P>
to empower committees to initiate their own studies without any 
specific order of reference from the House.
<P>
	This proposal resulted in what we now know as Standing Order 
108(2), which confers upon standing committees a wide-ranging 
authority to examine and report on all relevant matters pertaining 
to the mandate, management, organization or operation of 
specified departments. It is pursuant to this Standing Order that the 
Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs chose to 
undertake a study of the subject-matter of Bill C-46.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As indicated by the justice committee chair, the member for 
Windsor-St. Clair, this course of action has been followed by 
other committees. For example, the Standing Committee on 
Finance decided in January 1990 to undertake consideration of the 
subject matter of Bill C-52, an act to amend the Income Tax Act 
and related acts. More recently the justice committee initiated an 
examination of the subject matter of Bill C-45, an act to amend the 
Criminal Code (judicial review of parole ineligibility). It is 
interesting to note that in both these cases the committees were 
holding meetings on the subject matter of these bills while the 
House was either proceeding with or resuming second reading 
debate of the same bills.
<P>
	Committees are free to set their own priorities, establish work 
plans and schedule their business. As the Speaker, it is not my role 
to get involved in such committee matters and I would refrain from 
doing so, as have my predecessors. However, as the hon. member 
for Winnipeg Transcona stated that ``the spirit of the McGrath 
reform was that things would not be happening simultaneously'', 
perhaps committees could keep this in mind when planning their 
work.
<P>
	I would also like to remind all members that the daily 
publication, Projected Order of Business, provides them with the 
listing of all business expected, and I repeat expected, to be taken 
up on a particular day as well as some days to come. However, as 
you know, the government is not bound by this publication and 
retains the right, under Standing Order 40(2), to call any item of 
business listed under government orders on that day's Order Paper.
<P>
	May I draw your attention to the fact that the business printed on 
the Projected Order of Business is subject to change without notice. 
This is clearly emphasized in the note appearing under the title of 
the document. As committees plan their work, they may or may not 
be aware of changes to the Projected Order of Business, or the 
progress made on a bill for that matter.
<P>
<B>(1515)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In the case presently before us, the resumption of second reading 
debate on Bill C-46 was listed on the <I>Projected Order of Business</I>
<P>
published for Tuesday, March 11, 1997. This may have caused 
some members to assume that this item would be taken up that day. 
In fact, this particular item was not called on that day. It would 
therefore appear to have been premature on the part of the hon. 
member for Hamilton-Wentworth to raise the question at that 
time as Bill C-46 was not considered by the House that day.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I have given careful consideration to the matter presented by the 
hon. member for Hamilton-Wentworth and I have taken into 
account the extent to which this matter infringed on his ability to 
perform his parliamentary duties.
<P>
	It has always been difficult, and increasingly so nowadays, for 
members to manage their time because of the constraints imposed 
on them by the House, committee meetings, as well as caucus and 
constituency business, and members often must make choices as to 
what business they should give priority.
<P>
	Although I can certainly sympathize with the hon. member's 
predicament, he was not, in my estimation, prevented from 
carrying out his parliamentary responsibilities. Therefore the Chair 
does not find that a prima facie case of privilege has been made.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I thank the hon. member for Hamilton-Wentworth for bringing 
this matter to the attention of the House.

	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (for Minister for International Trade, 
Lib.)</B> moved that Bill C-32, an act to amend the Copyright Act, be 
read the third time and passed.
<P>
	She said: Mr. Speaker, our culture defines who we are. It is what 
makes Canada unique in the world. Bill C-32 is not only about 
culture, it is about creating jobs and growth for Canadians. It is 
about strengthening Canada's cultural industries and strengthening 
the very things that allow us to tell our very unique story.
<P>
	Nine hundred thousand Canadian jobs depend on the cultural 
sector and nearly 5 per cent of our gross domestic product comes 
from culture. Over the last five years the cultural sector has grown 
faster than the economy as a whole. But this success did not happen 
by magic. It took incredible talent, risk takers, artists and  millions 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9283"> 9283 </A></B>
<P>
and millions of Canadians who wanted to hear and see and read our 
story.
<P>
	What is copyright? Copyright is protecting people's creative 
work. It means that creators have the right to be paid when their 
work is used for commercial purposes.
<P>
	According to Statistics Canada the average Canadian artist is 
among the lowest paid in the economy, earning only about $13,000 
per year.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Just a few weeks ago, I was pleasantly surprised to meet world- 
renowned author Antonine Maillet. She told me that she could not 
live on her royalties alone, that she had to give lectures to make 
ends meet.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This bill is about fairness and making sure that Canada's creators 
are paid for the work they create, for their intellectual property. 
This bill has struck a balance which safeguards the interests of the 
users so that all Canadians can continue to be exposed to Canada's 
story.
<P>
	We have listened carefully, and this is a copyright act that 
respects those values. That is how Canadian culture will flourish 
and that is how jobs will continue to be created in the cultural 
industries. We need an act that deals with the realities of today, not 
1924 when the act was first adopted.
<P>
<B>(1520)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	For eight years now, successive governments and ministers have 
been working on this copyright bill. With Bill C-32, we tried to 
strike a balance between the creators' rights and the need to make 
their works accessible to everyone. Bill C-32 creates a healthy and 
fair environment for Canadian book distributors.
<P>
	As for all framework legislation, the Copyright Act as amended 
by Bill C-32 sets out the legitimate right of creators to be 
compensated for the commercial use of their works, while ensuring 
that the international community has reasonable access to these 
works.
<P>
	Given the number of creators and users affected, it is not 
surprising that Bill C-32 took so long. It is the result of a long and 
painstaking study and consultation process.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	First of all I want to thank all the members of the committee who 
did the real work in bringing back into the House Bill C-32 for third 
reading.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In particular, I would like to thank the hon. member for 
Lachine-Lac-Saint-Louis, the committee chairman, for his 
leadership on a very sensitive and complex matter.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We are extremely grateful that we have a colleague in this House 
who is the model of calm, reasoned and impassioned guidance.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I would especially not want to forget to thank also the one who 
took care of the painstaking balancing act, that is, my 
parliamentary secretary, the hon. member for 
Restigouche-Chaleur. He guided us through every step with his 
usual devotion and impartiality.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I want to thank also the members of the Liberal caucus who 
spent hours and hours ensuring that we achieved the right balance. I 
would be remiss if I did not in particular single out-
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
-the work done by the critic of the official opposition, the hon. 
member for Richmond-Wolfe, who put his own political interests 
aside to co-operate with all of us on a very important issue for all 
the artists of our country.
<P>
	There are times in politics when one has to put his or her own 
beliefs aside to work on drafting good legislation. I think that this is 
what we succeeded to do together.
<P>
	Aided by our consultations, the government put forward a 
number of amendments at third reading. These amendments were 
aimed at improving the bill.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I want to point out that the only party in the House that is 
opposed to copyright is the third party, the Reform Party. I think it 
is important to point out how the Reform Party has in its own 
charter cited the importance for respect of property rights. Let me 
quote from the Reform Party's policy on constitutional reform: 
``The Reform Party supports amending the charter of rights to 
recognize that in Canada there has existed the right of every person 
to the ownership, use and enjoyment of property, both real and 
personal, and the right not to be deprived thereof except by due 
process of law''.
<P>
	Unfortunately despite the stated belief in property rights this 
party did not recognize these rights when it came to Canada's 
creators and artists. The Reform Party unfortunately refuses to 
recognize that when an artist creates a song, quand Céline Dion 
chante or when Shania Twain sings the voice of Shania Twain is 
what makes that song unique. Up until the passage of this bill 
Shania Twain was never recognized as the creator of the record or 
the CD that bore her name. Historically, because of copyright 
reform almost a decade ago, we paid the person who writes the 
Shania Twain song but we never paid the singer. Bill C-32 will 
change that.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9284"> 9284 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1525)</B>
<P>
	The Reform Party does not recognize the legitimate rights of 
what yesterday the Speaker so eloquently called the soul of our 
nation. Copyright reform also plays a real and important part in 
maintaining our place in the world and in maintaining our identity. 
By bringing in this bill the government is recognizing that culture 
is the lifeblood of what we are as a nation and that culture is part of 
our collective identity.
<P>
	For nearly ten years artists have awaited the reform of phase II of 
copyright. Last December the world community, through the World 
Intellectual Property Organization, concluded two new important 
world treaties, the copyright treaty and the performances and 
phonographs treaty. Unfortunately Canada could not sign those 
treaties. Our own copyright legislation was so out of date that we 
could not sign a convention which was established in 1961. Bill 
C-32 will fix that. Canada will finally be in a position to join the 
world community as a full respector of copyright.
<P>
	We can also move forward to address the pressing issues related 
to the digital agenda and the pressing issues related to the 
performances and phonographs treaty of world intellectual 
property.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We worked very hard to give Canadian artists, who work in 
conditions that are among the poorest of all trades, the opportunity 
to get financial reward for what they currently do on a royalty-free 
basis.
<P>
	Bill C-32 is good both for creators and for people who use the 
products of the Canadian cultural industry, that is, Canada as a 
whole. I am therefore asking the members of the House to 
demonstrate resolve and respect.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I am asking all members of the House to underscore their respect 
for copyright by supporting the third reading of this bill and by 
ensuring that it has a speedy move to the Senate where we fully 
expect the kind of co-operation which was very evident in the 
debate in the House of Commons.
<P>
	I also want to say a special thank you to the Liberal whip's office 
and in particular the whip and the deputy whip for the work they 
have done in bringing this bill together. I thank the House leader, 
the whip, the deputy whip and the deputy House leader. Hopefully 
the bill will be sent to the Senate tonight for first reading. It is a bill 
which has been a long time coming. It will mean a better life for 
thousands of Canadian artists.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
is with much pride that, as the official opposition critic for heritage 
and cultural industries, I stand to take part in this debate.
<P>
	This is an occasion of great pride and a great step forward for the 
artists, the creators, those who nurture our imagination and our 
culture; it is a great step forward because, after third reading, this 
bill will be sent to the other place and will ultimately receive royal 
assent.
<P>
	I listened with great pleasure the comments made by the 
Canadian heritage minister, because she pointed out that the 
tremendous work that has been done all along in the committee, 
which received so many reports and studies-over 170 briefs-and 
heard about 67 witnesses, work that was done with great care and 
determination to improve a bill that will serve the artists, the 
cultural industries and the users.
<P>
<B>(1530)</B>
<P>
	Very briefly, I think the colleagues in the heritage committee, 
both the government and the official opposition colleagues, quickly 
understood that we had the will and determination to work together 
to advance the best things possible for this bill.
<P>
	In that regard, I must say that, as parliamentarians, we are of 
course members of Parliament elected to legislate; we are here to 
make laws. In the process of studying the copyright legislation, we 
all felt-and I think I speak for my colleagues-that we were 
playing our role as parliamentarians, that is making sure the bill put 
forward gets improved every step along the way in keeping with its 
ultimate goal, which in this case was to serve, as the Deputy Prime 
Minister and Minister of Canadian Heritage said, the interests of 
the artists, of the creators and of the cultural industries.
<P>
	In that sense, I think we reached our objective. I urge all my 
colleagues in the House to support the bill on third reading because 
these objectives have been reached.
<P>
	I would like to remind the House simply but clearly that this bill 
comes after an act that was passed in 1924 and was first amended in 
1988. Now, in 1997, we have a third set of amendments, the 
so-called phase II.
<P>
	Most artists and creators in visual or performing arts get an 
income from artistic activity that averages between $7,000 and 
$13,000 a year, depending on the type of activity. It is easy to 
understand that, for these people, it has been quite a long wait, 
from 1924 to 1988, before the society they live in and the 
Parliament of all elected representatives got around to listen to 
them.
<P>
	This is a crucial stage, because in 1988, artists and creators were 
granted greater moral and economic rights. In 1988, an extremely 
pivotal development took place: collective societies were 
recognized. Authors and creators can now be represented by an 
organization that tries to better manage the royalties and levies 
authors, creators, and artists are entitled to, if they are to earn a 
living from their artistic activity.
<P>
	Bill C-32 introduces majors elements, including the 
neighbouring rights concept. The heritage minister just  mentioned 
it a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9285"> 9285 </A></B>
<P>
moment ago. On behalf of our performers and the recording 
industry, we must at last join the 50 countries or so that have 
recognized neighbouring rights and signed the Rome Convention. 
This last phase of Bill C-32 will allow our performers to have their 
rights recognized in more than 50 countries. This is a major step 
forward.
<P>
	In this bill, there is another recognition, another important gain 
in the area of private copying. Everyone recognized during the 
hearings, and we spoke together about this, that a lot of illegal 
copying, a lot of bootlegging of songs and music is done without 
the creators and singers necessarily getting their fair share.
<P>
	With the private copying system, royalties will be paid directly 
to the manufacturer who, in turn, will redistribute them among 
creators, authors, composers and singers who, up until now, were 
deprived of their share because of this universally recognized 
practice that is the copying of cassettes.
<P>
<B>(1535)</B>
<P>
	This bill also has an interesting feature that gives us hope: it will 
be reviewed in five years.
<P>
	Everybody knows that this bill is not perfect. We worked on it, 
we improved it, but everybody admits that, in certain respects, it is 
already out of date. One reason for this is that it does not refer to 
modern technologies, to all those communication means which are 
being developed and on which artists still have no control in 
defending their rights.
<P>
	I ask the government to see to it that phase III can get under way 
as soon as possible and to request that the heritage committee 
complete its work before the bill is reviewed in five years, so we 
are well informed when the time comes.
<P>
	I wish to recall that the question of copyright has been on the 
official opposition's agenda since we arrived in this House. My 
colleague, the heritage minister, will recall that, at the beginning of 
this 35th Parliament, my colleague for Rimouski-Témiscouata, 
who spoke before me, asked her a question about this. She asked 
the minister to table a copyright bill as soon as possible. I must say 
that, in this regard, the official opposition's mandate has been 
fulfilled.
<P>
	I also remind the House that, in the interests of the artists, the 
official opposition asked the government to give consideration as 
quickly as possible to the new technologies and the new 
circumstances on the global market.
<P>
	In fact, between 1988 and 1990, some changes were made to the 
act as a result of NAFTA and other international agreements. Not 
long ago, the heritage committee was asked to review our cultural 
policy in relation to those international agreements.
<P>
	The official opposition did its job and managed to convince the 
government to act in the best interests of artists, who had been 
waiting for these changes for a long time. They are still waiting for 
some changes reflecting the new international market conditions 
and the new technologies.
<P>
	Today is an important day. I ask all my colleagues to vote for the 
bill at third reading.
<P>
	In concluding, I would like to thank first, my colleagues on the 
heritage committee for their co-operation and their support. I also 
thank the staff and the advisers who followed the committee during 
its proceedings to help its members understand all the issues and do 
a good job in presenting to this House an improved bill meeting the 
ultimate objectives of the authors.
<P>
	Finally, I want to express my appreciation for all the groups who 
submitted briefs or came before us to express their opinion and 
explain the issues as clearly as possible to help us do a good job.
<P>
	I want to express my sincere thanks to all those people and I 
hope that the bill will be given royal assent before the elections are 
called.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to rise once again to speak to Bill C-32. However I must 
say right from the beginning I am extremely disappointed with the 
deal that has been made between the Bloc Quebecois and the 
government to end debate on this issue. Many Canadians still are 
very concerned about so many aspects of Bill C-32 which simply 
do not fill the needs of interested parties, not the least of whom are 
Canadian broadcasters.
<P>
<B>(1540 )</B>
<P>
	I will declare my sympathies off the top as I always do. As I 
always point out to my colleagues across the way, I come from a 
background in broadcasting and I think it is important that be 
known.
<P>
	We are again seeing collusion between the Bloc Quebecois and 
the Liberals to end debate on an issue that affects millions and 
millions of Canadians. People still had all kinds of questions they 
wanted addressed. Unfortunately the government ignored them just 
as it ignored the concerns of people on the HST legislation on 
which the government also moved closure. It is becoming quite a 
common feature of the government, more so than the previous 
Mulroney government. That is the first point I wanted to deal with.
<P>
	Second, I will deal with the legislation specifically. Broadcasters 
have asked over and over and over again for a number of things. 
They have asked that the government move amendments to the 
legislation that would permit them to time shift, which simply 
means they would have the ability to record a program at one  time 
<P>

<B><A NAME="9286"> 9286 </A></B>
<P>
and then play it back at a different time without having to seek the 
permission of people who were playing music on that particular 
broadcast, without having to go through all the hoops, without 
having to go through all the paperwork. It is a common sense 
request, but for reasons that escape me or anybody with a modicum 
of common sense the government has denied it.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Copps:</B> It is in the bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solberg:</B> The minister is saying that it is in the bill, but it is 
not in the bill to the point where it is clear to the people involved 
that they will not suffer consequences if they do not jump through 
all those hoops. The minister knows that legal action has been 
taken in the past with respect to these sorts of issues. It leaves 
broadcasters wide open.
<P>
	The government must remember-and this is where the 
government falls down-that it does not place adequate importance 
on ensuring that broadcasters and the electronic media, the vehicles 
for the promotion of Canadian heritage, are allowed to do the job 
they have done so well in the past of promoting the wonderful 
culture of this country.
<P>
	Time shifting is one issue. I have spoken to many people at 
community cable channels. I have spoken to different groups that 
provide all kinds of great Canadian programming. They will feel a 
chill run through their organizations because the government has 
failed to adequately define how this would work. It has failed to 
make it clear that broadcasters could go ahead and do things like 
time shift without feeling some kind of repercussion.
<P>
	Broadcasters have also raised the issue of transfer of format over 
and over again but it has fallen on deaf ears.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Copps:</B> It is in the bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Arseneault:</B> It is in the bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solberg:</B> Although they are talking about it being in the bill, 
it is not defined well enough.
<P>
	For reasons that escape me the broadcasters have asked for some 
clarification, for some simplification so that everybody will be 
satisfied. Then there would be no problem.
<P>
	Again the government has failed to listen. Therefore 
broadcasters will be put in a position where they may be paying 
twice simply because they are transferring a song from a CD on to 
an electronic format like a computer hard disk. They will have to 
pay twice simply because the government has not used common 
sense and has not listened closely enough to broadcasters who are 
therefore put in this awkward position. There is no good reason for 
it. We have had hearings over and over again.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Copps:</B> It is in the bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solberg:</B> I say to the minister that we have had all kinds of 
hearings. The minister knows full well that  broadcasters have 
insisted that what is in the bill is not adequate. Nor is it clear 
enough. Unfortunately broadcasters will have to jump through 
major hoops simply because the government has not been listening 
closely to what they are saying.
<P>
	The minister and the parliamentary secretary across the way are 
concerned about the input of broadcasters. After all, they are the 
vehicle for the promotion of so much Canadian culture. Who could 
deny that they have done anything but a wonderful job? It escapes 
me why the government would not be listening a little closer.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	I want to make a couple of comments on behalf of my former 
colleagues in the broadcast industry. Please forgive me for doing 
this, Mr. Speaker, but I simply must. Yesterday we had some 
wonderful artists here from around the country, people who 
represented Canadian culture in various sectors: painters, poets and 
writers involved in film. It is important to remember that Canadian 
radio and television broadcasters should be standing beside those 
people, the vehicles for the promotion of culture.
<P>
	Over the last several years broadcasters have taken many hits at 
the hands of the former Conservative government and even at the 
hands of this government. Taxes continue to climb. All kinds of 
radio and television stations are in great financial difficulty. They 
have been struggling to make a go of it. When those various outlets 
disappear they are not there to promote Canadian culture.
<P>
	The government is proposing legislation that will make it 
extremely difficult for marginal stations to make a go of it. It will 
make it extremely difficult for those in very tight competitive 
situations to make a go of it. Therefore it is killing the goose that 
laid the golden egg. The government is making it extremely 
difficult for broadcasters who have done a wonderful job of 
promoting culture over the years to continue doing that.
<P>
	Broadcasters have tried to work very closely with the minister 
and her department. They have made extraordinary efforts to come 
to the committee to explain their position. They have been at the 
beck and call of the department. They are more than willing to 
come and have a dialogue with the minister and her departmental 
officials at any time. Even Liberal members across the way have 
worked closely with broadcasters to try to get their point of view.
<P>
	Unfortunately on these common sense issues the government has 
not listened. Many bureaucrats in the Department of Heritage who 
think they know better than broadcasters what their business is. On 
this particular issue they simply do not. Broadcasters have made it 
clear over and over again that this will impede their ability to do 
their job which ultimately, after making a profit and  all those sorts 
of things, is to promote Canadian culture in many different ways.
<P>

<P>
	If I have not said it forcefully enough, I am extremely 
disappointed. Canadian broadcasters will be extremely 
disappointed. The people who listen to radio stations and who 
watch television stations will also be disappointed that the 
legislation is being forced through.
<P>
	The government has joined forces with the Bloc Quebecois after 
a lot of debate has gone on in this place. We have reached a point 
where we could make some changes and the government has gone 
ahead and said it will ignore those common sense solutions. It will 
bull ahead and put forward solutions which simply are not 
adequate.
<P>
	I do not know if there is much more I could say on the issue other 
than that I know I speak for broadcasters across the country when I 
say they will be extremely disappointed.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> What about the artists?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solberg:</B> I am sure they will be disappointed when 
broadcasters simply cannot provide the type of service to them 
because of the legislation that I know they would love to do.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Is the House ready for the question?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Question.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The House has heard the terms of the motion. Is it 
the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?
<P>

<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> All those in favour of the motion will please say 
yea.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Yea.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> All those opposed will please say nay.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Nay.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> In my opinion the yeas have it. I declare the 
motion carried.
<P>
