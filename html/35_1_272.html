	<B>Mr. Stan Dromisky (Thunder Bay-Atikokan, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this is National Safe Driving Week.
<P>
	Ten years ago, vehicle collisions killed 4,364 Canadians and 
injured another 259,200. It was estimated then that approximately 
43 per cent of driver fatalities involved the use of alcohol.
<P>
	By 1994, even with the doubling of vehicles on the road, vehicle 
collision deaths had fallen by 25 per cent to 3,260 and the number 
of injured by 5 per cent to 245,000. However, of those collisions, 
44 per cent of driver fatalities involved the use of alcohol.
<P>
	The conclusion is obvious. We have made great strides in 
reducing the number of Canadians killed and injured on our roads, 
but impaired driving continues to demand our attention. That is 
why the theme of this year's national safe driving week is ``The 
Hidden Face of Impaired Driving''. Canadians are still having 
accidents that could have been prevented by not mixing drinking 
and driving.

	<B>Mr. Hugh Hanrahan (Edmonton-Strathcona, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Liberal so-called unity package is going to have a 
negative effect on Canada. This package will divide the country 
more than it will unite it. The distinct society clause will be seen as 
giving Quebec special status. By lending the federal government's 
constitutional veto  to provincial governments rather than the 
people, the government will pit one province against the others.
<P>
	The net effect of the government's package is to increase 
inequality. Without a doubt, denying all citizens constitutional 
equality will entrench the notion that all Canadians are unequal.
<P>
	My constituents in Edmonton-Strathcona and I support the 
Reform's blue book policy which states clearly our commitment to 
Canada as one nation and to our vision of Canada as a balanced 
federation of 10 equal provinces and citizens.

	<B>Ms. Colleen Beaumier (Brampton, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, Sri 
Lanka is a country consumed in violence by the ongoing conflict 
between the Sri Lankan army and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil 
Eelam. Since 1983, 50,000 people have been killed and another 
500,000 Tamils have been forced into exile.
<P>
	The Minister of Foreign Affairs has stated Canada's position: 
There can be no military solution to the problems in Sri Lanka. 
Both the minister and the secretary of state have stated on a number 
of occasions that Canada is willing to become involved in resolving 
the conflict if asked by both sides.
<P>
	The situation in Sri Lanka is grave. Innocent people are being 
subjected to terrible violence, hunger and despair. Amidst this 
terrible violence, allegations have arisen that aid money is being 
used to buy military equipment.
<P>
	I applaud the efforts of the minister and the secretary of state in 
issuing a standing offer to become involved in resolving this 
dispute, and encourage them to act to ensure that aid reaches those 
who need it the most.

	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, today is 
a very special day.
<P>
	Every year for the past six years, December 6 has been a day to 
reflect on violence against women. Since the day when 14 young 
women were shot and killed at the École polytechnique in 
Montreal, Canadians and Quebecers  have become less and less 
tolerant of all forms of violence, particularly violence against 
women. How 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17272"> 17272 </A></B>
<P>
can one not be appalled by the fact that three out of ten women in 
Canada have been hit at least once by their spouses?
<P>
	The Quebec government understands the need to act and it has 
chosen this day to table its policy on violence against women.
<P>
	The federal government should follow in its footsteps and deal 
with the causes of violence, which are mostly psychological 
distress and despair linked to unemployment, indebtedness and 
poverty.

	<B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise to bring 
to the attention of the House the deep concerns of many of my 
constituents regarding pornography.
<P>
	The local chapter of the Saint John Catholic Women's League 
has sent me several little ribbons in recognition of White Ribbons 
Against Pornography or WRAP week. The CWL took part in 
WRAP activities from October 22 to 29.
<P>
	The members of the CWL and their parishioners wore the 
ribbons, wrote their names on the backs of them and sent them to 
me to show their opposition to pornography in any form. We need 
stronger laws to protect us from this destructive menace in our 
society.
<P>
	Today we remember the 14 young women who were brutally and 
tragically murdered at École Polytechnique in Montreal five years 
ago. As we honour their memories let us remember that 
pornography contributes to the type of violent act that took their 
lives.
<P>
	I commend my constituents for their efforts and I 
wholeheartedly agree with them. I urge the government to stand up 
for Canadians and pass stronger anti-pornography laws.

	<B>Mr. Derek Wells (South Shore, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, today we 
remember the tragedy that occurred on December 6, 1989. It has 
been six years since 14 young women at École Polytechnique in 
Montreal lost their lives. The pain of that day is still fresh in our 
minds.
<P>
	Although much has been done to improve public awareness with 
respect to violence against women, we have only to read the papers 
to see that it is still happening every day. One look at the statistics 
demonstrates that women continue to be the target of violent acts.
<P>
	Steps have been taken by the Liberal government over the last 
two years to curb violence against women and to promote women's 
equality both within Canada and internationally. Within Canada, 
the federal plan for gender equality was announced while 
internationally, Canada played a leading role at the United Nations 
World Conference on Women. However, we still have a long way to 
go.
<P>
	Today, on the national day of remembrance and action on 
violence against women, take a moment to remember the 14 young 
women who died, as well as countless others who have suffered, 
both here in Canada and around the world.

	<B>Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton-Middlesex, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, today marks the sixth anniversary of the tragic deaths of 
14 young women at the École Polytechnique in Montreal.
<P>
	In honour of this national day of remembrance and action on 
violence against women, the Government of Canada calls on all 
Canadians to recognize that violence against women is a violation 
of women's human rights and has no place in Canadian society.
<P>
<B>(1405 )</B>
<P>
	Unfortunately too many women continue to suffer various forms 
of abuse at the hands of their partners, acquaintances or strangers. 
Therefore, eliminating violence remains a priority of the Canadian 
government.
<P>
	Since the tragedy in Montreal, the federal government has 
stepped up its efforts to eliminate violence against women. In fact, 
Canada is viewed as a world leader in recognizing and addressing 
the problem through community based action, information 
exchange and awareness, and shelters for battered women and 
children.
<P>
	I call on all Canadians to assume responsibility for the 
eradication of all forms of violence against women in this country.

	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, yesterday 
a Senate committee proposed an amendment to Bill C-103 that 
would grandfather the Canadian version of <I>Sports Illustrated</I>. In so 
doing, it joined the Reform Party, the task force on the Canadian 
magazine industry and the current Minister for International Trade 
in making this recommendation.
<P>
	Unbelievably the Minister of Canadian Heritage is 
compromising our international reputation by insisting that <I>Sports 
Illustrated</I> be banned retroactively as of March 1993. If the Senate, 
a special task force on split runs and the Minister for International 
Trade all  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17273"> 17273 </A></B>
<P>
recognize the legitimate rights of <I>Sports Illustrated</I> to run a split 
run in Canada, why does not the Minister of Canadian Heritage?
<P>
	Maybe the answer is that he clearly does not know what he is 
doing. Yesterday he said: ``What we are trying to do is make sure 
our Canadian industries remain Canadian, are able to grow and 
export, because export is part of their ability to mature''. But get 
this: Bill C-103 will impose a Canadian 80 per cent excise tax on 
our magazine exports. Unbelievable.

	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
five years ago former NDP MP Dawn Black gained unanimous 
support in the House of Commons for her bill making December 6 
a national day of remembrance and action on violence against 
women. As we have each year since 1990, today we remember and 
mourn the lives of the 14 women killed six years ago in Montreal.
<P>
	Today is not just a day of remembrance but a day of action. In 
this respect the Liberals have not lived up to their commitments to 
women. In the past year the federal government has wiped out the 
Canadian advisory council on the status of women. While the 
government says it is committed to ending violence against 
women, it dismantles the very programs that provide vital support 
to women.
<P>
	Many such programs are funded through the Canada assistance 
plan or federal transfer payments to the provinces and territories, 
payments which are being cut back drastically, threatening the 
survival of emergency shelters for women, child care and other 
programs to help women and their families.
<P>
	The Liberals must show their commitment to women through 
action, not words.

	<B>Ms. Hedy Fry (Vancouver Centre, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, today is 
a day of national mourning and remembrance for the 14 young 
women whose lives were cut off in mid-stride six years ago for one 
reason only: they were women.
<P>
	As we mourn we should be mindful that over 50 per cent of 
women in Canada, one in three in B.C., are the object of physical, 
mental and emotional violence. Battered body and soul, living with 
chronic helplessness and pain, it is a legacy of bitterness that they 
pass on to their children, Canada's children.
<P>
	As parliamentarians, women or men, Liberal, Reform or Bloc, 
we have a duty to stop this endless nightmare that so many women 
endure as an excuse for living. The Minister of Justice, the Minister 
of Health and the  Secretary of State for the Status of Women have 
shown clear leadership on this issue but it is not enough.
<P>
	We must mobilize our communities, the media and businesses. 
We must make this issue a cause nationale. Violent crimes cost this 
country over $4 billion a year in money but the real cost in terms of 
human life and hope is immeasurable.

	<B>Mr. John Maloney (Erie, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, today we mark 
December 6 as Canada's national day of remembrance and action 
on violence against women.
<P>
	Today we remember, we mourn and we act. We remember the 14 
students who tragically lost their lives at École Polytechnique in a 
senseless act of violence against women. We mourn the loss of 14 
of our best and brightest young women and what could have been.
<P>
	We vow to act with resolve to eliminate abuse against women 
everywhere. On average, a woman is killed every six days in 
Canada, often in a home and by someone she knows. The weapon 
of choice is generally a gun. These are startling, sobering facts, but 
true.
<P>
	The government is responding with initiatives, including tougher 
firearms control, elimination of the extreme drunkenness defence, 
more effective peace bonds and much more. However, eradication 
of violence against women requires the full participation of all 
members of society: government, media, business, communities, 
individuals and families.
<P>
	I encourage everyone to join in the partnership to eliminate 
violence against women. Just do it.

in a university, a place of learning, a Canadian tragedy occurred. 
On this day in 1989 a lone male directed his rage at 14 innocent 
women at École Polytechnique in Montreal.
<P>
	In a country such as Canada where so many women have 
experienced some level of injury, physical or sexual, we must make 
every effort to live up to our reputation as being the best country in 
the world in which to live by ensuring a society which is safe from 
ethnic or gender based violence.
<P>
	We mark this day of remembrance for the victims of the 
Montreal massacre and to raise Canadians' awareness that violence 
against women is not only a crime, but an infringement of human 
rights.
<P>
	Violence against women reflects not power over others but the 
fear of cowards.

motion to recognize Quebec as a distinct society.

out to be a complete crock, in light of the incendiary comments 
made by some Liberal and Reform members of the heritage

members when they strongly object to Telefilm Canada's subsidies 
to French-language audiovisual productions, which they see as 
overly generous in relation to the demographic weight of

<P>
	No Quebecer can remain indifferent to these members' 
shameless blackmail tactics against the Canada Council last week

any artistic project on the basis of creative merit rather than on the 
basis of Quebec creators' partisan commitment to federalism.

in our national conscience for the death of the women students in 
Montreal. Last year on this day, in response to hyperbole on the

members. A year has now passed and it is time to examine the 
government's record of how little has been accomplished to really 
change things on behalf of victims.
<P>
	We now have more gun regulation that will not make the 
Montreal murders less likely to occur again. Victims still have no 
comprehensive special standing in the courts and the Criminal 
Code. We still have section 745 which releases murderers early and 
my private member's bill for victims is still to be dealt with by the 
House.

	I call on the government, in view of the well-meaning sentiments 
that are always heard on this day, that by this time next year may 
we have substantive changes to the law which will bring meaning

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="UNEMPLOYMENTINSURANCE">UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, on the 
weekend, the Minister of Labour announced on all tv and radio 
stations in Quebec that as part of its unemployment insurance 
reforms, the federal government will create a reserve fund to 
cushion the impact of future economic recessions or slowdowns.
<P>
	On the other hand, the 1995 budget of the Minister of Finance 
provides that UI fund surpluses will be used to absorb the federal 
deficit. That is what it says on pages 89 and 94 of the Budget Plan. 
Yesterday, the Minister of Finance did not answer our questions. 
Today, I will put the question to the Prime Minister.
<P>
	Considering that the statement by the Minister of Labour is a 
clear and direct contradiction of what is indicated in the 
government's budget, could the Prime Minister tell us which 
minister is right?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Both, Mr. 
Speaker.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in that 
case, I will put the following question to the Prime Minister.
<P>
	If they are both right, how does this tally with the facts? There 
are no two ways about it: either the Minister of Labour is right, and 
a reserve fund will be created to cushion the impact of economic 
problems, or the budget's provisions are no longer accurate. How 
can the Prime Minister say in all honesty and sincerity that both 
ministers are right, when they are contradicting each other?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, when the Unemployment Insurance Fund shows a surplus, 
it is entered as a surplus, and the money is used in the government's 
current accounts. On the books, however, it is considered as a debt 
we owe this fund. Instead of borrowing on the market, we use this 
fund. It is on record as a reserve that will have to be paid back if 
necessary. However, because we have worked very  hard to reduce 
unemployment since we formed the government, the 
Unemployment Insurance Fund has shown an annual surplus 
because of our good management.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not 
know whether the Prime Minister realizes what he just said. He just 
explained that the government's deficit for this year will actually 
be $5 million more, because the Minister of Finance took the 
surplus in the Unemployment Insurance Fund, subtracted it from 
that column, put unemployment insurance revenues into revenue, 
and then told us: ``Here, this is will be my deficit''.
<P>
	Does he realize that with this answer he just confirmed, as the 
leader of this government, that the deficit of the Minister of 
Finance will be $5 million more?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as I said before very clearly, we consider that the funds in 
question are made up of money that we borrowed. Instead of 
borrowing from the private sector, we are borrowing from 
ourselves. However, on the books, as good accountants, we said it 
was not our money, it was money held in reserve.
<P>
	Instead of borrowing the money on the market and competing 
with the private sector, we are using this money, which we know we 
will have to pay back some day.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	However, it is quite probable that in the years to come, since the 
government is working very hard to create jobs, instead of a deficit 
the UI Fund will again show a surplus next year.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is also for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	The data available in the financial review of the Minister of 
Finance reveal that 82 per cent of program expenditure reductions 
proposed by the federal government were in the unemployment 
insurance program alone.
<P>
	In this context, how can the Prime Minister refuse to admit that 
his government's only strategy in fighting the deficit was to cut the 
benefits to the unemployed?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, when the Parti Quebecois government says we cut 
transfers to the provinces, it is contradicting the member, who has 
just said that all we cut were the benefits of the unemployed, and 
not transfers.
<P>
	But we cut all over, except that we reduced transfers such as 
those for health and the other programs. We did, however, increase 
equalization payments. In fact, since we have been in government, 
transfers to the province of Quebec have remained at exactly the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17276"> 17276 </A></B>
<P>
same level. They are  even slightly higher than they were when we 
came to office.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister is avoiding the question. We are saying 
that, of all the government's program cuts in connection with 
transfers to the provinces, 82 per cent of the cuts were made to the 
UI fund. This is what we are saying today. And this is what he is 
trying to get round.
<P>
	I would ask him the following question. Does the Prime Minister 
realize that his approach to reducing the deficit through the 
unemployment insurance surplus is unconscionable and testifies to 
his inability to improve the state of public finances other than by 
imposing a job tax? What his employment insurance amounts to 
then is a job tax.

Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, once again the hon. member is 
engaging in an attempt to misinform Canadians.
<P>
	Let us go back to last Friday and bring forward two basic facts. It 
is very important to try to clear the fog the Bloc Quebecois 
constantly tries to disseminate.
<P>
	First, $800 million of the proposed savings in the system are 
being recycled into direct employment benefits to get people back 
to work. Therefore it represents a substantial shift from income 
benefits to employment benefits and is designed to meet our very 
different work situation. It allows us to give people a quick, 
effective way back into the employment market.
<P>
	The figures the hon. member refers to have absolutely no 
relevance to the fact that we have said directly the money is being 
recycled.
<P>
	Second, we are beginning to reduce the premiums under the 
system. There will be a $1.3 billion reduction for businesses and 
employees so that we can put more money in their pockets and they 
can create more jobs.
<P>
	[<I>Editor's Note: Electrical power interruption.</I>]
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Axworthy (Winnipeg South Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
argument is so powerful that it even affects the electrical system of 
the House. The problem is that when the Bloc stands to speak, the 
lights go off totally and everybody is in the dark.

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister says he wants to put his makeshift 
unity policy behind him and get on with jobs and the economy. So 
let us do that.
<P>
	At present the greatest single impediment to job creation and 
economic growth in the country is the dead weight of the federal 
debt of $570 billion, a debt the government is adding to at the 
staggering rate of almost $100 million per day.
<P>
	The IMF and Canadian business groups have repeatedly called 
upon the finance minister to get real and revise his weak deficit 
reduction targets.
<P>
	Has the Prime Minister specifically instructed the finance 
minister to come up with a new deficit reduction target, the only 
one that means anything to the Canadian taxpayer, namely a zero 
deficit by 1997-98?
<P>
<B>(1425 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we are on target with what we said to the Canadian public 
we would achieve.
<P>
	We said that we started at 6.2 per cent of GDP and that we would 
be at 3 per cent after three years. We will be there. We set some 
realistic goals in a way that we have not stifled growth in Canada. 
At the same time as we were going through a reduction in the 
deficit, we saw a reduction in unemployment. The policies are 
working very well.
<P>
	Most of the time members of the third party are not asking 
questions on the economy. Yesterday, for example, they spent the 
day talking about the coat of arms. Is it extremely important?
<P>
	On January 15, 1994 the leader of the Reform Party criticized 
previous opposition parties. He said that anyone could make a 
jackass of themselves in question period. Yesterday the Reform 
Party proved that quite well.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the former head of the Economic Council of Canada, John 
Deutsch, used to have trouble getting Mr. Trudeau to take the debt 
and deficit seriously. I wonder if Mr. Trudeau passed the virus on to 
the current Prime Minister.
<P>
	The only way Mr. Deutsch could get Trudeau to take public 
finance seriously was to somehow link it to the Quebec or unity 
issue. Perhaps we can awaken the Prime Minister's interest in the 
issue by pointing to a recent CROP poll which said that 80 per cent 
of Quebecers believed the government should come to grips with 
real deficit reduction. This is something Quebecers have in 
common with other Canadians.
<P>
	If the Prime Minister is groping for actions to unite the country, 
why does he not personally commit his government to balancing 
the federal budget before the end of his mandate? I ask him not to 
give us a 3 per cent answer.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, when we ran in the last campaign we were very careful to 
put in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17277"> 17277 </A></B>
<P>
writing what we would do. We are  meeting our goals. We are 
respecting the commitments we made and we are on target.
<P>
	When we introduced the budget last February it was extremely 
well received by all commentators; we had done the right thing. We 
are moving in a rational way in the reduction of the deficit. At the 
same time we are not doing it in a way that is causing social 
problems in the country.
<P>
	That is why we are a party of the centre. We are not doctrinaire. 
We will not eliminate medicare just to have a balanced budget. We 
will make sure we have policies that respect the individual and at 
the same time offer solid administration.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister likes to dwell on the past. I am 
wondering whether he remembers a time in 1978 when Mr. 
Trudeau went to an economic summit in West Germany and was 
somehow briefly converted to deficit reduction. He came back and 
went on TV. Does the Prime Minister remember this? He 
announced $2 billion in spending cuts without even telling his 
finance minister, who is now the Prime Minister.
<P>
	Could the Prime Minister take a short trip, perhaps to Queen's 
Park; take a few lessons on budget balancing from Mr. Harris; get 
on TV and commit himself to spending cuts that will balance the 
federal budget?
<P>
	Eight of eleven senior governments in Canada are now 
committed to deficit elimination. Will the Prime Minister make the 
Government of Canada the ninth, by committing to balance the 
federal budget by 1997-98?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the leader of the Reform Party is making too many trips to 
Queen's Park. He will lose the only Ontario member he has in this 
House very quickly if he does not change his travelling plans.
<P>
	We have a good plan for reduction of the deficit. At the same 
time we are making sure the economy is working well. We will 
have managed to take the deficit from 6.2 per cent to 3 per cent in 
three years, as we said we would. It will be reduced gradually and 
eventually we will have a balanced budget.
<P>
<B>(1430)</B>
<P>
	However, we are not like their friend in the United States by the 
name of Gingrich who is talking about balancing the books in 2002. 
We do not talk like that; in Canada we do it.

	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	A little more than a month after the Quebec referendum, the 
unemployment insurance reform tabled by the government calls for 
both the maintenance of national standards and the implementation 
of five new manpower programs as demanded by Quebec.
<P>
	In light of the maintenance of national standards and the 
introduction of new programs, will the Prime Minister admit that 
the proposed reform does not in any way reflect the distinct and 
unique character of the people of Quebec?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the reform has been well received all over the country. I 
have figures in front of me showing that 66 per cent of people in 
Quebec at this time feel it is a well balanced reform which respects 
the regions.
<P>
	But an unemployed person is an unemployed person. What does 
he or she need from government? Good programs. Language does 
not enter into it. The unemployment insurance system takes money 
from those parts of Canada where people have the advantage of 
having jobs and distributes it to places where others do not enjoy 
that privilege. It has nothing to do with language and culture; it has 
everything to do with respect of the individual, and all citizens of 
Canada are treated equally.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it has 
been made very clear that this reform targets Quebec and the 
maritimes, despite the Prime Minister's words.
<P>
	How can the Prime Minister claim that his motion on the distinct 
character of Quebec holds any meaning when, the first chance he 
gets, he makes a total mockery of a unanimous request from the 
Quebec National Assembly by treating Quebec like all of the other 
provinces, in that it will be subject to the same national standards 
when it comes to manpower?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we have done what we said we would, namely withdraw 
from manpower training and make funds available to truly serve 
those individuals who are our clients, the unemployed. We want to 
ensure that the money they paid in while working gets back to them 
and not to others.
<P>
	As for the question of a distinct society, I note once again-for 
the third time-that the members of the Parti Quebecois and of the 
Bloc Quebecois will again vote, in their great hypocrisy-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.

	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, last week 
the Minister of National Revenue and taxation bragged about 
raising $1.1 billion out of the underground economy.
<P>
	If he were truly serious about attacking the underground 
economy why were Revenue Canada auditors instructed not to 
audit visible minorities?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the basis of the hon. member's question is false.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, if that is 
truly his answer, if he really believes it is false, then this gentleman 
is not doing his work.
<P>
	A report was done by Ernst Young on the underground economy. 
A lot of field auditors were interviewed, reviewed and visited. 
They were asked what was going on. Six, seven or eight case 
reports were done. The study and some off the record remarks by 
auditors confirmed they were instructed not to audit certain visible 
minorities ``due to potentially explosive political repercussions''.
<P>
	Further, the minister should know that 90 per cent of liquor 
smuggling in Ontario comes across one certain spot near Cornwall.
<P>
	I again ask the minister what steps he is taking to ensure his 
auditors apply the rules of the Income Tax Act to everyone equally 
regardless of race.
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):</B> 
Typically, Mr. Speaker, the hon. member talks about off the record 
information.
<P>
	We in Revenue Canada have a number of situations which can be 
difficult. One example is the transport of grains across the border to 
the United States where our customs officers are told not to stand in 
the way of a speeding truck. No, they take the licence number and 
we arrest the truck later. That is the type of situation we have there 
which of course the Reform Party, which approves of running the 
border, thinks is a good thing.
<P>
	With respect to other situations in which there could be risk to 
our officials, we instruct them not to take unnecessary risks. We
<P>
instruct them to proceed with their work. We certainly do not 
instruct them, as the hon. member has claimed, to avoid any visible 
minorities.

	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Human Resources 
Development. By lowering the maximum insurable earnings, the 
government is making its most significant tax reduction, that is 
$900 million, to the benefit of high income earners. At the same 
time, it is reducing the benefits paid to seasonal workers while 
collecting premiums from workers who hold precarious jobs.
<P>
	Will the minister admit that, contrary to his claim that this 
reform is fair, the new proposed system is regressive and unfair, in 
that it gives some of the benefits taken away from the poor to those 
who have stable and well paid jobs?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member has a habit 
of being able to understand only half the equation.
<P>
	The other half of the equation is that higher income earners will 
therefore have fewer benefits because they pay less of a premium. 
The reason is the maximum insurable earning has gone up to 40 per 
cent higher than the average industrial wage. The recommendation 
of both the seasonal task force and the House of Commons is that it 
should be frozen or brought down because it far exceeded what was 
required and therefore much higher payments were going out to 
those at higher income levels. That is the reason we brought in the 
reform. It was to be fair.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the other half of the equation is that the minister is taking 
money from people who were not contributing before. Will the 
minister recognize that it is unfair to have high income earners pay 
lower UI premiums, while part time workers who put in less than 
ten hours per week will now have to pay premiums, even though 
they will not be eligible to collect UI benefits?

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, last 
Friday the minister of human resources announced two mega 
training programs, one for $800 million and the other for $300 
million.
<P>
	Federal training programs have proven a colossal failure. The 
auditor general says regional development programs do not create 
jobs, except of course for federal bureaucrats.
<P>
	Why is the minister throwing over a billion dollars into more 
wasteful training programs when the auditor general says the 
programs will not create jobs?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, first let me make a correction 
in the statement of the hon. member. The employment measures 
are not just for training. They are directed specifically at a number 
of tools to help people get back into the workforce.
<P>
	Self-employment is a good example. Over the past two years in a 
number of test projects across the country we have been able to 
take people on the unemployment insurance system and help them 
start their own business, thereby creating a job for themselves and a 
job for another person. Sixty thousand jobs have been created by 
one of the tools we included in that package.
<P>
	Another tool is the use of a wage supplement which again helps 
small business people to create tools. We have evaluated 
specifically that in these measures we can add up to 15 additional 
weeks of work and, more important, up to $5,000 additional 
income for the people who use these proposals under our measures. 
That seems to me an awfully good investment.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
not talking about test projects. I am talking about creating 
sustainable long term jobs, and not with these billion dollar 
boondoggle projects.
<P>
	In his last report the auditor general said there is absolutely no 
evidence that training is accompanied by new jobs. The $1.1 billion 
needed for these wasteful programs will come at the expense of 
part time workers.
<P>
	When the auditor general has said these training programs will 
fail, why is the government hammering part timers to the tune of a 
billion dollars to pour into its bottomless pit of so-called job 
creation, mega training programs?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to quote an 
authority whom the hon. member might accept as even more valid 
than the auditor general: the member for Calgary Southeast herself.
<P>
	She wrote to me on April 10 saying the community of Calgary 
Southeast has a proposed training centre. It is well known that this 
area is Calgary's home to many who are unemployed, struggling 
and lacking in ability.
<P>
	I encourage her to consider supporting this training project and 
help in the revitalization of Calgary Southeast. It seems to me the 
member for Calgary Southeast wanted training programs for 
members of her riding. Why does she not want them for the rest of 
Canadians?

Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	Yesterday, on the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage, 
government members were saying that there was no Quebec 
culture, that there was only a single and broad Canadian culture. At 
the same time, they were sharply criticizing Telefilm Canada for 
funding sovereignist Quebec artists.
<P>
<B>(1445)</B>
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister agree with the members of his caucus, 
who say that there is only one culture in Canada and that Telefilm 
Canada must now fund artists according to their political opinion?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, there is a French culture in Canada, which is Canadian. It 
is in Quebec primarily, but I think the culture of the Acadians and 
Antonine Maillet forms part of the French culture, and this culture 
is not necessarily Quebec culture.
<P>
	So, when we talk about a Canadian culture, it may be of French 
or English expression. This morning I spent time with Canadian 
natives, who were having ceremonies. They too have a culture, 
which is entirely their own, but which is Canadian too, because it 
covers all of Canada. There are people of this culture in British 
Columbia, in Quebec and in the maritimes.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the cat is finally out of the bag. The Prime Minister, a 
Quebecer, has just denied his own culture. Will the Prime Minister 
acknowledge that his fine speeches in recent weeks on the distinct 
nature of Quebec society were nothing more than pure hypocrisy, 
since he did not manage even to convince-
<P>

the hon. member would put her question.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will phrase my question using the same word the Prime 
Minister used. Will he acknowledge, since he has not even 
managed to convince the members of his own caucus that 
Quebecers are a people, that there is a distinct culture and that the 
federal government must not lose sight of this in implementing its 
programs?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I return to my argument. French culture is not found only 
in Quebec. English culture is also found in Quebec. Gabrielle Roy 
came from St. Boniface, Manitoba, and she is considered one of 
French Canadian literature's finest. Her works continue to be used 
today in schools in Quebec. That is just to show the quality. I think 
that the member for Québec-Est, who was born in 
Penetanguishene, learned French culture and the French language 
in Ontario, and he is not any less French, because he is with the 
Bloc today.
<P>
<B>(1450)</B>
<P>
	What I am saying, and I have a number of examples, is that 
French culture may be found throughout Canada, and that English 
culture may be found in Quebec. We cannot say that Quebec is 
strictly French, because all sorts of people live in Quebec. There 
are a lot of proud francophones living outside Quebec.

<P>

	The fact is that if it were not for the commitment and the hard 
work and perseverance of the families of those victims, this 
important matter would not have found its way to the top of the 
national agenda. We are in their debt for the work they did to ensure 
the passage of the bill.
<P>
	In specific response to the question put by the hon. member, 
whose own work was so important in this regard, may I emphasize 
that every year in Canada some 13,000 orders are made in the 
courts of the country prohibiting people from having firearms 
because they have shown a propensity for violence. Too often that 
violence occurs in the context of the home. By a margin of two to 
one, when men kill women in the home the weapon of choice is a 
firearm, and 80 per cent of the time it is a rifle or a shotgun. It is 
almost always legally owned.
<P>
	The registration system that is provided for in this bill will 
permit police to enforce those orders to remove firearms and save 
lives. That is only one of the ways this bill will help in the effort we 
must make continuously to deal with violence by men against 
women.

	<B>Hon. Sheila Finestone (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism) 
(Status of Women), Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, yes, we have certainly 
conducted an in depth analysis of all the data affecting the lives of 
women and men to determine the impact of all the actions taken by 
the Minister of Human Resources Development in this regard.
<P>
	I must also tell you, Mr. Speaker, that we considered the fact 
that, in the end, taking every hour worked into account is a winning 
proposition for women. I am proud of what we have done.
<P>
	Furthermore, our government's decisions affecting poor families 
and children are an important part of our initiatives. We should all 
be proud and give the right information on what our party has done 
in this regard.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a 
supplementary question.
<P>
	Since we know that 70 per cent of part time workers are women 
and that the UI reform will have a very negative impact on them, 
will the secretary of state admit that her famous plan for equality 
between the sexes simply does not work and is a total failure?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Finestone (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism) 
(Status of Women), Lib.): </B>No, Mr. Speaker, I do not acknowledge 
these facts, which are neither current nor true. Our minister has 
responded to this line of inquiry several times by showing how 
women in part time and seasonal jobs will fare better in relation to 
the number of hours worked both for the well-being of their society 
and for their own families.
<P>
	I think my colleague would be well-advised to look at the data 
more closely; she would be very happy with the results.

	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, yesterday 
a Senate committee proposed an amendment to Bill C-103 that 
would grandfather the split edition of <I>Sports Illustrated</I> Canada. 
This is one of the amendments the Reform Party proposed. It was 
also a recommendation of the task force on magazine publishing.
<P>
	Here is something interesting: The Minister for International 
Trade wrote a letter to the Minister of Canadian Heritage in January 
1994 suggesting the same thing. Does this indicate a split in the 
cabinet over the split runs?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, of course there is cabinet solidarity on the subject. 
What the Minister for International Trade wrote in a letter to me 
dated January 27 was a report of the conversation he had with his 
American counterpart, Mickey Kantor. It is quite natural for the 
Minister for International Trade to report to the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage on the views expressed in the United States.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, careful 
reading of the letter clearly shows that the Minister for 
International Trade was making a recommendation to the Minister 
of Canadian Heritage, which he chose to ignore.

<P>
	The most disturbing aspect of the bill is that the Canadian 
government has now decided to place a tax on  any future Canadian 
split runs into the United States. If the bill becomes law, a Canadian 
magazine that wants to export a very similar magazine to the 
United States will be subject to an 80 per cent excise tax imposed 
on it by its own Canadian government.
<P>
	How in the world could the heritage minister have created such a 
bone-headed law that punishes Canadian industry?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the policy on split runs has been in effect for 
something like 30 years. It has helped the Canadian magazine 
industry which has contributed to our understanding of ourselves as 
Canadians. It contributes to our identity. It contributes to national 
unity, a fact that our colleagues in the Reform totally ignore 
because they are not interested in Canadian unity.

	<B>Mrs. Sue Barnes (London West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, two 
economic studies were released yesterday by the Centre for 
Research on Violence Against Women and Children in my riding. 
They put the annual calculable cost of this violence at over $4.2 
billion, with health related costs alone at $1.5 billion annually.
<P>
	I ask the Secretary of State for the Status of Women how 
knowledge about the cost of violence against women will affect 
government action on this very important issue.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Finestone (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism) 
(Status of Women), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, at the outset I recognize 
and thank the member for London West and particularly Dr. 
Greaves from the Centre for Violence Against Women which 
undertook this study at the behest of Status of Women Canada.
<P>
	The question of the pervasive nature of violence against women 
and children and its negative impact in a social, economic, health 
and criminal sense is very serious. There is no doubt the issues 
described in the study are vital and important to us all.
<P>
	I will study the findings. I will recommend certain actions to the 
Minister of Justice and to the Minister of Health, notwithstanding 
which I would suggest to all members of the House, to all levels of 
government and to societies and municipalities that the problem is 
beyond just this government which has done a very good job 
through the Minister of Justice with respect to the criminal 
element.
<P>
	The social and economic aspects still need to be addressed. Until 
the economic interests of women are looked into, we will have 
ongoing violence against women and children.

is for the Right Hon. Prime Minister and is with regard to the
<P>
embarrassingly high bank profits that have been announced in the 
last few days.
<P>
	As a result of the UI changes almost $1 billion was taken out of 
the pockets of working Canadians and small business operators. 
With obscenely high bank profits being registered, what steps will 
the Prime Minister take to make sure they too pay their share of the 
deficit?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, like other corporate citizens they are paying taxes on their 
profits. In the last budget the Minister of Finance imposed a special 
$100 million tax on the profits of banks. They pay more than the 
normal share, but the Minister of Finance will look into the 
situation. It is a sign in some ways that the economy is performing 
better than before.
<P>
	I hope they will pay a lot of tax out of these profits as we need 
the money to create jobs in Canada.

	<B>The Speaker:</B> I have an announcement to make before dealing 
with a few points of order. During question period the lights went 
off and on. I want members to know, so that when they return to

	<B>Hon. Sheila Finestone (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism) 
(Status of Women), Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, today is a day of 
remembrance.
<P>
	Today, we reflect on the tragic December 6th, 1989 when 14 
women died in the prime of their lives. Today, we also want to 
reflect on the thousands of women who face violence as a daily 
reality.
<P>
	It was also 25 years ago tomorrow that the royal commission on 
the status of women tabled its report in this House.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The report was a landmark study of the status of women in 
Canada. It contained 167 recommendations ranging from 
equalizing women's opportunity in the workplace to recognizing 
the equal contributions of both partners in the division of family 
assets upon marriage breakdown. Most of its recommendations 
have now been implemented. For example, sex discrimination is 
now prohibited under all of Canada's labour laws. Minimum wages 
are the same for both men and women. Maternity leave and 
parental leave benefits can be claimed.
<P>
<B>(1510)</B>
<P>
	The royal commission, however, did not identify violence as a 
major issue, but its members had a vision about what it would take 
to achieve equality. They predicted that as we uncovered the root 
causes and consequences of women's unequal status new issues 
would emerge that would need addressing, and they were right. In 
the last 25 years we have uncovered a close relationship between a 
woman's lack of equality and her  vulnerability to violence, and we 
have brought it out of the shadows.
<P>
	At the fourth United Nations World Conference on Women in 
Beijing, Canada made a commitment to implement the 
conference's platform for action, a powerful global agenda for the 
advancement of women. Among the 12 main themes it contains a 
plan of action to address violence against women. The global 
platform reaffirms that violence against women is not a private 
concern and that states must exercise diligence to ensure that 
violence is not occurring in homes, in schools, in the workplace or 
on our streets.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Another commitment is the federal plan for gender equality, 
released in August. The plan is a framework for federal action to 
bring about equality for women in Canada.
<P>
	We created the plan in conjunction with our preparations for the 
Beijing conference, and it includes several commitments to address 
violence against women.
<P>
	There have been significant changes since the royal commission 
report. At that time, only one woman was a member of the House 
of Commons, Grace MacInnis.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	There are now 54 women in the House. Whatever our political 
persuasion, we share a debt of gratitude to the royal commission, 
for without its vision the road here would have been longer and 
harder. Women's voices are now heard in the Chamber. Violence 
against women is now openly discussed. Women and men are 
working together to find solutions. I am confident that together we 
can find solutions at all levels of society.
<P>
	Today in particular I wish to commend the House for its support 
of the historic legislation on firearms control. The weapon used at 
l'École polytechnique will soon be banned.
<P>
	All of us want to make the country safer for women. We will 
succeed with the help of our partners, the men in the House and the 
men of the country, the NGOs, individuals, labour, business and 
other levels of government.
<P>
	In memory of the women who died six years ago, let us pledge to 
continue our campaign against violence to prevent such tragedies 
and to give women and girls their rightful place in society.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is with 
a great deal of emotion that, like all the hon. members of this 
House, I wish to pay tribute today to the 14 young women who 
were gunned down by an assassin six years ago. We join their 
families and friends in remembering them and thinking about the 
impact that their death will have on our society.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17284"> 17284 </A></B>
<P>
	As the hon. secretary of state for the status of women 
mentioned, the tragedy that took place at l'École polytechnique 
prompted us, collectively, to reflect on the steps we should take 
to ensure that such a tragedy never happens again. This is a joint 
undertaking in which each of us must take part. The lives of our 
daughters, sisters, colleagues, friends and fellow citizens and their 
safety are at stake.
<P>
	The second part of my remarks is intended not to be critical but 
rather to be constructive. I believe that, as parliamentarians, we 
must speak candidly about our concerns to further the common 
cause of equality for women. As the secretary of state for the status 
of women quite rightly pointed out, 25 years ago, the royal 
commission on the status of women came to the conclusion that 
violence against women can only be curbed by ensuring equal 
rights for women.
<P>
<B>(1515)</B>
<P>
	I am pleased to see that the Quebec government has taken some 
very concrete steps just today regarding conjugal violence. Today, 
the Government of Quebec tabled in the National Assembly its 
action plan on conjugal violence. It is important to turn our 
attention to this plan for a moment.
<P>
	First of all, I should point out that six ministers have co-operated 
in developing a structured and integrated action plan: the ministers 
of justice, health and social services, public security, and 
education, the minister responsible for family affairs and, finally, 
the minister responsible for the status of women.
<P>
	Many actions are planned, but I will just list a few. In all cases, 
during the inquiry on the provisional release of the accused, the 
attorney general's prosecutors will be required to ask the court to 
set as a condition for release that the accused surrender his 
weapons to the police.
<P>
	Second, victims will be informed quickly and automatically of 
the provisional release of the accused and of the conditions set by 
the court. They will also be informed of a release under a 
temporary absence or parole program.
<P>
	Third, a prevention campaign on violence against women will be 
launched. Moreover, the Quebec police information centre will 
record all cases of spousal abuse, as well as all conditions for 
release. Firearms will be confiscated immediately when a spouse is 
arrested. In the education sector, the emphasis will be put on the 
prevention of spousal abuse and on locating children who witness 
such violence. This is what we call action.
<P>
	Again, these are only a few of the measures included in the 
Quebec action program. On behalf of my colleagues, of women 
who are victims of spousal abuse, and of Quebecers, I congratulate 
the Quebec government for this major initiative.
<P>
	While Quebec is taking action in its fields of jurisdiction, what 
does the federal government do?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Finestone:</B> We implemented laws to take similar action.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Gagnon:</B> There is some and, in fact, quite a bit of inertia at 
the federal level. Let us start with the achievements of the 
government, as mentioned by the secretary of state for the status of 
women. I must say that I have some sympathy for the hon. member, 
since she must work with a government that shelved the issue of 
women as soon as it took office.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> You know that is not true.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Gagnon:</B> So, this government approves a plan to promote 
equality between men and women. Mr. Speaker, could they please 
let me finish? The government pledges to implement the program 
for action approved at the fourth world conference on women. It 
passes a bill on gun control. That is nice, but that is also very little 
after two years in office.
<P>
	Let us now look at what the government did not do. Let us look 
at the missed opportunities. There are quite a few. The government 
did not amend the Criminal Code to specifically prohibit female 
genital mutilation. That is also a form of violence. It does not 
happen here, but it is a form of violence. It also takes place in 
Canada. The government did not protest to Chinese authorities 
when, just last week, the situation of orphan baby girls became 
public. That is also a form of violence against women. These 
women are seen as an excess, a surplus.
<P>
	The government did not amend the Canadian Human Rights Act 
to protect homosexuals against discrimination. That is also another 
form of violence. The government did not put its reform projects 
through the prism of its plan to promote equality for women, thus 
forcing many women to live in poverty. That is another form of 
violence, and we are still a long way from achieving equality 
between the two sexes.
<P>
	In conclusion, I ask the government to truly follow the spirit and 
the letter of the recommendations made 25 years ago already. I ask 
the government to implement, in its own fields of jurisdiction, true 
measures to promote equality between men and women, so that 
some day we can say that the tragedy which occurred at 
Polytechnique was a terrible but isolated incident.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
think all members of this House share in the painful memory of the 
tragic event that happened six years ago, in 1989, when we lost 14 
of our young women at l'École polytechnique in Montreal. They 
fell victim to a senseless crime.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17285"> 17285 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1520)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We all believe the rights of victims of crime must be placed 
before the rights of criminals in society. Today we feel those 
sentiments most deeply.
<P>
	Exactly one year ago today in the House of Commons we held an 
emergency debate on violence against women. I appreciate the 
noble sentiments that continue to be espoused by those who speak 
on this and similar issues, for I too share those ideals. However, I 
am greatly concerned that in the intervening years since that 
emergency debate very little has been done to improve the 
situation.
<P>
	I am concerned that the House does only lip service to 
addressing the issue of violence against women, children and men. 
Remember, we must not limit our focus to eradicating violence 
against women. We must enlarge our scope and become active 
pacifists to wipe out senseless violence in society. We must rally to 
this sentiment and demonstrate to the world that Canada is a leader 
in its efforts to reduce crime, to safeguard its citizens and to 
champion the rights of victims.
<P>
	To do this we must get at the root of the problem, not just smooth 
over the symptoms. Gun control will not in and of itself solve the 
problems of violence in society.
<P>
	I believe that until the government of the day can identify the 
root causes of crime, until it can identify the reasons for domestic 
violence and violence against women, we will continue waking 
every day to face the personal tragedies brought on by crime.
<P>
	Today the government must take a more positive step in the area 
of violence against women and demonstrate its commitment to 
rooting out the problems the minister has alluded to.
<P>
	In its press release of November 27 of this year Status of Women 
Canada called violence against women a violation of women's 
human rights. I agree with this statement and I believe the 
government should enforce its sentiments.
<P>
	The government sent many people at great taxpayer expense to 
the women's conference in China. I challenge that conference site 
on the basis of China's terrible record of human rights abuse, 
especially to women, children and political dissidents. At that 
conference our government confirmed that eliminating violence 
remains a priority. It should be, and according to the secretary of 
state it is, a global goal not limited to Canada.
<P>
	Today is a serious day for us all, a day for us to remember, a day 
for us to help the healing. It is a day when we should all commit to 
moving forward. We must foster attitudes which promote peace 
and tolerance and express zero tolerance for the violation of human 
rights and zero tolerance for violence against women.
<P>
	Echoing sentiments of the Secretary of State for the Status of 
Women, I pledge and let us all pledge in memory of the women 
who died six years ago to continue vigorously our campaign 
against violence to prevent such tragedies.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order, I request the 
consent of the House to speak briefly on this subject on behalf of 
the New Democratic Party.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Is it agreed?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to address the House on this 
important day. I rise on behalf of all New Democrats on this 
national day of remembrance and action on violence against 
women, December 6.
<P>
	Today is the anniversary of the 1989 Montreal massacre at 
l'École Polytechnique. Fourteen women died on this day, a great 
tragedy. Today we reflect on, remember, mourn and call for further 
action to address and prevent violence against women.
<P>
<B>(1525)</B>
<P>
	On this day I also remember the work of my former colleague, a 
New Democratic member of Parliament from British Columbia, 
Dawn Black, whose efforts during the previous Parliament led to 
the establishment of this national day of remembrance and action. I 
think of her dedication to the House and to the issue of violence 
against women when I think of the motion today.
<P>
	I also remember and sympathize with the families of the 14 
women who died simply because they were women. Those families 
live with the effects of this great tragedy in ways many of us will 
never fully understand.
<P>
	Violence cannot be condoned, but it cannot be treated only with 
punishment. We must understand violence and treat the causes as 
well as the criminals. A plan of action must be recognized every 
day of the year, in every part of the country and in all our actions. 
We must deal with the economic and social roots of the 
circumstances which lead to violence against women. We must 
deal with economic and social legislation in the House. We have to 
keep in mind the possible human consequences of that legislation 
every day of our lives. We are confronted daily with decisions we 
can make in the House which may affect people in ways which 
could lead to violence and we must address those matters.
<P>
	Today is the day on which we reflect on, remember and mourn 
that which has been done to women. We must address the need to 
work further on this important issue. I trust all members of the 
House will heed the call for action on this important day.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Wayne:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I also would

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, today on the 
national day of remembrance and action to end violence against 
women I rise to extend the sympathies of my party to victims of 
violence across the country.
<P>
	Six years ago 14 young women were brutally murdered at 
l'École Polytechnique in Montreal. That act of violence 
reverberated across the country. Its pure senselessness shocked us 
profoundly. It made us question the direction Canadian society was 
taking. It prompted the federal government to take action to deal 
with this issue at home and internationally.
<P>
	As a society we must be committed to stopping violence against 
women both in and outside the home. We have to address the root 
causes of violence. As members of the House we must pass laws 
which will do that. Progress is being made on this front, but only 
continuing efforts involving each and every one of us on both sides 
of the House will change the attitudes which perpetuate violence.
<P>
	To the families of the 14 young women whose lives were so 
brutally cut short six years ago today and to all those who have 
suffered because of violence, they are in our thoughts and in our 
prayers. It is not enough to have a policy of zero tolerance against 
violence. As legislators we must take concrete action so that 
women, indeed all Canadians, can lead their lives free from the fear 
of violence. We must try to find out what has happened in our 
society and what has changed in our society which brings about 
these brutal acts.

	<B>Mr. Bernard Patry (Pierrefonds-Dollard, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, pursuant to Standing Order 108(1) and 108(2), on behalf 
of the chair, the hon. member for Burin-St. George's, I have the 
honour to present the eighth report of the Standing Committee on 
Health entitled ``A Study of National AIDS Strategy: Report of the 
Subcommittee on HIV-AIDS''.
<P>
	Pursuant to Standing Order 109, we are asking for a government 
response to our report.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	That sub-committee was created by the Standing Committee on 
Health in 1994. Its precise terms of reference were to study the 
spread of HIV, the prevention and the treatment of AIDS and the 
support for HIV carriers and AIDS sufferers, and to focus 
particularly on the role of poverty and discrimination in that 
situation.
<P>
	The sub-committee has now completed the first phase of its 
work, that is a thorough review of the National AIDS Strategy. It 
held hearings from December 1994 to May 1995.
<P>
	The report touches briefly on the epidemiology of HIV in 
Canada and around the world. It deals with the various elements of 
the strategy, the orientation, the coordination, the partnerships, the 
budget, community action, education and prevention, care and 
treatment, and finally, research. It contains several 
recommendations suggesting that the federal government increases 
its efforts in the fight against the AIDS epidemic.

	<B>Mrs. Anna Terrana (Vancouver East, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to present a petition from 110 British Columbians, many 
of them from my riding of Vancouver East.
<P>
	The petitioners would like to draw the attention of Parliament to 
the continuing military offence in Sri Lanka and the arrest in 
Toronto of Mr. Manickavasagam Suresh.
<P>
	The petitioners call upon Parliament to ensure Canadian 
neutrality so that the national conflict in Sri Lanka is not 
jeopardized; to intervene immediately and release Mr. Suresh; to 
take action to lift economic embargo and press censorship in the 
north and east of Sri Lanka; to allow freedom of movement of the 
civilians in the north and east of Sri Lanka without fear, 
intimidation, and terror; and to resolve the conflict between the 
Tamil people and the Sri Lankan government through peaceful 
negotiations between the Sri Lankan government and the LTTE, the 
representative of the Tamil people.

	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have two 
petitions I wish to present today on behalf of the residents of 
Simcoe Centre.
<P>
	The first group of petitioners are requesting that the Government 
of Canada not amend the Human Rights Act to include the 
undefined phrase sexual orientation. The petitioners are troubled 
about not defining the phrase sexual orientation. They have a 
legitimate concern that such a broad term could include all kinds of 
sexual behaviour.

	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the second 
petition involves section 718.2 of the Criminal Code.
<P>
	The petitioners are concerned that naming some groups in 
legislation will exclude other groups from protection and that 
sentencing based on the concept of hatred is very subjective and 
will undermine our justice system.

	<B>Mr. Jim Jordan (Leeds-Grenville, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
the privilege of presenting a petition asking the government to 
respect and maintain the historic significance of militia units in 
Canada. This particular petition comes from Brockville and of 
course they are referring specifically to the famed and historic 
Brockville Rifles.
<P>
	Their feeling is that in the haste to streamline the role of 
Canada's forces, the militia will be looked upon as an easy target 
and something that can be done without much significance. 
However, I want to remind the government that very often in small 
communities that is the only federal presence that exists. 
Therefore, I would like to see it maintained and restructured or the 
role redefined. The petitioners understand that change is likely to 
happen, but they are not prepared to see it happen in such a way 
that there will no longer be reserves. It is a pleasure to present this 
petition.
<P>
	The second petition I have contains 2,500 names and concerns 
the same topic of maintaining the Brockville Rifles, but it is 
lacking a little bit in form. So I am using this method in bringing 
this concern to the public.

	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I had prepared a speech, but I am going to have to

period which I find extremely important. But first, I would like to 
let you know that all Bloc members will speak for 10 minutes only.
<P>
	Last Wednesday, when he tabled his motion, the Prime Minister 
said, and I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-Quebec is a distinct society within Canada. As a Quebecer and a francophone, 
I understand and share the desire of my fellow Quebecers to have our difference 
recognized.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He was talking to the motion he had tabled in the House. The 
motion reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Whereas the people of Quebec have expressed the desire for recognition of 
Quebec's distinct society;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(1) the House recognize that Quebec is a distinct society within Canada;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(2) the House recognize that Quebec's distinct society includes its 
French-speaking majority, unique culture and civil law tradition;</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This afternoon, during question period, I asked the Prime 
Minister if he was in agreement with his colleagues on the heritage 
committee who, for the past two weeks,  have been coming 
strongly against the distinct society and Quebec culture. I asked the 
Prime minister if he believed that his colleagues had the right to 
state that there was only one culture in Canada, and that, from now 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17290"> 17290 </A></B>
<P>
on, Telefilm Canada should fund artists on the basis of their 
political obedience.
<P>
	The Prime Minister rose in this House and said that in Canada, 
there was only one culture, a Canadian one, whether French or 
English. It would appear that, two weeks after tabling in the House 
a motion saying that we are distinct because of our unique culture, 
the Prime Minister has not understood his own motion, probably 
because it was written by a member of his staff. If our culture is 
unique, it is the Quebec culture since we are in Quebec, and that is 
what we are requesting.
<P>
	Our culture is unique because it is French, because among other 
things our majority is French-speaking. But, today, the Prime 
Minister said: ``No. There is only one culture and it is Canadian.'' 
You cannot have it both ways, either the Prime Minister does not 
understand the meaning of the motion or he understands very well 
and, for the first time this afternoon, when he rose in the House, he 
recognized that Quebec is not a people, that there is only one 
people and it is Canadian, English Canadian preferably. However, 
he allows us the privilege of expressing the English culture in 
French. This is the gist of what he said this afternoon.
<P>
	Yet, when we passed the bill which created the Department of 
Canadian Heritage we asked that the government be responsible 
and acknowledge that there was a distinct society in Quebec. We 
repeated our request, we proposed amendments to recognize 
Quebec culture, but the Liberal government trivialized Quebec. It 
made its culture part of the Canadian melting pot, excluding it from 
its bill on culture and denying Quebec its very distinct existence, its 
fundamental right to express its difference.
<P>
<B>(1630)</B>
<P>
	During the last two weeks, the Liberal Party's representatives on 
the Heritage Standing Committee practically had allergic reactions 
every time they heard or met witnesses who financed artists or 
films.
<P>
	Today, the Quebec people want to be recognized as a people and 
want the powers which go with it. On October 30, 49.5 per cent of 
Quebecers voted for a country of their own; the federal government 
is offering us an empty shell, which has only some value as a 
symbol, and we realized today that it is not even worth the paper it 
was written on two weeks ago.
<P>
	Quebecers are a people. As early as 1766, the English 
government of Murray said that Quebecers, who were then called 
Canadians, were a brave and courageous people.
<P>
	In 1791, the Constitutional Act divided Canada's territory into 
two colonies, in order to recognize the  existence of two peoples on 
its territory. At that time, these two peoples were called the 
Canadian people, but they lived in Quebec, hence today's 
Quebecers, and the British people.
<P>
	In 1839, Lord Durham, whom we cannot suspect of being a 
Quebec nationalist or of having a separatist frame of mind, came to 
the following conclusion in his report on the state of the colony, 
and I quote: ``Problems in Lower Canada are not political or 
administrative in nature, but are the result of the forced 
co-existence of two distinct nations in the same state.''
<P>
	In 1905, Sir Wilfrid Laurier, an inveterate Liberal, said and I 
quote: ``Every time I go back to my province, I am sad to see there 
is a feeling that Canada is not for all Canadians. We must come to 
the conclusion that Quebec is our only homeland.''
<P>
	In 1965, the Laurendeau-Dunton Commission, whose work 
Prime Minister Trudeau hastened to wreck, released a preliminary 
report in which it noted that Canada was going through the most 
serious crisis in its history. The commission exposed in these terms 
the misunderstanding on which the Canadian crisis was based and 
is still based, and I quote: ``[-] English people, many of whom 
were showing good will [-]did not understand [-]the profound 
leanings of so many Quebecers towards an increased autonomy and 
their growing belief that Quebec would become a distinct nation 
ruling its economic and social institutions.''
<P>
	Because English Canada still does not understand Quebec, the 
constitutional future is doomed and we will never be recognized as 
a people. According to the Laurendeau-Dunton Commission, an 
essential requirement for Canada's survival is a real association 
that can only exist between equal partners.
<P>
	In fact, this motion is totally in line with what Manitoba Premier 
Gary Filmon told the <I>Toronto Star</I> on April 27, and I quote:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
``Quebec has to make its decision based on what I believe is the 
greatest country in the world and not look for us to change our 
country in order to make it more acceptable for them''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In fact, the Premier of Manitoba is telling us to either take 
Canada as it is or leave. That is why the Bloc Quebecois is 
fundamentally opposed to the motion before us today, and our 
voting against it will surprise no one in Quebec. Quebec is no 
longer content with crumbs. Quebecers have risen, they are 
standing up with their heads held high. They are asserting 
themselves as a people who want to be recognized as such and they 
want to negotiate as equals.
<P>

<P>
<HR>

<P>
	In the wake of the Meech failure, Robert Bourassa said, and 
I quote: ``Quebec is, today and forever, a distinct society that is 
free and capable of controlling its own destiny and development''.
<P>
<B>(1635)</B>
<P>
	At his party's March 1991 convention, he convinced his 
colleagues to adopt the Allaire resolution, which read as follows: 
``The failure of the Meech Lake accord is a historic event. This 
failure has made it imperative for Canada to change. Above all, the 
Meech Lake accord failure occurred at a time in history when 
Quebec society has reached a level of maturity, openness and 
development allowing it to feel fully in control of its future. 
Undoubtedly, Quebec now has the means and resources needed to 
exercise its choices''.
<P>
	Quebecers know that the Prime Minister's proposal is empty. 
Today, they understand that the Prime Minister is incapable of 
quoting a single Quebec author. His references are strictly 
Canadian. Quebec will accept nothing less than to be recognized as 
a people with all the powers that this entails.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Eleni Bakopanos (Saint-Denis, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
the hon. members of the Bloc Quebecois are once more forgetting 
that the people of Quebec have reaffirmed their sense of belonging 
to this country.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am sorry to interrupt, but 
the table advises me that there will be no questions and comments 
since we are debating a special motion. The hon. member for 
Richmond-Wolfe will be sharing the member's speaking time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I welcome this opportunity to speak today on the Prime 
Minister's motion to outline Quebec's traditional demands and 
show that this motion of the Liberal Party of Canada is nothing 
more than a charade to water down the aspirations of the people of 
Quebec.
<P>
	My remarks will be broken down into three parts, covering the 
last three decades. What happened during each of these three 
decades?
<P>
	Thirty years ago, during the quiet revolution, there developed in 
Quebec a clear movement in favour of Quebec becoming a 
sovereign state and assuming sole responsibility over its social and 
economic policies. This prompted the Quebec government to 
undertake discussions on the patriation of the Constitution, that is 
to say on a new division of powers and on an amending formula 
that would be acceptable to Quebec.
<P>
	In 1964, the Fulton-Favreau formula restricted the federal 
government's capability to act unilaterally, by requiring a majority 
of two thirds of the provinces to make substantive changes to 
federal institutions. This gave rise to widespread protest in Quebec.
<P>
	In fact, the Fulton-Favreau formula was putting off negotiations 
on the substantive issue, namely the division of powers, to deal 
only with the technical aspect of the matter, namely the patriation 
of the Constitution.
<P>
	The Quebec government then specified that any agreement 
concerning the patriation of the Constitution would be subject to a 
positive and satisfactory redistribution of powers. From then on, 
this will become a traditional demand. A new Constitution was to 
give the Government of Quebec the broadest powers possible on 
the basis of affirming the two-nation status of Canada in the 
country's social, political and economic structures.
<P>
	But Pierre Trudeau and the Liberal Party of Canada did not 
agree. Trudeau objected to policies based on Quebec as a nation. As 
part of the patriation process, they were intent on doing away with 
the Quebec rhetoric based on the concept of collective rights and 
with the fact that the French Canadian nation was becoming 
identified with the Quebec government.
<P>
	At this stage of the negotiations to patriate the Canadian 
Constitution, the political thinking of Prime Minister Pierre 
Trudeau is clear: Canadian federalism cannot, without jeopardizing 
its integrity, tolerate any constitutional asymmetry in the 
distribution and use of legislative powers.
<P>
	Moreover, in Mr. Trudeau's mind, there are essentially only 
citizens and their individual freedoms vis-à-vis the state. 
Consequently, the Quebec society must blend with the rest of 
Canada.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	The Victoria charter marks the beginning of a second decade of 
negotiations and discussions to patriate the Constitution. The 
charter recognizes Quebec's jurisdiction over social policies, but 
seeks to impose national standards. In a letter to the Prime 
Minister, in which he states his refusal to accept the Victoria 
charter, then Quebec premier Robert Bourassa writes: ``Canadian 
federalism must be decentralized to reflect the diversity of the 
regions, and to allow the Quebec government to preserve the 
cultural future of its majority''.
<P>
	In March 1976, Pierre Trudeau, who was still Prime Minister, 
writes in a letter addressed to all provincial premiers that if there is 
no unanimity, the federal government will have no choice but to 
decide whether or not to recommend to Parliament the patriation of 
the 1867 Constitutional Act.
<P>
	The third decade of discussions and negotiations on the 
patriation of the BNA Act starts with the failure of the Quebec 
government to obtain a mandate to negotiate 
sovereignty-association with the rest of Canada, a concept which 
implies the national 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17292"> 17292 </A></B>
<P>
recognition of Quebecers, as well as a major redistribution of 
constitutional powers, in favour of Quebec. As early as 1981, and 
in spite of having been re-elected, the Parti  Quebecois finds itself 
in an extremely vulnerable position vis-à-vis the federal 
government. A scathing answer came from the Liberal Party then 
in power in Ottawa. The Canadian Prime Minister took advantage 
of Quebec's vulnerability and proceeded with unilateral patriation 
of the Constitution.
<P>
	On December 1, 1981, Quebec's legislature adopted a resolution 
opposing unilateral patriation of the Constitution. Thus, Quebec 
reaffirmed its will to entrench in the new Constitution the 
fundamental equality of the two founding peoples as well as, as a 
natural consequence of its distinct society status, its extended and 
exclusive jurisdictions.
<P>
	The ``Canada Act'', or the Constitution Act of 1982, was the 
temporary conclusion of a process which had been going on for 
over 20 years. The charter of rights and freedoms, enshrined in the 
new Constitution, is the very basis of the principle of a Canadian 
nation. It gives the central power unprecedented political influence, 
an unparalleled power of centralization.
<P>
	We all know what happened next: the day Pierre Trudeau 
decided to unilaterally patriate the Constitution, the Liberal Party 
of Canada lost Quebec; since the 1984 election, it never could 
obtain more than a third of Quebecer's votes. From then on, it 
spoke mainly for Canada. The Conservative Party came to power in 
Ottawa and undertook to have the newly patriated Constitution 
signed by Quebec. More consultations were held between the 
premiers, which led to the Meech Lake accord in June 1987. A 
strong basis for negotiation was then laid out between Canada and 
Quebec since that accord has forced the courts, from the Supreme 
Court on down, to interpret the whole Constitution, including the 
charter of rights and freedoms, in light of the traditional claims of 
Quebec.
<P>
	Once again, however, the Liberal Party of Canada was not 
prepared to accept that and did everything in its power to scuttle the 
1987 accord. The current Prime Minister and leader of the Liberal 
Party made every effort, with the assistance of the hon. member for 
Sherbrooke, to water down the recognition of the distinct nature of 
Quebec. In English Canada, where the Meech Lake accord gave 
rise to much opposition, his voice was heard as being extremely 
effective in ruining any political basis needed for the accord to 
succeed.
<P>
	The current Prime Minister and leader of the Liberal Party then 
reiterated his party's position: Canadian federalism cannot accept 
constitutional asymmetry without being substantially weakened, 
Quebec cannot be regarded as a nation and only individual rights 
are recognized by the charter of rights and freedoms, which is the 
only instrument for interpreting the Constitution and the status of 
the Quebec state.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	Last week in the House, the leader of the Bloc Quebecois 
described the rapprochement that was made in the late 80s between 
the Conservative Party and the Liberal Party of Canada, a 
rapprochement which led to the Charest report, where the 
interpretative clause granted to Quebec in view of its distinct 
nature, as a state representing a nation, was formally denied.
<P>
	The beginning of the third decade of talks and negotiations about 
the status of the province of Quebec in the Canadian 
Confederation, pursuant to a Constitution which Quebec never 
agreed on, is marked again by a toughening of Quebec's position. 
Since it obviously could not expect anything from English Canada, 
the Quebec government, largely supported by the voters, now 
favoured a clearly sovereignist option, as shown, first, by the 
emergence of the Bloc Quebecois and the mass election of its 
members in Ottawa; second, by the almost total disappearance of 
the Conservative Party; third, by the failure of the Charlottetown 
accord; and lastly, by the election of the Parti Quebecois in Quebec.
<P>
	From then on Quebec would no longer get involved in endless 
and useless rounds of negotiations. The results of the second 
referendum on the sovereignty issue held in the province of Quebec 
occurred half-way through this third decade, recognizing the 
dazzling progress made by the sovereignty option in Quebec since 
the failure of Meech. Quebec is now heading towards its political 
sovereignty and nothing can make it go backwards. Certainly not 
this silly resolution which the Prime Minister of Canada introduced 
last week to urge the House of Commons to recognize Quebec as a 
distinct society. This is only a token recognition.
<P>
	This very day, in the House of Commons, during question 
period, the Prime Minister himself denied the existence of a 
Quebec culture although his own resolution aims at recognizing it. 
He stated that there is only one culture in Canada, and that is the 
Canadian culture. We will vote against this resolution, which is as 
hypocritical as it can get.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Labour, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to speak to the members of the House of 
Commons in the debate on the motion to recognize Quebec as a 
distinct society within Canada. In order to properly understand the 
true scope of what the Government of Canada is doing by 
proposing this resolution, it must be interpreted in the light of the 
vote this past October 30.
<P>
	Quebecers had two very clear things to tell us: they want to be 
recognized within Canada for what they are: a people with a 
French-speaking majority and a different and distinct culture. They 
also want to see profound changes made to the way the Canadian 
federation operates.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17293"> 17293 </A></B>
<P>
	Of course, our government needs to respond to economic 
imperatives and to the necessity of ensuring the continuation of 
our social programs, and this requires new partnerships with the 
provinces. We must, however, also acknowledge the reality of 
Quebec's malaise, a malaise directly linked to the wounds of the 
past, the most severe of these being the failure of the Meech Lake 
Accord.
<P>
	The Leader of the Opposition, in his reply to the Prime 
Minister's speech, has given us his version of the recent history of 
our country and the path it took through the constitutional to-ing 
and fro-ing. Allow me then to give you my version, that of a 
Quebecer with a totally different perspective. I was there when the 
Meech Lake Accord failed.
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	Unlike the Parti Québecois and a number of the Bloc members 
who voted against Meech, what I wanted along with most of my 
fellow citizens was for there to be recognition that Quebec is 
distinct, different, and it was my impression at that time that this 
country did not accept me for who and what I was.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	However, I understood that it was not the country that was 
refusing to recognize me. It was not my fellow citizens who were 
not willing to recognize me. It was rather the very process of 
constitutional negotiations and of agreement ratification that led us 
to this dead end. This is why I wondered, is it necessary to break up 
my country just because we have difficulty agreeing on the process 
to be used?
<P>
	The answer is clear to me. I believe it is possible to pursue the 
discussion and continue to build this prosperous country in an 
atmosphere of respect and generosity.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It is my firm belief, with the majority of Quebecers, that it is 
possible for us to reconcile two realities: our identity as Quebecers, 
of which we are extremely proud, and our identity as part of 
Canada.
<P>
	I have always believed that these two realities are in no way 
mutually exclusive, and that they do not in any way justify the 
destruction of a country built up by the generations before us with 
such effort and determination. That is what I defended then as a 
member of the Liberal Government in Quebec, and that is what I 
defend now as a member of this Liberal Government in Ottawa.
<P>
	During the referendum campaign, the Prime Minister of Canada 
made commitments he is meeting today by recognizing that 
Quebec is a distinct society. To do so is to recognize history, our 
common history. To do so is to remember the origins of the Canada 
of 1867 which opted for a federal system designed to reconcile 
Quebec's right to be a distinct and provincial autonomy with the 
need  to work together to build this vast country of ours that is 
Canada.
<P>
	In a speech to the Quebec Legislative Assembly on November 
24, 1871, Sir Wilfrid Laurier said, and I quote: ``It is a historical 
fact that the federal system was adopted only to maintain the 
exceptional and unique position of the province of Quebec on the 
American continent''.
<P>
	Do not get me wrong. I am simply stressing that unlike those 
who believe that separation is the only way for Quebec to take its 
place within Canada, I am convinced we can deal with this matter 
in a different way, without breaking up the country.
<P>
	The Leader of the Opposition may argue that distinct society is 
no longer an issue in Quebec but the fact remains that Quebecers 
earnestly want their distinctiveness to be recognized. This 
government understands that. Of course, some people would have 
preferred to see this recognition immediately entrenched in the 
Constitution, because the logical corollary of this recognition is its 
inclusion in the basic law of our country.
<P>
	We would have preferred to do so now. However, the PQ 
government and the leader of the Bloc Quebecois have already 
closed the door on any discussion. Nevertheless, by rejecting the 
proposal for Quebec's separation on October 30, Quebecers clearly 
gave their provincial government a mandate to work together with 
the Canadian government to find practical solutions and help 
Quebec develop its potential within the Canadian federation.
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	The government of Canada understood the message and 
presented, in an initial gesture of openness, the motion we are 
debating today in the House of Commons. We have met our 
commitment. The ball is now in the court of the Parti Quebecois 
and the Bloc Quebecois. By their stubborn refusal to consider any 
options for change, they are saying no to Quebecers. Make no 
mistake: whether the option selected to describe distinct society is 
Meech 1, Meech 2, Meech 3, Charlottetown 1, Charlottetown 2 or 
Charlottetown 3, the response of the leader of the Bloc Quebecois 
was very clear: ``I am a sovereigntist and I will never sign an 
agreement with the Canadian government''.
<P>
	The Leader of the Opposition often says Quebecers look to the 
past to justify their choice. I say to him today that Quebecers will 
also remember that the Bloc Quebecois and its leader refused to 
vote for the recognition of Quebec as a distinct society in this 
House.
<P>
	To recognize Quebec as a distinct society within Canada is a step 
in the right direction, as our federalist partners from Quebec 
acknowledged. It will provide the foundation for new, constructive 
relations with all our fellow Canadians. For once, the Parliament of 
Canada  will be united. And when we have passed this motion, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17294"> 17294 </A></B>
<P>
Parliament will have to consider the distinct identity of Quebec. 
For the first time, elected representatives of all Canadians will 
make a solemn and meaningful gesture towards the people of 
Quebec. As a Quebecer, I am proud to be part of a government that 
recognizes the distinct identity of the people of Quebec, and I am 
proud to be a member of this government which will continue to 
work towards including this recognition of the Canadian 
Constitution.
<P>
	Because the interests of Quebec and the interests of Canada as a 
whole are involved, I will vote in favour of this motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul DeVillers (Simcoe North, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
am pleased to take part in this historic debate on the Prime 
Minister's motion which recognizes Quebec as a distinct society by 
its language, its culture and its civil law tradition.
<P>
	The motion we are now debating is one of three initiatives for 
change announced by the Prime Minister last week and which act 
on the commitments made during the referendum campaign in 
Quebec. In addition to recognizing Quebec as a distinct society 
within Canada, the federal government will henceforth grant a 
regional veto on all constitutional changes and pull out of 
manpower training.
<P>
	These initiatives result from promises that the Prime Minister 
made to his fellow Quebecers during the referendum campaign 
and, particularly, the great Montreal rally which brought together 
more than 150,000 people, including 500 from my riding of 
Simcoe-North and the neighbouring riding.
<P>
	It is important to note that these initiatives are not the only 
measures the government has taken in response to Quebec's 
referendum, but they surely are an important step. Moreover, they 
are further proof that when the Prime Minister makes a promise to 
Canadians, he keeps his word.
<P>
	During the referendum campaign, everybody was talking about 
the need for change, everybody said that, from then on, things 
should be done differently if our country were to remain united. 
However, I have the impression that the change the vast majority of 
politicians were referring to did not reflect what Quebecers want.
<P>
<B>(1700)</B>
<P>
	Indeed, when I was going from door to door during the 
referendum campaign, people were constantly telling me that they 
wanted jobs, economic stability, a better future for their children, a 
good social climate, and so on. I can assure the House that the 
numerous Quebecers I met gave little importance to constitutional 
changes and the squabbles that go with it.
<P>
	In this regard, Quebecers are not very different from all other 
citizens of Canada. People from my riding of Simcoe-North 
express the same concerns. That is why I say that the commitment 
to change to which we should give a lot of importance is the one the 
Canadian people, including Quebecers, want. This is why I am 
proud to be part of a government which, for two years now, has 
been tackling with the real problems of the Canadian people, which 
are job creation and economic growth.
<P>
	That being said, the proposals put forward by the Prime Minister 
are not without sound basis and legitimacy. The motion on distinct 
society is important because it recognizes an obvious historic fact 
and reassures Quebecers as to their place in our country. In fact, the 
concept of distinct society is not new, neither historically, nor 
constitutionally.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	According to Professor Ramsay Cook, francophones in British 
North America and Canada developed early on a consciousness of 
their distinctiveness, both individually and collectively. The most 
obvious badge of that distinctiveness was language, while the civil 
code provided a legal foundation for difference.
<P>
	The idea of distinctiveness is even recognized implicitly in the 
British North America Act of 1867. The mere fact of creating the 
province of Quebec was the beginning of acknowledging a distinct 
society within Canada. There are also explicit recognitions of this 
fact in the Constitution. For example, section 94 recognizes the 
civil law of Quebec as distinct. Section 133 made Quebec, alone 
among the original provinces, bilingual, and by doing so made 
French for the first time an official language of Canada.
<P>
	The motion put forth by the Prime Minister is yet another 
explicit means to acknowledge Quebec's distinctiveness. Even 
though the distinct society resolution we are debating is not a 
constitutional resolution, it is important that it is a solemn 
commitment that sets out how the federal government, the only 
government in Canada that speaks for all Canadians, will conduct 
its affairs. In effect, it will indicate to all citizens and all federal 
government authorities that it is the will of the House of Commons 
that the distinct character of Quebec society be recognized once 
again within the Canadian federation.
<P>
	I also want to assure all Canadians that the expression ``distinct 
society'' is not exhaustive by any means. Even though the motion 
simply notes that the distinct society includes some specific 
elements of Quebec, it does not exclude others. It does not exclude 
the fact that Quebec is a pluralistic and democratic society, that all 
its citizens are equal before the law, the Canadian Charter of Rights 
and Freedoms, or the Canadian Constitution.
<P>
	This motion and the other measures announced by the Prime 
Minister are a significant first step in delivering on  the promises he 
made during the referendum campaign. They are also an important 
bridge to the first ministers conference on the amending formula 
that is scheduled to take place in April 1997. Once these negoti-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17295"> 17295 </A></B>
<P>
ations start we will have benefited from the practical application of 
the distinct society motion and the veto bill.
<P>
	The Prime Minister made it quite clear that these measures can 
some day be entrenched in the Constitution if it is the desire of the 
province of Quebec and other provinces to do so. However, the 
Government of Quebec has stated categorically that it does not 
want to participate in any constitutional discussions. Until this 
unreasonable position of the Parti Quebecois government changes, 
we will not be able to incorporate these measures into the 
Constitution.
<P>
<B>(1705)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I am convinced that the vast majority of Quebecers will view 
these initiatives in a favourable light. They will see that the Prime 
Minister is serious about making the changes they want.
<P>
	Obviously, members of the Bloc Quebecois and of the Parti 
Quebecois will oppose these changes. The reason is simple: they 
are separatists. They have no intention of improving 
Confederation. Their only goal is to destroy Canada. As Jacques 
Parizeau said during the referendum campaign: ``We do not want a 
distinct society, we want a country.''
<P>
	In spite of the intransigence of the Bloc Quebecois and of the 
Parti Quebecois, we will not let them prevent the adoption of these 
changes that are not of a constitutional nature, changes that the 
people of Quebec and the rest of Canada want.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I would like to advise the House that I will be splitting my 
time with my colleague, the member for Simcoe Centre.
<P>
	I am pleased and I am also saddened to rise today and speak to 
government motion M-26, which seeks to recognize Quebec as a 
distinct society. It also gives me great pleasure to stand before my 
colleagues in the House today as a loyal Canadian and state why I 
am opposed to this motion.
<P>
	Speaking here today, I hope to make clear my opposition to this 
motion from a historical, legal, and personal point of view. Along 
with Bill C-110, this motion constitutes the other half of the Liberal 
initiative to appease Quebec separatists in the wake of the 
disastrous handling of the October 30 referendum by the Liberal 
government. From a historical perspective, I must again note the 
saying, which has often been quoted in the House, that those who 
do not learn from the mistakes of the past are destined to repeat 
them. It would appear  that history is not a subject the framers of 
this motion are even remotely acquainted with.
<P>
	For the benefit of those Liberal members who were not present 
in the Chamber last week for the debate on Bill C-110, I will say it 
again. If this motion were some grade B horror movie it would be 
dubbed ``Son of Meech''. This motion, or is it a rerun of a motion 
picture, is a doomed rehash of the Meech and Charlottetown 
packages which were ultimately rejected by Canadians. If they 
could be given a say on this motion it would be rejected outright as 
well.
<P>
	I was not present during the Meech and Charlottetown debates, 
so I have waited several years to speak on this issue, but my 
remarks are as relevant now as they would have been in 1987 or 
1992. This is when attempts similar to the one before us were made 
by the former Tory government.
<P>
	Yes, Madam Speaker, and members on both sides of the House, 
``je me souviens''. I remember the failures of those initiatives, even 
though the members across the way clearly do not. I also remember 
that a former prime minister and a government bloated with 
arrogance yet painfully thin on solution proposed essentially the 
same thing. I also remember what became of that government just 
one year later.
<P>
	It is because people remember and have learned from history 
that I say confidently that this motion is unacceptable to Canadians.
<P>
	From a legal point of view, this motion raises more questions 
than it answers. That would not necessarily be such a problem 
except that the Prime Minister will not answer any questions in 
regard to the meaning of that phrase ``distinct society''. What does 
that mean?
<P>
<B>(1710)</B>
<P>
	This lack of openness by the Prime Minister only adds to the 
confusion. For example, does the motion confer additional powers 
on Quebec or not? If, as I suspect, it does or will with the passage 
of time give powers to Quebec that are not given to the other 
provinces, then clearly it must be opposed.
<P>
	Also, is this motion the precursor for an attempt by the Prime 
Minister to entrench the notion of distinct society in the 
Constitution? If it is, as I suspect is the case, and the Prime 
Minister wishes to do so at the scheduled review of the 
Constitution in 1997, should Canadians not know this now? Let us 
have the government be forthright.
<P>
	By extension, any entrenchment of distinct society as an 
interpretive clause in the Constitution will be unacceptable to 
Canadians for the same reasons it was back in 1992. Also, does the 
notion of distinct society in any way detract from the principle that 
all Canadians are equal? Here again the government will give us 
nothing but vagaries.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17296"> 17296 </A></B>
<P>
	By way of personal remarks I would like to share with members 
on both sides of the House the contents of a very insightful letter 
I recently received. The letter is from François Labrecque, a 
longtime resident of Quebec. I had the honour of meeting him 
while I was in Quebec City recently, and he wrote to me with his 
thoughts on this distinct society issue. He writes quite intuitively: 
``I am not sure the concept of distinct society should be presented 
as is. Instead of thinking of powers and rights with regard to 
distinct society, we should think in terms of responsibilities of 
individuals, groups, responsibilities of the people themselves and 
of their provinces to ensure that the distinct character is 
preserved''.
<P>
	He concludes in part that the Liberal Party approach is to provide 
distinct society status for Quebec and nothing for the other regions 
and provinces, which provokes negative sentiment in the rest of 
Canada and is clearly a divisive element.
<P>
	This is a Quebecer I am quoting, who clearly understands the 
shortcomings of any distinct society proposal. Reformers would 
agree with his position.
<P>
	For the benefit of those Liberal members who require further 
insight, no Canadian doubts that the language and culture of 
Quebec make it distinct. The language is dynamic, the culture is 
vibrant. These two characteristics alone will ensure its survival. 
That is why attempts to legalize or enshrine the concept in the 
Constitution are so insulting and offensive to many Quebecois.
<P>
	The Liberals are asking Quebecers to adopt some siege mentality 
that claims their language and culture is weak and dying. 
Fortunately, Quebecers themselves know the exact opposite to be 
true and realize that assuming responsibilities in key areas will 
allow Quebec's distinctiveness to be maintained.
<P>
	From a personal point of view, I watched as the Prime Minister 
tabled this motion in the House last week on November 27. At the 
time I could not help but feel that my birthright as a Canadian was 
being sold for the sake of a deal. I cannot understand how a 
government that professes to be so dedicated to the concept of 
equality can advocate something that so detracts from this 
principle. Then again after seeing Bill C-64, the government's 
racial quota bill, I should not really be all that surprised.
<P>
<B>(1715 )</B>
<P>
	I ask members of the House to contemplate the concept of 
equality as they consider the consequences the motion will have on 
the equality rights of all Canadians.
<P>
	I cannot support the government's motion to recognize Quebec 
as a distinct society. There is no safeguard to ensure that the motion 
will not be used to further the goal of Quebec nationalists. There is 
no assurance the motion will not be used to confer additional 
powers on the legislature of Quebec. It offers no guarantee that 
individual rights will not be made  subservient to collective rights. 
It affords no protection to the minority population of the province.
<P>
	The leader of the Reform Party has put forward an amendment 
that would address many of the concerns I have raised. It is my 
hope that when it is put to a vote members opposite will support it. 
To do otherwise and to adopt the government's motion as is would 
be to characterize some Canadians as distinct and some as second 
class citizens.
<P>
	In conclusion, unless the amended motion is adopted by the 
House I serve notice of my intent to vote against the motion as put 
forward by the government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to speak against the motion to recognize Quebec as a 
distinct society. We are talking about a promise or a commitment 
and I will talk about some promises and commitments that have 
been made.
<P>
	I will start with a promise that was made in the eleventh hour. It 
is a reluctant promise. It is a promise that was made in panic and 
desperation. It is a promise that had to be made because the 
government was out of touch with the people of Quebec. It is a 
promise that was made with no reflection on the past or no vision of 
the future. It is a promise that is out of touch with Canadians as a 
whole. As a matter of fact 55 per cent of Canadians outside Quebec 
oppose the recognition of a distinct society.
<P>
	We are trying to bring in a promise the Canadian people already 
rejected at the front door. I am talking about Meech Lake and 
Charlottetown. The Canadian people had a say and they rejected 
the concept of a distinct society. Yet here we are trying to bring it in 
through the back door, top down, with no consultation. The 
government has imposed closure to push it through. The attitude is 
that it knows best what the people of Canada want. This is a Quebec 
promise, not a Canada promise.
<P>
	In October 1993 there was a cry for change in the country from 
both inside and outside Quebec. The message I heard in October 
1993 was that Canadians were worried. They were concerned. The 
response of the government since the election has been don't 
worry, be happy. After two years of blissful ignorance and a do 
nothing approach we almost lost the country on Monday night, 
October 30.
<P>
	It is interesting that during the referendum the separatists had 30 
days to spread their unchallenged version. The destroyers of 
Canada were given 30 days to get their message out. The 
government brings in closure so that we who want to speak for 
Canada, to get the Canada agenda out, are given 30 hours. We have 
30 hours to debate what is probably one of the most significant 
motions before the House in the two years we have been here.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17297"> 17297 </A></B>
<P>
	So much for open government. So much for government 
responding to the voters. We should not be surprised. This is the 
government that actually had to appoint candidates because it did 
not have confidence in the Canadian voters to select the right 
candidates. This is the government that shows its so-called true 
concern for the democratic process. This is the government that 
has shown its arrogance time and time again in the two years we 
have been here, with the rebuke of government members who 
stood to speak against gun control.
<P>
<B>(1720 )</B>
<P>
	We were dealing with a promise of desperation. Let us now deal 
with some promises or commitments that have been made to the 
Canadian people. What about the promise of jobs, jobs, jobs? Two 
years ago we heard about jobs, jobs, jobs, and today we have an 
unemployment rate of 9.4 per cent. In the month of November, 
44,000 jobs were lost in Canada. Where are those jobs? What 
happened to the much heralded infrastructure program that was to 
kickstart the economy and create jobs? It was another failure. All it 
did was put us $6 billion deeper in debt with no jobs. Now we have 
a cabinet committee looking at the job creation problem.
<P>
	It is also interesting that the only jobs we have right now are 
because of free trade. This is a government that opposed free trade, 
but it is a pleasure to stand today and recognize the jobs that free 
trade created.
<P>
	What about the promises of dealing with the deficit? Nothing has 
been done in two years in spite of warnings from Moody's and the 
IMF. Government members were shooting the messenger when 
Moody's warned the finance minister that he was not going far 
enough in dealing with the deficit. We have since learned that the 
IMF has issued the same warning to the government, that it has not 
been serious in attacking the deficit and that Canada is in great 
jeopardy.
<P>
	What about tax relief? Smokers are the only ones I know that 
received any tax relief from the government because it gave in to 
the smugglers. Canadians as a whole have not had any tax relief. In 
fact Canadians who drive cars are paying additional taxes which 
they can ill afford, although there was a commitment to tax relief.
<P>
	The statement in the red book on criminal justice was that 
fighting crime and violence required tough measures. We have not 
seen tough measures. Tough measures are lacking. We still have 
section 745 of the Criminal Code that allows those convicted of 
first degree murder back on the streets after 15 years and we still 
have no victims' rights.
<P>
	The government has not addressed the issue of political reform. 
We all experienced the level of cynicism and mistrust out there 
between the voters and the politicians. It still has not addressed the 
problem. It has done nothing about recall. As a matter of fact a 
private member's bill on recall was defeated in the House. The  
government does not believe in referenda, in letting Canadians 
have a say on major issues that affect their lives.
<P>
	The GST was to be replaced. In two years it has done nothing 
about the GST. The Deputy Prime Minister was to resign if the 
issue was not dealt with in two years. The last time I looked she 
was still in the House of Commons.
<P>
	I am highlighting these promises because they were made to all 
Canadians. If these promises had been kept, they would have gone 
a long way to addressing the unity crisis we face in the country. The 
people of Quebec are just as concerned as the people of Ontario and 
the people of B.C. about the fact that we have a government that is 
not getting its spending under control, that is not dealing with the 
criminal justice system, that does not respond to victims and that is 
not responding to elected politicians who represent the people in 
their ridings.
<P>
	We could see the people of Quebec during the referendum 
looking at Ottawa and asking: ``Could it be any worse if we went on 
our own?'' They were looking at a federal government that is 
failing to deal with the major problems of the country. It is 
conceivable some of them could very well have said to themselves: 
``Why not leave? What we are looking at in Ottawa is a situation 
that is taking us deeper and deeper into debt. There is no indication 
they have learned from the past and will do anything about it''.
<P>
	It is evident we have not learned anything from the past. I recall 
the <I>b</I> and <I>b</I> commission that originated back in 1965. It was to deal 
with the greatest crisis in the country. I supported that in 1965 
because I thought it would address the unity problems we were 
having and would bring the country together.
<P>
	After 30 years it has been an utter and complete failure. All the 
government has to do now is look across the aisle and staring it in 
the face are 53 members of Parliament elected from Quebec to tear 
the country apart, living testimonial to the failed policies of the 
past, the status quo.
<P>
	There is no question we must change. That was the message in 
October 1993. I am proud to say Reformers put forward 20 positive 
proposals for change that had strong support both inside and 
outside Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1725 )</B>
<P>
	The 20 proposals for change did not require opening up the 
Constitution. They could have been done by a willing government. 
We saw it as a win-win situation. It was to go a long way to keeping 
our country united. It was to go a long way to addressing our 
overspending because many of the changes dealt with a 
realignment of powers, decentralization, eliminating duplication 
and bringing governments closer to the people they were serving.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="17298"> 17298 </A></B>
<P>
	We also missed the message in the Spicer commission report. 
The Spicer commission criss-crossed Canada and spoke to over 
400,000 Canadians, 300,000 elementary and secondary school 
students. In the report there was strong support for equality of 
provinces and of people. There was also strong support for the 
recognition of Quebec's differences, but there was little support 
for two-tier citizenship. That is what the bill is dealing with.
<P>
	During our break in November I held a series of town hall 
meetings across my riding. I wanted to get the feel of the people 
about the situation we would be dealing with, the possibility of 
another referendum or the possibility of recognizing Quebec as a 
distinct society.
<P>
	I supplied the people at the meetings with a questionnaire. At the 
end of the meeting I asked them to answer this question: Would you 
support distinct society status for the province of Quebec if it 
meant granting special powers not available to the other provinces? 
Ninety-eight per cent of those who responded to the questionnaire 
said no to any special status in recognizing the province of Quebec.
<P>
	It is time the government stood up to the separatists and called 
their bluff. It is time to stand up for Canada and speak for Canada 
as a whole.
<P>
	This country is a great country. It can only continue to be a great 
country if it is based on equal provinces and equal citizens. I call on 
all members of the government to oppose recognition of one 
province. Otherwise they are destroying our great country, the 
country our children and grandchildren are looking forward to.

	<B>Mr. Mark Assad (Gatineau-La Lièvre, Lib.):</B> moves:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should consider the 
advisability of reviewing and reforming funding for political parties.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Madam Speaker, the present system of financial 
contributions to political parties contains deficiencies that must be 
dealt with. All too often, we hear people say that large companies 
run the country and that they are the ones who can benefit the most 
from  their financial support for political parties. We hear that 
constantly.
<P>
	As we know, such a perception is very harmful to democracy and 
this is why I believe it is necessary to look into certain changes that 
need to be made.
<P>
	According to data obtained for the four last years including the 
election campaign of 1993, the existing system costs the state some 
30 millions dollars annually. Of course, I have all this information 
at hand.
<P>
	Since taxpayers have to pay for the system in one way or another, 
we propose the following solution: the state should contribute one 
dollar for every individual. In this way, democracy would be better 
served.
<P>
	This solution has many advantages. I will give you a few 
examples. Such a system would be the most democratic form of 
funding for political parties. Of course, every one would be equal. 
Members of Parliament would no longer have to collect funds for 
general elections. As we all know, this requires a lot of time and 
effort, and political parties themselves have to spend money to 
organize public fundraising.
<P>
	The cost to the state would actually be lower, because the figures 
I quoted were very conservative. I have indeed demonstrated that 
the government would pay less in such a system.
<P>
	This will put to rest the public perception that this is a slush 
fund, because it is not good for the public to believe such a thing. 
Politicians or parliamentarians would not owe anyone anything.
<P>
	Time has come to review the system to ensure the proper 
functioning of democracy, so that we can, once and for all, be free 
to do our job without having our hands tied.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The democratic principle demands that every citizen be accorded 
complete equality by the process which selects the people's 
representatives. Canada's present electoral system violates this 
principle in a fundamental way, for it is privately financed.
<P>
	When private interests are involved in party financing the 
political process deteriorates into a mere approximation of 
democracy. The participation of corporations, unions and private 
individuals in the political process obviously is inevitable and 
indispensable in many ways but should in no way include the 
financing of political parties.
<P>
	In my view the repair of this structural failure is of paramount 
importance. Any country which claims serious adherence to 
democratic ideals should publicly finance its political parties by a 
mechanism which directly relates their financial support to their 
political support.
<P>
	After looking at this present system and then at individual 
financing options I present an inexpensive and  flexible public 
financing mechanism. Here are at least three objectives. The 
present financing of political parties makes a mockery of the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17299"> 17299 </A></B>
<P>
cornerstone of our democracy that every citizen should be accorded 
complete equality by the process which selects the people's 
representatives. It allows private organizations which have no right 
to vote at all to indirectly cast hundreds of ballots by financial 
support to a particular political party.
<P>
	It restricts flexibility on policy issues since political parties must 
give greater consideration to the largest supporters. This is 
incompatible with the concept of a truly representative democracy. 
Political parties should be solely responsible to their members and 
obviously to the public.
<P>
	Shareholders of corporations and members of unions do not 
necessarily support donations made on their behalf. Party financing 
by private organizations is a clear distortion of the democratic 
process. However, in a free and democratic society private 
individuals should have the right to contribute their own personal 
funds to the party of their choice.
<P>
	That sounds logical. Nevertheless there are at least three 
fundamental objections to this option. It would require political 
parties to spend a greatly increased and inordinate amount of their 
time in fundraising. This is an inappropriate role for the people's 
representatives and also is inefficient.
<P>
	The proper function of a political party is to structure policy, not 
fundraising. It does not address the primary inequity. Any privately 
financed democracy, whether financed by private organizations or 
by private individuals, will have its fundamentally democratic 
factor distorted. This situation is abnormal and unacceptable in our 
system. It simply cannot be protected from abuse.
<P>
	In the United States it is common practice for every member of a 
corporation's top management to simultaneously contribute to a 
party or candidate the maximum donation allowed by an 
individual, thereby in effect making a corporate donation.
<P>
<B>(1735 )</B>
<P>
	The argument for individual financing is an incorrect 
generalization of the principle that in a free and democratic society 
each individual should have the right to support the party of his or 
her choice. This right is inalienable but should not extend to the use 
of personal wealth. The right to support the party of our choice 
includes the right to vote for the party of our choice and to work for 
the party of our choice. However, merely signing a cheque seems 
too easy and unfair to those who do not have any great amount of 
money to contribute.
<P>
	The mechanism is very simple. I will outline a simple, flexible 
and inexpensive democratic public financing mechanism that will 
certainly make the system much more fair and equitable.
<P>
	We would eliminate all private financing of political parties; 
establish a party financing fund by an annual allocation of $1 per 
voter from general revenues; distribute a portion of the fund among 
the registered political parties proportional to popular vote; 
distribute the other portion of the fund among the registered 
political parties in existence.
<P>
	The cost is negligible. One dollar per voter per year is a small 
amount for the support of a democratic election. Furthermore, the 
annual cost to the treasury would actually be less than what it is 
today, less than the $30 million that it costs. The method of the 
distribution is flexible and democratic.
<P>
	The distribution of the first part of the fund by proportional vote 
directly ties financial support to political support, ensuring that 
parties with greater political support receive greater financial 
support.
<P>
	The distribution of the second part of the fund equally provides a 
counterbalance that moderates the effect of large majorities, 
ensuring that parties with less support receive sufficient funds to 
effectively communicate the policies to the citizenry.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	To conclude, some obvious conclusions come to mind. Public 
funding is the only truly democratic way of financing political 
parties. At present, political party financing is a mix of personal tax 
credits, corporate tax deductions and contributions made by the 
government to each candidate who gets at least 15 per cent of the 
vote in an election.
<P>
	Public funding will force political parties to account for the use 
made of their funds. Political party funding will spare the political 
parties the need to raise funds, which is very time and energy 
consuming. This way, political parties can devote their time to 
developing policies. Finally, it will greatly improve the way the 
public perceives politicians, political parties and politics.
<P>
	This is basically what I had to say about the need to make 
changes in our political system with respect to funding of political 
parties. If any other member wishes to comment on this, I will 
welcome their comments, and if they have questions to put to me, I 
will gladly answer them.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise today to speak to the hon. member's motion. At the 
same time, I regret having to do so because if this hon. member of 
the government feels the need to table such a motion, it is because 
his own government has failed to honour its red book 
commitments, the commitments it made in the last election 
campaign.
<P>
	There is no cause for alarm, however. If the hon. member looks 
carefully at the government's record of the past two years, he will 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17300"> 17300 </A></B>
<P>
see that it has broken all its  commitments, whether they have to do 
with social programs, defence policy or the red book.
<P>
<B>(1740)</B>
<P>
	The fact that a Liberal backbencher has to remind his own 
government that it had promised to thoroughly review political 
party funding shows how lightly this government takes its election 
commitments.
<P>
	In the matter under consideration, the red book promises to 
restore voters' confidence, promote integrity in political 
institutions, and limit conflicts of interest and influence peddling 
through an in depth review of political party funding.
<P>
	This wish is reflected in the motion. Except that, in March 1994, 
I launched a debate that made it to third reading, a private 
member's motion saying that political parties ought to be funded 
by the public, that they should only be funded by people who have 
the right to vote, which would exclude institutions, corporations, 
unions, non-profit and for-profit associations.
<P>
	Although this would be a guarantee of democracy and openness, 
the vast majority of the hon. member's fellow Liberals voted 
against it, because their party is no different from the one it 
replaced. As they say in Quebec, they must look after their buddies 
after the election. They must return the favour to the big 
engineering and architectural firms, to the big banking institutions 
for funding them and helping them get elected.
<P>
	In this area as in many others, the government has refused to 
honour its commitments by enacting bills or amending existing 
legislation.
<P>
	The motion before us is nothing but wishful thinking. What is 
wishful thinking but decisions that have not been implemented in 
practice. The hon. member's motion is nothing but wishful 
thinking. He knows full well that his government is not interested 
in changing the system, because it is, to a very large extent, 
financed by multinationals and private interests, as was the 
Conservative government.
<P>
	His motion should have proposed a concrete measure, instead of 
saying ``the government should consider the advisability of 
reviewing and reforming funding for political parties''. It should 
have said: ``We will change this or that to the funding of political 
parties, for example by authorizing public financing, that is by 
allowing contributions only from those who have the right to vote. 
That would have been a concrete measure, instead of merely 
expressing an interest to reconsider the existing system. The 
member acts exactly like the Conservative government, when it 
tried to distance itself from its 1988 election commitment.
<P>
	At the time, Prime Minister Mulroney pledged, one week before 
the election, to implement public financing for political parties. I 
remember seeing a front page article in <I>La Presse</I>. But what did he 
do after that? He set  up a committee, the Lortie commission, which 
cost $20 million and produced a report with recommendations that 
were taken into consideration neither by the Conservative, nor by 
the Liberal governments.
<P>
	If you want the true solution to the problem of political party 
funding, look at how things are done in Quebec. But let us be 
honest and recognize that some steps were made in the last 20 
years, such as the granting of a tax credit. Twenty years ago, 95 per 
cent of the financing came from companies. The tax receipt now 
delivered to corporations and individuals resulted in a 40 per cent 
drop in contributions made by corporations. This is a first step. 
Some provinces also took action to limit interference in the 
government machinery associated with political contributions. All 
political parties talk about bringing in reforms, but no one takes 
concrete action. The Liberal party reminds us of those old parties.
<P>
<B>(1745)</B>
<P>
	Let us not forget also that putting the funding of political parties 
in order is in line with the Criminal Code. Section 121 of the 
Criminal Code clearly states that it is an offence to attempt to 
obtain a special privilege in return for a financial contribution. A 
good many departments must be nervous about certain 
contributions.
<P>
	Reforming political fundraising is not only in keeping with the 
Criminal Code, it also reflects the public's desire for openness and 
transparency. Voters now want the people they elect to Ottawa to 
know whom they are there to serve. They want their elected 
representatives there to serve the common good and not the 
interests of a privileged few. They want the individual who has 
contributed $20 to receive as much respect from elected members 
as the company that has contributed $50,000.
<P>
	They want, too, for funds to be collected according to clearly 
defined standards and used to serve all, not a privileged few. This is 
a way to perpetuate our democracy as it is faced with the threat of 
huge multinationals and heavy backers of political parties.
<P>
	By placing grossroots fundraising at the service of democracy 
and the political parties, we place the focus on the voter. We also 
oblige the parties to come closer to the voters and to be concerned 
with their needs, since they are the ones who will be providing our 
funds.
<P>
	More value will be assigned to membership in a political party. It 
also develops a feeling of pride in belonging to a political party 
they help to support. It also increases the democratic vigour of a 
society and obliges the party to decentralize its decision-making. 
As we come closer to achieving grassroots financing, democracy as 
it is experienced in Quebec and Canada becomes a great and noble 
undertaking that starts reflecting the true meaning of democracy 
and openness.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17301"> 17301 </A></B>
<P>
	In concluding, I think the following puts it in a nutshell: tell 
me by whom you are financed and I will tell you whom you serve. 
That is more or less what we can learn from this discussion on 
the motion before the House today.
<P>
	I also wish to pay tribute to the hon. member who within his own 
party had the courage to realize the extent to which his party and 
the traditional party system are at the beck and call of certain 
corporations and privileged contributors instead of being there to 
serve all citizens.
<P>
	His suggestion that $1 be contributed per voter to the existing 
parties, a proposal inspired by a professor from New Brunswick, is 
admirable but would prevent the creation of new political parties. 
For instance, could the Reform Party or the Bloc Quebecois, two 
parties who came out of the last election, have been born without 
this contribution?
<P>
	My point is that government financing might, by helping to 
maintain existing parties, prevent other ideas, structures and 
political groups from developing. So there is considerable 
hesitation and there are in fact many question marks about the 
suggestion.
<P>
	However, I hope that by discussing these issues, we can perhaps 
make the Liberal Party understand that even within its own ranks 
some thorough changes are in order. And they will have to come in 
the form of grassroots financing of political parties.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
when I looked at Motion No. 367 I could certainly agree in a 
general sense with the thrust of the motion. It reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should consider the 
advisability of reviewing and reforming funding for political parties.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1750 )</B>
<P>
	The only problem I have with the wording is that it is a little bit 
vague. It says ``consider the advisability of''. It is a pity that the 
member had not worded his motion ``that in the opinion of this 
House the government should review and reform funding for 
political parties''. That would have been a lot clearer and a bit more 
forceful in its thrust.
<P>
	I see that the motion is non-votable and it reminds me that this 
one hour of debate is fairly meaningless. I wish for the hon. 
member's sake that it could be a votable motion so that at least 
members could express their opinions on this issue.
<P>
	What I would like to do before I continue with my speech, 
Madam Speaker, is to ask for the unanimous consent of the House 
to make this motion votable.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Is there unanimous 
consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (North Vancouver):</B> Madam Speaker, this is 
absolutely amazing. The member's own colleagues are denying 
him the right to have a votable motion. The member spent some 
time talking about the importance of democracy in political parties 
and he cannot even get the consent of his colleagues to allow a vote 
on that motion in the House. It is certainly a symptom of the way 
the government runs its affairs.
<P>
	In a general sense I agree with the motion. I would like to read 
the Reform Party policy on funding of political parties. In the blue 
book policy which was developed and passed by our members it 
says: ``The Reform Party opposes any assistance to political parties 
and political lobbies from public funds, including any refund of 
candidate or party expenses, government advertising during the 
electoral period, the renting of parliamentary staff for 
reimbursement, tax credits for contributions to federal political 
parties and the transfer of tax credits to leadership campaigns, to 
nomination campaigns or to parties at the provincial or municipal 
level''.
<P>
	It can be seen that we have a rather comprehensive policy. It 
stems from the way that we had to build our party.
<P>
	I heard the hon. member from the Bloc talking about the 
difficulty of building a new party. We had to build our party from 
the ground up, from nothing, with not a single cent. I was there 
almost from the beginning, from late 1987. In fact, one of the 
people who is now on my executive committee in the riding 
association was one of the original signatories to the charter of the 
Reform Party.
<P>
	We had to raise money by having bake sales, by having garage 
sales, by walking door to door asking for $10 here and $1 there. It 
was worth it. It is tremendously fulfilling to be able to build a party 
that way. If something is not worth working for, it is not worth 
having.
<P>
	In that respect I disagree with the member's position that the 
state should fund parties because it is unfair to people who cannot 
afford to contribute. If it is not worth working for, it is not worth 
having.
<P>
	Even though the Reform Party and even the Bloc started from 
way behind with tremendous disadvantages, it is tremendously 
fulfilling to be able to build a party from the ground up.
<P>
	The hon. member stated that the present system is unfair to 
people who cannot afford to contribute. No, it is not. People who 
cannot afford to contribute can work as volunteers and help. 
Perhaps they can even be fund raisers. I do not think the present 
system is unfair at all.
<P>
	Although the hon. member for Gatineau has a formula which he 
claims would be democratic and fair, when I look at his formula I 
see that there is a component that  would give an equal amount of 
money to each party but then there is a component that gives some 
money based on the share of the vote in the previous election. 
Obviously that is an unfair advantage to the party that is in power. 
That is not reflected in a democratic way of the support levels at the 
<P>

<B><A NAME="17302"> 17302 </A></B>
<P>
time of the next election. That is a major flaw in the approach that 
has been proposed by the member from Gatineau. All that does is 
give the government side an advantage so it can spin its propaganda 
and cover up its lack of interest in the political will of the people 
between elections.
<P>
<B>(1755)</B>
<P>
	The government very clearly demonstrates it has no interest in 
the people's opinions between elections. I do not think it is going to 
take this member's motion seriously because it is simply not 
interested in getting the public involved.
<P>
	It was obvious when members opposite refused to make this 
motion votable that they were not interested in democracy at all. If 
they were interested in democracy, they would take notice of 
people and their opinions on the Young Offenders Act. They have 
done nothing to make it more effective.
<P>
	If you ask people anywhere in the country if their streets are 
safer than they were two years ago when the government was 
elected, they say no. All the polls indicate that people sense that 
things are much more dangerous than they were then.
<P>
	On Indian land claims, the government does not give a darn what 
B.C. MPs have stated about what is happening in B.C. They simply 
do not care what the people of B.C. think. We could talk about the 
employment equity bill and the way that was forced through the 
House and the lack of democracy in the way the government works.
<P>
	Frankly, I often tell my constituents that if members came here 
just once a year for 15 minutes, put all the bills for the year on the 
table and took one vote, the outcome would be exactly the same. 
This is a place of parties, rather than-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Could I ask the hon. 
member about the relevance of his comments to the private 
member's bill?
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (North Vancouver):</B> Madam Speaker, what I am 
trying to relate it to is the fact that the member opposite wants to 
institute some sort of democratic support of parties. I am trying to 
point out that the government side is not interested in anything 
democratic. Its members will not vote for the motion. They will not 
allow it to be voted on because they are not interested in 
democracy. They want to pursue their political agenda, their party 
agenda.
<P>
	If Madam Speaker would feel more comfortable with me getting 
more closely aligned to the motion, I am certainly prepared to do 
so.
<P>
	I support the idea that the government should review and reform 
the funding for political parties, but not along the lines suggested 
by the member. I would rather see the House get involved in the 
Reform Party proposal, which is to make the support of political 
parties depend entirely on the money they can raise from the people 
they purport to represent.
<P>
	After all, political parties are nothing more than special interest 
groups. At the moment, political parties are special interest groups 
that have a special advantage because the donations they receive 
are tax deductible with a premium. They are much better than the 
tax deductibility for any other type of charity or special interest.
<P>
	The politicians of the past have chosen to give themselves an 
advantage over everybody else who has to raise money from the 
public. Members of the Reform Party feel that the political parties 
should have to raise their money from the people they purport to 
represent and that the money should not be tax deductible. It should 
be truly money that is given in support of that party.
<P>
	As I said earlier, if it is not worth working for something, it is not 
worth having. It is certainly worth working to build a political 
party.
<P>
	Reform also disagrees with the idea that these election rebates go 
back to candidates and parties. All it does is perpetuate the public 
paying for special interest groups that they may not have any 
interest in supporting whatsoever. Clearly this is anti-democratic, 
not democratic, as the member would like us to believe.
<P>
	In summing up, I would like to repeat one more time the Reform 
Party's position on this type of motion. I will read that policy one 
more time.
<P>
	The Reform Party opposes any assistance to political parties and 
political lobbies from public funds, including any refund of 
candidate or party expenses, government advertising during the 
electoral period, the renting of parliamentary staff for 
reimbursement, tax credits for contributions to federal political 
parties and the transfer of tax credits to leadership campaigns, to 
nomination campaigns or to parties at the provincial or municipal 
levels.
<P>
<B>(1800 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
congratulate the hon. member for Gatineau-La Lièvre for 
bringing this motion before the House for debate. It is a useful 
topic for debate and I am glad we have this opportunity for 
discussion.
<P>
	However, listening to the hon. member for North Vancouver, it 
was one of the most extraordinary things I have heard in a while. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17303"> 17303 </A></B>
<P>
He came out with this policy of the  Reform Party which is another 
case of do as I say but not as I do policies Reform spouts so often in 
the House.
<P>
	We all know that during the last election the members of the 
Reform Party scooped their hands into the public till. Although 
they abhor the idea of public financing of elections, they all applied 
for the rebate they were entitled to get from the federal 
government. Then their party applied for its 22.5 per cent 
reimbursement which it is entitled to get from the federal treasury. 
The members had no reluctance about going after that money to the 
best of my recollection.
<P>
	Now they say their policy is they will not take that kind of 
money. Yet according to the rumours I hear they have fundraisers 
from time to time. They issue tax receipts for those fundraisers the 
way other parties do even though they say their policy is they do 
not do that.
<P>
	They say that is their policy but they do exactly the opposite. 
They do as much as any other party does to take advantage of the 
laws of Canada that give political parties advantage. Frankly, they 
ought to do that but not if they are saying their policy is different. It 
is what I would call hypocrisy, but I think it unparliamentary for 
me to say that a member of the House is hypocritical or a hypocrite. 
I would not do that. However, the Reform Party policy is very 
hypocritical on this matter.
<P>
	Those members use the money in the most unorthodox ways like 
paying suit allowances of $30,000 a year to their leader so he can 
be properly dressed while he gives up the publicly paid car.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (North Vancouver):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order. I would like to know what this has to do with the motion 
before the House.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I am sure the hon. 
parliamentary secretary is getting to the point. We will not have to 
wait much longer.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Mr. Speaker, indeed we will not because I am 
talking about electoral financing, which is what the motion 
concerns. The hon. member may have missed the point since he got 
on about young offenders and so on. I am trying to address my 
remarks to the subject matter of the motion which is, after all, 
electoral financing, but that may have escaped him. His remarks 
seemed to be all over the place.
<P>
	The other thing he should know is his colleague and our very 
good friend, the hon. member for Edmonton Southwest, introduced 
a bill dealing with electoral financing which is currently being 
studied by the procedure and House affairs committee which I have 
the honour to chair. I know the bill is going to come up next 
Tuesday. It is going back on the agenda for consideration in the 
committee.
<P>
	Does this bill abolish public financing of parties? No, it does not. 
It eliminates funding for parties that get less than a certain 
percentage of the vote but it will continue  it for everybody else. I 
believe there has been some agreement reached between the hon. 
member and members of the other parties which improves the 
situation somewhat. However, I do not know what the final result is 
and I would not presume to discuss the final details of the bill not 
knowing them.
<P>
	I think the hon. member for North Vancouver ought to be aware 
that the policy of his party which he spouted with such apparent 
sincerity is being ignored quite blissfully by the hon. member for 
Edmonton Southwest in the bill he has presented to Parliament and 
which now he is pressing my committee to report back to the House 
on so he can pass it.
<P>
	I hope the hon. member for North Vancouver is here in the House 
to support his colleague's bill when it comes to a vote. It is a 
votable item and he will have that privilege. I am looking forward 
to seeing what he says because here he reads the policy on the one 
hand and he will get a chance to vote for the policy by voting 
against his friend's bill. We will see what happens then.
<P>
	The Liberals on my committee are supporting the bill as are the 
members of the Bloc Quebecois. They have good sense. The hon. 
member for North Vancouver would do well to learn from his 
colleague, the member for Edmonton Southwest, and scrap the 
ridiculous policy he says his party members have voted in. I find it 
quite extraordinary. Let me turn to the motion before the House.
<P>
<B>(1805 )</B>
<P>
	The Canada Elections Act provides for the reimbursement of a 
portion of election expenses incurred by registered political parties. 
Specifically, a registered party is entitled to a reimbursement of 
22.5 per cent of the expenses declared in its return provided it 
spends at least 10 per cent of the election limit.
<P>
	Some of us have criticized this because we feel it encourages 
parties to spend money in order to collect the reimbursement. If 
they do not spend up to 10 per cent of the expenditure limit they do 
not get any reimbursement. Therefore they must spend like crazy to 
get there. It can be a fairly substantial limit, as hon. members know. 
They then get back 22.5 per cent of their expenses so that once they 
hit the limit it is basically a 75 cent dollar they have put out.
<P>
	There is no limit on the amount that can be contributed to a 
registered political party but there is a limit on the amount that can 
be spent.
<P>
	The Royal Commission on Electoral Reform and Party 
Financing recommended that registered parties receive at least 1 
per cent of the votes cast in an election before they are entitled to 
any reimbursement and then receive 60 cents per vote received for 
a maximum of 50 per cent of election expenses. They could not get 
more than 50 per cent of their expenses back under this system.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17304"> 17304 </A></B>
<P>
	In the last Parliament we had a special committee on electoral 
reform which considered the matter but did not agree with the 
Lortie recommendation. I was a member of that committee. I 
believe I am the only one left in the House. The others have moved 
on to other things.
<P>
	We reviewed the report and recommended that the 10 per cent 
expenditure requirement be applied to a party's direct election 
expenses and that the rate of reimbursement be increased to 25 per 
cent of direct expenses, a very modest change from the present law.
<P>
	I do not mind saying the reason we could not agree on anything 
else was that we ran into a stone wall with the Conservative 
majority, which saw that its electoral chances were failing. Those 
members realized that if they went to a 60 cent per vote 
arrangement, as recommended by the Lortie commission, they 
would get very little money if their vote fell out the bottom, as the 
polls at that time indicated they would. That is exactly what 
happened. Had we had that rule in place the Conservative Party 
would have been worse than bankrupt. It is in trouble now but it 
would have been much worse; the rule significantly helped it in the 
last election.
<P>
	The hon. member for Edmonton Southwest has proposed a bill 
that would eliminate reimbursement for parties that gain less than 2 
per cent of the national vote. He is going to change that because he 
has received agreement from the other parties to make changes. I 
do not know what the changes are so I do not want to go on about 
his bill.
<P>
	Now we have a proposal from the hon. member for 
Gatineau-La Lièvre. I am sure the hon. member for Edmonton 
Southwest, being a generous spirited individual, has looked at other 
possibilities. I know he has because he has had suggestions made to 
him in the course of the committee proceedings where he had the 
advantage of hearing from other members. He said that all makes 
sense, let us make some more changes. He is making more changes 
and I commend him for that. I am looking forward to seeing the bill 
in its possibly final form when it rolls out of the committee 
possibly next week. If that happens we will all have the benefit of 
that and perhaps it will make the motion of the hon. member for 
Gatineau-La Lièvre unnecessary.
<P>
	However, we are dealing with his motion today. It is not a 
votable motion despite the efforts of the hon. member for North 
Vancouver and so we will have to deal with it as it stands. We will 
have a discussion about it and then go on to something else.
<P>
	The hon. members opposite, although genuine in their desire for 
reform, do not agree on how they should go about it. They are 
making efforts to raise the level of debate by discussing these 
things and I respect that, particularly by the hon. member for 
Edmonton Southwest. It looks to me as though he has a speech  
coming up and I am looking forward to hearing his remarks.
<P>
	The point is how to solve this problem. I do not know the answer 
but I do think the Lortie commission report is worth looking at 
again. The point of it was to ensure parties get reimbursed based on 
the number of votes they receive. Another possibility is to have a 
pot such as that suggested by the hon. member for Gatineau-La 
Lièvre and have a fixed amount of money available in accordance 
with the limits on election spending and then divide the fixed 
amount among the parties that participate in the election based on 
the number of votes they receive.
<P>
	I believe there is general agreement that no party should get 
more than 50 per cent of its expenses reimbursed so that it would 
prevent some party that won more than half of the vote from 
getting more than half the money available. That strikes me as fair 
and reasonable.
<P>
	However, I do not think that is what has been put forward today 
and we need to look at that kind of proposal in greater detail. We 
need to look at it with respect to the charter of rights and freedoms 
because, as we know, there have been challenges to the expenditure 
limits on parties and on others, third parties in particular not 
participating in elections.
<P>
	All those issues will concern the procedure and House affairs 
committee as it undertakes the review of the Canada Elections Act, 
which I hope it will be doing soon. No doubt at that time it will 
consider the very worthwhile proposal put forward by my 
colleague, the hon. member for Gatineau-La Lièvre.
<P>
<B>(1810)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would, first off, like to pay tribute to the member for Gatineau-La 
Lièvre for tabling this motion. Although very timid for a party like 
the Bloc Quebecois, the motion is revolutionary for the Liberal 
Party of Canada.
<P>
	For the benefit of those watching us, I will take the liberty of 
rereading the motion:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should consider the 
advisability of reviewing and reforming funding for political parties.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It is very little. In fact, it is almost lip service. However, when I 
looked in the May 6, 1994, issue of <I>Hansard</I>, I found words, in the 
context of a similar debate, that were quite surprising coming from 
a federal Liberal. I will quote some of them.
<P>
	He said: ``I maintain, and I am not the only one, that the way 
political parties are funded leaves much to be desired''. A certain 
former prime minister currently under investigation is suing the 
Government of Canada. If we had a good policy on funding 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17305"> 17305 </A></B>
<P>
political parties in  this country, I am sure this sort of situation 
would not arise.
<P>
	For over two years now, Mr. Speaker, I have been sitting in your 
company in this place. The people in my riding claim my salary is 
high. But, for me to become a millionaire in politics, someone will 
have to augment my monthly income.
<P>
	And yet, I know people who have done nothing but politics and 
who are said to be millionaires tens of times over. They probably 
know how to manage their pay better than I do.
<P>
	I would, however, like to quote in passing a few extracts from the 
speech by my colleague for Gatineau-La Lièvre. I remind you 
that he went to the right school, my colleague for Gatineau-La 
Lièvre, because he sat in Quebec's National Assembly. He said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>No companies, no legal, architectural or engineering firms. We all know the 
gamut of contributors to party funds. There is no need to elaborate. I do not 
think that large contributions are made out of love for democracy. We must 
absolutely look at this issue. I say this as the member for Gatineau-La Lièvre.</BLOCKQUOTE>
The text I have just quoted is on page 4019 of the <I>House of 
Commons Debates</I> for May 6, 1994.
<P>
	Clearly the member for Gatineau-La Lièvre knows what he is 
talking about, because I took the liberty of checking with the office 
of the returning officer to see how the member for Gatineau-La 
Lièvre financed his electoral campaign in 1993. These figures are 
official, and anyone can go and check them with Elections Canada. 
In this member's case, individual contributions totalled $15,168, 
which represents 55 per cent of his financing, and corporate 
contributions amounted to $12,311, or 44 per cent.
<P>
<B>(1815)</B>
<P>
	I also took the liberty of checking in the riding of Saint-Maurice, 
the Prime Minister's riding. Individual contributions accounted for 
only 25 per cent, whereas corporate contributions accounted for 33 
per cent. One union contributed $5,500, and, obviously, funds were 
transferred to him from his party, given that he was in their good 
graces.
<P>
	Obviously, when we know who is funding the party in power, we 
can think about their intentions. On October 3, 1994, the Quebec 
City paper <I>Le Soleil</I> ran a headline to the effect that the Liberal and 
Conservative parties could thank major corporations for funding 
the political parties. I will give you a few examples. Listen 
carefully, Mr. Speaker, I think this is worthwhile.
<P>
	The largest contribution was to the Conservative Party in the 
amount of $216,000. It was made by a company recorded only as 
T'ANG Management Limited. Give me one good reason why this 
company gave $216,000 to the Conservative Party, led by Ms. 
Campbell. Give me one single reason. The member for 
Gatineau-La Lièvre said  in May 1994 that it certainly was not out 
of love for democracy.
<P>
	If it is not out of love for democracy, does it fly in the face of this 
democracy? In the red book, the party opposite me made the 
commitment to change the way political parties were funded. Brian 
Mulroney decided to do the same thing a week before the 1988 
elections. He did nothing.
<P>
	In the Conservative Party, there was a member as courageous as 
the member for Gatineau-La Lièvre, François Gérin, the former 
member for Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead. Not only did he 
advocate that political parties should be funded exclusively by 
voters, he applied this principle, rejecting any contribution from 
law, engineering or architectural firms, businesses, large or small, 
or unions. Unfortunately the member for Gatineau-La Lièvre did 
not do the same in 1993 since he accepted quite generous 
contributions from corporations of his riding and elsewhere.
<P>
	This morning, the Royal Bank of Canada announced net profits 
of $1.3 billion. Why do banks make that much money? Because 
they have connections in government. By feeding Grits and Tories 
alike, they are not taking any chance. They are sure to be on the 
right side and to have favourable laws. For instance, the Royal 
Bank of Canada gave $88,700 to the Liberal Party and $85,300 to 
the Conservatives in 1993. Banks are not taking any chance.
<P>
	Do you think that this party is serious about modernizing 
political funding? What was this same party doing just six weeks 
ago in Quebec? It flouted Quebec democracy by throwing money 
left and right three days before the referendum to arrange a big 
love-in. This nearly reached the no side's spending limit. 
Unfortunately it will not be accounted for. All they will get is a 
$10,000 fine.
<P>
<B>(1820)</B>
<P>
	They paid the salary of civil servants and teachers for that day. 
They closed schools and offices to allow civil servants in Hull and 
Ottawa to go to Montreal so they could show their affection, which 
lasted for an hour or so. Democracy was not respected in Quebec 
on that day. Some no side posters were even put up illegally.
<P>
	The Reform Party is not without guilt either. It will be 
remembered that, in 1993, they accepted $25,000 from the 
Canadian Pacific and $10,000 from John Labatt. Naturally the 
sums were more modest but the corporations knew that the Reform 
Party had no chance whatsoever of coming to power. The Liberals 
had a heyday and they welcomed the opportunity. I hope the Prime 
Minister will not be prosecuted or come under investigation 4, 5, 6

<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in respecting the tradition of the House, I will make my 
comments very brief to give the member an opportunity to wind up, 
if that is the pleasure of the House.
<P>
	I want to say a few words to this particular bill. As the House 
knows and as has been made very clear by the member for 
Kingston and the Islands, I have a bill before committee that speaks 
also to election financing. I commend my hon. colleague opposite 
for bringing this question to the House.
<P>
	I am not speaking in favour of this bill. It does not provide the 
respect to emerging parties that it should. That has already been 
covered by others. It does not pay respect to new ideas and to 
parties that may never in fact elect anybody but do bring new and 
fresh ideas into the body politic of Canada. That is extremely 
important to our political discourse as a nation. And this bill does 
not respect performance. In my view, it is absolutely essential that 
performance be respected and rewarded. No matter what their 
historical significance, parties that do not resonate with the people 
should not be rewarded.
<P>
	The hon. member for Kingston and the Islands went to great 
lengths to point out the contradiction in my presenting a bill to the 
House that would affect election financing that does not speak 
directly to the party policy. I want to make it clear, so that everyone 
understands, that my bill is incremental. The notion and the reason 
behind my bill is that it will save the taxpayers of Canada $1 
million or so. In my books, saving $1 million or so is particularly 
important. In particular, the measures in that bill would ensure that 
political parties are rewarded only if they have resonance within 
the body politic of Canada, that political parties are not rewarded 
merely because they have the resources to spend money.
<P>
	I have listened to the debate this afternoon. I think this debate is 
particularly important. When I started to investigate election 
financing I noticed that if you measured the number of books they 
would be approximately eight or nine inches high. These are all 
books about election financing in Canada.
<P>
	The point the hon. member from the Bloc raised about making 
sure the political process in Canada is kept as free as is humanly 
possible from any taint of scandal or influence peddling is one of 
the reasons I have come around to the view that there is much we 
can learn from the way the province of Quebec handles financial 
donations in that province.
<P>
	I thank the House very much for the opportunity to speak. Once 
again I congratulate my hon. colleague opposite for bringing this 
very important debate to the House.
<P>
<B>(1825 )</B>
<P>
	I concur with my hon. friend from North Vancouver who 
lamented that this was not a votable bill so we could see where all 
the dogs lie on this particular issue.

	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I understand that the hon. 
member for Gatineau-La lièvre has already spoken to the motion.

	<B>Mr. Assad:</B> How much time do we have left, Mr. Speaker?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> There are still a few minutes 
left. Under the right of reply, I am ready to give the floor to the hon. 
member for Gatineau-La Lièvre. However, I give notice to the 
House that he will be the last one to speak to the motion.
<P>
	Is that agreed?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Assad:</B> How much time do I have, Mr. Speaker?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Usually, under such 
circumstances, the House agrees to allow about two minutes for the 
member to close the debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mark Assad (Gatineau-La Lièvre, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
clearly, I will not have enough time to refute some of the objections 
raised during the debate on this motion.
<P>
	According to my research, I could prove that there are much 
fewer flaws in this proposal than in the present system. This, I 
hope, will be the subject of another debate, at some other time.
<P>
	I would have liked my colleagues in the House to realize that this 
is not a ``revolutionary'' idea, contrary to what one of my 
colleagues from the Bloc quebecois said. I believe it to be plain 
common sense.
<P>
	It is indeed an idea I have been promoting for many years, 
including in the National Assembly, when I had the honour of 
serving my fellow citizens at the provincial level. I raised the issue 
of funding for political parties in 1974. This is not something I 
became interested in last week.
<P>
	I have seen the trend and the many scandals surrounding funding 
for political parties.
<P>
	The idea I am presenting today is very simple. I am asking for a 
debate, not only among members of this House, who can settle the 
issue, but also in the public at large.
<P>
	You know, I did just that. I asked several people: ``Do you 
believe that the current way of funding political parties is 
democratic and fair or that there is favouritism or that there are 
slush funds?'' Most people would say: ``Do you think I am a 
nitwit? We do not believe that the system is fair and equitable. Far 
from it.''
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="17307"> 17307 </A></B>
<P>
	If you ask ten people, at least nine will tell you that the system 
is rotten to the core. So, the time has come to examine the way 
political parties are funded. It is not necessary to adopt the exact 
system that I am proposing. A University of New Brunswick 
professor who did his doctorate on the subject studied this. I 
consulted him and exchanged information with him. His studies 
demonstrated that the most democratic way is to let the public at 
large fund political parties.
<P>
	That is not complicated; perhaps it is even too simple. This is too 
often what happens when something is too simple: it is difficult to 
get it accepted.
<P>
	In concluding, this is a beginning. We must hope that other 
groups that are interested in our society will realize that the funding 
of political parties is fundamental in a democracy, and we cannot 
allow big multinationals or people with a lot of money to be the 
most important backers of political parties. This is paramount in 
our democracy.
<P>
<B>(1830)</B>
<P>
	Let us hope then that this is a beginning, because the data that I 
have can easily demonstrate that this would be the most equitable 
system, one which would not cost more to the state, not a cent more 
than it is costing today.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion and of the 
amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Guelph-Wellington, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to speak in support of this motion on behalf 
of the people of Guelph-Wellington.
<P>
	Canada has always been a nation of ordeals and of triumphs. 
This country was tied together with the railroad when some said it 
could not be done. It answered the call of peace and freedom in 
both world wars when some said that our country was too small to 
make a difference.
<P>
	We have held together a nation of difficult climate with 
unbelievable vastness and extreme beauty. I am confident that we 
can turn the ordeal of the 1995 referendum into another triumph for 
our country.
<P>
	This motion reminds us that it is the responsibility of the people 
elected to this national assembly to do what is right for Canada. 
The people of Guelph-Wellington  know that this sometimes 
means that we recognize the obvious.
<P>
	On October 27, 1995 residents of Guelph-Wellington joined 
the Canadian family in Montreal in a crusade for Canada. This 
crusade did not end when the buses returned. It did not end on 
referendum day when my constituents completed their prayers at 
Dublin Street United Church in Guelph. It did not end when the 
signatures dried on the petitions of love and affection signed by the 
students of the Wellington County Separate School Board. This 
crusade has not ended in the hearts of the people of 
Guelph-Wellington and all across Canada.
<P>
	Their crusade is about promises to be kept, relationships to be 
strengthened and a nation that continues to be built. We owe it to 
the people who boarded buses at 3 a.m. on October 27. We owe it to 
the people who voted no on October 30 and we owe it to every 
Canadian who loves this country and feels an attachment to its 
support and support this motion.
<P>
	The people of Guelph-Wellington are discouraged by members 
of political parties that believe they were elected to celebrate 
division and welcome the negative. They know that the Bloc 
Quebecois and the Reform Party were not at the rally on October 
27. They are aware that while one party works toward separation, 
the other is anxious to demand that the terms of the break-up of this 
country be staked out, almost like vultures.
<P>
	Never before has the difference between the government and the 
opposition parties been clearer. The Liberal government reminds 
Canadians that there is a lot to be thankful for. The Bloc and 
Reform Party find much to complain about every day. We are the 
crusaders. They are the destroyers.
<P>
	We seek to unite but they seek to divide. The Prime Minister said 
in the House on November 29 that the spirit of co-operation and 
partnership that inspires us should motivate us to continue building 
this great country in an atmosphere of generosity and respect. What 
the Prime Minister is proposing is both reasonable and prudent. In 
voting in favour of this motion, we are representing the best 
interests of all Canadians in the context of all that is good for 
Canada.
<P>
	The people of Guelph-Wellington are proud of their past and 
they know that we can acknowledge Quebec's distinctiveness 
because they are confident of our future. They look to the members 
of the House to build bridges, not to create gulfs.
<P>
	We can give regional vetoes without destroying the fabric of our 
nation. We need not be afraid. The history of the community that I 
represent is a strong one because we have been successful when we 
all work together. There is no question the referendum was a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17308"> 17308 </A></B>
<P>
difficult experience for the people of Guelph-Wellington and for 
all people across Canada. In the process, our patience  has been 
strained, but our determination to make this country work has not 
weakened.
<P>
<B>(1835)</B>
<P>
	My constituents are telling me to rise above the leaders of 
division and speak directly to the people of Canada, the Canadian 
family that lives in Quebec, in British Columbia and every 
community across Canada. They believe that the options presented 
by the Prime Minister are better than those offered by the Bloc and 
by the Reform Party. We have a vision of unity and we have a 
vision of peace.
<P>
	We want the government to continue on its agenda of jobs and 
growth. They know that a united Canada means more employment, 
economic stability and a stronger country for their children and 
their grandchildren. Their message to me is to get on with it and 
keep the promises made to Quebecers before the referendum. 
Ignore those who want to destroy Canada. They want their 
affection for Quebec to be heard and they want Quebecers to know 
that we have all succeeded in Confederation, every one of us.
<P>
	The central question that must be answered is: How can we turn 
the ordeal of October 30 into a triumph for all Canadians? I do not 
believe this can be done by being closed, intolerant and narrow. We 
should always remember those who prayed, wrote, called, marched 
and rallied for our country during the days prior to the referendum. 
Triumph calls for inner strength. It calls us to put away our 
differences. It rises above fear and it rises above frustration.
<P>
	We are the only elected body that can speak for all Canadians. 
This country was not built because our leaders reminded us of what 
is wrong. Canada is the best country in the world. Our Prime 
Minister can rise with pride to tell us that he is a proud Canadian 
and a proud Quebecer.
<P>
	I am proud of my community of Guelph-Wellington. I have 
said here before that I believe it is the best community in Canada. 
In Guelph-Wellington, we are crusaders for this nation. We see 
the rally in Montreal as the beginning, not an end. We see this 
motion as another step in nation building. We are proud of our 
community and proud of our province, but we are first and 
foremost Canadians.
<P>
	It was a Quebecer, Sir Wilfrid Laurier, who said that the 20th 
century belongs to Canada. It was another Quebecer, our Prime 
Minister, who said on October 27 that with this motion and other 
actions by the government, this country will enter the 21st century 
strong and united.
<P>
	Guelph-Wellington residents want nothing more than a united 
and a strong Canada. They helped build our nation. They have love 
for family and community. They work hard and they want us to do 
what is right for Canada. They are Canadians first.
<P>
	This motion is about change, change not for the sake of change, 
but change for the betterment of Canada. The people of 
Guelph-Wellington are confident Canadians. They know we can 
recognize the obvious, we can give regional vetoes and we can be 
centralized government without losing our nation. They know that 
the negative political parties will vote against this motion, but they 
also know that Canada will not be defeated. Canada has had its 
share of ordeals, but we have always triumphed.
<P>
	As they left their buses in Montreal on October 27, the people 
from my riding were handed a message from Quebecers. I hope 
members of the Bloc are listening to this. This is the message that 
my people were handed on October 27 from Quebecers. It says: 
``Quebecers would like to thank you for your support, your love 
and your encouragement. We appreciate this unselfish act and we 
thank you from the bottom of our hearts. God bless this country and 
all its citizens. We thank you.''
<P>
	I have read and re-read this message many times. This motion is 
for the author of that message and for everyone who believes in 
Canada.
<P>
<B>(1840 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Hamilton West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is my 
privilege and honour to speak on behalf of the constituents of 
Hamilton West to this extremely important motion tabled by the 
right hon. Prime Minister.
<P>
	During and after the Quebec referendum the Prime Minister 
assured us that he would adequately address the clear demand for 
meaningful change within the federation. The Prime Minister is 
keeping his word to the people of Canada.
<P>
	Like many of my colleagues on this side of the House, I am 
joining this debate in the Canadian spirit of conciliation, 
compromise and goodwill. At a time when various groups 
throughout the world are killing one another as a result of 
neo-nationalism, how typically Canadian for the federal 
government to address hard core neo-nationalist angst within the 
relatively calm and cool context of parliamentary debate.
<P>
	The day before yesterday during debate on government Motion 
No. 27, we debated the recent Dayton peace agreement and 
Canadian support for the international community's continued 
efforts to bring enduring peace and security to the Balkans through 
participation in a multinational military implementation force 
under NATO command.
<P>
	The significance of these two motions should not be lost on the 
members of the House. How typically Canadian for us to be so 
devoted to the maintenance of peace and security throughout the 
war torn regions of the world as to help other nations reach a lasting 
peace with one another. With respect to the current debate, how 
typically Canadian for us to set an example for the entire  world by 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17309"> 17309 </A></B>
<P>
choosing conciliation instead of conflict, diplomacy instead of 
rebellion, peace instead of war.
<P>
	I am not aware of any other nation in the world with the same 
degree of potentially conflicting differences from east to west in 
terms of culture, language, geography, economics and political 
outlook as Canada, whose citizens despite these differences are not 
embroiled in a bloody civil war or otherwise killing one another for 
the sake of these differences.
<P>
	Canada by its very nature stands out as a beacon of hope in the 
world where the concept of peaceful co-existence is overshadowed 
by seemingly irreconcilable conflict between factions. It is 
therefore not only timely but also typically Canadian for the Prime 
Minister to extend an olive branch to the people of the province of 
Quebec in the wake of the October 30 referendum.
<P>
	The results of the recent Quebec referendum remind us that we 
cannot take Canada for granted, that diversity must be respected. 
Consequently, the government has acted swiftly to initiate a 
process that in the words of the right hon. Prime Minister ``will 
ensure the unity and evolution of Canada in order to respond to the 
aspirations of all Canadians''.
<P>
	I think that is worth restating. The government aspires to 
respond to the aspirations of all Canadians from sea to sea to sea. 
Some less diplomatic than I have suggested the members of Her 
Majesty's Loyal Opposition, the so-called dark prince of 
separatism, have been so consumed by their own thirst for power 
that they have lost sight of their primary responsibility to protect 
the economic, social and political security of the people of Quebec.
<P>
	Others more cynical than I believe the desire of the Leader of the 
Opposition to focus 20:20 hindsight on the constitutional failures 
of his former political bedfellows is an indication of his 
unwillingness to set aside his uncontrollable, self-serving political 
ambition and focus on the long term future of the people of 
Quebec. Personally I feel that the marathon speech delivered by the 
Leader of the Opposition has been somewhat misunderstood.
<P>
	Clearly we can all understand how easily one can become 
confused by the constantly changing political agenda of the former 
Conservative Party federalist turned separatist, now would-be 
premier of Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1845 )</B>
<P>
	I would like to cut through all of this confusion for a moment and 
focus on the unity motion. The unity motion is a solemn 
declaration that sets out how the Government of Canada will 
conduct its affairs with respect to Quebec in particular and Canada 
in general. Passage of this motion will indicate to all Canadians and 
all federal government authorities that it is the will of the House of 
Commons to recognize the distinct character  of Quebec society 
within the framework of the Canadian federation.
<P>
	I know what it is like to serve in the opposition. Unfortunately 
exaggerated and unwarranted attacks on forthright government 
initiatives are key elements of the often underwhelming opposition 
art form. If we rise above the separatist bantering of members 
opposite we see a government, in fact an entire nation of people 
united by their genuine concern for the long term future of the 
citizens of Quebec within the federation. How typically Canadian 
to labour to keep our country together.
<P>
	Let us not forget the tens of thousands of letters and phone calls 
and rally goers from Hamilton, Dundas, Ancaster, Flamboro, 
Burlington and from right across Canada who so passionately 
showed their support and concern for the people of Quebec before, 
during and most important, after the October 30 referendum. Let us 
not forget the evolution of federalism that has allowed Quebec and 
the other provinces to enjoy increased powers and gradual 
decentralization with respect to the unique character of each and 
every province within the framework of a strong and flexible 
federalist system.
<P>
	In the case of Quebec we recognize and respect its distinct 
character, its French speaking majority, its unique culture, its civil 
law tradition; the fact that Quebec is different, not superior. How 
typically Canadian that the federal government continues to 
recognize and respect the rights and concerns of minority groups 
within Quebec as well.
<P>
	On behalf of the constituents of Hamilton West I want to say how 
proud we are of the right hon. Prime Minister's efforts to keep our 
federation alive. I am proud that the federal government has chosen 
to address the very real concerns raised by the people of Quebec in 
a diplomatic and conciliatory fashion.
<P>
	If this is what it takes to ensure Canada's pre-eminent position in 
the world as a peace loving federation, if this is what we must do in 
order to remain the greatest country in the world in which to live, 
then in my support for this motion I am proud to be typically 
Canadian.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, today 
is important for me personally, as a Quebec nationalist and as a 
member of the Bloc Quebecois in this 35th Parliament, as I have an 
opportunity to participate in this debate on the recognition of 
Quebec as a distinct society, even if all that was tabled before this 
House was a motion.
<P>
	Before starting my remarks, I must say that it is rather late, in 
1995, almost 1996, to realize that Quebec is different from Ontario, 
from the west and from the maritimes.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17310"> 17310 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1850)</B>
<P>
	I remember, of course, the great statement of love tens of 
thousands of Canadians outside Quebec made on October 30. I 
clearly remember New Brunswick Premier Frank McKenna 
coming and telling us, on the one hand, that he loved us. On the 
other hand, he toured industries on the periphery of his province, 
saying: ``Come and do business with us; we love our Quebec 
friends''. He was trying to steal our industries away from us. Love, 
yes, but as long as it is profitable. The Canadian federation has 
been extremely profitable to Ontario in particular for several 
centuries now.
<P>
	By putting forward these proposals for change, including the one 
dealing with recognizing Quebec as a distinct society, the Prime 
Minister of Canada acts on the promise he made himself to trick the 
leader of the Bloc Quebecois before he leaves. The Prime Minister 
said: ``I dream of the day when I will rise in this House to vote for 
Quebec's recognition as a distinct society and smile as I watch the 
Leader of the Opposition vote against it''.
<P>
	This is the Prime Minister speaking, a member from Quebec, the 
hon. member for Saint-Maurice, who, unfortunately, does not 
travel to Quebec often enough and, as a result, is literally out of 
touch with the francophone public opinion in Quebec. Twenty days 
before the referendum, like Claude Garcia, he was telling 
everybody: ``We are going to crush the Quebecers and have a 65 
per cent victory''. Can you see how out of touch from his home 
province this man is?
<P>
	That was a petty thing to say, a much too petty strategy, but it is 
true to form for the Prime Minister and member for Saint-Maurice.
<P>
	This motion recognizing Quebec as a distinct society is not the 
result of a sensible reflection with the interest of the country or the 
betterment of the Canadian and Quebec society in mind, let alone a 
major change to save the country.
<P>
	No, the Prime Minister's reflection was not based on these noble 
intentions, but rather on the desire to get back at the Leader of the 
Opposition and to discredit him.
<P>
	Revenge and discredit are inappropriate guides at a time when 
the survival of two nations is at stake. But neither the people of 
Canada nor the people of Quebec are fooled by the Prime 
Minister's scheme or by the Deputy Prime Minister's crocodile 
tears.
<P>
	The people understand that this distinct society proposal that was 
cobbled together even before the committee made its 
recommendations and that has been revealed as phoney, this 
motion that recognizes Quebec's distinct society in such a 
superficial way is outdated and is no longer an issue in Quebec for 
both sovereignists and federalists who want serious changes.
<P>
	Again, this shows how the Prime Minister is totally out of touch 
with Quebec reality. His fanaticism prevents him from 
understanding the message sent to him on October 30 by the people 
of Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1855)</B>
<P>
	In this regard, even partisan federalist newspapers are criticizing 
the Prime Minister. In the November 29 edition of <I>La Presse</I>, for 
example, Alain Dubuc writes, and I quote: ``The Chrétien 
government's first timid effort mostly shows that it has great 
difficulty in understanding what is happening in Quebec and 
Canada and, above all, in accepting changes that we see as 
inevitable''.
<P>
	They all agree that recognizing Quebec as a distinct society only 
through a declaration in the House of Commons does not resolve 
the underlying problem. Even entrenching this later in the 
Constitution no longer satisfies the aspirations of Quebecers.
<P>
	The Liberal government has missed the boat and neither the 
Leader of the Opposition nor the members of the Bloc Quebecois 
will be embarrassed to vote against this motion. On the contrary, 
adopting this motion would be a major setback in Quebec's path to 
its recognition as a people.
<P>
	As Gérald Larose used to say, we do not want to be bothered with 
distinct society any more. What we want now is to be a normal, 
quiet people.
<P>
	Quebec is sick of these meaningless slogans, of being a society 
at the mercy of Ottawa's and English Canada's whims, of a Prime 
Minister who denies ever having said what he said, both before and 
after he says it.
<P>
	If the official opposition accepted this motion, Quebec would be 
seriously weakened since, as everyone acknowledges, Ottawa's 
distinct society proposal does not go as far as the Meech Lake 
accord and the Charlottetown accord, which both Quebec and the 
rest of Canada rejected.
<P>
	The Prime Minister's motion through which the House would 
recognize Quebec's distinctiveness cannot in any way be 
considered a response to the demand for change expressed by 
Quebecers in the October 30 referendum. We must keep in mind 
that, a little over a month ago, 50 per cent of Quebecers voted in 
favour of Quebec's sovereignty, while the other 50 per cent voted 
for a major renewal of Canadian federalism.
<P>
	The motion before us falls short of Quebecers' aspirations. It is 
unacceptable, for both sovereignists and federalists.
<P>
	Once again, the Prime Minister of Canada has made the wrong 
decision, as all Quebecers and Canadians know. That is why I think 
that the Prime Minister will not find it so funny on election day.
<P>
	In closing, one can laugh at a people some of the time, but not all 
of the time.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17311"> 17311 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean Landry (Lotbinière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Prime 
Minister's motion about distinct society takes me back to 1992, 
the year of the Charlottetown accord. It was also at that time that 
I decided to pursue my career standing up for Quebec's interests 
here in Ottawa, as eight other Bloc members were already doing, 
seated at the back of the House, isolated, but undeniably efficient.
<P>
	I usually examine offers made to me. I never dismiss anything 
out of hand, without giving it at least some thought.
<P>
<B>(1900)</B>
<P>
	Of course, Quebecers have the same attitude. Thus, after having 
heard and read the Prime Minister's motion, I can say that it is the 
nicest turnaround that I have seen since going into politics. The 
Prime Minister botched his work. The referendum results made 
him panic.
<P>
	During the week preceding the referendum, he felt that he had to 
promise some changes, and this is what we have now: an empty 
shell, a black hole, a total blank. Distinct society my foot. This 
carbon copy of the Charlottetown proposals, which Quebec and 
Canada rejected, as we recall, does not recognize the people of 
Quebec in any way. Where on earth does the Prime Minister live to 
think that Quebec is now prepared to accept less than Meech 1 and 
2, less than Charlottetown, if you can imagine?
<P>
	The motion says that we speak French in Quebec and that we 
have a civil law tradition. How nice. This resolution is nothing but 
wishful thinking. The 1982 patriation of the Constitution was a 
denial of the existence of the Quebec nation. Since then, there has 
been only one nation: the Canadian nation. Thankfully, no Quebec 
government, not even the Liberals, put up with that rebuff. Meech 1 
was entrenched in the Constitution. Some legal and political 
aspects in that accord allowed Quebec to keep its head high.
<P>
	The current Prime Minister, along with his friends, managed to 
render that agreement meaningless. Quebec rejected a proposal, as 
did English Canada, but not for the same reasons, of course. How 
can the leader of the government dare take a step backward and 
seriously think that his resolution meets Quebec's historical and 
legitimate aspirations?
<P>
	His ally in the no camp during the last referendum, the leader of 
the opposition in the National Assembly, Daniel Johnson, 
demanded that Quebec's distinct nature be entrenched in the 
Constitution. The Prime Minister knows full well that his motion is 
meaningless. He only introduced it to be able to say that he is 
fulfilling the promises for change he made at the last minute, when 
the yes side seemed dangerously close to winning.
<P>
	As we saw in 1992, with the referendum on the Charlottetown 
accord, it is no longer enough to say, affirm, or wish that Quebec be 
recognized as a distinct society. At the time, the distinct society 
clause only had a  symbolic value, so much so that most 
French-speaking observers in Quebec were convinced that this 
concept no longer had the same meaning as it did in the Meech 
Lake accord. It was so watered down that even Clyde Wells felt 
there was no risk that this clause could serve as a stepping stone 
towards the affirmation of a special status for Quebec. Yet, this is 
what the Prime Minister is proposing.
<P>
	As a member representing a Quebec riding, I cannot support a 
motion which proposes much less than even the minimal claims 
made by Quebec over the years. The Quebec members who support 
that resolution will show that, as far as they are concerned, there is 
no nation in Quebec. There are only people who speak French, in a 
given region of Canada, period.
<P>
	We all know that this resolution is just that: a mere resolution. 
With all due respect to this House, this resolution has no legal 
effect, even if it is supported by a majority of elected 
representatives. It merely reflects the will expressed by 
parliamentarians, and it would not be binding on any court in 
Canada. It is meaningless.
<P>
	In his attempt to propose changes to Quebecers, the Prime 
Minister also included manpower training, as well as a veto power. 
Let me briefly say that, as regards manpower training, I am still 
looking for the change. Actually, there is one change. We now 
know that, when the Prime Minister talks about decentralization, it 
means that the federal government keeps control over the 
distribution of money.
<P>
	The federal government prevents Quebec from implementing a 
true manpower training policy. Yet, everyone in Quebec agrees that 
all powers related to that sector should be delegated to the 
province.
<P>
<B>(1905)</B>
<P>
	It seldom happens that everybody agrees on one thing, in Quebec 
or elsewhere. As for the veto, let us not delude ourselves, what is 
being proposed amounts to allowing regional referendums with 
terms and questions developed in Ottawa, where Quebec 
representatives are in minority as you know. Flexible federalism 
means Ottawa making the decisions and the provinces living with 
them.
<P>
	Three weeks ago, I heard the Prime Minister say that he was a 
Prime Minister from a Quebec riding, a francophone and a 
Quebecer, and that his government should be trusted.
<P>
	For my part, I was willing to trust him a little. I said to myself: 
``Listen, mistakes have been made, he made mistakes in 1982. But 
sometimes, a guy who made a mistake can get back on his feet. I 
will therefore go half way and trust him''.
<P>
	In the motion he put forward, Motion No. 26, I thought I would 
find a recognition of Quebec as a distinct society, and that this 
recognition would also be enshrined in the Constitution. That was 
not the case. A  few moments ago, I heard a member opposite say 
that we wanted separation and this and that. I will tell you that my 
father is a well known businessman in Quebec and in Canada. He 
has traded in all ten provinces of Canada. When my father returned 
from the west, the first question I used to ask him was: ``Dad, how 
did it go out west?'' And he would answer: ``Jean, it has been very 
hard, very difficult. I have the feeling that the west will separate 
before Quebec does''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17312"> 17312 </A></B>
<P>
	When we look around in this House, we see that Quebec has 
rejected this proposal from the Prime Minister, Mr. Chrétien, who 
represents the constituents from Saint-Maurice, and that even the 
English Canadians who make up the third party, the Reform Party, 
said no to this proposal. There must be a problem when both French 
speaking and English speaking Canadians agree to reject a 
proposal.
<P>
	So, we have to recognize what Quebecers have been asking for 
for the last 25 years. It is not asking too much to want to be 
recognized as a distinct society. The federal government has done it 
for the Indians, why can it not do it for Quebecers? They gave the 
Indians some land. We are not asking for land, we already have 
some. We only want to be recognized.
<P>
	Frankly, I must say that, after fighting for 25 years, Quebecers, 
the French speaking citizens of Quebec, really thought this time 
would be it. However, the Prime Minister told us: ``Dear friends, 
wait until 1997, wait until April of 1997, when we will reopen the 
Constitution''. I have to tell you in all honesty that, as a politician, 
when I decided to come to Ottawa, I told myself: ``The only way to 
succeed is to be on the spot, to go to Ottawa and mingle with my 
English speaking friends''. Because I must say in all honesty that 
the people from western Canada are my friends.
<P>
	It is not because we have a different point of view that we cannot 
get along with people from western Canada or the maritimes. Of 
course not. What is important is to be on the same wavelength and 
to get support for a society, for people-the men and women of 
Quebec who want to be recognized some day.
<P>
	I trusted the Prime Minister. I am a bit disappointed, because I 
would have liked for the resolution to say that our distinct society 
will be enshrined in the Constitution. It was not asking too much, 
as I said earlier, but it was not done.
<P>
	This was his last chance. I remind the House that three days 
before the referendum thousands of English speaking Canadians 
came to Montreal. I was proud, because these people came to visit 
our region. To say they love us is one thing, but to prove it is 
another matter.
<P>
	So, as far as I am concerned, I would like all this to be enshrined 
in the Constitution and I will continue to reflect on this issue.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to have the opportunity to participate in what can only 
be regarded as a historic debate.
<P>
<B>(1910 )</B>
<P>
	I would like to talk about a couple of things that are important 
with respect to the national unity of our country. These are things 
members opposite perhaps failed to mention when they talked 
about what they perceived to be the wrongs or the injustices 
suffered by their fellow citizens in various parts of the country. I 
say various parts of the country because this is not a case of 
complaints only from one province. We hear it from many 
provinces. We hear it from the provincial premiers when they 
complain about some of the changes the government is proposing 
in the amending formula. I know that bill is not before the House 
tonight, but it is part of the package of reforms the government has 
introduced, which I am pleased to have the opportunity to discuss.
<P>
	Although members do not mention it often, always in back of 
their speeches is the famous battle that occurred in Canada on the 
Plains of Abraham. I am not going to go through that. But there was 
a second battle, which I think is virtually of equal importance for 
the future of the country and which is never mentioned. I want to 
remind hon. members about this story because it is of tremendous 
significance for Canada.
<P>
	The battle happened 220 years ago this year. There was a 
revolution that started in the United States. The American 
revolutionary Continental Congress decided to send a force to 
invade Canada and take over the colony of Quebec, which was then 
part of the British Empire, having been captured 15 years 
previously in the famous battle I mentioned earlier.
<P>
	The Americans dispatched General Montgomery to capture the 
province of Quebec, or what was then the colony of Quebec. 
Starting in September he moved up the Richelieu River and 
captured Fort Saint-Jean and Fort Chambly on the Richelieu River 
before October 18, 1775. He subsequently attacked Montreal, 
where the British governor, Sir Guy Carleton, was stationed.
<P>
	Governor Carleton realized that the defence of Montreal was 
hopeless, given the fact that he was outnumbered substantially by 
the American force. He had only 800 British regulars with him to 
defend the entire colony. He left Montreal by ship and sailed for 
Quebec on November 11, 1775, and immediately began 
fortifications of the city of Quebec.
<P>
	General Montgomery took Montreal on November 13, stationed 
500 of his troops there, and then moved on to Quebec City with 
about 300 men. He gathered with him  various people from the 
countryside, des habitants pour l'aider avec son attaque sur la ville 
de Québec.
<P>
	It is estimated that he had between 1,600 and 1,800 men outside 
Quebec when he started his siege on December 5, 1775. The 
governor, Sir Guy Carleton, was in a heavily fortified position with 
apparently adequate food, but of course the city of Quebec was 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17313"> 17313 </A></B>
<P>
pounded by a bombardment launched by Montgomery and his 
forces as they besieged the city.
<P>
	As winter continued to move into the area and made things 
colder and more difficult for Montgomery's troops, he realized that 
in order to maintain his position he had to take the city and get the 
battle over with reasonably quickly. So he launched an attack on 
the city of Quebec on December 31, 1775 in the early hours of the 
morning. It was dark. There were a lot of shots exchanged and 
ultimately Montgomery was killed in the streets of Quebec. The 
battle was lost for the Americans. The siege continued until the 
spring, but a British ship arrived, lifted the siege, and the 
Americans had to retreat.
<P>
	That battle was won because the residents of the city of Quebec 
helped the British governor. They sided with the British governor, 
the recent conqueror, in order to preserve what they thought was a 
better way of life under the British crown as an independent part of 
North America and not as part of the United States. In a way, they 
were the first United Empire Loyalists, because they made that 
very significant decision. If they had not made that decision and 
had sided with the Americans and rebelled against the British 
force, as they could easily have done, no doubt Quebec would have 
fallen and no doubt we would have been part of the United States as 
a result of the revolutionary war.
<P>
<B>(1915)</B>
<P>
	The men and women who made that decision were residents of 
the city and of the surrounding countryside. In my view they were 
the first great nation builders of Canada. We never hear mention of 
them whenever a member of the Bloc Quebecois or any separatist 
is busy talking about Canadian unity.
<P>
	It is a battle that holds tremendous significance. In my visit to 
Quebec I saw the place in the street where Montgomery was killed. 
I believe there is a plaque in the street where this happened.
<P>
	Some of ancient buildings in Quebec bore marks for a long time 
of the bombardment they suffered from the Americans in that war 
220 years ago at the end of this month, the anniversary date of the 
attack on Quebec led by Montgomery.
<P>
	This was a very significant event in Canada's history which 
saved Quebec, basically the only part of Canada that was then of 
any significance as a British possession that operated as part of a 
group of colonies that began to grow and prosper, all of them not 
prospering quite so  well but at least growing in Nova Scotia, New 
Brunswick, Quebec and ultimately in Upper Canada, in Ontario.
<P>
	By 1840 we had the Union Act of 1840 that put the provinces of 
Upper and Lower Canada together under a single administration, at 
least legislatively.
<P>
	Subsequent to that the debates took place in respect of the union 
of the Canadian provinces. It is to those debates that I want to turn 
because I want to quote some nation builders. That is what we are 
engaged in here in a very modest way today.
<P>
	It is important to bear in mind some of the words some of these 
people spoke. I turn first to the remarks of the hon. Sir John A. 
Macdonald. He was not a knight at that time. He was the attorney 
general for the western part of the province of Canada and at that 
time the member for Kingston.
<P>
	He was one of the senior Fathers of Confederation. I quote what 
he said in respect of Confederation at that time. This is in the 
Confederation debates in 1865, talking about the union of Upper 
and Lower Canada:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It was felt that a dissolution of the union would have destroyed all the credit 
that we had gained by being a united province, and would have left us two weak 
and ineffective governments, instead of one powerful and united people.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Those words apply precisely to the situation we faced in 
pre-referendum Canada a few weeks ago. I submit those words are 
of importance now just as they were then. He went on to say:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Lower Canadians would not have worked cheerfully under such a change 
of system-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He was talking about a different system than the one I was 
reading about before-
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-but would have ceased to be what they are now-a nationality, with 
representatives in Parliament, governed by general principles, and dividing 
according to their political opinions-and would have been in great danger of 
becoming a faction, forgetful of national obligations, and only actuated by a 
desire to defend their own sectional interests, their own laws, and their own 
institutions.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He was speaking of having a unitary government where there 
would not be a federal division of powers as we now have where 
different parts of the country have the right to decide certain things.
<P>
	We have a situation in which both the opposition parties are 
claiming the federal government should give up powers and where 
the federal government has acknowledged that is so and has chosen 
to do that.
<P>
	I refer to Sir John's conclusion:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In conclusion, I would again implore the House not to let this opportunity to 
pass. It is an opportunity that may never recur. At the risk of repeating myself, I 
would say, it was only by a happy concurrence of circumstances, that we were 
enabled to bring this great question to its present position. If we do not take 
advantage of the time, if we show ourselves unequal to the occasion, it may never 
return, and we shall hereafter bitterly and unavailingly  regret having failed to 
embrace the happy opportunity now offered of founding a great nation.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17314"> 17314 </A></B>
<P>
	I quote another one, Sir George-Étienne Cartier, Macdonald's 
great partner in putting Canada together. He said, and these words 
apply today as much as they did then, in the same debates in 1865:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The question for us to ask ourselves is this: Shall we be content to remain 
separate-shall we be content to maintain a mere provincial existence, when, by 
combining together, we could become a great nation? It had never yet been the 
good fortune of any group of communities to secure national greatness with 
such facility. In past ages, warriors have struggled for years for the addition to 
their country of a single province.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1920)</B>
<P>
	Here we had the great willingness on the part of all these people 
to unite and form this great country we now enjoy.
<P>
	I quote another great nation builder, Sir Wilfrid Laurier, one of 
the great prime ministers of our country. He said, from page 1842 
of <I>Hansard</I>, on March 13, 1900:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>If there is anything to which I have given my political life, it is to try to 
promote unity, harmony and amity between the diverse elements of this country. 
My friends can desert me, they can remove their confidence from me, they can 
withdraw the trust which they have placed in my hands; but never shall I deviate 
from that line of policy. Whatever may be the consequences, whether loss of 
prestige, loss of popularity, or loss of power, I feel that I am in the right, and I 
know that a time will come when every man, my hon. friend himself included, 
will render me full justice on that score.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	As our forebearers did, we can do no less but to engage in the 
nation building which they did in this great and vast country of 
ours.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Marlene Cowling (Dauphin-Swan River, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am proud to be a Canadian and I am proud to be part of a 
country that includes the province of Quebec. I am proud to be part 
of a country that not only recognizes diversity but respects and 
cherishes it.
<P>
	What a boring country it would be if we were all the same. Our 
differences keep us vital and dynamic, and our ability to respect our 
differences while working together has made us the envy of the 
world.
<P>
	The United Nations said Canada is the greatest country in the 
world. We owe this honour in large part to those who built Canada, 
to the men and women who came here searching for a better life 
and for hope.
<P>
	The fabric of our country is woven from the threads brought here 
by people from around the world. These threads of hope, tolerance 
and compassion unite us as Canadians and will provide the strength 
to see us through the challenges that lie ahead.
<P>
	Countries are not rigid like the stone and rock they are carved 
from. They must be fluid and adaptable if we are to survive.
<P>
	Since Confederation, Canada has successfully adapted to a 
rapidly changing world. Our boundaries have changed and it was 
less than 50 years ago that we acquired a new province, 
Newfoundland. We are now in the process of creating the new 
territory Nunavut.
<P>
	Our economic base has expanded and diversified to the point at 
which Canada has a highly integrated economy and is a competitor 
in world markets. A century ago the people of a country that was 
largely based on farming and trapping could never have dreamed 
that the Canada of today would be a leader in telecommunications, 
aerospace and finance, and that its agricultural products would be 
marketed around the world.
<P>
	Canadian society has also changed dramatically. Our population 
has grown tremendously and shifted from largely rural to mostly 
urban. An influx of people immigrating from around the world has 
made Canada a unique cultural mosaic.
<P>
	Canada has grown and prospered because of its ability to read 
the signals for change and to adapt for the well-being of our 
country. The referendum vote on October 30 was a vote for Canada. 
It was a signal for change.
<P>
	As the Secretary of State for Multiculturalism noted during the 
debate on Friday, the Prime Minister, the government and 
Parliament have a duty to preserve the unity of Canada as a nation 
indivisible.
<P>
	Quebecers and Canadians have asked the government to keep 
Canada together. The Prime Minister has responded quickly to the 
signals for change. It is a response to keep the country united. That 
is what Canadians and the people of my riding of Dauphin-Swan 
River want.
<P>
<B>(1925)</B>
<P>
	When the Bloc members refer to the rest of Canada as English 
Canada they do a great disservice to the hundreds of French 
Canadians who live in my riding of Dauphin-Swan River; French 
Canadians who have kept their language, culture and traditions 
alive in rural Manitoba.
<P>
	I am pleased and proud to represent predominantly French 
communities such as Ste. Rose du Lac, Laurier, St. Lazare and San 
Clara where people of many ethnic origins, including English, 
French, Ukrainian, Polish and First Nations people, work together 
toward their common goal of building strong communities and 
contributing to a strong and united Canada.
<P>
	I have been overwhelmed by the response of the people of 
Dauphin-Swan River about the future of Canada. The people of 
my riding tell me that for the good of Canada, for our present and 
for our future, we need to remain united.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17315"> 17315 </A></B>
<P>
	As the Prime Minister has so eloquently stated, a Canada 
without Quebec is no Canada, and a Quebec without Canada is 
no Quebec.
<P>
	I also bring to the House a message from the youth of Canada. 
They too want and deserve a voice in the debate about the Canada 
they will inherit from us.
<P>
	In November I travelled to a number of schools in my riding of 
Dauphin-Swan River to listen to young people about their vision 
of Canada. The students told me their Canada includes Quebec. It is 
important to them that we make every effort to keep our country 
united, from sea to sea to sea. That is the Canada they know. That is 
the Canada they want. That is the Canada they deserve.
<P>
	This was also the message three young people from Russell, 
Manitoba brought to me in Ottawa on their way to the Montreal 
rally. These young people spent their hard earned dollars to travel 
to Montreal to be part of the chorus of voices ringing across 
Canada, telling Quebecers they are important to Canada. The 
courage and the commitment of these young people is a shining 
example of the belief western Canada has that a strong Canada is a 
united Canada.
<P>
	We must lead by example. We must show our young people that 
differences can be overcome and that compromise is preferable to 
conflict. As a member of Parliament and as a member of the 
Liberal government I am committed to ensuring a strong and united 
Canada for the benefit of the people of Dauphin-Swan River and 
for all Canadians. As a mother and a grandmother, the Canada I 
want to give to my children and my grandchildren is a Canada 
which includes Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley, 
Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak to Motion No. 26 this 
evening.
<P>
	It is a pleasure to speak to any government legislation of 
significance these days because the Liberal government has 
developed a habit of invoking closure on important controversial 
bills. It is beyond comprehension. This is one of the most important 
issues before the House and the government is limiting debate. 
What is the government afraid of, that people may actually find out 
what it is doing?
<P>
	It is difficult for me to find parliamentary language to accurately 
describe my outrage at how the government rams through 
legislation by denying members of Parliament the opportunity to 
bring the concerns of their constituents into the debate. However, I 
digress. I am here to talk about the motion before the House today. 
I had better take advantage of the opportunity to speak before the 
Liberals decide they want to invoke closure in the middle of my 
speech.
<P>
	The motion is rather simple but leaves many questions 
unanswered. Motion No. 26 calls on the House to recognize that 
Quebec is a distinct society within Canada. Before I give my 
opinion on the issue of whether  Quebec is distinct, I will address 
the issue of what this means to the rest of Canada.
<P>
<B>(1930 )</B>
<P>
	If Quebec is distinct, does that mean that the rest of Canada is 
indistinct? Does it mean there is no difference between the outports 
of the Newfoundland coast and downtown Toronto? Does it mean 
there is no distinction between the isolated native communities of 
the north and downtown Vancouver? Does it mean the rural grain 
farming communities of the prairies are indistinct from downtown 
Ottawa?
<P>
	The answer to these questions is obvious: No. Not only are the 
other nine provinces distinct from each other but there are 
significant distinctions within the provinces themselves.
<P>
	My first administrative assistant on the Hill was a francophone 
from Campbellton, New Brunswick. I can accept the fact that she 
and her fellow francophone New Brunswickers consider 
themselves to be distinct from the Quebecers who live just on the 
other side of the Restigouche River.
<P>
	This motion also recognizes the distinction between 
francophones in Quebec and New Brunswick but it does not 
recognize the distinction between New Brunswick's Acadians and 
New Brunswickers of British origin. Does that mean that there is 
no distinction between the two groups? That is the biggest flaw of 
M-26. It demands that this House recognize only one distinction.
<P>
	Let us look at the three largest metropolitan cities in Canada. I 
have enjoyed my visits to Montreal and could have spent days 
wandering in the old town, but like Toronto and Vancouver, 
Montreal is a city whose population is a blend of old stock 
Canadians and larger, newer immigrant communities. Immigrants 
come to these cities from countries that span the globe. What is 
different is the percentage of the various ethnic groups that make 
up the population of each of these three cities.
<P>
	Despite this difference, they are still all large cosmopolitan cities 
with tall skyscrapers in the central business district surrounded by a 
mix of industrial and residential communities.
<P>
	However, the government wants us to recognize that Montreal is 
distinct but Vancouver and Toronto are not. Why? Because as is 
stated in part (2) of the motion, the government wants the House to 
recognize that Quebec's distinct society includes its French 
speaking majority, unique culture and civil law tradition.
<P>
	Now we know why Montreal is to be considered distinct and 
Vancouver and Toronto are not. Montreal is distinct because of its 
French speaking majority but where does this leave Montreal's 
anglophones and allophones? According to this motion, they must 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17316"> 17316 </A></B>
<P>
be indistinct. Let us flash back to the aftermath of the referendum 
and Premier Parizeau's comments about the  ethnic vote. His 
comments were roundly and rightfully condemned.
<P>
	Members opposite were especially vocal in their condemnation 
of Premier Parizeau's attack on the ethnic vote. What does the 
government do in response? It put forward this motion that states 
that Quebec is distinct because of its French speaking majority. It 
wants to legislate a distinct status for Quebec's francophones, 
separating them from the ethnic minority, the very fact Liberals 
condemned Premier Parizeau for stating.
<P>
	Once again, the government deals in a logic that can only be 
understood by that side of the House. It must be something in the 
drinking water in the government lobby.
<P>
	Let us return to the question: Is Quebec distinct? Yes, Quebec is 
distinct. But Quebec is a diversified province with one area distinct 
from another within its own provincial borders, the same as all the 
other provinces.
<P>
	The northern parts of British Columbia and Alberta are very 
different from the southern parts. I recall the comments that the 
separatists were all spouting after the referendum loss that the 
results showed division in Canada. No, the referendum result 
showed the division that there is in the province of Quebec. 
Although Quebec is no longer a homogeneous province, the federal 
government wants it to be treated as one.
<P>
	Points (2) and (3) of the motion state that:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(3) the House undertake to be guided by this reality;</BLOCKQUOTE>
	and that:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(4) the House encourage all components of the legislative and executive 
branches of government to take note of this recognition and be guided in their 
conduct accordingly.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	What this means is extremely unclear. The Prime Minister is 
telling Quebecers that these sections will provide Quebec with a 
great deal of power, yet at the same time he is telling Canadians 
outside Quebec that it does not. Which is it? Let us not leave this 
motion undefined. Reform Party members have attempted to 
clarify the meaning of distinct society with our amendment, that 
this motion does not confer any powers, rights, status or privileges 
to Quebec that are not provided to any other province. Our 
amendment will ensure that all Quebecers will be treated equally.
<P>
<B>(1935)</B>
<P>
	Our amendment also makes it clear that there is nothing in this 
motion that denies the fact that Canada constitutes one nation. That 
is the danger of passing the government's motion without the 
Reform amendment. By identifying Quebec as a distinct society, 
the government is agreeing with the basic tenet of the separatist 
mantra that the Quebec people are different from the rest of 
Canadians. Do the Liberals honestly believe that once they 
acknowledge this difference they can counter the second part of the 
separatist argument  that because of this difference Quebecers need 
their own nation?
<P>
	In dealing with this issue I have tried to do what this government 
refuses to do: ask the opinions of average Canadians. In my latest 
householder that has just started to arrive in the homes of my 
constituents I included my regular 10-question survey. I have two 
questions in that survey. First, do you believe that Quebec should 
be granted distinct society status if it confers special privileges or 
powers to Quebec? Second, do you believe that Quebec should be 
granted distinct society status if it confers no special privileges or 
powers to Quebec?
<P>
	Unfortunately with the government's rush to stifle debate, I will 
not have enough time to have a truly representative response to 
these questions. However, as of this moment the answer to the first 
question is overwhelmingly no. The answer to the second question 
is still too close to see a trend. My greatest objection to this motion 
is that the government believes it is ordained to make these serious 
decisions on its own without any consultation with Canadians.
<P>
	It would have been more appropriate if the government had 
stayed to its original plan and had us voting on this motion 
tomorrow, December 7. What could have been more fitting than 
having the government ram through a motion in this manner, and 
by having it do so on a day that already has a reputation of being a 
day that shall live in infamy. I guess we will have to come up with 
our own day of infamy, but then the government is providing us 
with so many.
<P>
	The people of Surrey-White Rock-South Langley should 
have had an opportunity to express their opinions on this motion 
and the veto issue directly through a national referendum. 
However, they will have to be content with their MP having a 
chance to contribute in this debate. It is very unfortunate that there 
are many Canadians who have lost the opportunity to have their 
member of Parliament speak to this issue.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to address the distinct society motion presented by the Prime 
Minister and his government with respect to the province of 
Quebec.
<P>
	The reason we are debating this motion late tonight is because of 
the Prime Minister's last minute Hail Mary promise to Quebecers 
during the dying moments of the referendum campaign. With this 
motion, combined with a constitutional veto and a transfer of 
manpower training to Quebec, the Prime Minister feels that he has 
now made the best and most significant contribution to national 
unity. We are all going to live happily ever after.
<P>
	I am afraid I cannot agree with his logic, his proposals and the 
timing of them. He has resurrected the constitutional ghosts of 
Christmas past and will witness the same results as was had with 
Meech and Charlottetown: failure.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17317"> 17317 </A></B>
<P>
	First, in analysing the components of the distinct society motion 
I have to ask the question: Does the Prime Minister truly feel this 
really satisfies Quebecers' desires, hopes and needs? The Prime 
Minister is a Quebecer himself. If anybody should know what 
Quebecers want, it is he.
<P>
	However, during the referendum campaign he misread, he 
misunderstood and he misrepresented to the rest of Canada what 
should be done. He said: ``Thank you very much for staying quiet. 
Don't worry, they won't leave. Just don't say anything to upset 
them and everything will be fine''. He almost blew it and he knew 
it.
<P>
	He got the minister of fisheries, Captain Tobin, to use his turbot 
popularity and throw together a unity rally in Montreal asking 
everybody from sea to sea to get to Montreal. He then turned 
around and made promises to the separatists, promises to the 
sovereignists, promises to the nationalists, promises to the 
federalists. Aside from the fact that keeping promises is not one of 
the Prime Minister's strong points-he promised to renegotiate 
NAFTA, but did not; he promised to eliminate the GST, but has not; 
he promised to eliminate patronage appointments, but will not; he 
promised free votes, which maybe is something he is not allowed to 
deliver on-now we have him promising to recognize Quebec as a 
distinct society in Canada.
<P>
<B>(1940)</B>
<P>
	As a Quebecer he should know what Quebecers want when they 
say distinct society. He knows what they want is for the rest of 
Canada to recognize Quebec as one of two founding nations. He 
knows that Quebecers who want distinct society do not feel there is 
any cost in acknowledging the fact that they are one of two 
founding nations. They want a distinct society clause that will 
protect their rights over language, culture and civil law while 
keeping the province French.
<P>
	I personally do not disagree with some of these aspirations. 
What I do worry about are the consequences if the definition of 
distinct society is not spelled out. If distinct society means that 
Quebecers are different because of their language, culture and civil 
law, I recognize that. That means they are unique and distinct from 
other provinces and people, just as other provinces and people are 
unique and distinct from them.
<P>
	However, if Quebecers want this distinct society clause to mean 
that not only are they different but they also get special legislative 
powers above and beyond the rest of Canada, then I am against 
that. I am sorry but the answer is no to one province getting special 
treatment over another.
<P>
	While Reformers can agree to recognizing differences, we 
cannot agree to giving Quebecers some form of special status over 
and above other Canadians. That is  fundamentally unacceptable 
and I truly feel that most Quebecers understand that point.
<P>
	All Quebecers want is something that gives them satisfaction 
that they will not be tromped on, stamped on, kicked on as is 
currently being done by the Minister of Human Resources 
Development with his new employment insurance program.
<P>
	The frustration in Quebec is based on the fact that we have too 
much federal interference in matters of provincial jurisdiction. 
Quebecers want the federal government to get out of their lives in a 
lot of areas. That is where the solution to national unity lies. Give 
the powers to the provinces that they want and need, regulated by 
the federal government and let us make government the right size 
doing the right thing. Let us have a smaller and more open 
government than what we have.
<P>
	Simply put, all provinces want control over their purse strings on 
programs closest to the people, delivered at a lesser cost than is 
currently the case with the bureaucratic nightmare in Ottawa.
<P>
	I am not against the distinct society motion which recognizes 
Quebec as a distinct society within Canada, provided it is fully 
defined and does not make them the biggest kid in the playground. 
That is why I would ask the Prime Minister and the government to 
support Reform amendments to this distinct society motion so that 
he can get more support from all across Canada, including from 
those people in Quebec who look on this motion very suspiciously. 
It would give the people of Quebec and the rest of Canada what 
they want: recognition with powers, but not special status.
<P>
	I ask the government to support our amendments because what 
we are trying to do is please the majority of Quebecers, not the 
minority. If we keep trying to come up with programs and with 
definitions to please the separatists it will never work. It has not 
worked for 25 years and it will not work for the next 25 years. The 
separatists act like spoiled children, not all Quebecers, just the 
separatists.
<P>
	Most Quebecers want what is in their best interests and that is no 
different than myself as a distinct and different person from the 
province of Alberta. I want the best for my province just as people 
in Quebec want the best for their province.
<P>
	Let us design a motion that appeals to the majority of Quebecers, 
that appeals to the majority of Canadians. That is how we can build 
on national unity. For the sake of national unity I ask the Prime 
Minister to please consider the input and information that has been 
coming to him through the Standing Committee on Justice and 
Legal Affairs on the constitutional veto. I hope the government 
listens. There has been some valuable input there.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17318"> 17318 </A></B>
<P>
	We can debate sharing the federal government veto with four 
regions or five regions. That is not really the issue. I believe there 
are five regions because British Columbia is more like the Atlantic 
provinces than it is like the prairies.
<P>
	That is not the point. The point is that this veto should be for the 
people of Canada and not their legislative assemblies. We already 
have the seven provinces out of ten representing 50 per cent within 
the constitutional amendment clause. The separatist Parti 
Quebecois will now have veto power over changes to the Canadian 
Constitution. This is ridiculous. The veto should be given to the 
people of Quebec and not to the politicians.
<P>
<B>(1945)</B>
<P>
	We should be and I think we are a country of 10 equal provinces 
committed to similar goals and objectives, each with the same 
rights, privileges and powers. If we want to change those rights, 
privileges and powers, it should be one one way or another through 
a national referendum from the bottom up, not necessarily by 
elected officials from the top down.
<P>
	We have to look at the situation very seriously. We have to 
conclude that a lot of people in Canada want change, not just the 
province of Quebec or the people who had the referendum. People 
across the country want change for the good. They do not want 
change to justify the status quo.
<P>
	We have to look at issues like changes to the Constitution or 
granting one province recognition in a way that the rest of the 
country worries might give it special powers. We have to address 
those issue. What is wrong with addressing them? We all have to 
work together to bring the country together from sea to sea to sea.
<P>
	We have to make amendments to the Constitution to give it the 
ability to live and the ability to be changed. It should be difficult. It 
should not be easy to change the Constitution once we define the 
powers, the levels of responsibility and the way we will work 
together as 10 provinces. We should think about how we can make 
changes to it. We cannot give a veto to every province, or there will 
never be change. We cannot put that Constitution in a vault, let it 
die and gather dust. We have to give it life. It has to be a breathing 
document. It has to be tough to make change but we have to allow 
change to happen.
<P>
	We have to look at different provinces and different regions and 
try to recognize their specific needs and wants. There is no reason 
we cannot accommodate them. There is no reason we cannot come 
up with a mechanism to give Quebec what it wants and recognize it 
as a distinct society. It is different. It is unique. It has made a 
valuable contribution to the building and the nurturing of this great 
country called Canada.
<P>
	If that means that Quebec should also get special powers over 
and above being recognized as distinct, that is not right and we 
have to tell Quebecers that. The separatists really want this. It is not 
all Quebecers. Those who want it want to protect their French 
language. We should be able to help them protect their French 
language and their French culture.
<P>
	They in turn should protect minority rights within their province, 
the English and any other immigrant, and how they can interface 
with their provincial problems. They do that. What I am saying is 
that we have ways and means of producing a collective agreement 
if we just identify the right problem.
<P>
	This is a panic effort by the Prime Minister and the government 
to fulfil a promise that he made in the dying moments of a game 
that he thought he would lose. The game is called unity and he was 
afraid he would lose the country. He did not want to go down in 
history as the Prime Minister who lost the country after having told 
all of us: ``I am from that region. Don't worry. They won't vote to 
go'', and they almost did.
<P>
	It is sad. Now that it is all over they almost look at us and ask: 
``What did the Reform Party do?'' We kept telling them all along to 
tell Quebecers the consequences of separation, the price of 
separation. They did not do it then. We will do it now and never in 
the future will any province look at itself and say it will separate 
and everything will be perfect. We will tell them the cost of 
separation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Speller (Haldimand-Norfolk, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to have an opportunity to address the House today on 
the motion put forward by the government to recognize Quebec as 
a distinct society.
<P>
	I remind members of the most recent referendum in which a 
majority of Quebecers voted to stay in Canada. With this motion 
we are trying to make sure we build on that commitment by 
Quebecers.
<P>
	With all the rhetoric it is difficult for Canadians to understand 
what is going on. The Bloc is telling Quebecers there is nothing in 
this package, that it is a bunch of platitudes, that it means nothing, 
that we in so-called English Canada really do not want them to stay. 
The Reform is telling us that we are giving Quebec everything, that 
we are giving it something that other provinces do not have, and 
that somehow it will be able to do other things within Canada to get 
special powers because of the motion.
<P>
<B>(1950)</B>
<P>
	No wonder Canadians are having a hard time understanding. 
Quite frankly it is not only rhetoric but lies are being told to 
Canadians on the issue. It is disturbing, especially given the fact of 
how important the issue is to Canada and to the future of the 
country.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17319"> 17319 </A></B>
<P>
	The opposition is telling truths but it is only telling half truths. 
The Bloc says it does not want to talk about the Constitution. Then 
it says that somehow the motion does not give Quebec any special 
constitutional power. How can it argue on the one hand that it does 
not want to talk about the Constitution and on the other hand argue 
that the motion somehow is not constitutionally significant?
<P>
	Frankly it is no surprise that Canadians do not want to talk about 
the Constitution. They want to deal with other issues. They want to 
deal with jobs. They want to make sure that their families have 
opportunities for education and proper health care. These are issues 
of concern to Canadians.
<P>
	The Prime Minister gave a commitment at the Montreal rally, 
which I am proud to say a number of my constituents attended, to 
address some of the concerns of Quebecers. I know the Reform 
Party blames us for the outcome being so close, and it was. I agree 
that it was Canadians who came together in that last week, drew the 
referendum together and showed Quebecers what they thought.
<P>
	On behalf of not only the constituents of Haldimand-Norfolk 
but of all people of Canada I want to say how proud I was of those 
great Canadians who went from the riding of Haldimand-Norfolk 
on their own volition to Montreal to express their deep desire for 
the country to stay together.
<P>
	All Canadians inside and outside Quebec understand there is 
nothing we could propose right now to the Government of Quebec 
and to the Bloc Quebecois that would make them happy. There is 
nothing we could propose right that would make them all of a 
sudden jump up and say that they want to stay in Canada. They are 
not prepared to do that.
<P>
	What the Prime Minister has done, and I think he has done it 
very well, is drafted it in a way that he is giving exactly what he 
committed to. He is opening the door for future commitments and 
future negotiations in 1997 or 1998. He is allowing Canadians the 
time to sit down and work on some of the problems we have as a 
country.
<P>
	I call on all Canadians to take up the challenge of the Prime 
Minister to go to Quebec, to Alberta or British Columbia and tell 
them we need to keep the country together and that the fact the 
United Nations considers us the number one country in the world is 
no mistake.
<P>
	It is because we have been able to draw together, to work 
together, to bring the diversity of Canadians together and to focus 
attention on working for the betterment of not only Canadians but 
the country as a whole. We have stayed together all these years 
because of that desire of Canadians.
<P>
	There are those who ask: ``What is Canadian? What is Canada?'' 
Some people say Canada is something that is not American. I 
believe we saw in Montreal what Canada  really stands for: for 
sharing, caring and working together. The motion tries to build on 
that. I ask Canadians to challenge the naysayers and those in 
Quebec who say that English Canada does not want them based on 
history and on fact.
<P>
	Recently we observed Remembrance Day with ceremonies in 
which we remembered the strong dedication that many Canadians 
gave to their country. We recently celebrated the 50th anniversary 
of the end of the war in Europe. Those Canadians died for their 
country, believing in their country. I wonder what they would think 
today about the ongoing debate in the House, what they would 
think about the silliness of some of what is being said. They fought 
and gave their all for their country. They deserve our giving them 
something back. We should sit down, talk, throw away politics, 
throw away the rhetoric and let their memory guide us in terms of 
our deliberations.
<P>
<B>(1955)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	On behalf of my constituents of Haldimand-Norfolk, I want to 
tell Quebecers there is a desire on our part to make things right. I 
think Quebecers are being told lies about the position of English 
speaking Canadians in rural areas. My constituents would like a 
chance to sit down and talk with their French speaking compatriots.
<P>
	People in Haldimand-Norfolk are proud of Canada, and they 
think we have accomplished great things together over the last few 
years. We would like you Quebecers to try to understand how we 
feel. Do not believe all the talk about English speaking Canadians 
being willing to let you go and not being ready to compromise. We 
are ready. Let us get together and talk about it.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I am not sure, Mr. Speaker, whether you understood what I said. 
Perhaps you can read the translation afterward. I say on behalf of 
the people of Haldimand-Norfolk that we need to sit down, to 
throw away the rhetoric, to put politics behind us and to share our 
common values of what is Canadian. We can do that and at the 
same time we can work on what Canadians really want.
<P>
	We can work on making the economy work. We can work on a 
health care system that is envied the world over. We can work on 
saving the environment. These are all very important issues that we 
need to address. We do not need to be talking about the 
Constitution at this time.
<P>
	In our three-point plan we are trying to make sure that as 
Canadians and as legislators responsible for all of Canada and not 
just one region or one province, we make it very well known to 
Quebecers that we love the country, that we need them as a part of 
the country for it to be strong and that we recognize their 
distinctiveness.  We recognize they have a distinct and different 
language from that of a lot of Canadians. We recognize they have a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17320"> 17320 </A></B>
<P>
different culture and a different legal system. I only wish the 
opposition party, Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition, would recognize 
it.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I assure the hon. member for 
Haldimand-Norfolk that I understood every word and I take the 
liberty to compliment him on his effort to speak in the other official 
language.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Francis G. LeBlanc (Cape Breton Highlands-Canso, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to take part in tonight's debate on 
the Prime Minister's motion concerning the recognition of 
Quebec's distinct society within Canada. In supporting this motion, 
I would like to talk, first of all, as an Acadian from Nova Scotia. As 
you know, Acadians were among the first people to settle in Canada 
after the First Nations, and, since the founding of the first 
settlement at Port-Royal, four centuries ago, we have had our share 
of upheavals, struggles and turmoil.
<P>
<B>(2000)</B>
<P>
	Protecting our language and culture has never been easy. We 
have had to fight, and we still do, to get our share of recognition. 
But we realized a long time ago that our chances of survival as a 
cultural community were much better if we joined forces with the 
francophones of Quebec, Manitoba and elsewhere in Canada.
<P>
	We know that the preservation and blossoming of our language 
and culture inevitably depend on our being part of a larger country 
which has been able to include our concerns as well as those of 
other cultural communities in a larger entity and a broader vision. 
This is Canada.
<P>
	The Official Languages Act and the bilingualism policy have 
provided a concrete example of this broader vision of Canada.
<P>
	I consider myself lucky to have had a chance to personally 
experience the distinct nature of Quebec. For four years, in the 
early 1980s, I was a student at Laval University, where I made a lot 
of close friends among Quebecers. I had a chance to have lengthy 
discussions with them about their vision and their place both within 
Quebec and within Canada.
<P>
	I found that, in general, the distinct nature of Quebec and of 
Quebecers is not based on a separation from the rest of Canada, but 
rather on an affirmation of oneself and a feeling of solidarity that 
finds its expression and its soul in the vitality of the French 
language, as the singer-songwriter Michel Rivard says so 
beautifully: ``The language of my heart is the heart of my life''.
<P>
	But despite all the political rhetoric and the sovereignist 
movement, the Quebecers that I know have a profound attachment 
to Canada. And I think that if all cultural communities across 
Canada can work together,  we can contribute to the growth and 
prosperity of our wonderful country.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I have no trouble with the notion of Quebec being seen as a 
distinct society within the context of this motion. Nor do I see any 
contradiction in the notion that while not conferring special powers 
to the Government of Quebec, this motion is by no means 
symbolic, although it carries some important and powerful 
symbolism.
<P>
	By recognizing the distinctive character of Quebec in its 
policies, its laws, its regulations and its programs, this motion 
provides one more prism among many others through which the 
Government of Canada commits itself to be guided in the 
development of its laws, its regulations, its policies and programs 
before they are enacted and as they are implemented.
<P>
	The members of the Reform Party have a hard time 
understanding this because they do not really understand how 
modern government functions. When government policy is 
developed and presented before cabinet for consideration or when a 
change is made to a body of regulation or when a new law or 
program is adopted and advanced and presented before Parliament, 
it must be evaluated according to many different angles or 
dimensions. One of these is the balance of impacts of the program 
across gender lines, socio-economic lines, and regions and 
provinces so that the balance of these impacts is fair and equitable.
<P>
<B>(2005 )</B>
<P>
	A good example of this is the legislation that was tabled last 
week by the Minister of Human Resources Development. In the 
package of information that accompanied the legislation creating 
the employment insurance program, one of the first tables 
presented is a table describing the financial impacts of employment 
insurance by province. No government would contemplate a major 
change in a program such as employment insurance without 
considering the impacts across provincial lines.
<P>
	Another example of a prism through which government policy 
has to be evaluated is provided by the Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms, which since 1982 has been enshrined in the Canadian 
Constitution. The Charter of Rights and Freedoms ensures that 
laws and regulations and programs introduced by the federal 
government respect the basic freedoms and rights of Canadian 
citizens that we have enshrined in the Constitution through the 
charter.
<P>
	A third example is provided to us by the official languages 
legislation enforced by the official languages commission for 
Canada and the whole policy and infrastructure promoting official 
bilingualism in Canada, which ensure that linguistic minorities in 
Canada, including Acadians and other francophone groups  
throughout the country, as well as anglophones in Quebec, receive 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17321"> 17321 </A></B>
<P>
the recognition of their language and receive services in the 
language of their choice.
<P>
	These are commitments the federal government has made for 
itself and for its programs. They are part of the prism through 
which all laws, regulations, and programs must be evaluated by the 
Government of Canada.
<P>
	The distinct society motion the Prime Minister has brought 
forward this week will in a different way act as a prism and a guide 
and an opportunity for the federal government to commit and 
ensure that the programs and its policies reflect this particular 
cultural aspect of Canada, which is the distinctive character of 
Quebec in those very important categories of unique language, 
culture, and civil law tradition. That in a sense is the genius of the 
Prime Minister's approach to recognizing Quebec as a distinct 
society and putting into practical effect the application of that 
respect as far as the Government of Canada is concerned.
<P>
	One of the reasons Canadians continue to be so supportive and 
have such great confidence in the Prime Minister of Canada is 
because largely through his great experience in government he has 
found a way to give concrete effect to the commitments and 
undertakings he made to the people of Quebec and to the people of 
Canada for change and for recognition of their particular place in 
Confederation in a way that does not violate the rights of other 
Canadians and the rights of provinces but acts as a positive 
discipline on the Government of Canada.
<P>
	If other Canadians and provinces through the constitutional 
discussions choose and can agree on the enshrinement of such a 
principle in the Canadian Constitution, that would strengthen the 
notion of the distinct society we have adopted and will adopt 
through this Parliament.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I will conclude my remarks by saying that I know this initiative 
will never satisfy the separatist members of the Bloc Quebecois 
and the Parti Quebecois.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am sorry but the member's time has 
expired. I now give the floor to the member for 
Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans.
<P>
<B>(2010)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member who just spoke may rest 
assured that will never satisfy us.
<P>
	``Whatever they say or do, Quebec is today and always will be a 
distinct society''. Those words were spoken used by Quebec's 
federalist Liberal Premier Robert Bourassa, the day after the 
demise of Meech Lake. ``From now on, no more negotiations 
involving ten or eleven parties. From now on, there will be bilateral 
discussions only''.
<P>
	This proves that the motion before the House today, presented by 
the federal Liberal government, is nothing new. The concept of a 
distinct society was developed by the Quebec Liberal Party. 
Actually, it goes back to 1965 and the preliminary reports of the 
Royal Commission of Inquiry on Bilingualism and Biculturalism, 
the Laurendeau-Dunton Commission, where we find the term 
distinct society in a marginal note to the paragraph that defines 
Quebec society on page 103.
<P>
	In a speech on May 9, 1986, Quebec Intergovernmental 
Relations Minister Gil Rémillard stated five minimum conditions 
which, if they were met, might lead Quebec to ratify the 
Constitution Act, 1982. Meanwhile, the Parti Quebecois was 
talking about a distinct people.
<P>
	According to the Meech Lake Accord in 1990, the Quebec 
National Assembly would be responsible for protecting the duality 
and promoting the distinct identity of Quebec. We supported 
Meech Lake because it was supposed to recognize the distinct 
identity of Quebec. This provision would not have the effect of 
lessening the existing powers of the federal government.
<P>
	Basically, including this in the Constitution would be a way to 
make up for the affront we suffered in 1982. In 1980, Liberal Prime 
Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau said in a speech on May 14, before 
the referendum on May 20: ``We are putting our seats on the line, 
and if you vote no, this no will mean yes to a new Canada''. The 
result was the unilateral patriation of the Constitution in 1982, with 
the help of the present Prime Minister.
<P>
	To take a leaf from the book of the hon. member from Nova 
Scotia, how can we trust these people? Basically, what did we ask? 
We asked the judges to consider both concepts, the Canadian 
duality and distinct society, in their interpretations of the 
Constitution Acts of 1867 and 1982, the latter including the 
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, the Prime Minister's 
baby, as he keeps reminding us in this House.
<P>
	At the time, the distinct society clause would have limited the 
centralist and standardizing tendencies of the Charter. When the 
Supreme Court ruled that certain sections of Bill 101 were 
unconstitutional, the Quebec National Assembly would have been 
able to adopt them again, if the distinct society clause had been 
accepted.
<P>
	Another important event, with a player we saw during the 
referendum campaign last October, was initiated by the Charest 
report named after the hon. member for Sherbrooke, who is often 
conspicuous by his absence from this House, and the Charest report 
goes back to-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am sorry to interrupt the hon. member 
but, if I have heard him correctly, the hon. member is not allowed 
to comment on a colleague's  absence from this House. I would ask 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17322"> 17322 </A></B>
<P>
the hon. member not to comment on any member's presence or 
absence.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Guimond: </B>Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Once again, you have 
been vigilant and I withdraw my comment.
<P>
	In the Charest report, in May 1990, the desire was to lessen the 
scope of the distinct society concept, particularly by stating that the 
distinct society clause did not in any way diminish the 
effectiveness of the charter.
<P>
	Right from the start, in May 1990, it was obvious that certain 
provincial premiers were uncomfortable with the idea of a distinct 
society. From then on, the Meech Lake accord began to experience 
some difficulty.
<P>
<B>(2015)</B>
<P>
	According to certain premiers, the semi-official nature of the 
distinct society concept could have led to the Canadian courts' not 
using that clause in interpreting the Canadian Constitution. Then 
came the Charlottetown accord in which the constitutional 
importance of the distinct society was watered down into a set of 
eight fundamental characteristics defining Canada. How could the 
courts have seen their way clear in all of that?
<P>
	We were led to believe that the notion of a distinct society ranked 
higher than the other fundamental characteristics. But the overall 
sparseness of the Charlottetown accord shows that the notion of a 
distinct society would not have had any real effect. This was 
already an indication that it was an empty shell. And that is why 
Quebecers voted no in the October 26 1992 referendum on 
Charlottetown, because they considered that it did not give enough 
to Quebec. The other provinces voted against it as well, but because 
they considered that it gave too much to Quebec. Imagine!
<P>
	I have just given a brief overview of Meech 1, Meech 2, the 
Charest report, Charlottetown. I have never seen a box wrapped in 
Christmas paper without something inside, but such is the case 
with the propositions of the Prime Minister, his Liberal team, and 
the ``learned committees'' he has set up to show Quebecers how 
much he loves them.
<P>
	Nothing in this motion recognizes Quebecers as a distinct 
people. As we know, a motion of the House of commons has no 
legal value, let alone a constitutional one. The motion introduced 
by the Liberal government is an empty shell and will no legal or 
political impact. It is an act of panic aimed basically at deceiving 
those who want real changes to Quebec's status.
<P>
	Fortunately, Quebecers can see through all this and can pick out 
what is truly good for them. The Prime Minister's reaction in 
introducing this motion tells us there is a terrible threat. He kept the 
phrase ``distinct society'' because it would have been difficult to do 
otherwise, but he did all he could to strip it of its meaning. Just 
imagine. The Liberal government's proposal was considered 
unacceptable even by Quebec  Liberals, whose leader, Daniel 
Johnson, recently asked that the distinctive character of Quebec be 
entrenched in the Constitution.
<P>
	The definition of distinct society proposed by the Prime Minister 
is identical to the one contained in the Charlottetown accord, which 
was rejected by a majority of Canadians and Quebecers alike. 
Furthermore, the definition proposed by the Prime Minister does 
not go as far as the one initially proposed in the Meech Lake 
accord. How could anyone in this House believe that we could not 
oppose such a motion? Come on. We are not idiots.
<P>
	The government's motion to recognize the distinct nature of 
Quebec cannot, in any way, be considered an adequate response to 
the changes demanded by Quebecers during the October 30 
referendum. We have to remember that last October Quebecers 
voted in favour of sovereignty in a very large proportion and that a 
majority of Quebecers, including some who voted no, were in 
favour of a comprehensive renewal of Canadian federalism.
<P>
	Given that my time is almost up, I would like to tell you that we 
are in favour of sovereignty for the people of Quebec and that it is 
out of the question for Quebecers to negotiate agreements that even 
Daniel Johnson called, when referring to manpower training, 
cut-rate agreements.
<P>
<B>(2020)</B>
<P>
	Clearly, the federal government's proposals give nothing to 
Quebec.
<P>
	To conclude, like many I think that we have to be careful not to 
undermine whatever good faith remains between the various 
parties. On the contrary we should create links which will bring us 
to a partnership-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am sorry, but the member's time is up. 
The hon. member for Chicoutimi has the floor.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is true, 
we are all taking part in a historical moment in this debate, because 
this moment marks federalism's inability to renew itself.
<P>
	I never thought I would rise in this House to speak on anything 
so empty as this debate on Quebec's recognition as a distinct 
society. This motion by the government is essentially an exercise in 
futility. It is a complete and utter void.
<P>
	Since October 30, improvisation has reigned supreme in this 
House, so much so that it is giving the Quebec Ligue nationale 
d'improvisation pretty stiff competition.
<P>
	Before October 30, constitutional matters were systematically 
off topic. We kept being told that Canadians wanted to hear about 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17323"> 17323 </A></B>
<P>
the economy, work, jobs and job creation. But, surprise, the day 
after October 30,  the sovereignist project was within a hair's 
breadth of becoming a reality.
<P>
	A few days later, the federalist camp reacted hastily in the face 
of a potential victory by the yes side. In Verdun, we had the 
pleasure of a speech by the Prime Minister, which brought back 
memories. In 1980, on the eve of another referendum, another 
Prime Minister came to Quebec to make promises. The current 
Prime Minister was on the dais with him.
<P>
	On October 30, the federalist camp heaved a sigh of relief. The 
reality of the matter is something else, however. With their slim 
victory, the federalists no doubt consulted each other and decided 
to act. And what a reaction! I said before that this smacks of 
improvisation. Two committees were created here. But, all of a 
sudden, the Prime Minister himself announced the recognition of 
Quebec as a distinct society. To hell with the committees, he 
sidestepped his own creations and everybody else.
<P>
	The distinct society motion, as it stands, is nothing more than 
meaningless words. It is a smoke screen. In fact, it is only a motion 
of the House of Commons, which could be easily overturned at the 
whim of any federal government. There is nothing in the 
Constitution that recognizes Quebec as a distinct society. All this 
motion means is that, in the future, it will be possible to tell 
Quebecers you are distinct. Are you not happy? You are distinct. 
But giving Quebecers the means to act distinctly is out of the 
question. And it is even more unlikely that the Liberal government 
would try its hardest to have this distinctiveness recognized in the 
Constitution. Again, this would be too much to ask.
<P>
	But, to think of it, what else could we expect from a Prime 
Minister who himself said last September, in this House, that 
everybody knew that Quebec was distinct and, consequently, that it 
did not have to be enshrined in the Constitution. If this is how he 
reads last week's motion, then it is justified. If that is how he 
understands the motion he tabled last week, this motion is justified.
<P>
<B>(2025)</B>
<P>
	The Prime Minister would certainly need a history lesson. 
History shows that every time the federal government wants to do 
something for Quebecers, it waters down its promises. This is akin 
to using the same coffee grounds to make five or six pots; what 
remains at the end of this process is like dishwater. That is what the 
government is doing with this resolution. First Meech, then 
Charlottetown, and now the 1995 resolution. There is nothing left. 
Indeed, there is not much left. This merely encourages the 
legislative and executive branches of government to take note of 
the recognition that Quebec is a distinct society.
<P>
	Unlike some Liberal members, we see the past as important. 
There is a famous saying that what goes around, comes around. 
Quebecers know their history. They also know what they want. The 
Prime Minister's  motion will go down in history mostly as another 
insult to Quebecers' intelligence, as an attempt to convince them 
that a simple resolution would finally settle the issue.
<P>
	This government is forgetting something else. Quebec's motto is 
``Je me souviens''. On October 30, some Quebecers decided to give 
Canada a last chance. It was the last chance. Once again, they 
thought that Canada would recognize them as a people and give 
them the powers that go along with being a people. Unfortunately, 
they were once again in for a disappointment when they saw what 
was really being proposed: a resolution that sets us back even 
further.
<P>
	This resolution was put together in a mad rush because the Prime 
Minister knows full well that he will be questioned by the official 
opposition. While, in 1980, Quebecers were represented by 74 
Liberal members in the House of Commons, in 1995, it is quite a 
different story, since 53 Bloc members have been given the 
mandate by the people of Quebec to look after their interests. The 
Prime Minister knows full well that if he tries to delude Quebecers 
into believing that he is delivering the goods, we will be there to 
condemn him for it. The mandate we have been given by the people 
of Quebec was clear and it has become even clearer since October 
30.
<P>
	Where I come from, we have a saying that goes: ``Rude 
awakenings are to be expected on the morning after''. Never has 
the saying ever been so true as in the case of the aftermath of the 
October 30 referendum. At the beginning of my remarks, I 
indicated that I never expected to have to speak on such a 
meaningless thing, and I am sure that the people of my region 
agree.
<P>
	This is another history lesson that Quebecers are not about to 
forget. It is also a lesson for those who thought they would give a 
last chance to Canada. But by dint of remembering, the people of 
Quebec will take action. I have no doubt about that. One day soon 
we will start writing the history of the people of Quebec.
<P>
	The resolution put forward by the Prime Minister is tasteless, 
colourless and odourless. Anyone who believes that Quebecers are 
a people must reject it.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Reg Alcock (Winnipeg South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish to 
tell you that I am splitting my time with the member for 
Ottawa-Vanier.
<P>
	I have been torn as I thought through what I might say tonight on 
this resolution. I am profoundly saddened that I am standing here 
and talking on this issue at this time in our history. We have so 
many issues to deal with in this country. However we are once 
more drawn back into a debate that at its roots is not going to put 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17324"> 17324 </A></B>
<P>
bread on the table, is not going to do anything to alleviate poverty,  
is not going to create a job, is not going to enhance the capacity of 
people to work, to learn or to earn. It is a debate that if I understand 
what the members of the Bloc have been saying tonight is based on 
a constant bringing forward of a history that has not served them or 
the rest of Canada particularly well.
<P>
	What confuses me as I think about it is that shortly after I was 
elected to this Chamber I had several opportunities to travel into 
Quebec; one as a student in Jonquière. I spent some time there at 
the CEGEP studying French and meeting with the Bloc member for 
Jonquière who most hospitable. He took me around, showed me his 
constituency and introduced me to people there. We had wonderful 
discussions about what Canada needed to do to deal with the debt, 
with social programs and with all of the kinds of things that we talk 
about all across the country.
<P>
	Some time after that I had an opportunity as a member of the 
HRD committee to go into Montreal, Quebec City, Lévis and 
Rivière-du-Loup to talk to people and receive submissions, in 
particular, about unemployment insurance but really all of the 
social programs that were encompassed in that rather large review.
<P>
	Three members of the Bloc toured with us across Canada as part 
of that committee. We started in Vancouver and travelled right 
across the country. What struck me about that experience is that 
when we got away from the opening moments of the hearings, 
when the organized groups would come in and demonstrate, wave 
and shout and scream in Vancouver, in Toronto and in Montreal, 
and sat down with people to talk about what they were concerned 
about and what did they wanted to see the government do and what 
were the issues they wanted us to confront, I did not hear the word 
``Constitution'', I did not hear the word ``embarrassment'', I did 
not hear the word ``insulted''.
<P>
	I heard people talking about how we can help our kids get an 
education, how we can build skills, how can we find jobs. I heard 
people in Lévis and Rivière-du-Loup talking about being very 
concerned about their future and about the fact that their children 
were having to move out of town to find work. I heard unilingual 
French people saying the same things in those communities as 
unilingual English people were saying in Saskatchewan, Alberta 
and in my own province of Manitoba.
<P>
	I do not mean to make light of what occurred. Any time 50 per 
cent of any area votes to leave a country that is as strong and 
wonderful as Canada, there is a problem.
<P>
	I have talked about this with members of the Bloc. Lots of 
conversations go on in this House, some of them across the floor 
like tonight. I have a conversation two or three times a week in the 
gymnasium with the member for Quebec-Est. We talk about what 
is at the root of the concerns that is driving people in Quebec to 
want to  leave Canada. I have had many long talks with the member 
for Mercier about her views of social programs in Canada or in 
Quebec. Frankly they are very consistent with my views of social 
programs in Quebec. To try to understand what is driving this 
desire to break up this country is something that has been very 
difficult for me.
<P>
	I want to share with the members of the Bloc something that I 
hope will help their understanding of the feelings in other parts of 
Canada about this issue. When the Meech Lake accord failed to 
pass the Manitoba legislature, I was the House leader for the 
opposition. When the constitutional amendment was brought to 
Manitoba, there was a very detailed and thorough public 
examination of the proposals.
<P>
<B>(2035)</B>
<P>
	A committee was struck, with representatives from all three 
parties in the legislature. That committee travelled all over 
Manitoba. Committee members went to Indian reserves in the 
northern part of the province. They went to small rural 
communities in the north, the south, the east and the west and they 
spent many days in the city of Winnipeg, allowing Manitobans to 
come forward and speak to them about their feelings on the Meech 
Lake accord.
<P>
	As a result, Manitoba put forward some amendments to the 
accord as it was then struck. When I hear the language used by 
previous speakers here about how people did not respect Quebec 
and how that was an insult to Quebec, I want to tell them that 
subject never came up in these hearings.
<P>
	The Meech Lake accord says in subsection (2)(i):
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Constitution of Canada shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(b) The recognition that Quebec constitutes within Canada a distinct society.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(3) The role of the legislature and Government of Quebec to preserve and 
promote the distinct identity of Quebec-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That was what the Meech Lake accord said if I understood the 
members opposite correctly.
<P>
	After holding hearings all over the province, after researching it, 
considering it, debating it, this is how the three parties in the 
Manitoba legislature said the clause should read:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Constitution of Canada shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with 
the recognition that the following constitute fundamental characteristics of 
Canada:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(d) Quebec constitutes within Canada a distinct society;</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In the Meech Lake accord the recognition is that Quebec 
constitutes within Canada a distinct society. The recommendation 
of all parties of the province of Manitoba was that Quebec 
constitutes within Canada a distinct society.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17325"> 17325 </A></B>
<P>
	My province has recognized and supported that fact since 1990. 
This resolution, which calls on the House to recognize that Quebec 
is a distinct society within Canada, is simply consistent and 
affirms the very statements that the member holds up as an 
example of the things that Quebec wanted. It is the very thing that 
the three parties in the legislature and the people of Manitoba were 
prepared to support and the very thing that the Prime Minister asks 
us to support now.
<P>
	When I look at the role we have as legislators, there are six 
practical things we do. We pass, amend or rescind legislation. We 
deal with expenditure or the withholding of expenditure, the 
cutting of expenditure. We regulate. However, there is an 
intangible thing we are called on to do in this Chamber and that is 
provide leadership.
<P>
	It is time we began to talk about not how we drive this country 
apart, but how we pull it together, how we collectively provide 
some leadership that will improve the lives of people in this 
country, not harm them.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Mauril Bélanger (Ottawa-Vanier, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my speech this evening is entitled <I>An open letter to my Quebec 
kissing cousins</I>. They know who they are.
<P>
	First, I want to thank these cousins for the discussions we had 
during the referendum campaign. One of them was in charge of the 
yes side in her community, in the lower St. Lawrence region. We 
had a brief conversation, two days before the referendum, in a very 
serene and pleasant atmosphere.
<P>
	The other two cousins had me over for dinner, in a Montreal 
suburb, on a stormy fall evening. Inside, there was also a storm 
raging. It was a storm of ideas, concepts, rebuttals and assertions. 
In short, it was a very nice evening, and I thank them.
<P>
	That evening, we discussed the Constitutional Act of 1982, the 
Meech Lake accord, as well as issues such as overlap, duplication, 
immigration, and French in North America, Canada and Quebec. 
Of course, we also talked about the distinct society.
<P>
<B>(2040)</B>
<P>
	Today, I find myself participating in a debate revived last 
Wednesday by the Prime Minister and the Leader of the 
Opposition. That day, I listened very carefully to the speech made 
by the opposition leader. If I do not call him by name, dear cousins, 
it is not out of disrespect, but because the rules and the tradition of 
this House prevent me from doing so.
<P>
	As I said, I listened carefully to what he had to say. Several of his 
statements are so skilfully crafted that you have to stop and think 
for a minute or two to find out what he means, especially when he 
is talking about the Constitutional Act of 1982. Here are some 
quotes from the speech he made. ``One of the things the 1982  
Constitution effectively introduced into Canada and Quebec's legal 
and political landscape was the notion of a single country, a 
Canadian nation-this was a first.''
<P>
	Later on, he added: ``This was the first time constitutional and 
legal texts talked about Canada as a single nation, the nation of 
Canada. The corollary, needless to say, was that Quebecers found 
their existence as a people being denied, implicitly, if not 
explicitly.''
<P>
	Finally, he said, and I am still quoting: ``-but it never occurred 
to me that, someday, a democratic Canada, English Canada, a 
nation that is open, tolerant and respectful of individual rights, 
could actually rely on its weight to crush Quebec's wish, tear up the 
Constitution agreed upon by our forefathers in 1867 and replace it 
with another constitution that was not recognized by Quebec but 
imposed on Quebec, a constitution repudiated-'' I could go on and 
on.
<P>
	I could spend hours proving that the Constitution was not 
replaced or torn up, that not all Quebecers repudiated this 
Constitutional Act, as the Leader of the Opposition would have you 
believe. But by doing this, I would be entering into an argument 
with some politicians. For now, I would rather talk to my cousins.
<P>
	In the face of such a condemnation of what happened in 1982, I 
thought it was time for me to reread the Constitution Act, 1982, 
which I did. I looked everywhere to find some hint of the crushing 
he talked about-which is something some people would like to 
make a part of the historical bagage of Quebecers-but I could not 
find it.
<P>
	I looked everywhere to find where the existence of Quebecers as 
a people was denied implicitly or explicitly, with the same result. It 
was nowhere to be found.
<P>
	I looked everywhere to find the quote that says that English 
Canada-and I will come back to this irritating expression a little 
later on-relied on its weight to crush Quebec's wish. Again, I 
could not find it.
<P>
	So we have every reason to wonder, Mr. Speaker and dear 
cousins, if the intent of these remarks was not to perpetuate and to 
reinforce a myth that has been created and spread by separatist 
forces.
<P>
	Dear cousins, I have a question for you. What bothers you in the 
Constitution Act, 1982? Is it the entrenchment in the Constitution 
of your fundamental freedoms, such as freedom of conscience and 
religion, freedom of thought, belief, opinion and expression, 
including freedom of the press and other communications media? I 
do not think so.
<P>
	Is it freedom of peaceful assembly? I do not think so either. 
Freedom of association? I doubt it. Is it the entrenchment of your 
democratic rights, your mobility rights or your legal rights? I do 
not think so. To this day, I have not met one Canadian, or one 
Quebecer for that matter, who is against these rights.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17326"> 17326 </A></B>
<P>
	Is it then the entrenchment in the Constitution of French and 
English as the official languages of our country? Does it bother 
you so much? Or is it the inclusion in the Constitution of the 
concepts of equalization and regional disparity, two typically 
Canadian concepts that continue to serve Quebec well?
<P>
	I still fail to see what is the cause of this national humiliation the 
advocates of independence have talked so much about. Referring to 
the points that I just mentioned, how has Quebec's wish been 
crushed?
<P>
	Dear cousins, on the autumn evening when we met, I really 
appreciated our ability to talk frankly, directly and with mutual 
respect. So I ask you to think carefully and as objectively as 
possible about the following question: what bothers you personally 
about the Constitution Act, 1982?
<P>
<B>(2045)</B>
<P>
	There is something else I would like to say, and I referred to this 
earlier. The term English Canada, which Bloc members and their 
leader keep using these days in a poorly disguised attempt to keep 
erecting walls between Canadians, crops up at least a dozen times 
in the speech made last Wednesday by the Leader of the 
Opposition.
<P>
	Well, I want to ask you people in the Bloc who are constantly 
complaining, loud and clear, about the general lack of 
understanding for Quebec society, to please stop ignoring a million 
French Canadians who do not live in Quebec. We would appreciate 
some respect.
<P>
	In fact, the term is not accurate since New Brunswick is 
officially bilingual, probably another humiliating result of the 
Constitution Act, 1982. The Bloc likes to speak in separatist terms, 
and it is pretty obvious why. I hope you, my cousins, are not fooled. 
You know, in northern and eastern Ontario, there are a lot of French 
Canadians, including your own cousins. Some day, we should 
discuss how certain expressions evolved and why, hardly a 
generation ago, we were all French Canadians, and today, we are 
Franco-Ontarians, Québécois, Acadians, Fransasquois and so forth.
<P>
	Maybe we should invent new hyphens, new links, with all due 
respect for the late John Diefenbaker. I agree, we are all Canadians. 
But as such, we all have one or more links elsewhere. Some are 
new Canadians, others are English or French Canadians. In this 
great country with a strong tradition of tolerance and openness, 
there is room for everyone, even communities that form a distinct 
society.
<P>
	When you think about it, the hyphen is a symbol that seems 
tailor-made for Canada. Are we not one of the hyphens or links 
between France and the United Kingdom, between Europe and the 
United States of America? We see those links throughout our 
history, between Lower Canada and Upper Canada and even in the 
Act of Union.
<P>
	The beauty of the hyphen is that it manages to link two entities 
that are sometimes entirely distinct. Is this not the very essence of 
Canada? Squaring the circle, duality in unity? My dear cousins, 
you will agree this would be an interesting subject for our next 
meeting. Meanwhile, let this House recognize the distinct identity 
of Quebec society by voting for the motion presented by the Prime 
Minister, a motion which, at the very least, is a step in the right 
direction. That being said, my dear cousins, I remain, yours 
sincerely.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in opposition to Motion No. 26, which 
is the motion put forward in the House by the Prime Minister. I will 
oppose the motion unless it is amended, as was suggested by my 
leader, the hon. member for Calgary Southwest.
<P>
	I am concerned that the federal government has used closure to 
limit debate on something as important as how Canada functions, 
how we respect and treat one another, and whether or not the 
principle of distinct society is a worthwhile course for us to follow 
as a nation.
<P>
	The whole idea of using closure, or time allocation, has been 
addressed many times in the House. I will not condemn it at length. 
I will just repeat that I believe it is wrong. I know that members 
opposite, when they sat in opposition, declared that it was wrong. 
The hon. member for Kingston and the Islands called it morally 
wicked if the Mulroney government introduced time allocation and 
closure. Yet the Liberal government has introduced this procedure 
far more often than the Conservatives did under Mulroney. The 
Liberals do not even bat an eye. They think there is nothing wrong 
with limiting debate on important issues that do not need to be dealt 
with in an emergency when the national good is at stake.
<P>
	When we talk about distinct society it brings back memories. I 
first remember hearing this phrase discussed in the debate on the 
Meech Lake accord. Perhaps it was coined before that, but I was 
not aware of the phrase until the Meech Lake debate. Subsequently, 
it was a bone of contention when the Charlottetown accord was put 
forward and voted on in a national referendum in Canada and 
defeated.
<P>
<B>(2050 )</B>
<P>
	It is interesting that the reason the Meech Lake accord never did 
pass is because of a member who sits in our midst. While there was 
opposition to the Meech Lake accord in the province of 
Newfoundland with its premier and there was resistance in the 
province of Manitoba with the government there, the one member 
at that time in the Manitoba legislature who probably had more 
impact on bringing down the Meech Lake accord than any other 
Canadian was the hon. member for Churchill, who now sits in this 
House.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17327"> 17327 </A></B>
<P>
	It is interesting that the member for Churchill, in recognizing 
other problems the aboriginal people of Canada face, has called 
a sacred assembly. As a people they are doing some soul 
searching. They are even looking for inspiration from higher 
powers than themselves to solve problems facing the aboriginal 
people.
<P>
	Maybe if we as a nation started to reflect on the one we 
recognize in our Constitution as the supreme authority, perhaps we 
would be better off than spending all this time trying to confer 
special privileges, rights, or distinct society, whatever that may 
mean, on a group of individuals. The Constitution calls upon us to 
recognize the supremacy of God. If we have the correct 
interpretation of how this almighty person looks upon the world, he 
looks upon us with the same eyes regardless of our language, our 
race, or our culture. I believe we are all equal before him. We are 
all special, but certainly I do not expect he would suggest that any 
of us are distinct or in some way deserve privileges the rest of us do 
not.
<P>
	I want to talk a little about why I am concerned about the phrase 
distinct society. I am a little concerned about how it may be 
interpreted in the future. Quite frankly, I do not trust the Liberal 
government when they propose that this really does not mean 
anything.
<P>
	I am reminded of a Liberal politician in the past who when he 
spoke in western Canada would not speak in glowing terms of the 
national energy program. This subject seldom came up because this 
Liberal, being a fairly knowledgeable and experienced politician, 
realized that western Canadians were aware that the national 
energy program had siphoned billions of dollars out of the western 
Canadian economy and into the federal treasury and the same 
proportional benefits were not returned to the people who owned 
the natural resource. Natural resources of course are a provincial 
jurisdiction.
<P>
	This same experienced Liberal politician would go into Atlantic 
Canada, far away from the west, and expound on the virtues of the 
national energy program. I saw this on television one day. The 
wonderful thing about television is that sometimes it captures the 
things you say and it is recorded and broadcast in other parts of the 
country.
<P>
	I realize that we have to be careful that we are consistent with 
our message in all parts of Canada when we are dealing with an 
issue, whether it be the national energy program or whether it be 
distinct society.
<P>
	I have the uncanny feeling that when we are talking about 
distinct society the message being conveyed to the province of 
Quebec is not the same message that is being conveyed to other 
parts of Canada. The message to Quebec is that this will meet their 
aspirations. This somehow will confer on them some feeling of 
being a nation, meet demands that have been made by the 
separatists. Somehow these demands will be met and  their feelings 
of nationalism will be appeased by recognizing them as a distinct 
society.
<P>
	Then in the rest of the country the message is a bit different: 
Distinct society does not really mean anything, it is just an 
acknowledgement of something that already exists; it is no big 
deal, nothing to be worried about, and it might keep the country 
together.
<P>
	I doubt that very much. It does not seem to make sense to me that 
you can convey one message to Canadian citizens in the province 
of Quebec and another message outside of the province. Something 
does not fit. Rather than question the message, we have to question 
the messenger. I do not think they are dealing a fair hand to 
Canadians when they describe the distinct society.
<P>
	We really have to be concerned about how this term distinct 
society will be interpreted in the future. We can sit in this House 
and the government and the Prime Minister can say distinct society 
means this or that. But we know this term will be interpreted in the 
future by the courts and by future governments, so we have to be 
concerned about how distinct society is defined.
<P>
<B>(2055)</B>
<P>
	Actually I cannot find any place in Motion No. 26 or in any other 
information that tells us exactly what distinct society means in this 
case. We are told it includes the French-speaking majority. It does 
not say anything about any other Quebecers. We are told the House 
will be guided by this distinct society phrase. We are told the House 
will encourage all components of the legislative and executive 
branches of government to take note of this recognition and be 
guided in their conduct accordingly.
<P>
	To me that sounds like a blank cheque. That is saying let us adopt 
the phrase ``distinct society'', hang it over the door of Quebec, and 
then we will try to pursue it with diligence and all our effort 
without knowing really what it means. We will interpret that in the 
future. We will let future politicians and future governments, 
perhaps even separatist governments, define the phrase distinct 
society for us. Just trust us, it will work out all right, that is what 
they are saying.
<P>
	That concerns me very much as a Canadian, because I realize 
that when we are talking about the future of our country we are not 
talking about today only. We are not even talking about the people 
who make the decisions in this House and in the legislative 
assemblies of the provinces across the land. We are talking about 
the decisions that will be made in the future by parliamentarians 
and by people in the various legislatures, including possibly a 
separatist government in the province of Quebec.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17328"> 17328 </A></B>
<P>
	In conclusion, I want to deal with this whole idea of conferring 
special status or rights on any group of society. Why would we do 
that? There are three reasons we might do that. The first reason is 
because these people  are inferior to us and they need some kind of 
assistance. I do not accept that for the province of Quebec. I see 
them as my equals. Secondly, we can say that they are superior and 
they deserve some special status. I do not accept that either. I see 
them as my equals. Thirdly, we could say that because some of 
their ancestors were here before some of our ancestors they deserve 
a higher rung on the ladder. I do not accept that. Wherever we come 
from, we should all be treated equally. None of us should have any 
special status conferred upon us. Therefore, unless we accept the 
Reform amendments I cannot support the motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate 
the opportunity to speak to Motion No. 26 today, as it will have a 
profound impact on the future of our country if it is adopted.
<P>
	Let me state my position quite clearly. As a Reformer, as an 
Albertan, as a Canadian, and as someone who considers Canada as 
home, I cannot support distinct society for any province. I cannot 
support elevating one province over another, and I am not prepared 
to separate the haves from the have nots. I believe in equality and 
fairness for every man, woman, and child in this country regardless 
of their race, colour, creed, origin, or abilities.
<P>
	To say that this motion is ill-conceived is a euphemism of the 
first order. This motion is an unmitigated disaster, an affront to the 
House, a disgrace to the country, and misrepresents all Canada 
stands for.
<P>
	It is our duty today to govern this country with democracy, 
freedom, and equality as our guiding lights as we build on the past 
and lay the groundwork for the future generations. We have to be 
accountable for our actions today, just as those in the past have 
been judged by history for their actions.
<P>
	There have been defining moments in history that were hailed as 
great achievements, yet history found them to be shallow and 
empty gestures that in hindsight would have best been left undone. 
I think of 1938, when Mr. Chamberlain promised us peace in our 
time as he waved a document that was, as I called it, a one-sided 
agreement. One year later, his proclamation for peace was trampled 
under the jackboots of an army that marched across Europe.
<P>
<B>(2100 )</B>
<P>
	In 1982 prime minister of the day proclaimed a new Constitution 
for this country that he said would last for 1,000 years. But that 
Constitution did not have the signature of Quebec, and like Mr. 
Chamberlain's declaration for peace in 1938, this Constitution was 
a one sided agreement.
<P>
	I hear the historians of tomorrow calling this motion a one sided 
agreement that will not stand 1,000 years and will not even buy 
peace in our time. Today we are debating a motion which the 
government promises will bring peace and harmony to the country. 
As in 1938, the  motivation for this motion is appeasement, not 
resolution. This is an offer to Quebec, not an agreement with 
Quebec.
<P>
	Let us look at the proposed motion. The government wants the 
House to affirm a distinct society in the province of Quebec. 
Distinct society is not defined. Those who have demanded 
recognition as a distinct society in these last few years have not 
demanded recognition as a medal to be worn with pride but as a 
lever to exert more power, more advantage and to receive 
preferential treatment at the expense of the rest of Canada. Let us 
not lose sight of that fact.
<P>
	The government mistakenly believes that talking about an issue, 
making statements about an issue, is equivalent to resolving the 
issue. Our debate today is a prefect example of that hypocrisy. In 
passing this motion the Prime Minister believes he will have 
achieved peace in our time. We know today Quebec is not satisfied. 
We know today the leaders of the separatist movement in Quebec 
will brush this gesture aside and march on.
<P>
	What faith do we have today that this agreement will buy peace 
within Canada, harmony within Canada and build the structure for 
a united Canada while the forces of separation organize and 
marshal their resources for another assault on the unity of the 
country? We have none.
<P>
	Alberta and British Columbia have been vocal over the years in 
their demand for change within this united federation, but they 
have voiced their concerns in a true and democratic way of working 
in a positive manner to achieve change. Both of these provinces are 
designated as have provinces within the equalization formula. Both 
of these provinces have contributed billions over the last few 
decades to the promotion and protection of this Confederation 
while they continue to live up to their commitments without 
demands that they receive the benefits equal to their contribution to 
the country.
<P>
	If we are to have peace we need goodwill and commitment by 
the parties involved, not a simple, frivolous motion debated in the 
House produced at the whim of the government, all in the false 
hope that one single motion is a panacea to several decades of 
dissent.
<P>
	The Reform Party has proposed three simple amendments to this 
motion to give it strength and focus. First, the government is asking 
that we recognize Quebec as a distinct society. We as Reformers 
say that is fine provided we recognize this is not to be used as a 
lever for more power and privilege at the expense of other 
provinces. Surely our amendment confirms the very heart of any 
federation, any family and any society that wants to survive today: 
equality for all.
<P>
<B>(2105 )</B>
<P>
	Second, we recognize the French speaking majority, culture and 
legal traditions in Quebec. They are a fact of life which exist each 
day. However, we also recognize the  great promise of the new 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17329"> 17329 </A></B>
<P>
world which guarantees equality for all regardless of who we are, 
what we are and where we came from.
<P>
	Third, while we undertake to be guided by the reality of a 
distinct society and recognize that fact, we also undertake to be 
guided by the reality and recognize that this nation is one nation, 
from sea to shining sea.
<P>
	Changes to the Constitution and the devolution of federal powers 
is a manageable process, but it is being managed in a most 
disgraceful manner by the Liberal government. The Reform Party 
knows that Canada can work together, will work together and, with 
real leadership in the country, will stay together. Leadership 
requires vision and a clear statement of the way to the promised 
land.
<P>
	In the face of the challenge to break up the country the Reform 
Party has responded with a call to action with a plan and a program. 
A strong and proud Canada will move forward only when the 
leadership of this great nation articulates a clear vision for the 
country which is created by, endorsed by and supported by the large 
majority of Canadians and provinces.
<P>
	This motion, in the way it is presented, is not the answer.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a great 
pleasure to enter the debate on Motion No. 26, which would 
recognize Quebec as a distinct society.
<P>
	As we listen to the opposition parties we are wondering just what 
we are doing here. A distinct society will not cause the price of 
gasoline to go up. It will not affect our paycheques. It will have 
little or no effect on the lives of Canadians.
<P>
	I have taken the opportunity to do a mailing to the constituents of 
Durham. I am happy to say that a good many of them are 
responding on how they feel about this issue. Their main concern is 
they want to keep the country united and strong. However, they 
have limitations. They do not think it should be done at any price. 
They are concerned that we respect the civil rights of all people in 
Canada. This motion will not inhibit the civil rights of individuals 
within the province of Quebec.
<P>
	People are prepared to recognize each other as being distinct. 
However, it is an unusual concept for a society to recognize one 
element as being distinct. Clearly that means the other elements 
must also be distinct. There is a polarization of understanding. I 
believe that is healthy. It is useful within our system.
<P>
	As I was coming to the House tonight I thought about all the 
debates and arguments caused by these two words in the last two or 
three decades. I wondered what would happen if we all collectively 
went to bed tonight and got amnesia. We would forget about our 
past. We would forget about our history. We would forget about we 
were doing when we lived together.
<P>
<B>(2110 )</B>
<P>
	What would happen when we woke up tomorrow morning? We 
would find that we still have this huge country, the second largest 
nation in the world. We would discover that within that nation there 
were different linguistic groups: some French, some English, some 
others.
<P>
	We would find that over a certain period of time they had entered 
into agreements with each other, individuals. That is all 
government is about, contracts and agreements between people.
<P>
	We would discover that we had built a caring society, that we had 
developed medicare systems, unemployment insurance systems, 
pensions for our elderly. We had built all of these things, a social 
fabric, and we called it Canada.
<P>
	We also did some other things. We also borrowed a lot of money 
to pay for some of these social programs in periods when our 
revenues could not sustain them. We would discover as we opened 
the books that we had huge debts; some of them federal, many of 
them provincial, but all culminated in a huge bill we all had to pay.
<P>
	Having looked at these aspects, we would also see we had 
inherited tremendous resources. We had inherited the forests, the 
mines, the rivers. We had inherited a country of mountains, of 
lakes, from sea to sea to sea, and that we all together shared this 
great nation.
<P>
	It seems to me we would be hard pressed to discover what we did 
not like about each other. We would be quite respectful with each 
other and humble to live in such a country. We would discover we 
were willing to respect the cultural integrity of the numerous 
groups that live within that country; that our objectives were not to 
overpower or overwhelm another culture but to co-exist.
<P>
	I am sure we would look at the calendar and would see we were 
approaching the 21st century. We would look at our debts and we 
would look at our resources and we would try to see how we can 
live together and work together as we approach the 21st century. I 
am sure we would find a solution for that.
<P>
	The other side of the coin is we do not have amnesia and so what 
have we forgot? We probably forgot the negative parts of our 
history. We forgot about the Plains of Abraham. We forgot many 
other aspects about the existence of Canada today. We probably 
forgot about some of the symbols we display so proudly, which are 
really symbols of a bygone day. They are symbols of our heritage, 
and not something we want to get rid of; we want to evolve as a 
nation.
<P>
	It is clear to me as I travel throughout the country that people no 
longer understand what the governor general stands for or 
represents. Ever since being elected to this place, one of the things I 
enjoy doing, at least initially, is going around to our high schools 
and presenting the governor general's award. The governor 
general's award is presented to the highest scholastic student in a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17330"> 17330 </A></B>
<P>
secondary school each year. I have many high schools in riding and 
I do many of these events.
<P>
	When I am handing out that award I ask those people to name the 
governor general. In two years none of these academics has been 
able to name the governor general. If our institutions of 
government have become so irrelevant maybe they should be 
changed.
<P>
	If we want to enter into and renew our partnership links, both of 
these cultures have to adjust for each other. I question some of my 
brethren in other parts of the country who want to cling to the status 
quo, our symbols of the past.
<P>
<B>(2115)</B>
<P>
	Two days ago I was surprised to hear my Reform colleagues 
arguing about changing the coat of arms of Canada in such a way 
that it states we want to work toward a better country. Can we 
imagine wanting to stick to the status quo to the point where we 
could not see that simple change as being useful? I would like to 
change a lot of other things in the country. I know many people 
respect the monarchy. Indeed that is part of our past and is 
something we cannot erase.
<P>
	It is time to change some of the symbols of Canada. I have no 
problem with our currency reflecting distinctly Canadian symbols.
<P>
	It was interesting to watch the referendum in Quebec. It was my 
privilege to be at the Montreal rally and see the oui signs which 
showed that side of the loonie depicting the Canadian loon. I ask 
some of my colleagues in the House whether that tells us 
something. Does it not tell us that if we want to evolve as a country 
we clearly we have to evolve together?
<P>
	It would be very good if we could all get collective amnesia, put 
to one side some of the things in our past that we are not happy with 
and recognize the true strength and wealth of the country. Basically 
we should get along together. We have many problems. Our deficit 
is a tremendous burden. It is much like having a huge mortgage in a 
marriage and not being able to afford a divorce.
<P>
	The people out there should remember that we are not talking 
about giving away the farm. There is very little expense, but the 
bottom line is that it is time to change our nation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Geoff Regan (Halifax West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise this evening to speak to the resolution which 
recognizes that Quebec is a distinct society because of its majority 
French language, its culture and its civil code legal system.
<P>
	A month or so ago our country was brought to a precipice by the 
referendum in Quebec. As I campaigned in Quebec during the 
referendum, as I talked to people  in Quebec and thought about 
what was happening there, it was frightening that we had failed to 
understand each other. People outside Quebec did not have a good 
understanding of the concerns of Quebecers, how sincere they were 
in their concerns about the preservation of their language and 
culture within this huge sea of English that is North America. With 
the huge English area surrounding Quebec, including the U.S. and 
the rest of Canada, Quebecers have a very real concern about it.
<P>
	I found a lack of understanding among some francophone 
Quebecers of the point of view of people outside Quebec and of 
their love for Quebec. There was a misunderstanding among them 
of how the rest of Canada would react to a yes vote in Quebec. The 
consequences would have been severe for all of us. Certainly there 
was a failure among Bloc members to recognize that.
<P>
	This reminds me of the fact that we almost lost a great country.
<P>
<B>(2120)</B>
<P>
	We must remember that Canada's position in the world is a very 
important one. It is one that is widely respected. Why is that? We 
are respected as a peacemaker and a peacekeeper around the world. 
We are respected because we provide an example to the world of 
living peacefully with differences. It is a great example. We are 
respected widely for our exercise of the art of Canadian 
compromise.
<P>
	A few weeks ago I was watching a CBC television program 
during which Allison Smith was interviewing Israeli prize winning 
author Amos Oz. It was interesting to hear him talk about his work. 
His novels have always tried to bring together the two sides, the 
Palestinians and the Israelis.
<P>
	He was talking about the need for compromise and the need to 
work out solutions in that country. He talked about the example of 
the Israelis and the Palestinians. He pointed out that on the one 
hand the Israelis had always looked upon the land in the area of the 
West Bank as being very important to their nation and a very 
important part of themselves. It is essential to them to have that 
land for their country. On the other hand the Palestinians look at 
that land as being essential to their nation, an essential part of 
themselves.
<P>
	As he pointed out often, we feel we have a misunderstanding but 
if we talk enough we can work out the problem. However there was 
not a lack of understanding on the two sides. There was an 
understanding but the problem was that they both wanted the same 
thing. There was an impasse and a conflict.
<P>
	As he also pointed out, when people realize there is that kind of 
conflict eventually they come to the realization that the only 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17331"> 17331 </A></B>
<P>
logical, rational response is a  compromise. His phrase was that 
compromise is life and life is compromise.
<P>
	Surely any of us who is married will understand that is true. Life 
is full of compromises. Certainly a marriage is made up of 
compromises. How can we have one without compromise? It is a 
very important part of a healthy marriage. Compromise is an 
important part of living with differences, as is all of life.
<P>
	We have to recognize that we have different points of view in the 
country and that we have to find compromise between those points 
of view.
<P>
	Some people have the idea that the country is made up of two 
founding linguistic groups. We also have the point of view on the 
other side that suggests that we are 10 equal founding provinces. 
These are two different points of view. Somewhere in the middle 
we have to find some common ground.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We have the history of the Maritimes. In 1867, the two big 
provinces, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, joined with Quebec 
and Ontario in the Confederation. At that time, Nova Scotia and 
New Brunswick had very powerful economies, stronger than 
Ontario and Quebec. Obviously, from our point of view, in Nova 
Scotia for instance, the agreement involved equal provinces, equal 
partners.
<P>
	But there must be an understanding of the historical links 
between Lower and Upper Canada, Ontario and Quebec, with their 
two main language groups. Those groups joined forces to create 
this country. The two are part of one reality. Neither one nor the 
other represents reality; the two together do. But there are different 
understandings of what this country is, and it is difficult sometimes 
for those who understand things one way to understand the other 
point of view.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I want to talk for a moment about the word distinct which was 
dealt with in the resolution. According to the definition in <I>The 
Concise Oxford Dictionary</I> it is an adjective and has three different 
meanings:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><i>1</i> a not identical; separate; individual. <i>b</i> different in kind or quality; unlike. <i>2</i> a 
clearly perceptible; plain. <i>b</i> clearly understandable; definite. <i>3</i> unmistakable, 
decided.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	A lot of francophones do not realize that in English the word 
distinct is often thought of in terms of the word distinguished, 
which suggests some sort of superiority or a heightened level. 
When we talk about a distinguished person, it is a person who has 
achieved a high level in life. In the past that has created a problem 
in Canada.
<P>
<B>(2125)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The difficulty with defining the word ``distinct'' is to make both 
sides, anglophones and francophones, see that  it is used differently 
in both languages. That was a problem I encountered when I visited 
Quebec. I was talking with some students at Saint-Jovite and a girl 
asked me ``Why do the anglophones not look up the definition of 
the word &quot;distinct'' in a French dictionary. In French, it means 
``different''; there is absolutely no suggestion of superiority''.
<P>
	But back in Nova Scotia, in my riding of Halifax West, when I 
talk to the people from down home, they ask ``Why will the 
francophones not consider the definition and meaning of the word 
``distinct'', because it has a different meaning in English?''
<P>
	You can see that it is hard to see the other side's point of view, or 
for them to see ours. It is always hard. The answer is not to separate 
but to communicate and find a compromise.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Whenever we have an impasse or a deadlock the only solution is 
a compromise. In the measures we brought forward this week is a 
compromise. For example, we know that Quebec wanted a veto for 
itself over constitutional change. We are providing in the system of 
how we govern the federal government's approach to the matter a 
veto to four regions, not just to Quebec. We also recognized in the 
resolution that Quebec is a distinct society because of its culture, 
its language and its civil code. This is an important compromise for 
the country. Together they form an important compromise position 
that will help us bridge toward the constitutional conference in 
1997.
<P>
	This is not a constitutional change. Constitutional change is not 
precluded or prevented by these measures. It will be up to those 
who meet at the conference in 1997 whether or not they wish to 
make future changes to the Constitution. That is left to the future 
for now.
<P>
	People in my area are saying: ``Let's deal with it quickly. Let's 
deal with it in a nice, clean manner and set it aside for now so we 
can focus on the real problems of the country''.
<P>
	Is Quebec distinct? If Quebec were to separate it would be as 
distinct as Mexico from the other provinces of Canada. It has a 
different language and a different culture in many ways, not in 
every way, from the rest of Canada. The majority language there is 
different. We cannot say that about any other province. It is clearly 
distinct in that way.
<P>
	Does this make Quebec superior? No. Does it recognize and 
celebrate our differences? Yes, it does.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Terrebonne, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I, like 
my colleagues in the Bloc Quebecois, am pleased to rise in the 
House today to speak on the motion to recognize the distinct nature 
of Quebec society.
<P>
	Before speaking on the motion, as such, I would like to refer to a 
short passage from the <I>Practical Guide to Private Members' 
Business</I>, which defines a motion. It says that the effect desired is 
the first consideration in deciding between a bill and a motion, that 
in passing a motion-as is the case here- stating a resolution, the 
House expresses a wish without committing the government to a 
particular measure or direction.
<P>
	A wish is expressed, which does not commit the government to a 
particular measure or direction. It is important to remember that 
this is what the motion is directed at. The guide goes on to say that, 
on the other hand, a bill passed by Parliament may have major 
implications for both the government and the public.
<P>
	But there is no cause for anxiety. This is not a bill, it is a motion, 
that is, a wish that does not commit the government to a particular 
measure or direction, in other words, it does not amount to much.
<P>
	I would also point out that, in this House, a motion was passed 
last December 13, which reads as follows: ``That, in the opinion of 
this House, the government should officially recognize the 
historical contribution of the patriotes of Lower Canada and the 
Reformers of Upper Canada to the establishment of a system of 
responsible democratic government''.
<P>
<B>(2130)</B>
<P>
	This motion was passed on December 13. What action has been 
taken to implement this motion since? None, none whatsoever, 
because it was idle talk that did not commit the government to 
anything.
<P>
	Let me remind you that a motion recognizing hockey as our 
national winter sport and lacrosse as our national summer sport was 
also passed. What action has been taken since? The Canadian 
lacrosse team's budget was eliminated. Completely. What good is a 
motion? It does not mean a thing.
<P>
	Besides being meaningless, the motion is contradictory to begin 
with, because it reads, and I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That-the House recognize that Quebec's distinct society includes its 
French-speaking majority, unique culture and civil law tradition;</BLOCKQUOTE>
	``Unique culture''. Just this afternoon, my hon. colleague from 
Rimouski-Témiscouata asked the Primer Minister the following 
question:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister. Yesterday, government 
members of the heritage committee maintained that there was no such thing as a 
Quebec culture-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Now this motion says that we in Quebec have a unique culture. 
Unique means that it is exclusive to Quebec, if I am not mistaken.
<P>
	Yet government members maintained that there was no Quebec 
culture, only one great big Canadian culture. It seems to me that 
their position flies in the face of the motion these same members 
are about to vote on.
<P>
	And what was the Prime Minister's answer?
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Mr. Speaker, there is a French culture in Canada, and it is a Canadian culture.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	There is only one culture in Canada: the Canadian culture. That 
is what the Prime Minister said. On the other hand, the motion 
tabled by the Prime Minister himself, seconded by his Deputy 
Prime Minister, recognizes that there is a unique culture in Quebec. 
It reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That-the House encourage all components of the legislative and executive 
branches of government to take note-</BLOCKQUOTE>
-it does not say much, ``to take note''-
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-of this recognition and be guided in their conduct accordingly.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	What did the Prime Minister do this afternoon? Just the opposite. 
The opposite of what? The opposite of what a meaningless motion 
says to do. Is there any doubt about that? I will let you be the judge 
of that, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	Yet, during the referendum campaign, the Primer Minister 
repeated time and time again that he would positively not address 
constitutional issues, but deal with the real problems instead, 
namely job creation and deficit reduction. How did we end up 
debating this motion then? Because they were afraid. They looked 
at the polls and realized that they were losing ground. Faced with 
rising support for the yes side in opinion polls toward the end of the 
campaign and with the possibility of losing the referendum, the 
Prime Minister suddenly changed his mind. He set up a 
smoke-and-mirrors operation aimed at convincing the people of 
Quebec that the federal government was committed to making 
major changes to the current federal system after a hypothetical no.
<P>
	The fact that this strategy was improvised from beginning to end 
was, of course, reflected in the Canadian Prime Minister's 
ambiguous and meaningless comments in the last days of the 
referendum campaign. On October 24 in Verdun, he said, and I 
quote: ``Quebecers want Quebec to be recognized within Canada as 
a distinct society by virtue of its language, culture and institutions. 
I have said it before and I say it again, I agree''. Yet, he tells us 
today that there is only one culture in Canada, although his motion 
says that Quebec has a distinct culture. No matter, he has a right to 
be mixed up.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17333"> 17333 </A></B>
<P>
	The Liberal government also felt pressured to deliver on its 
vague promises to change the federal system following the 
razor-thin victory of the no side on October 30.
<P>
<B>(2135)</B>
<P>
	To do so, it set up two phoney committees. One of these 
committees was chaired by the Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs; its mission was to save Canada. What a nifty little mission.
<P>
	On November 29, even before the committee tabled its findings, 
the Prime Minister hastily announced three initiatives aimed at 
satisfying the desire for change expressed by the vast majority of 
Quebecers.
<P>
	As far as recognition of Quebec as a distinct society is 
concerned, however, these efforts are not very impressive. But, 
before going any further, allow me to read the motion:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Whereas the people of Quebec have expressed the desire for recognition of 
Quebec's distinct society;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(1) the House recognize that Quebec is a distinct society within Canada;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(2) the House recognize that Quebec's distinct society includes its 
French-speaking majority, unique culture and civil law tradition;</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Perhaps my French is not so good, but to me ``culture- unique'' 
means a culture that is different from others.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(3) the House undertake to be guided by this reality;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(4) the House encourage all components of the legislative and executive 
branches of government to take note of this recognition and be guided in their 
conduct accordingly.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In other words, this is just the opposite of what was done this 
afternoon.
<P>
	Upon reading the motion, we realize that it is merely a 
recognition of Quebec society as it is now. It simply reflects a 
logical conclusion.
<P>
	Nowhere in this text is there any mention of additional powers 
being given to Quebec. Even the minister told us that it does not 
provide powers to Quebec. He is an honest man.
<P>
	This motion is meaningless. It is merely a symbolic recognition 
of what we already know, namely that we are different from the rest 
of Canada. Even the Prime Minister has said so.
<P>
	The fact is that the recognition of Quebec's distinct nature, as 
currently proposed by the Liberal government, is light years away 
from what was proposed in the past.
<P>
	Indeed, during the 1986-87 federal-provincial negotiations to 
make Quebec sign, with honour and enthusiasm, the Constitutional 
Act of 1982, the Liberal Party of Quebec made a demand, as part of 
its June 1985-86 political agenda. This is for the Quebec Liberals 
who hold a Liberal party membership: ``The Liberal  government is 
asking that a statement be included, in a preamble to the new 
Constitution, to explicitly recognize Quebec as a distinct society 
and as a cornerstone for the French element of the Canadian 
duality''.
<P>
	That was not written by nasty separatists in their political 
agenda, but by the Liberal Party of Quebec.
<P>
	These proposals from the Liberal Party of Quebec led to the 
Meech Lake accord. Although the concept of distinct society in that 
accord was not worth much, at least it was entrenched in the 
Canadian Constitution. Moreover, the distinct society clause was 
interpretative. Therefore, the provisions of the Canadian 
Constitution had to be interpreted based, among other things, on 
that clause. Consequently, today's motion on the concept of distinct 
society is very far from what was agreed to in the Meech Lake 
accord. There was a minimum of interpretative powers. Today, 
there are none.
<P>
	There is nothing of the like being proposed today, besides which 
the government side is deluding itself into believing that Quebecers 
will smilingly accept such a ridiculous proposition and 
undertaking-and I am weighing my words carefully with that 
choice of adjective.
<P>
<B>(2140)</B>
<P>
	Where were the people in the Liberal government when the 
people of Quebec came close to saying yes to sovereignty on 
October 30, at 49.4 per cent? Do the Prime Minister and his cronies 
really believe that the people of Quebec will settle for that stuff and 
nonsense when they came within a hair's breadth of acquiring a 
country with total control over all of its powers? No. The federal 
government needs to stop fooling itself and face up to reality.
<P>
	Quebec is not inhabited by a distinct society, but by a people, the 
people of Quebec. The men and women of Quebec already know 
that, and this is why they do not recognize themselves in the 
meaningless concept of a distinct society. If there is one lesson to 
be learned from the October 30 referendum, it is that the people of 
Quebec are on their way to sovereignty.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is both 
a pleasure and a duty to speak to a motion so well characterized by 
the previous speaker as wishful thinking, a motion of the House of 
Commons on the recognition of Quebec as a distinct society.
<P>
	In this country people have long misunderstood the so-called 
identity of the province of Quebec. Quebec is not a province like 
the others. It is a people, a nation. It is a nation forged by history, a 
society that included aboriginal peoples and the many immigrants 
that came to change that society and be changed by it, that would 
enrich it and absorb its identity.
<P>
	Quebec is not a province like the others, and until this fact is 
recognized other than by a motion on distinct  society or some 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17334"> 17334 </A></B>
<P>
Charlottetown accord on an equally hollow concept, Quebecers 
will have no choice but to ensure that in the next referendum, the 
result will not be 49.9 per cent, which is a close defeat or a close 
win, but a clear majority.
<P>
	I hope so, not only for Quebec but also for Canada which as long 
as this issue is around, will not be able to consider its own potential 
and problems and guide the development of its economy and its 
own history in the best interests of Canadians.
<P>
	We in Quebec claim and will continue to do so, that the best 
thing for Quebec and Canada would be to agree to a partnership.
<P>
<B>(2145)</B>
<P>
	We realize that the outcome of the referendum does not give us a 
mandate to negotiate this partnership immediately. However, 
Canada should not get the impression that symbolic gestures as 
frivolous as a motion on distinct society will do anything at all to 
deal with the problem facing both Quebec and Canada.
<P>
	In my youth, which, I must admit, was a long time ago, I was 
very keen on history. History is an impassioned quest for 
understanding what makes a people and a nation. The Quebec 
people, the Quebec nation has come a long way since the first 
French colonists immigrated to Canada, which is an aboriginal 
name. These French immigrants quickly mixed in.
<P>
	I need only mention the Carignan-Salières regiment with its 
many soldiers, mercenaries from every country in Europe. They 
settled here. When the English conquest left no choice but 
compliance, their intermixing explains why every historian 
studying this point in history says that, even at that time, the 
Canadians or ``Canayens'', like the Americans, former English 
settlers, would not have taken long to become independent in a 
country with a different name.
<P>
	Fortune, if we can use such a term for the English conquest, 
dictated that there would be a colony within a colony and that, after 
all these years, Quebec through its complex but clear and unilateral 
history, would succeed in making itself felt as a people and a 
nation, ever increasingly. Increasingly clearly, and certainly since 
1960, when, at the end of a period in which middle class business 
and economics had again taken root after 1760, young people spoke 
with one voice calling for ``maître chez nous'' and for ``égalité ou 
indépendance'', through the Ralliement pour l'indépendance du 
Québec, the RIN, or even the FLQ, leading this people, already a 
fact, to speak for itself. General de Gaulle did no harm either with 
his ``Vive le Québec libre'' from the balcony.
<P>
	Quebec's history has passed through the election of the Parti 
Quebecois, the failure of the first referendum, a bitter pill for those 
who had worked so hard. But it was,  however, productive, because 
15 years later, in 1995, the 1980 referendum almost won.
<P>
	In these few minutes, it is not possible to express the density of 
Quebec's history. I want to say that I have tremendous respect for 
all of the Canadians who are speaking up here, today, and who are 
attached to their country. I say to them the only way the countries 
of Canada and Quebec can develop and flourish is through mutual 
recognition.
<P>
<B>(2150)</B>
<P>
	It is by mutually recognizing not Quebec's distinct society, 
which is practically meaningless, but the depth, the profound 
nature of this people and this nation, of both Quebec and Canada, 
that we can mutually and collectively prepare for the future by 
building on a real foundation.
<P>
	Unfortunately, instead of bringing us closer to a future to which 
Canadians and Quebecers are entitled, this situation is a setback, 
because it tries to fulfil a wish that has absolutely nothing to do 
with the real underlying needs.
<P>
	I sincerely hope that our position will help Quebecers and 
Canadians take a real step toward their future.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, I have the great honour of supporting the motion before us 
today.
<P>
	I am a Quebecer and it is as such that I associate myself with this 
motion. I do so because it is in the best interests of Quebec and 
because it opens the door to a renewed partnership for Canadian 
partners from coast to coast.
<P>
	The ideal country does not exist, except in the imagination of 
certain persons. And we all agree that Canada is far from perfect. It 
needs to change. It must change to better reflect its own reality.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	What is that reality? It is the reality of a vast country with a 
scattered, diverse population. It is the reality of a country in which 
regional identities are strongly expressed. It is also the reality of a 
country in which the francophones are concentrated in one 
province but a million others are distributed across the rest of 
Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	That is the Canadian reality. Not only must we take it into 
consideration and recognize it, but our institutions must also reflect 
this reality if we want this country to work and to achieve its full 
potential.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	On October 30 Quebecers sent us a clear double message. While 
reaffirming their attachment to Canada,  they indicated that they 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17335"> 17335 </A></B>
<P>
wanted to see Canada change quickly to reflect their aspirations. 
We must know how to interpret this message. We must not only 
take note of it, but we must respond to it in a concrete way or this 
country will fail.
<P>
	As the Prime Minister pointed out so well when the motion was 
tabled, the referendum results have taught us that we must not take 
Canada for granted. It was in this context that the Prime Minister 
made three firm commitments on behalf of the Canadian 
government during the referendum campaign. These three 
commitments were as follows: to recognize that Quebec is a 
distinct society within Canada; to refrain from making any 
constitutional change affecting Quebec without the consent of 
Quebecers; and to undertake changes to bring citizens closer to 
services and decision making.
<P>
[Translation] 
<P>
	The time has come to fulfil these commitments, to take action. 
Through the motion before this House, we are starting to give 
concrete expression to the commitments made by the Prime 
Minister. By putting it to the members of this House this quickly, 
the government is showing that it takes its commitments seriously. 
It is showing how important this issue is, not only for Quebec, but 
also for the rest of Canada.
<P>
<B>(2155 )</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Why do Quebecers want to be recognized as members of a 
distinct society? The reasons are obvious. Quebec is home to a 
French-speaking majority, a unique culture, and a civil law 
tradition. Quebec has been built around these essential elements for 
more than three centuries. Recognizing this is not only 
acknowledging reality, it is also agreeing that these characteristics 
of Quebec society must be preserved and nourished in a context 
where Quebec co-exists in North America with a population of 
about 300 million anglophones.
<P>
	To adopt this motion is to recognize that the French character of 
Quebec must be protected. It is to assert that Quebec must enjoy 
cultural security. It is to recognize the linguistic duality that is in 
the very nature of Canada and contributes to its cultural and social 
richness.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	By recognizing Quebec distinct nature and by admitting that the 
definition of distinct society contained in this resolution is by no 
means complete, this House is undertaking to let itself be guided by 
this reality. The legislative and executive branches of government 
will be encouraged to take this recognition into account in all their 
activities and all their decisions. This means that this resolution 
will have a positive impact on the way legislation is passed in this 
House and decisions are made in federal government departments 
and agencies.
<P>
	There is more. The motion before us today is but one of a whole 
series of government actions. During the referendum campaign, the 
Prime Minister also pledged not to make any constitutional change 
without Quebec's consent. That commitment is reflected in the bill 
recently introduced by the Minister of Justice to provide a regional 
veto power. Under this bill, any constitutional amendment 
proposed by the federal government will require the consent of 
Quebec and the other regions of Canada.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The objective of the motion is clear: to protect Quebec from 
amendments that might reduce the powers of the Quebec National 
Assembly. By taking this action the Government of Canada is 
recognizing that the Government of Quebec, as the only 
government representing a francophone majority in North 
America, has a central role to play in the evolution of Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This is a far cry from the so-called meaningless motion referred 
to by the separatists in recent days. Through this bill, the federal 
government strengthens the regions, particularly Quebec. We feel 
it is a first step toward a more flexible and more effective 
federalism.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It would be wrong to claim that the only purpose of the motion is 
to meet the aspirations of Quebec. Canada is not a melting pot, nor 
has it ever been. The issue here is proposals that reflect the deep 
nature of Canada. The issue here is ensuring not only our national 
unity but also its harmony and the effectiveness of its institutions.
<P>
	I have followed the debate on the motion with interest. I have 
heard the criticisms of the official opposition, which were not 
really surprising. I have also heard the criticisms of others who 
claim to be defending Canada while at the same time opposing the 
motion. To them I would say that it is easy to criticize after the 
crisis is over. However, what will those who object today say when 
the separatists mount another attack? I invite them to answer right 
now, before it is too late.
<P>
	Canada is a federation of partners. It is by preserving the spirit of 
partnership and co-operation and by recognizing both our 
differences and our shared objectives that this country will grow 
and prosper. The motion we are debating today deals exactly with 
this concept of partnership. The Canada we all want is a country in 
which each region has its own specific character and the freedom it 
needs to express it. That is the essence of what this motion 
contains.
<P>
<B>(2200 )</B>
<P>
	The definition of a federation is not a grouping of equal partners. 
The purpose of a federation is to permit the differences of the 
various parts to be accommodated within one country. Otherwise it 
is a unitary state. We  are not, because we have started as a group of 
people who were different and who founded a type of government 
able to accept the differences. It is really unfortunate that there is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17336"> 17336 </A></B>
<P>
now a party which does not agree that the differences the country 
has are part of its richness and of its wealth.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The motion before the House specifically relates to the concept 
of partnership. The Canada that we want is a country in which 
every region will have its own distinctive character and the means 
to develop it. This is the very essence of the motion.
<P>
	Canadians want a united country. They are open to changes that 
will preserve its unity and promote its development, as evidenced 
by the resolutions recently passed by the legislatures of Ontario, 
New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Newfoundland, to recognize 
Quebec's distinct nature.
<P>
	I am convinced that the majority of Quebecers and Canadians 
recognize themselves in this motion. I would humbly submit to the 
Official Opposition, moreover, as well as to the Government of 
Quebec, that they are wrong to reject it.
<P>
	Of course the separatists cannot accept propositions with the 
object of making Canada work better. This is an undemocratic 
attitude, for it denies the results of the referendum. It also 
condemns Quebec to immobility and rejection of any improvement 
to the system. It is thus in contradiction to what most Quebecers 
want.
<P>
	We have no illusions about it. Since the Government of Quebec 
is interested solely in its own option, we shall not engage in 
constitutional discussions which would be doomed to failure from 
the word go. But that does not prevent us from taking steps today in 
the direction Quebecers and all Canadians want us to go. Needless 
to say, however, if Quebec and the other regions of the country 
consent, the Government will be open to including the changes 
contained in this motion in the Constitution.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Every member sitting in the House has the opportunity by voting 
for this motion to acknowledge Canada for what it is, a diversified 
country, an open country, a country that has always based its 
development on accepting and preserving its differences.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	For, beyond those differences, the shared values and objectives 
we have always had as Canadians, regardless of where we live, 
remain: freedom, tolerance, the creation and distribution of wealth 
for individuals and regions.
<P>
	The months and years to come will surely afford us the 
opportunity for a concrete demonstration of the fact that we go far 
beyond principles and pious wishes.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lyle Vanclief (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
have the opportunity to put on the record some of the comments I 
have received from constituents. They have watched and 
participated with all of us, or most of us, as a number of members 
and parties in the House did not participate in the process, in order 
to reach out to the province of Quebec with most Canadians to set 
the country back on a path of a unified purpose and commitment to 
the dream which has made this country the envy of the world.
<P>
<B>(2205 )</B>
<P>
	I would like to publicly thank those from the Prince 
Edward-Hastings riding who took that long bus trip to Montreal 
on October 27 to extend their hand and to once again tell Quebecers 
their Canada included Quebec. It certainly was a contribution I 
know was well meant and very useful. I thank them for that extra 
effort as well as the individuals and businesses in the riding that 
helped to make that possible during that day and during that critical 
time in the future of our country.
<P>
	The resolution we are debating is certainly an honest and 
thoughtful fulfilment of an important commitment the Prime 
Minister made to the people of Quebec during the referendum 
debate. We are fortunate as Canadians to have a Prime Minister 
who displays and portrays very clearly integrity and sincerity in his 
actions. When he makes a promise to Canadians he fulfils that 
promise.
<P>
	The package of unity measures announced and put forward to the 
House and to Canadians in every province has three parts, as we 
well know: to recognize within Canada that Quebec is a distinct 
society; not to proceed with any constitutional change that affects 
Quebec without Quebecers' consent; and to undertake changes to 
bring services and the decision making process closer to citizens, 
initially in the field of labour market training.
<P>
	This kind of leadership, to put this type of thing before 
Canadians and before the House, is what is needed today in order to 
heal the wounds, and the recent wounds, that need to be healed in 
order to move forward together as Canadians. This motion along 
with the bill concerning the veto and other actions of the House 
concerning workforce training measures provide a confident 
display of national reconciliation.
<P>
	The motion that addresses the legitimate concerns of the citizens 
of Quebec in terms of our acknowledgement of the distinctive 
characteristics of Quebec as a society is only a recognition of the 
reality there today.
<P>
	If we analyze the motion by looking at the second part it says 
very clearly that Quebec includes a French speaking majority. That 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17337"> 17337 </A></B>
<P>
is a reality. It says Quebec has a unique culture. That is a reality. It 
says Quebec is governed by the civil law tradition. That is a reality.
<P>
	This motion does not give any special status to the people in 
Quebec. It recognizes one of the things we all say everyday, that 
our country is made up of many diverse cultures. However, we 
have six million French speaking people of a unique culture, 
different from many of the rest of us, in Quebec.
<P>
	The motion provides them the assurance that the federal 
government will be guided by the recognition of that distinctness 
and carries the Prime Minister's personal commitment that he and 
the government will gladly incorporate into the Constitution, when 
all the provinces are prepared along with Quebec, appropriate 
resolutions to do so.
<P>
	No matter what area we are dealing with, our own riding or an 
organization we belong to or in the House, we know there are 
differences. We know there are people who think differently. The 
important thing, whether in our own families or whether in the 
larger family of a constituency, a province, a municipality or in the 
House, is that we recognize and appreciate each other's differences.
<P>
<B>(2210 )</B>
<P>
	We may not always agree but the only way we are to get ahead in 
a family of any kind, whether it is a family of the House or a family 
that we call Canada, is to go forward together. We are stronger as 
we work together to achieve that end. It is a disappointment to most 
Canadians when we see one political party in the House saying it 
wants a Quebec without Canada and another political party making 
it very clear it would be very happy, certainly not upset, if we had a 
Canada without Quebec.
<P>
	The concerns that this motion conveys special powers to the 
province of Quebec or that this motion is an acknowledgement of 
the Constitution's inability to be flexible enough to accommodate 
such changes are simply unwarranted.
<P>
	While this motion has no legal effect, it definitely expresses an 
important commitment by the elected body that speaks for all 
Canadians, this body that we are all part of here this evening, and it 
recognizes an obvious reality without giving the people of Quebec 
any powers that Canadians elsewhere do not possess.
<P>
	That is not the intention of this motion. The intention of this 
motion and the intention and the challenge of the House is to treat 
all Canadians equally. We also have to recognize Canadians are not 
all the same when it comes to language, culture and, in the case of 
Quebec, the law and the civil law code they are governed by.
<P>
	The Constitution is more than capable of accepting this change, 
as is the government. The willingness of the Quebec government to 
make that possible would be a significant help in giving greater 
weight to this important measure.
<P>
	I am disappointed that the official opposition and the third party 
are opposed to this motion, opposed and fail to recognize the 
diversity of what makes up this wonderful country we are all part 
of.
<P>
	The negative contributions to the debate during the referendum 
by some members of the House, some parties in the House, nearly 
cost us the country. We cannot stand by and allow that to happen 
again. It is illogical, narrow minded and not of the national 
character we have here Canada.
<P>
	Canada must reassert our strength of purpose and unite our 
people. This is a commitment the government is prepared to make, 
and is making. It is the potential of this motion and it will be the 
legacy of the government and the Prime Minister.
<P>
	We are a country incredibly rich in culture, resources, beauty, 
geography and opportunity. I encourage all members of the House 
to do what we can, individually and together, to make our country 
even stronger in the future than it is at the present time. I urge all 
members of the House to support this motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
will be splitting my time with one of my fellow members.
<P>
	In May 1987 Pierre Trudeau wrote an open letter to the country 
after the Meech Lake accord was signed. He had this to say about 
Quebec as a distinct society:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The real question-is whether the French Canadians living in Quebec need a 
provincial government with more powers than other provinces. I believe it is 
insulting to us to claim that we do-.The new generation-has no use for this 
siege mentality in which the elites of bygone days used to cower-.They don't 
suffer from any inferiority complex, and they say good riddance to the times 
when we didn't dare to measure ourselves against others without fear and 
trembling. In short, they need no crutches. Quite the contrary, they know that 
Quebecers are capable of playing a leading role within Canada.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Mr. Trudeau believed the recognition of Quebec as a distinct 
society would be a stepping stone to sovereignty, that granting 
special powers to Quebec would be the end of the Canadian dream. 
I think he was right.
<P>
	Call Quebec a distinct society, promise to make government 
decisions in light of that status, and sovereignists will seize on it to 
say at last we are recognized as a distinct society, and a distinct 
society is a nation; we have only one more step to go.
<P>
	The notion of a distinct society formed the basis of the 
sovereignty argument in the last referendum campaign and will be 
used to greater effect next time if this motion passes.
<P>
<B>(2215 )</B>
<P>
	The current Prime Minister's last minute promise of a distinct 
society was born out of panic. It is a policy of appeasement to 
sovereignists in Quebec and it stands in opposition to traditional 
Liberal Party policy.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17338"> 17338 </A></B>
<P>
	I agree with Mr. Trudeau about distinct society, but I take issue 
with his belief that national unity lay in his new Constitution and 
the charter which would form a federation, as he put it, set to last 
1,000 years.
<P>
	Instead, Mr. Trudeau, by invading provincial jurisdictions, by 
consolidating power in Ottawa and by starting us down the debt 
road that has led us to the fiscal crisis we now face as a nation, set 
in motion a series of events that led us to the brink of separation on 
October 30. It does not help that our current Prime Minister is so 
closely associated with the repatriation of our Constitution and 
being finance minister during the time that this fiscal crisis began.
<P>
	Federal strategy during the referendum and afterward was put 
forward by the Prime Minister in the following way. He promised a 
virtual status quo, even though Quebec had been demanding that 
the federal government get out of provincial jurisdiction since 
1920. The Prime Minister now says he will decentralize some job 
training to the provinces. It is too little, but it is not yet too late.
<P>
	Finally, the lack of federal strategy ignores the changing face of 
Canada. The new Canada is more than just two founding nations. 
We have come of age in this country. We are no longer simply two 
founding nations. We are a nation of almost 30 million people and 
growing. We are a nation of 30 million equal people. There are no 
longer just two languages, there are many. Canada is more than just 
two rich and populace central provinces. It is a nation with a 
growing western economy and a population to match.
<P>
	In the old Canada, Ontario and Quebec could afford to ignore the 
western hinterland. However, in 20 years British Columbia will be 
nearly as populace as Quebec. Alberta and B.C. already have the 
two strongest economies in the nation. The west is not only a 
theoretical equal, it sits now at the table as a practical equal with 
the central provinces.
<P>
	Liberals seem to be living in the past, in the old Canada. That is 
why the notion of a distinct society reverberates so poorly in the 
west. If the Prime Minister wants to give special status to Quebec 
and this status means unequal powers or unequal treatment of all 
Canadians, regardless of race, sex, language or culture, then this 
idea will not sell in British Columbia and the rest of Canada.
<P>
	That is why we proposed these amendments. It was to make it 
crystal clear that it does not involve any more powers or any 
unequal treatment of any Canadians. If he continues to treat 
provinces unequally, he is starting to drive a wedge in the west 
where there once was one only at the Ottawa River.
<P>
	It is fair to say that everyone in this Chamber feels a good deal of 
pressure today, pressure from their constituents, from party 
colleagues, from provincial governments and even from people 
who are yet to be  born, because future generations may have to live 
with whatever we decide. They are in a sense looking for us to do 
what is right.
<P>
	I want to say that I regret what is happening in the House. The 
proverb states: ``A house divided against itself cannot stand''. At 
this crucial time in our history, we face a divided House of 
Parliament, not only between federalists and separatists, which is 
to be expected, but incredibly we also face a divided House among 
federalists.
<P>
	The government seems to claim a certain omniscience on the 
subject of national unity but the results of the referendum proved it 
to be sadly mistaken. If at the beginning of the referendum 
campaign the Prime Minister had brought in the leader of the 
Reform Party and said: ``We both represent legitimate viewpoints 
of Canadians. We can work out a strategy together. Let us combat 
the separatists in Quebec'', I think the leader of the Reform Party 
would have co-operated gladly. However, there seems to be no 
room for compromise in the Liberal ranks.
<P>
	Instead, the Prime Minister questions the loyalty of Reformers 
just because they do not agree with the way the Liberal Party wants 
to fight separatists. Of course this is not true. We are not lacking in 
patriotism. We simply feel like most Canadians, that we have been 
shut out of the process and that the strategy is wrong.
<P>
	What is that process? The resolution came before the House with 
two days' notice, an hour's notice to the press, a briefing to the 
Liberal caucus on the same day that the Prime Minister held the 
press conference. There was no briefing for any other members in 
the House. There was no public consultation or even consultation 
with the provinces, many of which reject this notion of distinct 
society.
<P>
	Members of the Reform Party, like it or not, represent real points 
of view of real Canadians. On the Liberal side they may want to 
ignore the Reform members in the House but the people of Canada 
who voted for us cannot be ignored. In ignoring the thoughts of 
Reformers, the Prime Minister is alienating strong federalist forces 
outside of his own cloistered offices. Yet when the Reform Party 
protests, the Prime Minister chides them like school children and 
says: ``Shame, shame you're in bed with the separatists''. Then he 
proceeds to offer a constitutional veto to the separatist Government 
of Quebec.
<P>
<B>(2220)</B>
<P>
	There is a sincere desire for national unity on the government 
side of the House. I do not question that. Their tactics are wrong. 
There is wisdom on this side of the House worth hearing.
<P>
	I would like to read from <I>Hansard</I>. When I asked the Prime 
Minister, when he must have known or he should have known that 
the west would never ever accept this  distinct society clause, why 
he brought it forward, his Minister of Justice rose and said: ``Mr. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17339"> 17339 </A></B>
<P>
Speaker, I do not think we should assume for a moment that the 
hon. member speaks for the people of British Columbia''.
<P>
	I will say one thing. A slick Toronto lawyer does not speak for 
the people of British Columbia. If he wants to know what the 
people of British Columbia are saying, he should come out to the 
coffee shops, come out to the public meetings, come out to the talk 
shows, come out anywhere in the west and listen. If he listened he 
would realize the wedge that he is driving with this motion between 
British Columbia and the rest of Canada. I do not know why the 
government is proceeding with this.
<P>
	The Reform policy is to confront hard and soft Quebec 
separatists on the one hand by developing realistic answers to the 
hard questions that the sovereignists like to sweep under the rug. 
We would detail the costs of separation for Quebecers and make 
sure that all Quebecers hear them. A huge percentage of voters in 
Quebec thought that they could vote yes and still have all the 
benefits of being Canadian. The federal government's failure to 
detail the cost of separation, to tell them where the rubber meets the 
road, tell them what they are in for, brought us nearly to the brink 
of separation on October 30. That is what we should do on the one 
hand.
<P>
	On the other hand Reformers would also appeal to Canadian 
nationalists in Quebec, who represent well over half of the 
population. We would do this by showing them exactly where 
Canada can change, that we can devolve programs and 
responsibilities to all of the provinces equally.
<P>
	We have detailed 20 separate areas where changes can be made 
without constitutional change simply by getting the federal 
government out of areas of provincial jurisdiction. Our strategy 
would confront the separatists on the one hand and encourage 
Canadian nationalism on the other and cultivate unity among all 
federalists across the country by preserving the concept of equality.
<P>
	It is a reasonable strategy. It will work. I would appeal to all 
members to drop this disastrous distinct society motion while there 
is still time. Members should stop casting insults when someone 
comes up with another idea and maybe see if there is a kernel of 
truth in it.
<P>
	I invite all federalists to create a strategy in this House for all 
members that is not created in the Prime Minister's office. It is 
time for the west to be brought into the picture. It is time for 
federalists to work together to tell the separatist Quebecois exactly 
what they are in for and to offer a new vision for a united Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
wonder if I might have the consent of the House to split my 10 
minutes with the hon. member for Elk Island.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is it agreed?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ablonczy:</B> Mr. Speaker, this is a very ill-conceived move 
on the part of the government. As a matter of fact I believe it is 
politically motivated solely. The Prime Minister, having totally 
botched the matter of the referendum and the move on the part of 
some people from one province to separate from the country is now 
desperate to show he is doing something. If this was such a good 
idea he should have done it two years ago and not hastily thrown it 
into the breach when he was in desperate difficulty.
<P>
	Members on the other side are telling us over and over that this is 
going to unify the country. In fact, this distinct society proposal 
will do nothing but intensify Canada's divisions. In my few 
minutes I am going to put on the record why I believe this is so.
<P>
	First, once we concede that Quebec is distinct we have provided 
an enormous justification for it to be separate. Second, formal 
recognition of Quebec's distinctiveness in the Constitution is 
meaningless unless that special recognition also becomes a 
principle used to interpret the Constitution with respect to this 
distinct society. The rules by which our country functions would 
then always be interpreted so as to treat one province as distinct 
and special.
<P>
<B>(2225 )</B>
<P>
	As a result, that province would have special status and 
constitutional powers, for if we state that in spite of its being a 
distinct society, Quebec has no more power than the other 
provinces, in the end it would be no more distinct than the others. 
The whole exercise would only be window dressing because 
Quebec's interests would not be better served by it. Separatists 
would be able to denounce it as yet another empty gesture and 
cause disaffection with the federal government to increase, not 
decrease.
<P>
	The greatest danger is that giving Quebec distinct society status 
in the Constitution would almost certainly be interpreted as also 
giving Quebec special status and constitutional powers. Former 
Prime Minister Trudeau in 1987 pointed out that Quebec 
politicians will take the position ``that if the Constitution says 
something it is because a meaning was intended''. It is an old 
principle in lawmaking that legislators usually do not talk without 
saying something. It can happen, but not when they write laws. 
Thus we have to suppose that distinct society means something.
<P>
	Trudeau was also quoted as commenting that if anyone thinks 
recognizing Quebec as a distinct society means nothing, ``you are 
in for a superb surprise''.
<P>
	Anyone who has studied the courts' interpretations over the last 
several years of existing constitutional provisions will have no 
trouble understanding this. Canadians were astonished, for exam-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17340"> 17340 </A></B>
<P>
ple, when our courts told us the Constitution says that if you are 
extremely  intoxicated when you kill someone, you are not guilty of 
a crime.
<P>
	While we may intend only to recognize a sociological and 
historical fact when we amend the Canadian Constitution to 
designate Quebec as a distinct society, down the road it is clearly 
open to the courts to affirm that the provision really confers special 
status and powers on one of the ten provinces, whether it is in the 
Constitution or in any other legislation, such as the motion which is 
before us today.
<P>
	Why would it matter if Quebec was given special status and 
powers? The simple answer is that it would only intensify Canada's 
divisions.
<P>
	First, it would violate the principle of equality. This principle is 
foundational to the whole characterization of Canada as a 
democracy, where every citizen has the same rights and the same 
value. It would be completely unacceptable for some Canadians to 
be designated as having different or greater rights, different or 
greater value, than others. In the past we have condemned societies 
that sought to operate on that tenet. We have declared the very idea 
repugnant. Would we now find special status for some acceptable 
in our country? Never.
<P>
	Second, far from bringing Canadians together, such a move 
would segregate them and emphasize the differences between them 
even further. The Prime Minister will attempt to characterize the 
move to confer distinct society status and a constitutional veto on 
Quebec as an act of generosity and reconciliation.
<P>
	Tolerance and kindness have long been praised as traits of the 
Canadian people. We would not wish to be accused of acting 
otherwise. However, I believe that Canadians must place 
reasonable limits on any exercise of generosity. Therefore, we must 
ask whether it is reasonable to give a separatist government, 
committed to breaking up the country, a veto over the Constitution 
of Canada. It will truly result in fundamentally redesigning Canada 
to give some citizens more say and a greater degree of control than 
all other citizens.
<P>
	If a unified Canada is our goal, the only sound course of action is 
to pursue those issues on which Canadians agree and not those 
issues on which they are divided. The Reform Party's vision for a 
new and better Canada is guided by the founding principle of 
equality of provinces and citizens. It is the only sound basis on 
which to go forward as a confident and unified people.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am both angry 
and grieved this evening. I am angry because something which I 
value so highly, the wonderful country in which we live, is being 
treated with such indifference by the government. I am grieved 
because the principles of equality are being violated in the 
proposed legislation.
<P>
<B>(2230 )</B>
<P>
	I joined the Reform Party and became a member of Parliament 
because of my commitment to the equality of Canadians. I cannot 
understand how a government can look back without seeing that 
the policies of the last 30 years have driven a deep wedge into this 
country. How can those members then conclude that wriggling 
around that wedge some more is now going to produce unity? That 
does not make sense to me.
<P>
	I am very gravely angered by that. I am grieved by the fact that 
we are here in a Parliament where we cannot properly and openly 
discuss this. Whenever we bring forward ideas we get into name 
calling instead of honestly and openly debating the issues and the 
principles that are involved.
<P>
	We have a parliamentary system here that does not respond. 
There is no mechanism in this Parliament to change what is now 
being proposed and what is clearly wrong. The reason is that all the 
members on the government side do not have the freedom to speak 
and to vote what they truly believe.
<P>
	I cannot believe that among the 176 members on the other side, 
not one of them has any serious questions about this legislation. 
There are four members in the government from Alberta. Every 
one of us in the Reform Party who is from Alberta has heard from 
numerous constituents that there are large problems with further 
bifurcating this country with this kind of legislation. Surely those 
other four Liberal members in Alberta have heard those same 
messages. If they have chosen not to listen and not to represent 
them here because of that nasty party discipline that is exercised in 
the House, which makes this place ineffective, that makes me very 
angry. We have here a system of governance that cannot respond to 
a major crisis in this country because of its archaic systems.
<P>
	I plead with those members opposite to use their own 
intelligence, their own analysis, their own convictions, their own 
beliefs, and stand in the face of this government. Because of their 
majority, they alone can do it. They are the only ones who can save 
this country.
<P>
	If we keep on following the plan that is proposed, it is inevitable 
that the divisions among us will increase. In this very weak attempt 
to try to appease one province that has legitimate beefs and instead 
of listening to the legitimate beefs to offer this little appeasement 
carrot, they are putting at risk the unity of the whole country. They 
are doing that with impunity and as if they do not care.
<P>
	It is a total shame. It distresses me. I really eagerly wish the 
Liberal members in the House would exercise principle and forget 
about this policy they have had of voting the way they are told. 
That will destroy this country.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17341"> 17341 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Warren Allmand (Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, to repeat the resolution, we are today debating the 
government's proposal to recognize Quebec as a distinct society 
within Canada.
<P>
	According to the resolution, this distinct society is defined as 
including a French-speaking majority in Quebec, which is certainly 
distinct, since there is no other province in Canada that has such a 
French-speaking majority; a unique culture in Quebec based on the 
French language, which is also unique and distinct in Canada; and a 
civil law system, which no other province has. These are not 
exclusive traits of the distinct society but simply the high marks.
<P>
	Let me point out that these three distinctive features that are in 
the resolution were first recognized and granted by the British in 
the act of cession of 1763 and in the Quebec Act of 1774. These 
distinctive features that are attributed to Quebec in this resolution 
are not new. What we are doing here today is simply restating this 
distinctiveness in a different way in this century.
<P>
<B>(2235 )</B>
<P>
	Distinct society does not mean superior; it means different. We 
have in Quebec the civil law. Those in the other provinces have the 
common law. Neither is superior. They are different. That is what 
the distinct society clause means.
<P>
	The distinct society clause does not mean special status. Quebec 
and all provinces have some special provisions in the Constitution 
relating to them, and they all in some way have special status, but 
this is not the meaning or the purpose of the distinct society clause.
<P>
	Finally, the distinct society clause does not mean more power to 
Quebec. I submit that those who suggest this are being 
mischievous, destructive, and misleading. I found it extremely 
hurtful to hear one Reformer after another continually refer to this 
resolution as a constitutional amendment with constitutional 
consequences.
<P>
	The source of the federal and provincial powers is in the 
constitutional act of 1867 and the Constitution Act of 1982. In 
particular, the powers of the federal and provincial governments 
are in sections 91 and 92 of the Constitution of 1867. The only way 
those powers can be changed, abridged, increased or diminished is 
by a constitutional amendment. That is the only way they can be 
changed.
<P>
	This resolution before the House is not a bill. It is a resolution. It 
is not a proposed constitutional amendment. To suggest otherwise 
is misleading the Canadian public, which almost amounts to 
dishonesty in the House. This is a resolution of the House of 
Commons. It is not a bill that will lead to legislation. It is not a 
proposed constitutional amendment. In no way can this resolution 
augment the powers of Quebec, nor can it reduce the powers of the 
federal government or any  other province. This or another 
government might want to some day change those powers, but it is 
not doing it through this resolution.
<P>
	If the purpose of this resolution is not to grant special status or to 
give additional power, then what is its purpose? The purpose of the 
resolution is to assure Quebec that despite its different language, 
despite its different culture and legal system, we want them with 
us; we honour and respect them with their uniqueness, with their 
differences, with their distinctiveness. It is a formal commitment 
by the Parliament of Canada, representing all the people of Canada, 
that we recognize they are distinctive and we want them as they 
are. We do not want to assimilate them, we do not want to blend 
them. Once passed, the resolution is also meant to be a guide, but it 
is not legally binding; it is simply a guide.
<P>
	In many respects the resolution is like the great rally in Montreal 
on October 27. By that rally Canadians from all over the country, at 
great expense to themselves, came to Montreal to say that they 
wanted Quebec to stay in Confederation, that they respected 
Quebecers as they are, with their differences. But the rally had no 
legal or constitutional consequences. It did have very strong 
symbolic and political consequences-not legal or constitutional 
consequences, but symbolic and political consequences. It is the 
same with this resolution before the House.
<P>
	The distinct society clause is saying to Quebec that we recognize 
its distinct institutions and culture and because of them Canada is a 
better country. Its consequences are political and symbolic but 
extremely important, considering the atmosphere of this country 
today.
<P>
	I say it makes Canada a better country because Canada with two 
official languages and two cultures has a great advantage over other 
countries. These two languages and cultures are great assets, not 
burdens. Unlike the United States, unlike France, the United 
Kingdom, Italy, Germany and Japan, which only have one official 
language, Canada can do business in English and French, can do 
diplomacy in English and French, research in English and French, 
write plays, novels, and poetry in English and French, produce 
television, films, and songs in English and French. It has great 
universities, libraries, and centres of research in English and 
French.
<P>
<B>(2240)</B>
<P>
	This resolution alone will not do the job, but with the veto bill it 
is a very good start to assuring Quebecers that we accept them as 
they are with these differences referred to in the resolution and we 
want them to stay with us.
<P>
	I urge Canadians and I urge my colleagues in the House to put 
themselves for one moment in the shoes of French-speaking 
Quebecers. Here we have an island of approximately 8 million 
francophones in a North American sea of about 350 million 
anglophones. Put  yourself in that same situation. Reverse the 
languages. We have 8 million anglophones in a sea of 350 million 
francophones. They see this situation as putting their language and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17342"> 17342 </A></B>
<P>
culture at risk, their distinct language and culture threatened by the 
overwhelming majority of the anglophone provinces of the 
population of North America.
<P>
	Under the Quebec Act of 1774, French-speaking Quebecers were 
the majority in that state, although it was a British colony. Under 
the Constitution of 1791, with Upper Canada and Lower Canada, it 
was one to one: the French Canadians were equal in population 
more or less with the Upper Canadians. It was the same under the 
act of the union; up until 1867 it was Upper Canada and Lower 
Canada.
<P>
	Now they are one out of ten provinces and they are a much 
smaller percentage of the total population. Would my colleagues 
try to understand this situation, put themselves in the shoes of the 
French Canadians in Quebec? Try to understand how they might 
believe with great credibility that their unique institutions would be 
at risk in that situation.
<P>
	That is why assurances are required, and the distinct society 
clause is such an assurance. I urge my colleagues to give it some 
thought and support it.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Colleagues, there are two members who 
wish to speak further. We are supposed to stop at 11 p.m. I wonder 
if the two members who wish to speak could either divide the time 
or we could not see the clock until each is finished. Would that be 
agreeable?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Not 
seeing the clock is fine.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Not seeing the clock is acceptable.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Graham (Rosedale, Lib.):</B> If my hon. friend from 
Esquimalt cannot see the clock, I can understand it at this hour. I 
am sure he and I would be happy to share our time.
<P>
	In spite of the remarks that were made by some of the 
predecessors from his party who suggested that those of us on this 
side of the House were speaking because we felt we had to vote a 
certain way with the government, let me assure the other members 
in the House that when we rise to speak on this question we are 
speaking from the profound desire of Canadians to speak for our 
country, to speak of how we understand our country and what we 
are trying to achieve. We may have our differences, but we must 
understand that together we must try to resolve what is right about 
our country.
<P>
	As the great prime minister of this country, Sir Wilfrid Laurier, 
said many years ago, elections decide everything and answer 
nothing. The referendum is somewhat like that. It made a decision. 
It decided that Quebec was to stay in Canada, but it did not answer 
the question as to  under what conditions it is to stay in Canada. It 
did not answer many of the fundamental questions we are obliged 
as parliamentarians to review.
<P>
	I believe profoundly and seriously that the Prime Minister's 
initiative is not a constitutional initiative but is a realistic initiative. 
It corresponds to the aspirations of Quebecers. It is a solemn 
undertaking by this federal House and our executive to be guided in 
its decisions by a recognition of Quebec's unique culture, linguistic 
characteristics, and civil law traditions.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	When we come to this House, we all come with our various 
experiences as individuals and Canadians. I was born in Montreal 
but grew up in British Columbia, in Vancouver. Most of my family 
still lives in Vancouver.
<P>
<B>(2245)</B>
<P>
	I am there regularly. I consider myself a westerner, to some 
extent, but I now live in Toronto. I had the opportunity and the 
privilege of teaching at the University of Montreal and McGill 
University, so I also consider myself a Quebecer.
<P>
	When I look at the history of Quebec since 1774, since the 
Quebec Act, since our colleagues rejected Lord Durham's proposal 
to submerge Quebecers in an English ocean, if I may use that 
expression, when I look at the history of my country, at great 
French Canadians like Cartier, Laurier, Saint-Laurent, Trudeau and 
Chrétien, federalist Quebecers faithful to their people and 
convinced that federalism is the best way to protect their people's 
existence. Why can we say that?
<P>
	Because the province of Quebec has a distinct identity. There is a 
distinctiveness that makes it different from the rest of Canada. 
There is Bill 101 which protects the French language in Quebec. 
Quebec controls immigration to the province, which is not the case 
in other provinces. Internationally, and I have a particular interest 
as chairman of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Quebec 
with its membership in the francophonie and its privileged 
relationship with France is seen as different from the other 
provinces.
<P>
	We can say that in terms of protecting French culture and the 
French language in North America, for reasons already mentioned 
by the previous speaker, Quebec already has a different identity, a 
kind of distinct society. It is a very important asset for us in the rest 
of Canada. The hon. member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell 
made an emotional speech the other day about protecting the 
French language outside Quebec and he really convinced me that I 
as an Ontarian had a duty to protect the distinct identity and distinct 
society of Quebec.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I speak as an Ontarian. Can we say as Ontarians and as British 
Columbians that we have an interest in protecting a distinct society 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17343"> 17343 </A></B>
<P>
in Quebec? Does the  existence of a francophone majority within a 
province in Canada enrich the cultural and political life of the 
country in a way that enables us to be distinct and different?
<P>
	This is an extraordinary and complex subject. We can say that 
our colleagues who have spoken earlier in the House are right when 
they say that British Columbians are distinct. Of course this is true. 
We are all distinct.
<P>
	However speaking as I do, coming from Toronto, we recognize 
that our culture in North America will only survive in the face of 
North American television and the enormous pressures in which we 
live on the north-south pole, whether they are economic, 
environmental or cultural, if we live beside Quebec which is part of 
us, enriches us and gives us a specificity that is different. We as 
Ontarians are different because we have Quebec as a distinct 
society beside us. We as Ontarians live in a country that is 
bilingual, bicultural and bi-juridical.
<P>
	I have had experience as a young lawyer travelling outside the 
country. One of my great privileges was to work as a Canadian in 
international conferences. People were able to say to me: ``You 
represent a country that represents the civil law and common law 
traditions. You represent a country which has the Gaelic traditions 
and the Anglo-Saxon traditions. You are able to act as a bridge in 
this new world, this interdependent world in which we live. You are 
able to participate in this world in a way that is different from 
Americans, British, French and anyone else in the world'', 
precisely because we are Canadians and precisely because we are 
enriched by the presence of the distinct society of Quebec which 
forms a part of ourselves. We do not need to reject it. It enriches 
our experience. We are able to be what we are because we have 
Quebec as a part of us. We would be poorer if we did not. We would 
be poorer if we did not have Quebec as a distinct society.
<P>
<B>(2250)</B>
<P>
	If we look into the 21st century we must recognize that we will 
be challenged as a people. Whether we come from British 
Columbia, Alberta, the maritimes, Ontario or Quebec, we will be 
challenged to adapt to enormously changing conditions. In the 
course of those changes our adaptation, our flexibility and our 
ability to be something different will be precisely because we have 
been able to shoulder together, to partner together with our 
colleagues in Quebec a linguistic and cultural experience that 
means we can live and make something work in the country that is 
different from anything else.
<P>
	That is why I argue with my colleagues in favour of the distinct 
society. I respect their difference of opinion. I ask them to respect 
ours. This is not some political vote. This is a strong belief of 
people.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Epp:</B> How about inequality?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Graham:</B> There is no suggestion of inequality, as my 
colleague suggests. Distinct society is not a special  status. In 
recognizing Quebec as a distinct society we do not diminish 
ourselves. We enrich ourselves. This is not a suggestion of 
superiority. This is a suggestion of a recognition of a difference 
with which we live and with which we enrich ourselves by adapting 
and making a part of our culture.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I realize my time has almost expired. I want to say that in 
Ontario we have a very large francophone community, whose 
survival depends on the existence of a distinct Quebec society. A 
society that contributes to the enrichment of our society in Ontario 
and to the existence of an Ontario that is distinct from the United 
States, and I want to say to this House that the existence of Canada 
as a distinct society depends on our recognition of Quebec as a 
distinct society.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I will repeat that in English as I believe it very strongly. The 
existence of Canada and the future of Canada as a distinct society 
depend upon our willingness to recognize the existence of Quebec 
as a distinct society within us. That will be our strength. That will 
be our future. That will be the future of Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, a basic principle in a democratic society is the principle of 
equality for all of its individuals. This principle is being abrogated 
and trashed by the motion the government is putting forth to give 
the distinct society clause to one province.
<P>
	The principle of equality is something that Canada stands for, 
Canadians have fought for and Canadians have died for. It is the 
basic tenet of our country and one that this party and Canadians 
outside Quebec will not stand by and allow to be broken apart.
<P>
	Canada stands as a beacon of hope on the planet. It stands as a 
beacon of hope in the global community, a hope for equality, peace 
and tolerance. That is what Canada stands for. Yet the course the 
government is taking is abrogating that and violates the very 
principle of equality we stand for.
<P>
	Rather than leading us down the road of unity, it is leading us 
down the road to disunity. The government is balkanizing the very 
country that stands as a beacon of hope for unity and tolerance that 
is held up by the rest of the world.
<P>
<B>(2255 )</B>
<P>
	The recognition of Quebec as a distinct society is not a benign 
statement. Rather, it enables one province to have special status 
over others. It is first step toward including it in the Constitution. 
Some may argue that it is benign and necessary, but that flies in the 
face of equality for all Canadians.
<P>
	It enhances Quebec's group rights as opposed to the individual 
rights of Quebecers. It would enable an  aggressive Quebec 
provincial government to abrogate its responsibilities and trample 
the rights of the minorities within Quebec. Statements by various 
<P>

<B><A NAME="17344"> 17344 </A></B>
<P>
separatist leaders after the referendum led us to believe nothing 
else than the fact that some of them were racist.
<P>
	Furthermore, the province of Quebec with the distinct society 
could supplant federal policies by using the argument that Quebec 
is one half of Canada and the remainder is the other half. It could 
manipulate federal policies based on that. It is highly iniquitous 
because Canada is made up of ten provinces, not two groups.
<P>
	Unfortunately this and previous governments have not engaged 
in the process of trying to bring Canada together. They have 
engaged in the process of appeasement. There are some glaring 
examples.
<P>
	The federal government gives Quebec $7 billion a year. In fact, 
Ottawa has transferred $160 billion to Quebec over the last 30 
years.
<P>
	Quebec has three seats on the Supreme Court of Canada.
<P>
	Quebec has been allowed to use the notwithstanding clause to 
step on the rights of anglophones within that province. Would 
Quebec tolerate the rest of Canada using the notwithstanding 
clause to do the same thing? I do not think so. Neither would the 
rest of Canada.
<P>
	The rest of Canada has not been trampling on the rights of 
Quebecers. Rather, it has been engaging in the process of 
appeasement. Quite frankly the people in the rest of Canada are fed 
up and will simply not tolerate this any longer. That is why a 
distinct society with a veto is intolerable to the rest of Canada. We 
are hearing, sadly, the nascency of separation in the rest of Canada. 
That is not something about which we should be proud.
<P>
	We are witnessing a tragedy. Canada is being fractured into 
many different groups. People are talking about Canada in a 
defeatist fashion. They are saying we have no vision, no direction, 
no identity and no culture. Some would say that Canada is like a 
rudderless boat in the ocean, buffeted around by circumstances 
beyond her control.
<P>
	I do not accept that. Canada has an identity. Canada has a soul. 
Canada is strong. Canada has courage as we see in our 
peacekeepers. Canada has culture as we see in Celine Dion and the 
Group of Seven. Canada has made scientific contributions through 
Dr. Fraser Mustard.
<P>
	Canada has strength in its people, in their everyday actions. That 
is what has made Canada the great country it is today. They are the 
heroes of Canada. That is the identity of Canada and that is why it 
is held in such high esteem throughout the world. It is our identity. 
It is very clear to those who have travelled to other parts of the 
world. We are not some benign, opaque country without an 
identity. We are a great country.
<P>
	Essential to the unity of a country is the concept that every 
citizen is equal. We are not first anglophones or francophones, 
Quebecers or British Columbians, Afro-Canadians or 
Indo-Canadians. Above all else we are simply Canadians. The 
hyphenated Canadianism we have pursued does not bring us 
together with our differences; it divides us. Our differences, 
whether they be language or culture, do not need to ghettoize us. 
Rather, our differences are something we can cherish. Our 
differences bind us together as citizens and as human beings in a 
common humanity.
<P>
	It irritates me to no end and gets me very angry and also saddens 
me to see our differences used as a way of separating us instead of 
bringing us together. We need to change that now. It requires strong 
leadership for us to do this.
<P>
	To the Prime Minister, stop negotiating with the separatist 
leaders because you will not win. It is a futile action. Bring your 
principles of equality, your principles of understanding and 
tolerance, directly to the people on the ground in Quebec and the 
rest of Canada. Both need to heal. Both need to come together and 
both need to understand each other. You must have again as the 
basis of your decisions equality for all.
<P>
	Constitutional changes must not go to the politicians. They must 
not go to the provinces. They must go directly to the people. 
Constitutional changes must go to a binding national referendum, 
to all Canadians, as it affects us all. It seems the government lacks 
the belief in the people of this country that they would uphold 
tolerance and respect for each other in the decisions they make.
<P>
	The rest of Canada and I am sure the people of Quebec want 
nothing more than to be treated as equals. They want nothing more 
than to live their culture and their language. If we give culture and 
language directly to the provinces, as we must, the people of 
Quebec would be the masters of their own cultural and linguistic 
destinies.
<P>
	That is what they ask for. That is what they must have. That is 
also what the rest of Canada must have. The message we send to 
the people of Quebec and the rest of Canada is this. We stand here 
today simply as proud Canadians with a history, Canadians with a 
future based on our differences, based on what binds us together, 
based on respect and tolerance for each other.
<P>
	It is not a fantasy. It is something we can pursue and achieve. All 
it requires is leadership from here, leadership in the community 
and for all of us to work together to raise Canada to the truly great 
height it can reach.
<P>
