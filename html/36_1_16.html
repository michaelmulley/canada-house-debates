<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>INCOME TAX CONVENTIONS IMPLEMENTATION ACT, 1997

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson (for the Minister of Finance, Lib.)</B> moved 
that Bill C-10, an act to implement a convention between Canada 
and Sweden, a convention between Canada and the Republic of 
Lithuania, a convention between Canada and the Republic of 
Kazakhstan, a convention between Canada and the Republic of 
Iceland and a convention between Canada and the Kingdom of 
Denmark for the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention 
of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income and to amend 
the Canada-Netherlands Income Tax Convention Act, 1986 and the 
Canada-United States Tax Convention Act, 1984, be read the second 
time and referred to a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, I intend to be very brief this morning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We intend to enter into three new tax treaties with Lithuania, 
Kazakhstan and Iceland and we are making revisions to four 
existing taxation treaties, those with the Netherlands, Denmark, 
Sweden and the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada currently has 61 treaties for the avoidance of double 
taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion.  With these three 
new treaties we will be up to 64.  This is very important for 
Canada as a nation which is outward looking and which depends on 
40% of its economic wealth in any one year on its exports, on its 
commerce abroad, on its foreign direct investment and the flows 
of information, capital, technology, royalties, dividends and 
interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In five of the treaties, those with Ireland, Denmark, Lithuania, 
Kazakhstan and Iceland, the major provisions, apart from avoiding 
the double taxation of income, i.e., deciding that if income 
flows from one country to another, which country has the right to 
tax it.  Obviously both countries cannot if we are to have a 
modern world.  Otherwise the rates of tax would easily exceed 
100% of that income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through these treaties one country foregoes the right to tax in 
certain circumstances.  For purposes of simplicity we have 
countries of source and we have countries of destination, usually 
where the recipient is resident.  Will it be the country where 
the income is owned or the country where the recipient is 
resident that will determine the primacy of taxation?  In this 
exercise we have followed the general outlines set out in the 
OECD model convention for the avoidance of double taxation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In five of these treaties, those of Ireland, Denmark, Lithuania, 
Kazakhstan and Iceland, one of the main provisions involves 
reducing the withholding tax that would otherwise be payable by 
the source country, in this case Canada, 25% under the Income Tax 
Act, reducing it down to a level which is far less punitive.  In 
most of these cases we have reduced it to 5% where the foreign 
resident has a controlling or major interest in a Canadian 
corporation.  The rate is often reduced to 10% where interest 
payments go abroad.  In many cases where there are payments on 
government debt, there is no withholding tax whatsoever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the main concerns in bilateral negotiations has been to 
try to reduce the withholding taxes to zero, where they deal with 
royalties on scientific know-how, computer software and things 
which are necessary to produce a modern industrial state. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1110"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT2"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT2"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1110
<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT1"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I regret that in some of these five treaties we are not able to 
get that rate down to zero on such royalties.  However, in the 
treaties with Sweden and Netherlands we have confirmed that we 
will have a zero withholding rate on those types of payments. 
This is significant progress in a world which is increasingly 
dependent on the flows of information and technology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the most important change being made today is with 
respect to the tax treaty with the United States.  Its main 
provision deals with social security benefits which flow across 
the Canada-U.S. border:  a person resident in the United States 
who receives Canada or Quebec pension plan or old age security 
benefits or a person resident in Canada who receives from the 
United States its social security benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just so we understand these provisions I would like to go back 
to the law as it existed prior to 1996.  At that time the country 
paying the benefit did not exercise any taxing jurisdiction or 
taxing power. That taxing power was exercised only in the country 
of residence.  Therefore a person resident in Canada who was 
receiving U.S. social security was taxable in Canada.  The rule 
was that only half of that social security benefit went into the 
resident taxpayer's income but it is obvious to members on all 
sides of the House that this produced unfairness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, if persons resident in Canada were receiving social 
security from the U.S. of say $8,000 they were taxable on only 
$4,000 of it, whereas if they were receiving $8,000 of old age 
security they were taxable on all of it.  This was not equitable 
and not fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore we entered into negotiations with the United States to 
change that law as of January 1, 1996.  We said that rather than 
the country of residence taxing the pensions or the social 
security it would be the country of source.  If a resident of the 
United States received Canada pension plan or OAS, Canada would 
withhold 25% on those payments to the resident in the U.S. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the U.S. person was a low income taxpayer and his or her 
marginal rate of tax was either zero or less than the 25%, Canada 
gave that person the option of filing a tax return in Canada.  To 
the extent that the tax would have been less than that 25% 
withheld by Canada, Canada would give a refund.  It worked well 
for a person resident in the U.S. receiving pension benefits from 
Canada.  On the other hand it did not work so well going the 
other way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The U.S. withheld 25.5% on social security payments going to a 
resident of Canada but it did not allow the Canadian who was in a 
low income or no income bracket to file a U.S. tax return and be 
taxed on a net basis; i.e., to be taxed at less than 25.5%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Accordingly, negotiations were entered into with the United 
States and that is the result of this protocol.  We are saying 
that the country of residence of the taxpayer or the recipient 
now has the exclusive right to tax.  The country paying the 
social security, the United States will forgo its withholding tax 
or Canada will forgo its withholding tax when paid to the United 
States.

<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the resident of Canada will include only 85% of U.S. 
social security in their Canadian income, and a reciprocal right 
applies to residents in the United States receiving pensions from 
Canada.  This means that low income taxpayers are in effect going 
to be taxed on a net basis and it will not be punitive.  This is 
a desirable and hopeful result. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to protect those who might have already suffered or 
paid their taxes, this law, when in effect, will be retroactive 
to January 1, 1996.  To help in the transition, if someone has 
already paid their taxes for 1996 or 1997, we have said that they 
will pay no more taxes than they otherwise would have.  Therefore 
if a person is in a higher bracket than the 25.5% withheld, they 
will not have to pay that for the years 1996 and 1997.  It will 
only be on an ongoing prospective basis that these full rates of 
tax, applicable to domestic or resident taxpayers, are going to 
be applied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also one other amendment that deals with capital gains. 
We know that if a U.S. resident owns real estate or resource 
properties in Canada and disposes of them they would be subject 
to Canadian tax.  Suppose they own those properties through a 
corporation resident in the United States and sell the shares in 
that corporation. It would seem natural that they should not be 
able to get away with something by doing it indirectly through a 
corporation, that they could not get away with it even if they 
owned those properties directly. This is why Canada has always 
had a law in its books which states that where one owns those 
Canadian assets indirectly through a U.S. corporation, they will 
be taxable as if one owned those assets directly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the U.S. does not tax Canadian residents on this basis. 
Accordingly, we have amended the tax convention with the United 
States in order to reflect that both of our laws be brought into 
this more modern mode.  Quite frankly, in terms of administering 
a law when a resident of the U.S. sells the shares of a 
particular company it is very difficult to look behind that 
corporate shell and find out what all the assets are.  In a 
modern world this does not make a lot of sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very pleased to say that we have settled this issue of 
transporter pensions or social security in a way that is fairest 
to those who have the lowest income and whose tax rates would 
otherwise be under the 25.5% U.S. rate or the 25% Canadian rate 
when they are taxed on a net basis.  This is a desirable result. 
It is fair and is evidence of the ongoing good co-operation and 
strong relationship between our two countries.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I rise on behalf of the official opposition to address Bill C-10, 
an act to implement a convention between Canada and various 
conventions between the countries of Sweden, Lithuania, 
Kazakhstan, Iceland and Denmark for the avoidance of double 
taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion and also to amend 
the 1986 Canada-Netherlands Income Tax Act and the 1984 
Canada-U.S. Tax Convention Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the outset I would like to make clear that the official 
opposition supports the proposed conventions with Sweden, 
Lithuania, Kazakhstan, Iceland and Denmark.  We have no objection 
to the essentially housekeeping amendments made to the 
Canada-Netherlands Income Tax Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the government did try to seek our consent and that of 
the other opposition parties to rush this bill through the House, 
which is often the case in technical bills involving housekeeping 
amendments of this nature. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1120"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT4"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT4"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1120

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a good thing that we as opposition MPs sometimes look a 
little below the surface to find something very suspicious and 
nefarious lurking beneath the surface of such technical bills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed such a nefarious section exists in this bill with respect 
to the tax treatment of social security payments to Canadian 
residents from the U.S. social security fund.  Schedule section 
of part VII of Bill C-10 deals with those payments which the hon. 
minister just addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in reviewing the government's rationale for amending 
the treatment of taxation of social security payments received by 
Canadian residents, the minister left out a few very pertinent 
facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He implied that somehow these change being made from the third 
protocol agreed on by this government in 1995 to the protocol 
that was signed in April by representatives of the American and 
Canadian governments would somehow increase tax fairness and 
provide tax relief for lower income resident Canadian seniors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That really is not the full picture.  What the minister forgot 
to mention was that tax treaty, the 1985 third protocol which 
imposed a 25% flat withholding tax for social security payments 
coming to Canadian residents, was negotiated and agreed on by 
this government, the very government whose members are saying 
that it was an unfair agreement.  Indeed it was. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us back up a couple of steps and give the government a bit 
of a history lesson when it comes to how it has treated these 
80,000-some seniors who have received U.S. social security 
payments in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Originally since the 1984 U.S.-Canada Income Tax Convention Act, 
50% of social security payments to Canadian residents could be 
included for purposes of Canadian taxation.  That made a lot of 
sense because it was the same treatment that U.S. recipients of 
social security have. That is to say, 50% of their social 
security payments were included for the purposes of taxation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1992 the U.S. government under one of the Liberals' 
ideological allies, Bill Clinton, decided it was going to raise 
taxes on seniors. It did that by raising the total maximum 
inclusion rate for U.S. social security benefits from 50 to 85% 
so that theoretically wealthier seniors were paying more tax on 
their social security benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following that, this government entered into negotiations with 
the Americans to produce the third protocol, which did not create 
a parallel system with the American treatment of the taxation 
social security benefits. Instead what they did was impose this 
25.5% flat withholding tax on those payments being made to 
Canadian seniors and American residents of Canada.  That was 
devastating.  It had an absolutely devastating impact, 
particularly on low income seniors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the members from the government who come from the 
Windsor area in particular where many of these taxpayers are 
concentrated know of what I speak.  It put many of the lowest 
income seniors there into terribly dire straits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of the lowest income seniors saw their tax bills rise by 
$1,000 to $2,000, people on fixed incomes, people who do not have 
the resources to hire tax accountants or lawyers or specialists 
to advise them on this kind of change.  Suddenly it appeared, 
even after the government made commitments that no one would pay 
more taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. deputy prime minister, a member from the Windsor area, 
indicated in several public statements on the record that the 
1985 protocol would not result in a tax increase for any Canadian 
resident. He was wrong.  He was completely wrong because every 
Canadian receiving U.S. social security payments saw a 
significant increase in their tax bill.  The government was wrong 
then and it is wrong again today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those seniors lost trust in this government's ability to protect 
their interests in negotiating the 1985 treaty.  As a result 
there was a lot of political heat felt by this government.  They 
went back to the table and they renegotiated it, and today we are 
analysing the result of that negotiation.

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened? Once again this government sold Canadian seniors 
down the river by raising the inclusion rate of U.S. social 
security payments from 50%, as it was before 1985, to 85%.  That 
is a 70% increase in the inclusion rate.  That is a 70% increase 
in the taxes that seniors who receive U.S. payments will have to 
pay the Canadian government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals call this fairness.  They say this is revenue 
neutral.  It is not.  If more seniors pay more taxes than they 
used to, that is a tax grab. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know this government has a problem when it comes to 
accounting.  By adding $100 billion to the federal debt it claims 
to have somehow balanced the budget.  It thinks adding debt means 
fiscal responsibility, that increasing taxes equals tax fairness. 
It is more of the same old Liberal tax, spend and borrow game 
that we see in section 7 of part VII of Bill C-10. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very serious matter and I hope the government listens 
closely.  We have received representations from an organization 
representing thousands of Canadian resident seniors, the 
Canadians asking for social security equality.  They point out to 
us the kind of very serious dire straits that older Canadians 
fell into as a result of the 25% flat withholding tax, unfair tax 
grab, imposed by this government in the 1985 treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They made representations to the government to make changes so 
they could get back to revenue neutrality with the pre-1985 tax 
rules.  Instead they get a 70% tax increase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government will say these changes are fair because Canadian 
taxpayers who receive Canada pension plan and OAS, now seniors 
benefits, have an inclusion rate of 100%.  They are right. 
Liberals must be happy that seniors have to get shaken down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What they are doing under the proposed seniors benefit changes 
is to deeply penalize middle income seniors in particular who 
have acted responsibly to save for their retirement by imposing 
massive taxes on their income from private savings.  That is what 
they are doing under the seniors benefit.  They are doing very 
much the same thing under this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government will argue, as have several of the members from 
the Windsor area, that the 100% inclusion rate for CPP payments 
to Canadian residents is somehow a precedent for these Canadian 
residents receiving U.S. social security payments.  On the face 
of it, it seems like a reasonable enough argument.  We want 
fairness.  Everybody should be treated the same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a difference here.  Canadians are not taxed on the 
payments they make to the Canada pension plan.  The so-called 
premiums, premiums which the government will be raising by 73% 
between now and the year 2003, are deductible from the taxes we 
pay.  They are not included as taxable income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The U.S. government treats its taxpayers differently.  They do 
not get to deduct the cost of their social security premiums paid 
to the U.S. treasury.  They are taxed at source on those 
payments.  That is why Americans do not have a 100% inclusion 
rate for social security benefits.  They have decided for policy 
reasons to tax that pension system at the front end when the 
taxpayer earns the money and pays into the system rather than 
when he retires and collects from it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine the case of a hard working Canadian taxpayer who goes 
across the border to find gainful employment in the United States 
because there are not enough jobs in Canada.  Under American law 
a portion of their paycheque is taken off at source and sent to 
the U.S. federal treasury to fund their social security benefits. 
They do not get to write the cost of that off against the taxes 
they pay.  They are paying taxes on those premiums and they make 
their retirement plans based on that income.  Of course most of 
these people are seniors on modest fixed incomes.  Then finally 
along comes their retirement and what happens?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If they were residents of the United States they would be faced 
with a very small tax on the social security benefits they 
receive.  In fact anyone in the United States who earns up to the 
equivalent amount of $40,800 Canadian as a senior would pay no 
taxes on their social security benefits, none, zero, zip. There 
are no taxes for low income seniors on their social security 
benefits. If they earned a little bit more, if their income was a 
little higher, then for middle or higher income seniors somewhere 
between 50% and 85% of their social security benefits would be 
taxable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Americans have built a progressive scale into their tax 
system for social security benefits. There is progressivity and 
fairness.  The wealthy would pay more, 85% of their social 
security benefits are what they would pay taxes on. But the poor 
would pay nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government has created a double standard for Canadian 
residents earning the same social security benefits.  Not only 
did they have to pay taxes on their social security premiums when 
they were working, now they will have to pay taxes on 85% of the 
social security benefits regardless of whether they bring in 
$10,000 a year or a million dollars a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government loves to lambaste our American friends for 
unfair taxes.  This government prides itself on being the paragon 
of fairness when it comes to taxation, but it has created this 
gross double standard.  It is going to double tax Canadian 
residents who happen to have worked in the United States, who 
have been taxed once by the U.S. government on their payments 
into the social security plan.  They will now be taxed again 
regardless of their income level and 85% of their social security 
benefits will be included for purposes of Canadian taxation. That 
is not fair. That is what is called a tax grab and it is 
something the government is going to pay a serious political 
price for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the so-called fairness of these changes if you 
were a recipient of social security benefits in the United States 
earning $30,000.  What would have happened under the 1985 tax 
treaty this government brought in, if you were a Canadian living 
in Canada collecting U.S. social security benefits, the 1985 tax 
treaty which it is trying to change added $1,300 to the tax bill. 
If you were a senior earning $30,000 the changes brought in in 
1985 would have added $2,000 to your tax bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spoke to some seniors from the Windsor area on the telephone 
today who indicated that the flat 25% tax imposed by the 
government in the past tax treaty added $2,000 to their tax bill. 
This is not just a number, not just a figure.  It is real money 
out of the pockets of real people, affecting their lives, making 
them poor, putting many of them in distress. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard stories of seniors receiving social security 
benefits in Canada who had to leave their apartments, who had to 
sell their cars and could not drive to the grocery store and who 
could not afford cabs.  I understand there is a member of the 
government from Windsor who actually should be commended for 
volunteering to drive some of these seniors to the grocery store 
because they cannot afford a cab because of the $2,000 tax grab 
agreed to by the government in the last tax treaty.  It was not 
fair, not right.  It was a tax grab so the government tried to 
change the rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happens now?  The government grabs more.  Under the new 
treaty, under the fourth protocol that we are debating in Bill 
C-10 today, the same seniors will again see an increase in the 
taxes payable on their U.S. social security payments.  In fact 
somebody earning $30,000 a year will pay over $3,000 more than 
they did in 1985.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about seniors on a fixed income of $30,000 a year 
who will see 10% of their gross income disappear because of the 
70% increase in the inclusion rate proposed by Bill C-10.  That 
is fairness?  They call that fairness? I call it a rip-off, a 
rip-off on top of 36 tax increases imposed by this government 
since it came to power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the example of a Canadian resident with a gross 
income of just over $40,000.  What happens to him?  In the United 
States he would only pay an inclusion rate of 50%, not 85% as in 
Canada.  The marginal tax rate would only be 32% but as a 
resident of Canada he would pay $2,600 more than he would if he 
were a resident of the United States.  That is how we are 
treating our seniors and I think it is shameful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government will claim again and the finance minister has 
said in correspondence with me that these changes are necessary, 
that the 50% exemption was in the tax treaty because when the 
treaty was signed that was how the U.S. taxed its own residents' 
social security income.  True enough.  If that is how the U.S. 
government treats its residents, why are we treating people who 
paid into that system differently?  Why do they have to pay 85% 
of their income into this system? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As people from Canadians Asking for Social Security Equality 
have said, this is a massive tax grab.  They just want an 
amendment so they will get the same treatment they had under the 
pre-1985 rules.  That seems reasonable enough to us.  So that 
they do pay their fair share but not a penny more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government's idea of tax fairness is that everybody pays 
more. My idea of tax fairness and tax efficiency and a growing 
economy is a system where Canadians get a bit of a tax break.  It 
is a system that acknowledges that Canadians have worked all 
their lives and it will not penalize them for saving.  They have 
saved all their lives and they will not get penalized for trying 
to live out a reasonable retirement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I repeat that this is from a government that has imposed 36 tax 
increases on Canadians, tax increases that have amounted to $24 
billion in additional revenues as of last year.  It is from a 
government that now imposes a tax burden of 46% on the average 
Canadian family.  This is a government that has presided over 
four straight years of shrinking after-tax family income.  The 
government calls that a record of economic growth.  I call it a 
record to be ashamed of.  This is a government that has presided 
because of those tax increases, because of that shrinking family 
income over 9% unemployment, over 17% youth unemployment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now in Bill C-10 which we are considering today the government 
is attacking Canadian residents who are receiving U.S. social 
security payments.  Under the proposed amendments to the Canada 
pension plan the government is attacking younger Canadians by 
imposing on all working Canadians a 73% increase in their CPP 
premiums.  This will give self-employed Canadians a $3,600 tax 
bill for their CPP premiums, money that people of my generation 
know we are likely never to receive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a government that is proposing, in its amendments to the 
seniors benefit, tax increases which would severely penalize 
middle income seniors for having acted responsibly and for having 
saved for their retirement.  And today again it proposes yet 
another tax increase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My message to the government is to listen to Canadians who are 
speaking out about this and who are asking for fairness.  Even 
the finance minister made an admission in a letter to me dated 
September 22 by saying “I can understand some recipients are not 
in favour of the new agreement”.  Why is that?  It means that 
after 1997 they may have to pay more tax than they did in the 
past.  The finance minister admits it.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1985 the deputy prime minister said that the proposed tax 
treaty would be revenue neutral.  He was wrong.  I will not say 
that he lied because that would be unparliamentary.  He just did 
not tell the whole truth.  Whether he knew it or not, he did not 
tell the whole truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We just heard the hon. minister say that this would not increase 
anybody's taxes, that it would bring taxes down for lower income 
Canadians but I have here in my hand a letter from the finance 
minister contradicting that statement.  The Minister of Finance 
has admitted that Canadians are opposed to it because it will 
mean a tax increase for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Which is it?  Is it fairness or is it an increase?  Is it a tax 
cut or is it a tax grab?  I guess we will have to trust the word 
of the hon. Minister of Finance when he says that it is a tax 
grab. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a question.  I am sorry I did not have a chance to ask 
the minister this question, but there was no question and comment 
period.  Somewhere in the labyrinthine hallways of the Ministry 
of Finance surely somebody sitting at a computer terminal has 
crunched the numbers as to how many more millions of tax dollars 
the government will squeeze out of low and middle income seniors 
to satisfy its insatiable demand for tax dollars through Bill 
C-10.  Surely they know what the dollar figure is. Why have they 
not disclosed that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My challenge to any government member speaking on this bill 
today is to tell us how much money they are squeezing out of the 
poor seniors with this bill.  How many millions of dollars will 
there be on top of the billions of dollars they have already 
squeezed out of Canadians, 
on top of the billions they plan to squeeze out of 
seniors benefits, on top of the $10 billion they plan to squeeze 
out of the Canada pension plan? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It may not mean a lot to the millionaires who populate the front 
benches of the government and it may not mean a lot to ordinary 
members who get $5 out of every dollar they put into their gold 
plated MP pension plan.  However a $2,000 tax increase for a 
Canadian resident senior earning only $30,000 a year means a lot. 
It can make the difference between living a reasonable 
retirement and a retirement stuck in poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sick and tired of the government prattling on about tax 
fairness when again and again it means higher taxes for the 
people least able to defend themselves, least able to hire tax 
lawyers and accountants who populate the Liberal Party, least 
able to handle this kind of cut to their income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call on my colleagues opposite to look at this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no doubt that when government members walked into the 
government lobby this morning, government hacks were there 
handing them their speaking notes.  They will dutifully stand up 
today and read word for word, verbatim, about how this bill is about 
fairness and how it is just an innocuous housekeeping amendment. 
That is what we will hear from those members today. They do it 
time and again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance ministry, as always, will frame the 
amendments and the legislation working behind closed doors with 
the minister while the backbenchers are left in the dark not 
knowing what is really in the bill. When they show up in the 
House they are presented with 138 pages of technical legislation. 
They are given their speaking notes.  They have not read the 
bill.  They have not looked beneath the surface of those speaking 
notes to ask the minister questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But seniors are asking us questions, not just members of the 
opposition but members of the government. They are pleading for 
the sake of their retirement for the MPs opposite to take this 
seriously and not to bluff it off as just another government 
bill, another technical housekeeping amendment because it is not 
that. Over 80,000 Canadian seniors are going to see their taxes 
go up over what they paid in 1985.  That is not fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why will members opposite not look beneath the surface?  Why 
will they not throw away the scripted notes they have been given 
by bureaucrats in the finance department, which some of them are 
reviewing at this very moment?  Why will they not speak for 
themselves and their constituents rather than for the bureaucrats 
in the finance department? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the challenge of democracy.  That is the challenge of 
representation.  That is the challenge this government again and 
again has failed to meet with its massive tax increases which 
have reduced hope for older Canadians and younger Canadians and 
which have given us a 9% stagnant unemployment rate for 86 
straight months.  That is the economic record of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are very sly.  The Mulroney government used to get heat all 
the time for any little change like this one because the Liberals 
were very good opposition members.  Mr. Speaker, I think you know 
that from experience.  They pointed out tiny tax increases hidden 
in complicated bills like this one and the Mulroney government 
paid a price for it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government is very slick.  It has lots of high 
priced PR hacks telling it how to hide these sorts of things from 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I put the government on notice today.  On behalf of all Canadian 
taxpayers the official opposition party—and I think the other ones—will 
not let these kinds of things slide through any more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government approached us and asked us to fast track the 
bill, to consider it in committee of the whole and to let it go 
in one day, hoping that the 85,000 Canadians who will face a tax 
increase would not notice it.  That is what it tried to do, but 
it will not get away with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will take it to committee.  We will draw out debate.  We will 
bring witnesses before the finance committee, the same seniors 
who will be so deeply affected in their lives by the bill.  Those 
Canadians will not tolerate this kind of completely irresponsible 
approach to democratic deliberation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say again that my hon. colleagues opposite should take a look 
at the facts.  I would be happy to get unanimous consent of the 
House to table a chart prepared by Mr. Bruck Easton, a tax and 
commercial lawyer from Ontario, in which he compares the relative 
taxation of U.S. social security payments to Canadians using 
comparable U.S. rates.  It demonstrates conclusively the tax 
changes proposed under the protocol included in Bill C-10 will 
levy a massive tax grab on a small number of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A small number of Canadians, no more than 85,000, are affected by the 
bill.  They do not have, as I 
mentioned earlier, high priced tax lawyers.  They do not have 
high priced lobbyists like former Liberal cabinet ministers 
working for them to get access to decision makers in the 
government.  They do not have anybody at their beck and call on a 
$5,000 a day retainer who can call up Mr. Goldenberg or other 
officials in the prime minister's office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was talking to a representatives of the organization today.  I 
asked him to urgently fax me some critical information for this 
debate.  He had to drive three miles just to get to a fax machine 
to fax something here.  These people are not equipped like the 
special interest group, the big business lobby friends of the 
government opposite, to object to bills like this one.  All they 
have is a bit left over which the government lets them keep, a 
bit to contribute to this kind of fight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of the seniors are of an age and in a condition of health 
where they do not know what will happen to them.  What 
happens is that they get their cheques and the cheques have 
shrunk; they are smaller.  They look at their tax return and 
wonder what has happened because their income is $2,500 less than 
it was four years ago.  That is a good question members opposite 
will have to answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There may be only 85,000 Canadian resident taxpayers affected by 
the bill but each and every one of them as a taxpayer has a right 
to object to do so. The government 
will be hearing from people like them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I plead with government members not to listen to backroom boys 
in the ministry of finance.  They should listen to their 
constituents, listen to Canadians asking for social security 
equality, and listen to taxpayers who asking to keep a bit more 
of their money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The attitude of the government as with all Liberal governments 
is that it is the government's money.  Somehow it is the 
property of the Government of Canada, if not the 
Liberal Party of Canada.  This money belongs to Canadians.  When 
the government raises taxes on particularly hard pressed seniors, 
as it is proposing to do in the bill, it suggests that those 
people do not need the money and that the government needs it 
more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To do what?  To lavish billions upon billions of dollars on 
special interest group handouts and subsidies to its big business 
friends.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask members opposite to reveal to the House and to taxpayers 
exactly how much they expect to squeeze out of Canadian 
recipients of U.S. social security payments through the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suspect the amount is probably less than the $100 million the 
government decided to give earlier this year to its billionaire 
friends at Bombardier, a company that has donated hundreds of 
thousands of dollars to the already overflowing coffers of the 
Liberal Party of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How many other hundreds of millions of dollars have been handed 
out to big business, corporate friends of the government?  Who is 
forced to pay for it?  Not those very same corporations but 
retired seniors trying to get by on $12,000 or $20,000 or $30,000 
a year.  That is where the money is going.  I say shame on the 
government for having its priorities so desperately wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the government really in favour of fairness and equality 
which it prattles on about ceaselessly?  The hacks in the 
various government departments who write their scripted speeches 
have, I think, a very limited vocabulary because the word fairness appears 
about 18 times in every scripted speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If they really had an understanding of the concept of fairness 
in a modern liberal democracy, they would exercise it in the way 
they act and not in just what they say in political speeches. 
They would exercise the concept of fairness by saying to the same 
seniors they are persecuting in the bill today that they would be 
willing to give up, or at least retroactively reform 
their gold plated, taxpayer subsidized MP 
pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know they will not do that.  We know their concept of 
fairness starts with taxing Canadians more and taking more out of 
the public trough for themselves and their big business friends. 
That is not fairness.  I call that unfairness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to close by asking the party opposite to consider 
seriously the effect this bill will have.  We will be proposing a 
minor amendment to the bill at committee stage to clarify article 
2, paragraph 5 of article XVIII of the 1984 Canada-U.S. Income 
Tax Convention Act.  It is a very simple amendment that would 
make clear the inclusion rate for U.S. social security payments 
to Canadians could not exceed the same level imposed on American 
recipients of the same benefit.  There would not be double 
taxation or unfairness.  Those seniors would be treated the same 
way, as if they were paying taxes in the country where they 
earned the benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government agrees to the amendment, many tens of 
thousands of Canadian seniors will be very grateful and will be 
better off for it.  Their lives will be better.  They will be 
less hard pressed.  They will be able to do more for themselves, 
for their families and for their grandchildren. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appeal to the genuine humane instincts of members 
opposite to look beneath the surface of the bill and to ask the 
Minister of Finance about it in caucus on Wednesday.  They will 
get a chance to do so because we did not agree to fast track the 
bill and are pushing for debate.  They should ask him, as he 
confirms in his letter to me, whether it increases taxes on poor 
seniors, to what extent it does so, and how many more millions of 
dollars will come into the public treasury as a result.  When he says yes, 
why not ask the minister to agree to the amendment we will be 
proposing to establish tax fairness for these hard pressed 
Canadian seniors?

</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur: Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak on Bill 
C-10.  It makes a bit of a change from being official Bloc Quebecois 
critic for justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-10 is extremely important.  It affects a number of  my 
constituents in Berthier-Montcalm, and particularly in the Rawdon 
area.  That municipality is home to a number of retired persons from 
nearly all parts of Quebec. 
In particular, there is a concentration of anglophones who—while 
remaining Canadians' worked in the United States when they were 
younger, and have now come to the Berthier—Montcalm area to 
retire and have made Rawdon their home.

<A HREF="#LINKT10"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was made aware of the problem as far back as 1995.  It is a rather 
significant one, because retired people do not have the same income as 
they did while working.  These people were heavily penalized because 
of the conventions betwen Canada and the United States, which did not 
work very well.  Taxes had to be paid to both sides and they ended up 
being penalized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our interventions on this date back to 1995.  The problem was raised 
here in this House. 
The government was challenged on  it. François Langlois, the Bloc 
member for Bellechasse at the time,  did an extraordinary job with 
this question.  He got it debated on several occasions, both in 
committee and in this House.  Speaking for both the Bloc Quebecois and 
myself, François Mercier is owed a vote of thanks for the work he has 
done on this matter.  He is back home now, not having been re-elected 
in 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another Bloc Quebecois member, the hon. Member for 
Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, has been 
involved with this matter since 1995 and is still responsible for it. 
He defends constituents faced with this problem anywhere in Quebec in 
an exemplary manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should say first of all that the Bloc Quebecois supports Bill 
C-10 before us. It resolves the questions we have had since 1995 
and also the concerns of our constituents faced with this 
problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, there are a number of parts to this bill. I have some 
constructive criticism, given the importance of the subject. Part 
VII of the bill contains the rules for American pensions. Given 
our geographic position, the history of the two countries, which 
have long been friends, our close relations with the United 
States, there are many economic relations between the United 
States and Canada, much more than, say, between Lithuania and 
Canada or Iceland and Canada, to mention just those two countries 
also included in Bill C-10. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To speed up the entire process, given the importance of 
relations between Quebeckers or Canadians and Americans, I think 
the government should have drafted the treaty for American 
pensions specifically, dealing with the problem of taxable income 
between the taxable incomes in Canada and the United States, to 
acclerate the adoption process and prevent ambiguity with other 
parties to settle the issue once and for all. But Bill C-10 also 
includes other conventions. Parts I to V refer to Sweden, 
Lithuania, Kazakhstan, Iceland, Denmark, the Netherlands and, of 
course, the United States. It is like trying to hide the most 
pressing problem in a bill that is more complex than it needs to 
be to solve the most urgent problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This will not prevent the Bloc Quebecois from supporting the 
bill, but had the government listened to us in 1995 and 1996, if 
the government had drafted a specific bill to resolve the most 
important problem, that is, a convention between Canada and 
United States, the problem would now be solved. People who should 
get refunds would have them, and we would be in a very different 
situation where we could be talking about conventions with other 
countries, not less important, but with whom our dealings are 
less important in terms of the objective of pensions for people 
having worked abroad who retire in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I was saying earlier, the purpose of parts I to V is to 
implement tax conventions with all the countries I listed 
earlier, except the Netherlands and the United States. 
Part VI concerns the Netherlands, and part VII concerns the 
United States, our neighbours to the South.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These conventions are basically the same, and are largely 
patterned on the OECD model. They are standard conventions with 
which Canada is familiar because it often enacts similar 
conventions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What surprised me when I looked into this matter, 
because I had this problem pointed out to me in my riding and we 
discussed it in the Bloc Quebecois caucus, is that in April 
1997—and this was confirmed in the joint committee on banking, 
trade and commerce—there were 57 tax conventions in effect 
between Canada and various countries and 34 pending or under 
negotiation. Of the 57 treaties in effect, many are quite old, do 
not necessarily meet OECD standards or were not concluded in the 
way Canada now concludes such treaties. 
In other words, 
Canada has a great many tax treaties like this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is good to 
have these treaties between countries when the goal is to ensure 
fair and equitable tax treatment of residents and non-residents. 
It is also good to have treaties when the goal is to encourage 
trade and investment between countries.  But we must prevent 
these treaties from becoming smoke screens for abusive tax 
avoidance. I will not mention shipping companies under flags of 
convenience to avoid paying taxes in Canada and Quebec. Not will 
I talk about the scandal we saw in the House, involving both 
Liberals and Conservatives, because both of them were equally 
involved in the family trust affair. We heard a lot about that 
during the 35th Parliament. Shall I talk about that?  The 
member opposite is looking at me and might be interested in these 
things. 
I will talk about them after all, as I have the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is said 
that tax conventions—the member opposite is smiling, he wants me 
to get into this, I found him a bit deadpan today, but his smile 
is a sign that it is important that I speak about this—encourage 
trade and commerce, but care must be taken not to abuse such 
treaties. Companies making hundreds of millions of dollars in 
profits can hire good lawyers, good tax experts knowledgeable in 
Canadian taxation. They pay then with what they get through 
existing legislation. It's quite legal, nothing is illegal. But 
there has been abuse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first example I 
gave—I did not want to get into this, but I am being encouraged 
to speak—is Canada Steamship Lines. 
As for tax conventions being used as a means to reduce one's tax 
liability in Canada, the example comes from high above. I am 
referring, unfortunately, to the current Minister of Finance. A 
newspaper article—this is not a figment of my imagination—indicates 
an in-depth study of the company was done, and the 
finance minister is taking advantage of tax conventions with 
countries considered as tax havens, such as Bermuda, Liberia, 
Barbados, and in 1981, when the finance minister became the owner 
of Canada Steamship Lines, this shipping company was conducting 
the same sort of business, but under the Canadian flag. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the study released in  <I>Le Soleil </I> revealed, and this 
was later confirmed by many, that between 1981 and 1994 the 
company set up three subsidiaries in Bermuda and three more in 
Liberia. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1205"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT13"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT13"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1205

<A HREF="#LINKT12"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also learned that 
since 1994 the GST group established seven more subsidiaries in 
Barbados. According to tax experts, Liberia, Barbados and Bermuda 
are among the countries where the tax man is most complacent 
toward companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All this to say that  when we make abusive use of legal tax 
conventions, as the finance minister did, such treaties serve 
essentially the same purpose and allow the awarding of the same 
contracts as before 1981, before the finance minister took over 
the company, but now the ships fly the flags of countries experts 
consider as tax havens.  Why?  Simply to avoid paying taxes, or 
to pay as little as possible.  It is rather clear. Existing tax 
treaties are used in such a way as to benefit the wealthy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other example mentioned by the Bloc Quebecois during the 
35th Parliament is the whole issue of family trusts. One day, in 
May 1996, we learned from the auditor general that there were 
serious concerns as to how the Income Tax Act had been applied to 
transfers abroad of at least $2 billion in assets held in trust 
funds in Canada.  With the complicity of  the Department, with 
the complicity of both the Liberals and the Conservatives, 
because both parties had a hand in this, $2 billion were 
transferred to the U.S. without a cent being paid in taxes, all 
this perfectly legally, again because of the tax treaties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the kind of tax treaties on which we must focus to try 
to plug loopholes as much as possible, so that each and every 
citizen of this country, in Quebec as well as in Canada, pay 
their fair share of taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are two very important examples. Given the extensive 
number of  tax treaties between Canada and various countries, one 
might expect that in signing such treaties a responsible 
government would assign appropriate resources to evaluating, 
adjusting and renegotiating tax conventions that present 
problems, especially with countries representing the greatest 
risk of tax losses for Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a riddle for you this morning. Guess how many 
employees are assigned to tax treaties in the finance department. 
How many employees work on these treaties? There are 57 treaties 
that have been signed so far and, as of April 1997, there were 
another 34 pending.  Probably several of these have already been 
signed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All in all, there must be approximately 100 treaties. So, in the 
federal administration, this big machine, how many employees are 
monitoring these treaties, ensuring that they are reviewed and 
that amendments are made if mistakes are found, if the loopholes 
are too great for tax fairness?  How many? A hundred, 
twenty-five, twelve?  We have learned that there is only one in 
charge of seeing to these conventions.  Fortunately, this is a full 
time job.  However, he is alone, and billions of dollars are at 
stake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not questioning the skills of this employee, whom I 
actually find very courageous to tackle this task on his own, 
without asking for any help. On the other hand, I wonder how 
serious the government is about seeing that these treaties are 
properly implemented.  I think that in a case such as this one, 
it is not a matter of saying that the government  is just 
ignoring the implementation of such treaties. 
I think that, by having one public servant for a hundred or so 
treaties, the government is deliberately turning a blind eye and 
a deaf ear to what is going on with all these international 
treaties.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Are you aware that Canada spent more on the visit by 
the Queen of England than on auditing tax treaties à an example I 
have chosen because it is in today's news.  Speaking of  royal 
visits, I am sure the Queen of England must now be recovering 
from the visit to India, which seens to have been a trial for 
her. This is just to show that the government is not necessarily 
investing in the right place. 
Perhaps more public servants need to be assigned to keeping a 
serious eye on all these international treaties, which are 
essentially good things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe there must be international 
treaties.  There must be legislation to protect the most 
disadvantaged, as Part VII of this bill does.  The Bloc Quebecois 
initiated it in 1995.  It is right for there to be tax 
conventions to solve the problems of Canadians residents and 
non-residents having once worked in the United States, but these 
havens and tax conventions should not be abused. To avoid this, 
there must be a minimum follow-up, and that is provided by civil 
servants, investigations, people responsible for these 
conventions' application. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To conclude, the Bloc 
Quebecois supports Bill C-10.  We do, however, call upon the 
government to take subsequent follow-up far more seriously. 
We are calling upon the government, in light of what is at stake, 
the billions of  dollars involved—big bucks here—and in light 
of the fact that most often it is companies who make use of tax 
conventions, and they can afford top notch lawyers and 
tax experts, to have enough resources, civil servants to do a 
good job, a very good one, of following up on the application of 
these international treaties.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want 
to say a few words on Bill C-10 that implements tax treaties and 
tax conventions with a number of countries such as Sweden, 
Lithuania, Denmark and the former Soviet Republic of Kazakhstan. 
It also amends tax treaties or conventions with the United States 
and the Netherlands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is fairly lengthy and detailed. For the most part the 
NDP agrees with what is being done.  Primarily it is a 
housekeeping bill.  It prevents double taxation in many cases. It 
also prevents fiscal evasion by citizens. In the main we support 
the direction in which the bill is going. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do have one major concern and that is with part 7 of the 
bill.  That is the amendment to the convention with the United 
States.  It concerns over 80,000 people who receive social 
security benefits from the United States but who reside in 
Canada. What is happening to them is unfair because it is being 
done retroactively.  That is the part of the bill which we as 
parliamentarians should look at changing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Until 1996 when Canadians received social security payments from 
the United States, and a lot of these people reside in the area 
of Windsor, Ontario, they were taxed on 50% of their social 
security payments.

<A HREF="#LINKT14"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a system that was in use in this country for many years. 
It was under that understanding and under that law that people 
made their retirement plans and did the financial planning for 
their families.  That is what it was based on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then in November 1995 the government introduced Bill S-9 in the 
Senate.  That bill introduced a very important change.  The 
Canadian government would not collect taxes on social security 
payments but instead there would be, in effect, a withholding tax 
taken off the paycheques of Canadian citizens by the American 
government.  The withholding tax rate is 25.5%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was a big drop in income for many citizens.  It happened 
very quickly, without proper consultation, maybe without any 
consultation with these citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a lot of legitimate protest after the passage of that 
bill because it unfairly attacked the incomes of 85,000 Canadians 
who had done their retirement planning and had based their 
livelihood on a set of rules in place when they were working in 
the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The protest continued for a fair amount of time.  Last April the 
government made the announcement that there would be change. 
Indeed that change has been made in the bill which is before the 
House today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now instead of the United States taking off the withholding tax 
of 25.5%, the government in the country where the citizen resides 
will be taxing the citizen on the social security payment; in 
other words, the Canadian government in this case.  On the flip 
side of the coin, the American government will tax American 
citizens receiving the Canada pension plan or the Quebec pension 
plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the government did not do was go back to the pre-1995 
taxation level which was on 50% of the social security payments. 
Instead the government will be taxing 85% of the social security 
benefits, 85% instead of the previous 50%.  One could 
make the argument that this is, in many cases, better than it was 
a year or so ago but it is still not nearly as good as it was 
prior to 1995.  This is very unfair.  This was done without 
properly consulting the people who are affected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an organization called CASSE, Canadians asking for 
social security equality, which is involved in this issue.  It 
has lobbied on this issue.  It made this issue an important one, 
particularly in the Windsor area for the election of June 2. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These citizens were not properly consulted.  They certainly did 
not approve the change.  For these people the change is not good 
enough.  They did their planning based on the rules.  The rules 
were changed after the game was played.  Now we are in the world 
series and all of a sudden there is a lot of interest in 
baseball.  If a team wins or loses that is nullified because the 
rules were changed after the game was played.  It is extremely 
unfair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The very least the government should do is grandfather this 
particular part of the bill so it will not affect people who are 
already retired.  Those people have already planned their lives. 
They have already purchased their retirement home.  They have 
already budgeted for their groceries and clothing.  It should be 
grandfathered so it does not affect the people who have retired. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like many other tax bills, if the government wants to go in this 
direction and it can make a case, then of course it is not unfair 
in terms of people who are still working not being notified 
because the rules are there.  It is a different situation 
altogether.  We can then argue, of course, whether a tax on 85% 
is too high or too low. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first option is to go back to the way the rules were prior 
to 1995.  These people should be taxed on 50% of their social 
security income. The second point I want to make is that, at the 
very least, it should be grandfathered so that retirees will not 
have the rules changed after they have done their planning.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to make a couple of other remarks about the bill 
before us today and the general issue of tax fairness in this 
country.  I remember the 1993 election campaign when the Liberal 
Party talked about abolishing the GST, about getting rid of that 
goods and services tax.  All of a sudden the party was in power 
and there was no action on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to urge the government, something which our party has 
been doing, to eliminate the GST entirely from children's 
clothing and books. That would be a good step in the right 
direction toward tax fairness.   It would reduce taxes by about a 
billion dollars in a targeted sense on many people who are the 
least able to pay for taxes in Canada.  At the same time it would 
also stimulate some employment in terms of circulating more money 
in the economy. That is the kind of thing that should be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was rather amused this morning as I listened to the Reform 
Party critic for national revenue as he waxed eloquent in the 
House about the need for tax fairness, to get rid of tax grabs 
and tax increases. You would think he was thinking about all 
those ordinary people, those ordinary citizens, those mainstream 
Canadians who have difficulty making a living in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On October 1 in Parliament that member was asked the following 
question:  “Mr. Speaker, does the hon. member really believe we 
have tax fairness in this country, that the Conrad Blacks and 
other wealthy people pay their fair share of taxes?”  He replied 
that they, meaning the Conrad Blacks and other multimillionaires, 
“pay more than their fair share of taxes”.  What a shame, they 
pay more than their fair share of taxes.  The Reform Party thinks 
that Conrad Black and multimillionaires are overtaxed in this 
country, that they are paying too much and that if we reduce 
taxes for them we would have to up the tax bite on ordinary 
citizens living right across this country.  I think that is 
utterly disgusting for a democratically elected party in the 
latter part of the 20th century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are seeing some real hypocrisy coming from that side of the 
House when they pretend to be concerned about senior citizens and 
about the people in the Windsor area and across this country who 
are seeing their taxes increase by the bill that is before the 
House today.  People who are watching the House of Commons 
proceedings should be aware of where the Reform Party really 
stands and who it really speaks for.  It speaks for the extremely 
wealthy, the multimillionaires in this country, the people who 
have a lot of money.  Reformers want them to have more tax breaks 
and to hell with the ordinary citizens of Canada. 
<P><A NAME="LINK7"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to ask the member a very simple question.  He is so 
interested in fairness.  With the changes coming to CPP, with 
benefits decreasing relative to the premiums and seniors 
generally being really pushed, does he also believe in the 
fairness that will cause him to say no to his MP pension plan? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not know what that 
has to do with this bill but I want to inform the hon. member 
that I voted against that pension legislation a long time before 
he was even concerned about MP pensions. 
<P><A NAME="LINK8"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich—Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, we 
are in the House today to debate Bill C-10.  I looked back on the 
35th Parliament and counted about 36 tax increases by this 
government.  Today we are in our fourth week of Parliament and 
this is the second tax increase proposed by this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We saw in Bill C-2 the single largest tax grab, again with 
respect to the Canada pension plan, which was brought in by this 
government and rammed through this House without debate.  The 
government wanted to do the same thing with Bill C-10.  It 
approached the opposition and asked to move this bill through 
very quickly without debate in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With Bill C-2, I was very concerned for the future of Canada's 
children.  Would they get a pension?  Would their premiums be 
paying for the benefits of people today while they would never 
see a dime?  Today I am concerned for their grandparents.  Last 
week it was the children.  Today it is the grandparents.  There 
is absolutely no question that this again is another tax grab by 
this government.  It is another sneaky hidden one.

</I></B></P><P align=left>What concerns me is in only four weeks of parliament we are 
already into the second tax increase.  They are increasing the 
rate of what they did in the last parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We already know the senior supplement is coming.  This will be 
another massive tax grab on middle income seniors.  When is the 
government going to wake up and realize the Canadian public is 
not going to stand for this? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard members this morning from the opposition and the 
government sides.  I made some notes with respect to the speaker 
from the government side.  With the proposed changes he said 
recipients of this benefit will have to claim only 85% of their 
income as taxable income.  What he is not telling us is under the 
previous tax provisions they were required to claim only 50% of 
their income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The net effect of this is a 70% tax grab on these people.  The 
government knows full well it is putting more money in its pocket 
to do with as it wants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the comments of the hon. member for Calgary 
Southeast.  I would like to know what that number is.  Some of 
the bureaucrats within the ministry of finance know exactly what 
that number is. We have a right to know what it is. 
<P><A NAME="LINK9"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, Bill C-10 
allows Canada to ratify income tax treaties with Sweden, 
Lithuania, Kazakhstan, Iceland and Denmark.  It also ratifies 
changes to existing treaties with the Netherlands and the United 
States.  These treaties set out a framework for taxes on 
investment income flowing between Canada and other countries. 
They provide mechanisms to avoid double taxation and prevent tax 
evasion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the past several years Canada has negotiated tax treaties 
with over 70 countries.  These agreements deal with problems that 
arise when residents of one country earn income in another.  They 
are based on the model double taxation convention prepared by the 
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A key problem these treaties address is that of double taxation. 
This occurs when the same person or business pays comparable 
taxes in two or more countries on the same taxable income for the 
same period of time.  For example, double taxation would occur if 
a resident of one country were taxed in both Canada and that 
country on dividend income received from a Canadian company. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Preventing double taxation helps facilitate investment.  To 
prevent double taxation these treaties limit the application of 
each country's respective tax laws and ensure that the taxes paid 
in one country are recognized in the other.  Limits on 
withholding taxes in the country where the income is earned are 
set.  An exemption is provided for certain income that would 
otherwise be taxed in the country where it is earned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The treaties outline the maximum withholding taxes that may be 
charged on different forms of income such as dividends, 
royalties and interest.  Specifically under the tax treaties 
included in Bill C-10 a general rate of withholding tax of 5% 
will apply to dividends paid to a parent company on branch 
profits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, a withholding tax of 10% will apply to interest and 
royalties.  Software, patent and knowhow royalties, except in the 
treaties for Lithuania and Kazakhstan, will be exempt in the 
country in which payments arise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The withholding tax on other dividends is set at 15%.  When the 
income is then received in Canada double taxation is prevented by 
subtracting the tax already paid from what would otherwise be 
payable on that income.  The treaties contain measures to prevent 
double taxation of income earned in Canada by residents of the 
countries concerned.

<A HREF="#LINKT17"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another problem addressed by tax treaties is that of tax 
evasion, where income earned abroad is not reported in Canada. To 
prevent tax evasion the treaties provide for the exchange of 
information.  Changes to our treaty with the Netherlands include 
an article on assistance and tax collection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This article, which is similar to that approved with the United 
States two years ago, ensures that Canada and the Netherlands 
will not be used as a refuge for those seeking to avoid taxes in 
other countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-10 deals with a problem that arose as a result of recent 
changes to the way our tax treaty with the U.S. treats social 
security payments.  Under changes made law in 1995, social 
security payments made to residents of other countries were to be 
taxed by the government that issued the cheque.  Previously the 
country of residence taxed that income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The U.S. then imposed a flat 25.5% tax on all social security 
payments made to its former residents now living in Canada 
regardless of other income.  This created hardship for low income 
seniors, many of whom saw their cheques cut by one-fourth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under Bill C-10 Canadian residents will no longer, retroactive 
to 1996, be subject to the United States flat tax of 25.5% on 
social security payments.  Under the changes 85% of such income 
from the U.S. will be added to Canadian taxable income and will 
then be subject to the normal tax rate of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarly U.S. residents receiving Canadian social security 
benefits will only be taxed in the United States.  Bill C-10 also 
preserves each country's exclusive right to tax its residents 
gains on shares of companies that are not resident in other 
countries.  The government agreed to a change in the Canada-U.S. 
tax treaty that let the U.S. tax this income.  Unfortunately the 
Liberals did not bother to find out at what rate it would be 
taxed or whether there would be relief for low income earners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The U.S. chose to apply a flat 25.5% tax regardless of the 
income of the recipient, resulting in hardship for low income 
earners.  When that income was instead taxed by Canada our rules 
required that only half of it be applied to taxable income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This resulted in a considerably lower tax rate than 25.5%; as 
low as zero in the case of low income seniors and about half for 
most others.  With great fanfare in the House of Commons the 
Liberals today announced that they have fixed the mistake they 
made two years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada and the U.S. have agreed to return to the old rules 
whereby social security and CPP are taxed by the country where it 
is received and not by the country that pays.  The change is 
retroactive.  A refund cheque will be issued.  About 50,000 
people will be affected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Progressive Conservative Party would like a firm commitment 
from the government.  Before entering into further tax treaties 
on social security the government should determine exactly how 
the other country intends to tax and at what rate. 
<P><A NAME="LINK10"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I commend the hon. member on his comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In speaking with representatives of the taxpayers affected by 
the changes included in the bill for Canadian resident recipients 
of U.S. social security benefits, they were under the 
understanding the Progressive Conservative caucus would be 
opposing the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was not clear from the hon. member's remarks whether his 
caucus would be favouring or opposing the bill on the grounds 
that it in fact increases taxes for those seniors.  I wonder if 
he could illuminate me and the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise:</B>  Mr. Speaker, our concern is that of 
double taxation and of tax evasion.  We are concerned about the 
issues being addressed in the bill.  That is why the discussion 
went forth as I presented it.

tax increase to keep in line with the Mulroney government's long 
history of increasing taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the Tory promotion of a tax increase keeping in line with 
Brian Mulroney's tax increases? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I just do not know how long 
the present government and the opposition will harp on past 
governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The past government was the Liberal government that is in force 
now.  I am flabbergasted by how long they can look into the past. 
We have to look to the future and make changes as required.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to enter into debate on the issue of Bill C-10 and, more 
important, to support passage of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is appropriate to review what has happened and why it has 
become a problem.  The Canada-U.S. tax treaty was amended and 
came into effect on January 1, 1996.  Unintentionally social 
security benefits and disability benefits of some Canadians who 
worked in the United States for part of their working lives were 
taxed by the U.S. government at roughly 25.5%.  We basically did 
the same for American residents who were receiving Canadian 
benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is that Canada has a very fair and reasonable system 
of taxation which allows non-residents to file tax returns in our 
country and to seek a refund of the taxes if they were not in 
fact taxable.  Unfortunately the United States does not have a 
similar system of refund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a consequence a good number of seniors—as was mentioned 
today it is upwards of 85,000—discovered that suddenly taxes 
were being deducted from them that they had no real way of 
getting back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding and across the country I have dealt with many 
seniors who are concerned about the issue.  I spoke to a woman in 
my riding, Ellen Mowat, whose total income was about $14,000.  Of 
that amount, $10,000 was social security benefits.  The result 
was that it increased her taxes to $2,500, and the woman was only 
receiving a total of $14,000 in income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Statistics Canada says that low income cutoffs for people are 
about $25,000.  Clearly Mrs. Mowat would be considered to be in 
poverty.  Yet at the same time she had this problem of over 
$2,500 a year being deducted from her income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had letters from Mrs. Leona Jeremy of Middleton, Nova Scotia. 
It was the same situation.  She had $14,000 of income and was 
paying over $1,000 a year in taxes.  It goes on and on.  Les 
Stevens, a resident in my riding, had a total income of $12,000 a 
year and was paying $1,000 in tax through this retrogressive tax 
the United States imposed.  He had no way of getting it back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to note, in spite of some of the comments of 
the Reform Party today, that none of those people will pay any 
more taxes under these changes.  In spite of some of the things 
the Reform Party has been saying today about tax increases, the 
bottom line is that these people will not be paying any more 
taxes.  In fact they are entitled to a refund of their taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will address some of the other issues presented today.  One is 
the income inclusion amount in Canadian taxes. 
It is true the income inclusion amount has been increased from 
50% to 85%.  When I say “income inclusion amount” I am talking 
about people in Canada receiving social security benefits from 
the United States being required to report 85% of that income for 
tax purposes.

<A HREF="#LINKT19"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party went on and on about the 85%.  The reality is 
that it was already at 50%, so there has been an increase in the 
income inclusion amount of over 35%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should think about what it means.  People in some 
jurisdictions will be heavily influenced, such as Windsor and 
other border cities.  There could be someone receiving Canada 
pension benefits and paying 100 cents on the dollar on their 
taxes because of the income inclusion factor being 100%.  Another 
person receiving a U.S. pension could still report only 85% of 
it.  How could anything be more fair?  Many would suggest it 
should be higher. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again the Reform Party is taking little shreds of evidence 
and turning it into a fiasco.  Of the 85,000 seniors who will be 
affected very few will pay more taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The law came into effect on January 1, 1996.  What has happened 
in the interim?  Taxes have actually been held back.  Mrs. Mowat 
is missing $1,000.  It goes on and on.  For over two years these 
people on meagre incomes have had thousands of dollars held back 
by the U.S. government.  Our Minister of Finance has taken on 
their cause and negotiated with his American counterpart to 
relieve the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting the U.S. Senate committee has already accepted 
the proposal without amendment and is pushing it through the U.S. 
Congress.  Here we have the Reform Party saying that it will 
delay it and wants to amend it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who are Reform members talking about protecting?  Are they 
talking about Mrs. Mowat?  Are they talking about low income 
seniors across the country who are out this money?  No.  They are 
talking about the very highest income earners.  That is with whom 
the Reform Party is siding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party is stating today that it is prepared to delay 
the legislation?  Why?  So a few people who do not want to pay do 
not have to recognize 85% of that income on their tax returns and 
only have to recognize 50%, even though every other senior in the 
country receiving a Canadian pension has to recognize 100%. 
Reform members are talking about these people.  They want to 
protect them.  That is atrocious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform members spoke about people who could not afford to get in 
their cars to go and get groceries.  The U.S. government has 
$5,000 of Mrs. Mowat's money and she is only making something 
like $15,000 a year.  What does the Reform Party say to Mrs. 
Mowat?  It will somehow delay the legislation.  Tell me how that 
is being responsible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party talks about the progressivity of the system. We 
have a progressive system.  I have worked with the Canadian 
Association of Retired Persons.  The Reform Party is saying that 
it will get on the case and really study it.  It will drag its 
feet through parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where were Reformers when this was going on in the 35th 
parliament?  I did not hear them asking how they could help these 
poor people.  It was members on this side of the House and 
members of the Bloc who asked how we could resolve the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On various occasions the Minister of Finance went down there to 
negotiate with his American counterparts.  He told them that the 
problem had to be resolved because it was hurting Canadian 
seniors.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party is a great wall of silence.  When does the 
Reform Party become interested in this issue?  When we talk about 
increasing the income inclusion amount from 50% to 85% of the 
85,000 seniors affected by this.  I heard the member for Calgary 
Southeast say the number of people affected was 10,000.  He did 
not say 85,000.  He said it was, at most, 10,000 who may see 
their taxes increase.  It is those 10,000 who the Reform Party is 
concerned about.  It is not the 75,000 sitting out there who may 
well become deceased while they wait for this process that the 
Reform Party is now talking about dragging through the House of 
Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most people can see what the real issue is today. The government 
is asking for this bill to be fast tracked because we want to get 
that money back in the hands of seniors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson:</B>  You want to get it in your own hands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd:</B>  By the way, if they are so concerned 
about these people, part of this protocol basically says that 
anybody who during that two year period, because of the 85% 
inclusion amount, would have seen their taxes increase will not 
be reassessed.  How much fairer can you be?  People who would 
have paid taxes based on the increase in the income inclusion 
amount during that period of time will not be reassessed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The retroactivity is solely directed to the benefit of the low 
income seniors who need the money that the U.S. treasury is 
sitting with in its bank account.  When this protocol is passed 
by both governments the IRS will cut a chunk to Revenue Canada 
and Revenue Canada will turn around and distribute that money 
back to those lower income seniors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, it is those low income seniors, the Mrs. Lois and 
Mr. Stevens of this world who are waiting for this legislature to 
get this bill through so they can get their money back. These 
people are desperate.  They are not making $85,000 like the 
member over here.  They are making $15,000 and they need their 
money.  That is why this legislation should go through the House 
as quickly as possible and not be derailed by this party.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac—Mégantic, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the federal riding I have the pleasure to 
represent in this House, the riding of Frontenac—Mégantic, lies 
along the American border, so that I have over 500 retired people 
who are being unfairly penalized by the convention adopted 
January 1, 1986. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most of them are suffering, because their 
incomes are between $10,000 and $18,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under this convention, which is still in effect, they lose 25%. 
The United States takes 25.5% of their American pensions at 
source, and there is no way to recover this amount, even though 
they should be able to recover much of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those in the low income group, this is therefore unfair, and 
in the riding of Frontenac«Mégantic, more than 500 people are 
directly affected by the legislation before us this morning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have three questions for my colleague from Durham. When can 
retired people expect to receive their American cheques in their 
entirety? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My second question is: I understood that this bill would be 
retroactive from January 1, 1996, is this still the case?

</I></B></P><P align=left>My third question is not a question but a comment. My colleagues 
in the Reform Party intimated earlier that they would do 
everything within their power to delay passage of Bill C-10, 
which we are debating this morning. I think I understand why the 
Reform members are so strongly opposed. There were loopholes in 
the 1986 convention but there was also abuse. The Minister of 
Finance of the government to which the member for Durham belongs 
shamelessly took advantage of tax shelters by registering his 
vessels of the Canadian Steamship Line in tax havens. This is 
perhaps why the Reform members are opposed to Bill C-10. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the Bloc—and Gérard Lamothe who is watching us this 
morning is no doubt very proud of his member of Parliament—will 
support you, but we would like you to act very quickly, because a 
number of our constituents have been calling for this bill to be 
passed for months. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for 
his question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, if he is concerned about his constituents then he does 
not understand the retroactive nature of this protocol.  He talks 
about going back to January 1, 1996 for the money previously paid 
by his constituents that will be refunded and that we are putting 
the world back to 1996. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am surprised by the member.  What would some of his 
constituents say if he is willing to support an initiative which 
delays this legislation?  It is his constituents who are out the 
money.  Every month that goes by another 25.5% will be deducted 
from their cheques, money which they will not have to spend in 
his riding. I am surprised that the Bloc would support the Reform 
Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people are desperate for their money. These people are 
saying “Alex, when are we going to get our money?  We want our 
money back”.  That is what we should doing. The Americans have 
realized this and that is why they are pushing their protocol 
without amendment.  They realize the demoralizing effect it has 
on Canadians. 
<P><A NAME="LINK14"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I find the remarks of the member for Durham quite remarkable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who was in power in 1986 when this tax treaty was promulgated? 
He talks about the terrible problems these people are suffering. 
I talked about the very same problems in the majority of my 
speech. I do not know if he was listening or not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The low income seniors who have been whacked by this 25.5% flat 
tax were whacked by this government which agreed to the tax 
treaty.  Shame on it. Now it is trying to blame us for the 
mistake it made.  We believed the Deputy Prime Minister and the 
finance minister just like the member did when he voted for the 
tax treaty, just like the seniors did when they said nobody would 
end up paying more taxes.  What happened?  They all ended up 
paying more taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have one question for the member.  Who was in power in 1986? 
Did he vote for the treaty? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not want to drag out this debate.  We would like to end it 
right here, right now if the government would agree to an 
amendment which would make it clear that this would not increase 
anybody's tax burden over what was paid in 1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this member and the government are willing to entertain an 
amendment that does not treat social security payments to 
Canadians differently than to Americans in terms of the inclusion 
rate we will support it right now.  We will fast track it right 
through this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the member not agree to do that?  He says that this 
will increase taxes for everybody.  Under this treaty the 
inclusion rate will be 85% for the constituent he is talking 
about whereas in the United States a retiree would have to earn 
$60,000 to get an 85% inclusion rate on the social security 
benefits.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Every Canadian recipient of these payments will get an inclusion 
rate of 85%.  It does not matter how low their income is.  That 
is the unfairness we are trying to address.  That is why we want 
to make an amendment.  Will the member support us in getting such 
an amendment passed today? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I can understand why the 
member is having such a problem with this issue.  It is because 
he does not understand the difference between income inclusion 
and taxation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people will see 85% of their income included on their tax 
returns.  The reality is, they do not care.  They are not 
taxable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The very few people who the member is trying to defend, yes, 
they may see lower taxes.  By the way, they are not going to be 
any worse off than they were for the two years in which that 
legislation existed.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, mine is an 
academic question.  I would ask the member to declare publicly 
that people who have a low income will not be taxed by this 
provision.  Is that true or is that not true? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about inclusion rates.  Is he saying that people 
who have low incomes will not be taxed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd:</B>  Mr. Speaker, once again it depends on 
the definition of low income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will tell him that the people I represent who are making 
$14,000, or the example given of the individual making $10,000, 
no, they will not be paying any tax. 
<P><A NAME="LINK16"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
Reform critic was talking about tax fairness. He was asked a 
question in the House on October 2. The question was whether we 
have tax fairness? Do Conrad Black and other wealthy people pay 
their fair share of taxes?  His answer was “They pay more than 
their fair share. Conrad Black is paying too much in taxes. 
Multi-millionaires pay too much in taxes”.  I wonder whether the 
member agrees with the Reform Party on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the Reform Party seems to 
have an agenda which represents probably less than 10% of the 
people of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, there is high taxation in higher income groups, but not 
unavoidably so.  We have a progressive taxation system.  As the 
member knows, we have lowered the number of taxation categories 
from something like six to about three. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agenda of the Reform Party is a flat tax.  A flat tax would 
shift the total tax burden from the higher income earners to the 
middle income earners, the people that party does not represent.

Surrey Central, one of the six new electoral districts of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This being my first speech in the House, I should like to pay 
special tribute and thank the Reform Party member of Parliament, 
the hon. member for South Surrey—White Rock—Langley, and former

</I></B></P><P align=left>It has the fastest growth rate of any city in Canada.  We have a 
diverse population in Surrey Central.  Many new immigrants to 
Canada have chosen Surrey as their new home.  We want to build on 
the cultural, religious and linguistic integration that we 
already enjoy in our community as a success. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This feeling is strengthened from events such as Newton 
community day held recently in Surrey.  I hope to fulfil my role 
in the official opposition's effort to build a strong and 
prosperous Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My constituents have sent me to Ottawa to hold this Liberal 
government responsible and accountable for job creation, tax 
relief, making our streets safe again, repairing the social 
safety net and securing our national unity as well as to hold 
this government's feet to the fire for every misspent hard earned 
Canadian taxpayer dollar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I now turn to the issue of the debate in which we are engaged. 
We are debating Bill C-10, the Liberal government's legislative 
proposal to implement an income tax convention between Canada and 
the United States, and between Canada and several other 
countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look beneath the surface of Bill C-10.  I can assure 
members that my constituents and I are glad to have the 
opportunity to speak out in opposition of this proposed 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are anxious to oppose this tax grab by the Liberal 
government.  The constituents of Surrey Central, whom I have the 
privilege to represent in this House, eagerly want to expose Bill 
C-10 for what it is, a tax grab.  The people I represent are 
proud to participate in exposing this thinly veiled tax grab. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Residents of Canada who receive social security benefits from 
the United States of America will be more heavily taxed by this 
legislation.  It is estimated that at least 80,000 Canadian 
taxpayers will be affected by this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On this side of the House we give fair warning to the Liberals 
that we do not want the debate on this bill to be suddenly 
cancelled.  We know that the Liberals will use time allocation, 
the Liberals will use closure or do anything else they can 
possibly think of to put stop on debate in this House. They have 
already done this with Bill C-2, the bill that contains the 
largest single tax increase in Canadian history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals invoked time allocation on this second piece of 
legislation.  We must warn the Liberals not to continue to 
suddenly cancel debate in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we are debating the tenth piece of legislation in the 36th 
Parliament.  Already in this Parliament, being only a few weeks 
old, we have two tax increases foisted on Canadians by the newest 
Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the same Liberals who cancelled the Somalia inquiry. 
Never before in the history of our country has any government 
shut down a commission of judicial inquiry.  The Liberals did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Somalia inquiry was only two thirds of its way through when 
the Liberals shut it down.  The inquiry was very close to 
analysing events in the department of defence that took place 
under the Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals did not want to be held accountable for their 
actions.  The senior officials, including the senior management 
team at national defence headquarters, did not want to be held 
accountable for their actions and therefore had the Liberals 
cancel the Somalia inquiry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mention the Somalia inquiry because while the House was in 
recess last week the Liberal defence minister announced the 
government's response to the recommendations of the Somalia 
inquiry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason the defence minister had to respond last week was one 
of the former Somalia inquiry chairmen, Peter Desbarats, was 
releasing his book on the Somalia inquiry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today is the first day the House has returned from the break and 
the Liberal defence minister's attempt to finally bury the 
Somalia inquiry.  It is not ironic that we are debating the 
Liberal government's bill which has a 35% tax increase buried in 
it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal defence minister has chosen not to adopt the most 
serious recommendation of the Somalia inquiry, namely the 
establishment of an inspector general.  The Liberal defence 
minister has chosen instead to leave the upper echelons of 
national defence headquarters unaccountable for their actions 
even in the future.  We know the Liberals are always prepared 
to stop Canadians from holding the Liberal government accountable 
for its actions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two weeks ago the Liberals stopped debate on the largest tax 
increase in the history of this country.  Last week the Liberals 
refused to allow the recommendations of the judicial commission 
of inquiry and today we are faced with another Liberal government 
tax increase.  This is very serious.  Canadians should be 
concerned about the fact that the Liberals have ruined the 
existence of the most powerful tool we have in this country to 
find truth, a judicial commission of public inquiry.  They 
stopped the Somalia inquiry right in the middle of its work. 
They have shown Canadians that they are not afraid to stop the 
pursuit of truth. They are prepared to put a stop to things that 
hold people responsible and accountable for their actions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The truth is that the Liberals stopped debate in the House and 
passed Bill C-2 at second reading. This bill represents the 
largest tax grab in the history of this country. The truth is 
that the Liberals stopped the Somalia inquiry from finding the 
truth.  Today the truth is that the Liberals are again increasing 
taxes for certain Canadians with Bill C-10. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-10 is offering Canadians a new income tax convention with 
the Americans but the truth is the Liberals have taken the 
opportunity to gouge the taxpayers again.  They are using Bill 
C-10 as another opportunity to raise taxes.  The Liberals cannot 
even do something as simple as negotiating a tax treaty with 
another country without trying to figure out a way to squeeze 
more money out of the already overtaxed Canadian taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The income tax take has been rising steadily in this country. 
The Liberals are balancing the budget on the backs of Canadian 
taxpayers.  Let us see how strong the backs of Canadian taxpayers 
are.  The Fraser Institute calculates that the average family of 
four has had lost a total of $3,000 in purchasing power since 
1993, since the Liberals took power in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Net personal income tax revenues increased from $51.4 billion in 
1993-94 to $66.5 billion in 1997-98.  These revenues are right on 
track to increase to $70.4 billion in 1998-99.  The saving rate 
of Canadians in 1992 was 10% and had dropped to 3.2% in fourth 
quarter of 1996.  It dropped further to 0.9% in the second 
quarter of 1997.  The Canadian personal income tax burden is 
already the highest in the G-7 countries and is 34% higher than 
the OECD country average.  Canadian living standards were lower 
in 1996 than they were in 1989.  This made Canada the only nation 
to experience an absolute fall in living standards over that 
period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly the Canadian economy is not performing as well as the 
finance minister is projecting.  In fact, it is underperforming. 
The election is over now.  I advise the government to stop making 
political footballs out of the issues facing the Canadian people. 
Canadians are tired of these games.  Let us get serious for the 
next millennium at least. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is telling Canadians that it is okay for 
federal Liberal politicians to have a generous gold plated 
pension plan.  And yet it leaves Canadians with a very rusty 
plan.  At the same time, the government has no problem in clawing 
back pension benefits from retired Canadian workers who have 
scrimped and saved for their retirement. 
The Liberals are placing a burdensome tax on the backs of our 
youth.  Where is the fairness?  Where is the hope for the future?

</I></B></P><P align=left>Taxes are going up again.  In the red book, in the throne speech 
and in the recent economic statement by the Minister of Finance 
the Liberals made no firm proposal for tax relief for Canadians. 
The finance minister has just introduced the largest tax hike in 
Canada, a 73% increase in CPP premiums which will cost Canadians 
$10 billion.  The average income level for Canadians has dropped 
almost $1,000 since 1989 and their disposable income has dropped 
almost 9%.  Gross tax revenues total $139.8 billion in 1996 and 
1997, or 17.5% of the GDP, the highest they have been in 20 years 
and the second highest ratio in Canadian history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Increased revenue collection accounted for 72.5% of the total 
improvement in the Liberal government's deficit figures.  Of the 
total deficit target overshoot of $10.1 billion, 53.5% was the 
increase in revenues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The employment insurance surplus alone made up $7.4 billion of 
deficit reduction in 1996-97.  There is more to the story of Bill 
C-10 than the badly camouflaged tax grab.  The Liberals are 
admitting to it.  They are admitting to the mistake by proposing 
Bill C-10. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the third protocol took effect it was evident that the 
United States did not take into account the income levels of the 
recipients of this benefit.  This devastated the lives of 
thousands of people including middle income Canadian seniors.  At 
that time the current deputy prime minister, the member for 
Windsor West, was quoted in the Windsor <I>Star</I> on December 
22, 1995 as saying he was assured that Canadians would not pay 
more taxes but would pay less taxes. He was dead wrong.  He was 
wrong then.  He is wrong now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone who earned less than $70,000 paid more taxes.  No one 
paid less taxes.  The Liberals are admitting that the income tax 
convention they made with the United States in 1995 was so bad 
they had to implement a new tax convention.  This is pathetic. 
They are well aware of the mistakes they have made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When they finish ramming this legislation through the House and 
the Liberal controlled Senate, a retirement home for the creme de 
la creme of Liberal party faithfuls, Canadians will have had to 
deal with the experience of facing three separate income tax 
conventions with the United States in the last two years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals cannot seem to get it right.  They do not care 
about more than 80,000 Canadians affected by this tax convention

that existed before the terrible treaty of 1996.  Under Bill C-10 
Canadian residents who receive social security benefits from the

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals are continuing to raise our taxes.  They are 
balancing the budget through tax increases.  They have not 
stopped government duplication.  They have not stopped waste. 
They have not stopped mismanagement. They are only concerned with 
putting a stop to what will hold them accountable.  These things 
include debate in the House, public commissions of judicial 
inquiry and anything else that comes close to holding them 
responsible for their actions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The shutting down of the Somalia inquiry, the ending of debate 
on Bill C-2, the largest tax increase in history, and now the 
almost hidden tax increase in Bill C-10 are examples of the kinds 
of things Canadians will be adding up when they hold the Liberals 
accountable in the next election.  Backbench Liberal members 
should be very worried.  They will be held accountable in the 
next election.

sitting, the United Nations development program held a conference 
in Ottawa.  In fact it was held right here in the House of 
Commons.  The conference was one of many the United Nations is 
holding around the world to discuss its good governance and 
democracy initiative. It strives to establish the means for 
recipient countries to govern themselves effectively and 
efficiently. Some countries that have agreed to pursue democracy 
do not have the structures of government needed to carry out 
democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example the International Monetary Fund said that Cambodia 
was to downsize its public service.  Cambodia was having a 
difficult time reducing its public service because it did not 
even know how large it was.  There was the problem of figuring 
out exactly how many public servants there were working for the 
Cambodian government. The United Nations program was able to help 
by providing Cambodia with the tools necessary to establish the 
structures of a public service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that the United Nations could do some work right 
here in Canada.  It seems clear to me that the Liberals need to 
be taught that a commission of judicial inquiry in a democratic 
nation is supposed to be free to pursue the truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The almost hidden and unjustified 35% tax increase contained in 
Bill C-10 stands as an example of how Liberals need help in terms 
of understanding the use of good governance in a democracy.  They 
will use any opportunity to increase taxes.  The abuse of the 
structures of good governance by the Liberal government in our 
democracy is unacceptable.  Bill C-10 is unacceptable. The Reform 
Party opposes its passage through the House until the amendment 
is made so that Canadian recipients will pay the same inclusion 
rate as their American counterparts.

to give tax relief to the Canadian public who are already taxed 
almost to death. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The taxes are so high for seniors who are on fixed incomes and

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I want to commend the hon. member for Surrey Central for his 
excellent maiden remarks in the House.  His constituents should 
be proud to be so well represented in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to tag on to the comments the hon. member just made 
to the question by the hon. member for Qu'Appelle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party believes that all Canadians pay more than their 
fair share.  When we have a tax burden that now consumes over 40% 
of our gross domestic product, all Canadians are paying more than 
their fair share. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make one thing clear for the record that the hon. 
member for Qu'Appelle in his lusty reliving of his sixties class 
warfare days may not understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal Department of Finance statistics show that the top 
10% of income earners in Canada report about 32% of the income 
earned and pay 48% of total Canadian taxes.  The top 10% pay 
nearly half of the income taxes. Before the hon. socialist member 
for P.E.I. stands up, I would like to remind him that this 
statistic comes from his Department of Finance which also tells 
us that the top 1% of income earners who report 9% of the income 
earned pay 18% of the taxes collected in Canada.  The top 1% pay 
nearly 20% of the taxes.  The top 10% pay nearly half the taxes. 
If this is not paying more than their fair share, I do not know 
what is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The solution for everybody, whether it is a poor member of 
Parliament like the member for Qu'Appelle or a Canadian like Mr. 
Black who is creating jobs, is tax relief so we can have more 
jobs.  Or we could try to tax people out of this country like the 
hon. member's friends in the NDP in Saskatchewan were so 
successful in doing in destroying the wealth creation machine in 
that province by taxing them all into Alberta. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hopefully we will not do the same thing.  Hopefully we will not 
launch into the same kind of class warfare campaign the hon. 
member is recommending.

more important, talk about subjects his constituents deemed 
important for him to speak upon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member mentioned in his speech that Bill C-2 was a 
pension grab, a rip-off or whatever the member would like to 
address it as. 
Personally I think it is a rip-off, legalized theft hidden in 
government forms.  I would like the hon. member to stand up in 
this House and say to me that underneath the democratic process 
we have with this so-called Liberal government you were given 
your chance to stand up here in this House, the greatest house in

you were allowed that with Bill C-2.

about the CPP and Bill C-2. I was astonished when I saw that 
there was taxation without representation.  I could not talk 
because debate on the bill was closed by members opposite.  It is 
a shame for members opposite that we had so many things to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We care about the future of the younger generation on whose

we challenge them to have a debate, to have representation for 
the people who sent us here to represent them so well.  We have 
every right to represent them.  We have every desire to represent 
them.  This situation should never occur.  The members on the

<P><A NAME="LINK21"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have a 
comment on the issue of hypocrisy.  I thought it was kind of 
unusual in the speeches on Bill C-2 by Reformers that they talked 
about wanting the time to go back and consult with their 
constituents. I know we are getting a little off topic but Bill 
C-2 was presented in the 35th Parliament. The negotiations for 
Bill C-2, that is to say pension reform, occurred during that 
period of time.  It included the Government of Alberta which has 
basically signed on to the amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thought it was really remarkable that Reform Party members 
wanted to go back and talk to their constituents now, when I and 
many of my colleagues had town hall meetings two years ago.  When 
is the Reform Party going to get its act together? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal:</B>  Mr. Speaker, Bill C-2 presented a 73% 
tax hike which is the largest tax hike in Canadian history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ask members opposite why they had to put closure on 
this discussion.  Why could they not have the courage to come to 
this House and say let us debate the issue and then go for the 
increase or decrease or do whatever we have to do?  We know from 
talking to Canadians in all constituencies that they do not want 
a tax hike.  We have to give them tax relief at this time.  It is 
shameful when we give them a 73% tax hike without looking into 
the situation and what people are representing.  It is shameful 
when the Liberals do not have the courage to debate in the House.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Susan Whelan (Essex, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to participate today in the debate on Bill C-10 that among other 
things amends the Canada-U.S. tax convention.  In particular the 
bill deals with the manner in which residents of Canada receive 
U.S. social security and residents of the United States receive 
Canada pension plan payments and OAS. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This amendment is to change a flaw in the U.S.-Canada tax treaty 
which was negotiated by the previous government but implemented 
by our government.  It is a flaw that we did not catch at the 
time and that due to the hard work of many members on this side 
of the House was brought to the attention of the finance minister 
who undertook to renegotiate the bill with the U.S. government. 
And renegotiation takes time. I will explain how that came about, 
what the flaw was and what we have done to deal with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada-U.S. tax treaty sets rates at which Canada or the 
United States can tax pension benefits, U.S. social security 
being received in Canada and CPP and OAS being received in the 
United States.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before 1996 the country that paid the benefit to a resident of 
the other country could not tax that benefit at all. The country 
where the recipient lived would include 50% of that benefit in 
their taxable income.  The other half of the benefit was tax 
free. Thus people residing in Canada receiving U.S. social 
security benefits would claim half of that amount on their 
Canadian tax return as income and other half would be tax free. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1996 the tax treaty was changed.  Under the new rules the 
country that pays the benefit, the country that issues the 
cheque, can tax all of it.  The country where the recipient of 
the cheque lives cannot tax any of it.  Therefore Canada would 
tax CPP payments going to people who live in the United States 
and the United States would tax U.S. social security benefits 
going to people who lived in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada ordinarily taxes Canada pension plan and old age security 
benefits going to non-residents at a rate of 25%. Canada also 
applies the OAS recovery tax, the clawback on high income earners 
to non-residents as well.  However, to ensure fairness in our tax 
system, any non-resident can choose to file a Canadian tax return 
and pay tax at the ordinary Canadian rate rather than at the flat 
25%.  The result is many low income U.S. recipients pay little or 
no Canadian tax on their Canadian CPP or OAS. The United States 
also taxes outbound social security benefits at a rate of 25.5%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is the flaw that escaped us as legislators.  The United 
States tax system does not allow any non-residents to file tax 
returns unless they are U.S. citizens or resident aliens. There 
are some of those living in Canada.  Therefore the 25% tax is 
fixed and final to Canadians. There is no recourse for 
non-American non-residents to file a U.S. return and to be able 
to pay U.S. tax at a lower rate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was at this point in December 1995 that I first realized 
there was a problem when the United States began withholding 
25.5%.  At that point myself and the other Windsor MPs contacted 
the office of the Minister of Finance to explain the problem and 
to ask that it be addressed.  I attended meetings with CASSE, 
Canadians Asking for Social Security Equality in Windsor, the 
local Windsor group organized to deal with the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister realized the problem.  He actually travelled to 
Windsor in September 1996 to meet with members of the local CASSE 
committee established to lobby the government to renegotiate this 
change with the United States government.  The Minister of 
Finance then met with his counterpart in Washington, Mr. Robert 
Rubin, to negotiate with the United States to reopen the 
Canada-U.S. tax convention to address this problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed new rule included in the latest protocol to the tax 
treaty will give the country of residence the exclusive right to 
tax social security benefits.  This means only Canada will be 
able to tax U.S. benefits paid to residents of Canada and vice 
versa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under this change, all low income Canadians that the Reform MPs 
have been talking about today will pay no tax.  This change will 
retroactively ensure that these low income Canadians will pay 
less tax than the 25% withheld by the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once this protocol is ratified, several thousand low income 
Canadians will no longer pay any income tax. Thousands more will 
pay less tax than they currently do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party member for Calgary Southeast who spoke this 
morning raised the issue of fairness by comparing the U.S. rate 
of taxation on U.S. social security in this proposal.  The 
purpose of Canadian law is not to reflect U.S. tax laws.  The 
purpose of Canadian tax law is to ensure that people living in 
Canada are all treated equally.  The purpose of our tax code is 
to treat neighbours coast to coast equally, not to treat people 
who live in Canada and work in the United States the same as they 
would be treated if they lived in the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many non-tax differences between Canada and the United 
States.  For example, a person living in Canada has access to the 
Canadian universal health care system.  If that person lived in 
the United States he or she would have to pay for health care in 
many cases.  That may not be a tax but it definitely does affect 
income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can speak to that personally because I have an aunt who lives 
in the United States.  I know for a fact that while she was 
receiving U.S. social security benefits before she was of 
senior's age she was paying over $350 U.S. a month to a private 
health care system to ensure that she had health care. 
When she became ill that very health care system, that wonderful 
system which the Reform Party thinks is great, cut her off.  It 
was one thing after another, from long term care, to medication, 
to a co-pay of 30% to 70% every time she had any type of test. 
The sicker she got the more she had to pay.  That is how the 
system works in the United States with a private benefit system 
where one pays and continues to pay into it while receiving the 
benefits.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We should be aware that when seniors living in Canada receiving 
social security go to the hospital that distinction is not made. 
They are not asked where their incomes come from or where their 
taxes are paid.  We have always treated all Canadians and those 
who live in Canada equally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that the changes will ensure that neighbours are 
treated equally and fairly, which is why Canada will require the 
U.S. social security recipients to include 85% of U.S. social 
security as income when they file their income taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I stated before, thousands of low income seniors, disabled 
Canadians and spouses and children of those who work in the 
United States will pay no tax at all due to this change and 
thousands more will pay less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There seems to be some allegation that this change is only about 
seniors.  It is not just about seniors.  I want to make that 
clear to the members of the Reform Party.  There are thousands of 
those who work in the United States.  There are children of those 
who work in the United States and there are disabled Canadians 
receiving U.S. social security benefits.  I can speak to this 
from my own personal experience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have an aunt whose husband worked in the United States and is 
receiving U.S. social security.  They have a disabled child who 
receives U.S. social security.  The benefits from U.S. social 
security are higher than those she would receive in Canada. This 
change will directly affect her because she will pay no tax as a 
disabled Canadian receiving U.S. social security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, my aunt, who receives U.S. social security, will pay 
some tax.  She has told me that she believes she should pay her 
fair share in Canada.  She is not one of those high income 
seniors the Reform Party is speaking on behalf of today.  When 
this proposal was first made in Windsor, people should be aware, 
the first people I have talked to on CASSE thought it was a good 
change and a good benefit because low income seniors, disabled 
persons, children and spouses would get their tax dollars back. 
When they realized they were in the upper income and they would 
be paying their fair share in Canada while they lived in Canada, 
that is when they became opposed to this proposal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This proposal was negotiated with CASSE.  It was put forward 
before CASSE.  When its members first heard the proposal they 
were in agreement with it until they found out how some of their 
individual cases or situations would be affected and that they 
would still pay less tax than their Canadian neighbour.  That is 
what seems to escape the Reform Party in this whole debate today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Somebody in a high income bracket living in house A receiving 
U.S. social security and somebody in a high income bracket living 
in house B receiving the same income but from Canadian sources 
will pay more tax than the person in house A.  If they live in 
Canada and they all get the same Canadian benefits, they all 
should pay for the same Canadian benefits.  We are still giving 
that person in house A, the person receiving U.S. social 
security, a break, a 15% inclusion in their income.  We are 
recognizing that they did pay tax on their U.S. social security 
benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the Reform Party to stand up and say that the amount of 
taxes that one will pay on their U.S. social security benefit 
equals the amount of benefits they are receiving today is 
ludicrous.  It is very similar to our Canada pension plan system 
where people receiving pensions today did not pay into the system 
what they are getting out.  The tax they pay in the United States 
does not equal anything near the amounts they are getting out. 
The reason they have that exemption in the United States of 
$27,000 U.S. is because they do not have a universal health care 
system and because they do not have the same benefits as we have 
in Canada for many other things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the member for Qu'Appelle when he said that the 
Reform Party speaks for the high income seniors.  Those are the 
people who are complaining about this change.  Those are the 
people who have problems with this change because they may 
actually come close to paying what their neighbours in the same 
income bracket will pay.  They are still going to get a break.  I 
am not sure that their neighbours in house B would agree that 
house A should still get that break because we all have to pay 
for our Canadian system.  We all have to pay for our health care 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe the hon. member for Calgary Southeast should come and 
visit Windsor and he would understand what happens in the health 
care system in Windsor.  He would recognize what his colleagues 
in the province of Ontario are doing to the city of Windsor. 
In fact, what has happened in Windsor had to do with the lowering 
of taxes by the province of Ontario.  That caused the loss of 
$4.9 billion in revenues to the province with the first tax cut 
which was funnelled down to the health care system.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When they talk about lowering taxes and tax relief for all 
Canadians, I think hon. members on the other side should stop and 
think about the effects of tax relief and look at what has 
happened in border communities such as Windsor and Essex county, 
and try to understand the benefits of today's proposal and 
recognize that low income seniors, the disabled, children and 
spouses of those who worked in the United States, the majority of 
whom will be better off if they are in a low income bracket. Many 
will pay the same but some will pay more.  Those are the ones the 
Reform Party members are speaking for today.  Even those who pay 
more will pay less than their Canadian neighbours. That is 
something which should not be lost on the House and not lost to 
all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Reform Party says there has been no debate, where has 
it been?  I raised this with the Minister of Finance in December 
1995 when the changes first took effect.  Where were Reform 
members when the changes were announced on April 9, 1997?  Where 
were they during the rallies in Windsor in 1996?  I was there, 
but I did not see any Reform members.  Where have they been 
throughout the discussion?  When exactly did they decide to jump 
on to the band wagon and offer their own solutions?  We have been 
talking about this and dealing with people in our communities who 
have been affected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The members for Windsor and Essex county, the member for Windsor 
West and Windsor St. Clair and the members for Kent-Essex and 
Durham and I have worked on this together along with other 
members on this side of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard from people in my riding in Essex, which is a 
border community, from seniors with upper incomes and others. 
They want to pay their fair share.  They want to ensure that the 
Canadian health care system and other social benefits continue 
for those who are less privileged. The seniors I talked to 
recognize and appreciate the benefits they have received 
throughout the years of working and living in Canada. In order to 
balance the books all Canadians have to participate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hear today that this is a hidden tax increase.  That is 
ludicrous.  It is not a hidden tax increase. We are talking about 
treating Canadians equally and fairly and about tax fairness for 
all Canadians. I believe it is urgent that we deal with this 
issue today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard the member for Surrey say that we should not end the 
debate.  I would like him to talk with the woman I spoke with on 
Saturday in my hometown of Amherstburg who has been waiting for 
this change.  I told her that this would be coming before the 
House on Monday.  I will be happy to go back and tell her that 
the Reform Party thinks we should debate it a little while 
longer.  This lady is one of the low income seniors that they 
talk so much about, one of those who because of the provincial 
government has had her housing costs increase by 10%, while we 
are still trying to get back the 25%.  She would like that money 
back as quickly as possible, not next year or two years from now. 
She would like it back as soon as this passes in the House and as 
soon as it is ratified in the U.S.  However, if the Reform Party 
has its way we will be debating this for months to come.  We do 
not have time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those low income seniors they speak so highly about do not have 
time to wait. They have issues facing them right now in their 
homes and apartments with regard to what they can and cannot 
afford. They want to know that the tax relief we have promised on 
April 9, 1997 is coming to them quickly.  I want to be able to go 
back and tell them that this side of the House will ensure they 
get that money back into their pockets as quickly as possible. 
They also want to know that they will still have the benefits to 
which Canadians have become accustomed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that hon. members across the way cannot disagree that low 
income seniors need that money. Why would they want to delay the 
debate and suggest that there has not been adequate debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can send them newspaper articles.  I can send them letters I 
have received.  I can send them copies of my correspondence if 
they want to read about it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They had members in this House in the last two years.  They had 
the opportunity to raise this issue over and over and over again. 
They had the opportunity to have ample time for debate when they 
chose what they would talk about on their days of debate in this 
very House of Commons. Therefore for them to stand up today and 
say there has been no time for debate I think is a fallacy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want to know that these people who are being affected, 
these 60,000 people who are receiving U.S. social security 
benefits are going to have the opportunity to get their money 
back as quickly as possible and that their tax fairness will be 
restored. Again, I think it should be known that all Canadians 
want to be treated equally and fairly and all Canadians want to 
have access to systems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people in my riding who are receiving U.S. social security 
benefits want this resolved as quickly as possible.  They want 
the proposed new rules to come into effect.  They understand that 
it may not be what they thought was the perfect solution. We are 
not going back to the old system.  They knew that from the very 
first time I met with them.  They were told up front that we 
cannot go back.  This is negotiated between two countries. We 
went too far and now we are going to negotiate back to what is a 
level of fairness.  We took back the taxation to our own country 
so that there can be that level of fairness in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They knew from the first day that this problem was raised that 
we were not going back to the old system, that the old system was 
not fair to their Canadian neighbours receiving Canadian 
benefits.  The old system was not fair to everyone in Canada as 
well as to those in the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I want to emphasize one last time the fairness this 
change will effect.  This change will be retroactive for people 
living in Canada.  If they would not have paid any tax in Canada, 
they will get a full refund.  If they would have paid less tax 
with the U.S. 25% flat rate, they will get a refund of the 
difference. If they would have paid more than the 25% flat rate 
that the U.S. withheld, the Canadian government in fairness will 
not pursue those taxes for those two years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to conclude by saying that the change was a mistake. Once 
the mistake was recognized, Windsor and Essex county MPs, those 
from Windsor West, Windsor—St. Clair, Kent—Essex and myself, as 
well as many other members on this side of the House, 
particularly the member for Durham, worked very hard to ensure 
that the Canadian government renegotiated the Canada-U.S. tax 
treaty as fast as possible and that it would be retroactive to 
the day this is implemented.  Those in need will get that money 
back.  Those who have had to borrow from their friends and 
families will be able to pay those dollars back.  Those living on 
a tight income will finally see some relief that they need. 
<P><A NAME="LINK23"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich—Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the member for Essex has recognized there was a problem 
and that they have attempted to fix it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to reiterate my earlier comments that this is a tax 
grab.  I will explain to the member why the Minister of Finance 
is smiling these days.  He continues to take bites out of our 
wallets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What concerns me the most is that—and I am saying this after 
the House has been in session for only three or four weeks—the 
government seems to be stuck on the number 70%.  In Bill C-2, the 
largest single tax grab, they are going to raise the taxes of the 
working Canadians by 70%.  There will be a 70% increase in those 
premiums, over 70%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The inclusion rate was 50% in the 1984 protocol which was up 
until 1995, but now we are going to see that 50% inclusion rate 
raised to 85%. What does that amount to?  A 70% tax increase. 
This government is stuck on raising our taxes by 70%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Essex keeps bringing back the rich versus the 
poor. In Bill C-2 it was the working against the retired.  This 
is not what this is all about.  It is about arithmetic and the 
numbers do not add up.  This party stands for the poor, believe 
me, more than anyone on that side of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are tax provisions that we wanted to implement. 
We would have taken people making below $30,000 right off the tax 
rolls.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not suggesting that low income people should pay tax on 
this at all, by no stretch of the imagination.  What we are 
suggesting will ensure that this will be dealt with fairly and 
that is not what is being done.  It is another tax grab. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask them to show us the numbers.  The Minister of Finance can 
show us those numbers.  I am sure it is another tax grab by the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Susan Whelan:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I listened to the comments 
of the member opposite and I wondered when he said that it is not 
an issue of the rich and the low income earners.  It is not an 
issue of the rich and the low income earners.  I said very 
clearly throughout my statement that it is an issue of treating 
all Canadians equally, Canadians from coast to coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a tax system in Canada.  Our income is placed in the tax 
system to determine the level of tax that is payable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The numbers are out there, if the hon. member cares to know. 
Someone with a $14,000 income or lower will pay no tax.  Does he 
care about those people?  I am starting to wonder. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They talk of $30,000 as some magic cut-off.  We know what 
happened in Ontario with the magic tax relief its government gave 
to people.  It took with one hand and it took back with the 
other.  Low income Ontarians are now realizing that the tax 
relief they thought they were getting is not there.  There is no 
such thing.  The moment the teachers go out on strike, the low 
income people will have to pay for child care.  Why will those 
teachers go out on strike?  Because the province of Ontario did 
not listen to them. Tax relief is not necessarily what it 
implies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about fairness, fairness and equality for all 
Canadians from coast to coast. 
<P><A NAME="LINK24"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the remarks of the hon. member for Essex are shameful.  She 
admitted that there was a flaw in the bill which her party voted 
for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals were asked whether this would increase taxes on 
U.S. social security recipients.  I am sure that before the 1997 
election they were asked about it.  The deputy prime minister 
said no, that it would be revenue neutral.  He misled those 
people.  The government said it would not increase taxes and it 
did. She asked where we were in 1986.  We were right here 
believing the government when it told us there would not be a tax 
increase, just as her constituents were. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are we opposing this measure today?  Precisely because the 
hon. member for Essex and the other members from Windsor will not 
represent their constituents.  I have a file full of letters from 
her constituents, letters to the papers in her riding, opposing 
this bill and this tax grab. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me get one thing perfectly clear.  The member suggests that 
we are somehow trying to raise taxes on the lowest income people 
and trying to drag out debate on this issue to prevent them from 
getting their cheques.  Let me say to her what I said to the hon. 
member for Durham.  We will agree to vote for this bill and pass 
it right now if the government would agree to our amendment, 
which we will be proposing, which would treat all social security 
recipients equally in what they receive in terms of the inclusion 
rate in the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposal we made in the election was to take the bottom one 
million taxpayers off the tax rolls altogether. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why will the member not allow those cheques which are now being 
withheld to be sent out to the low income people while at the 
same time reduce the inclusion rate to what it was in 1995? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does she deny that Bill C-10 will increase federal revenues? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it falling on me to represent her constituents?  Shame on 
her.  Shame on the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Susan Whelan:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like the hon. 
member for Calgary Southeast to know that I do represent my 
constituents.  I represent the majority of my constituents.  And 
the majority of my constituents who are low income earners have 
told me that they accept this change.  They want this change and 
they want it now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Reform Party wants to be led by the special interest 
groups and the high income seniors, go right ahead.  I will go to 
sleep at night knowing that I represent the majority of my 
constituents.  I represent all of my constituents, not just those 
receiving U.S. social security.  All of my constituents want to 
pay equal taxes.  Not just those receiving U.S. social security 
should get a break. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member should know that when the deputy prime minister 
made that statement he asked a very specific question.  The 
question to the finance department was based on those who were 
paying income tax. 
However, there was a group of numbers that was missing.  We have 
recognized that error.  There was no misleading in any election 
campaign. The statement was made after the campaign. The member 
should know that as soon as we recognized that error, and we have 
recognized it, we began negotiations with the United States to 
make that change.  That is why we are here today.  It is to make 
that change.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is my 
understanding that prior to this bill being passed, that is under 
the rules that are now in place, 50% of the security income was 
taxed and now 85% of that income is going to be taxed. If we are 
going to tax a greater proportion of the income, it seems to me 
that will result in a tax increase. I would like the member to 
explain if that is not so, how that would come about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My second question is with respect to the retroactivity.  The 
government claims that its bill is going to be retroactive.  I 
would like to know what specific procedures are going to be 
followed to make sure under the retroactive rules that those who 
have paid taxes will no longer be accountable for how they will 
get their refunds or rebates and how they will be looked after. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are two very serious questions and I would appreciate a 
response. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Susan Whelan:</B>  Mr. Speaker, first and foremost I have 
never said that all people receiving U.S. social security will 
pay less tax.  I have acknowledged from the very beginning that 
low income Canadians receiving U.S. social security will be 
better off under this change.  I have acknowledged since the very 
beginning that those in the upper end who are including 85% of 
their income will probably pay, or some will pay, more tax. 
However they will still pay less tax than their Canadian 
neighbour with the same income level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have also been working very closely with the finance 
department to ensure that this process will happen quickly once 
this is passed in our House and in the United States to ensure 
that those people who need to get refunds and who are entitled to 
refunds will get them in a very timely fashion.  It is my 
understanding that the process is in place the moment the 
legislation is passed in both houses.

people as soon as they make around $6,500 a year.  The government 
collects almost $2 billion a year from people who earn $15,000 a 
year or less, many of them old people, many of them young people 
and many of them poor people.

of $250,000 it would reduce its taxes by $4,000 a year.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, my 
supplementary question is for the Minister of Finance.  The 
government is so busy congratulating itself that its members will 
not admit they have screwed up.  The fact is that Canadians are 
worse off today than they were at the beginning of the decade. 
There is more unemployment.  There is more poverty.  There are 
more personal bankruptcies.  There are more families losing 
income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the government persist in its inflation obsession when 
its higher interest rate policy will cost $70 billion in lost 
economic growth over the next five years, condemning close to 1.5 
million Canadians to continuing unemployment? 
<P><A NAME="LINK86"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the leader of the NDP ought to look at the facts.  There are over 
one million more Canadians at work today than there were when we 
took office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She talked about interest rates.  Interest rates are down five 
percentage points for the first time in 20 years.  Our interest 
rates are lower than those in the United States.  Not only are 
our short term rates lower, but for the first time since our 
longer term bonds came out, our 30 year rate is lower than in the 
United States, our 10 year rate is lower than in the United 
States.

Bachand (Richmond—Arthabaska, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, thanks to the 
efforts of the Conservative opposition, a public statement was 
made on October 1, confirming that an investigation into 
allegations of influence peddling was indeed under way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last 
week, charges were laid by the RCMP—a very serious business. 
Unfortunately, there is a missing link in all this: Who gave the 
information to the person who was charged? The missing link could 
be sitting across the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to preserve the integrity of this government and this 
House, I would ask the President of  the Treasury Board whether 
he can confirm before this House that no employee of his Montreal

investigation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK88"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and Minister

</I></B></P><P align=left>Responding to the same question in a press conference, the RCMP 
Inspector said: “This is covered in the report we have forwarded

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, a lot of questions remain unanswered about this 
matter.  The government may have hoped that the RCMP 
investigation and its completion would put this matter to rest. 
I would suggest that today is an opportunity for the government 
to explain itself by answering a few straightforward questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would direct my question to the President of the Treasury 
Board. Can he tell the House how did someone who was organizing 
riding associations, building up membership lists and helping 
fundraising know which companies applied for government grants, 
the stage of the applications and on which ministers' desks these 
applications were sitting? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I always hesitate to intervene in any questions 
that are posed or any answers that are given.  However, we must 
remember that we do have a general convention in the House—it is 
not a rule—that we should be very precise in our questions and 
also in our answers so that in no way would there be any 
prejudice on any person who might have business before a court of 
law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With that in mind, I am going to permit the question.  If the 
President of the Treasury Board wishes to answer it, he may do 
so.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, in 
1993 the Montreal accounting firm of Raymond, Chabot, Martin and 
Paré gave $6,000 to the Liberal Party of Canada.  In 1994 it gave 
$5,000, in 1995 it gave $4,000 and then in 1996 it gave $86,000 
to the Liberal Party.  In that same year it received $20 million 
in contracts from CIDA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question for the government is this.  Is it just a happy 
coincidence that the firm that donated $87,000 to the Liberal

<P><A NAME="LINK93"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of

know that anyone can make contributions to political parties 
providing they satisfy the criteria that they are Canadian 
citizens or taxpayers in Canada.  People donate to the Reform

in the corporate sector who give now and then to people on all

apparently Liberals believe in that old adage that membership 
does have its privileges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will put the question again.  A Liberal accounting firm gave 
over $87,000 to the Liberal Party at the exact same time that the 
minister was personally involved in awarding $20 million in 
contracts.  The minister at the time hand picked a short list of 
contractors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it that huge donations given to the Liberal Party of

candidates.

Nothing is being hidden, Mr. Speaker.  In fact we want more open

not my doing. What I said was that our department would work as 
hard as it could to clarify the situation under our 
responsibility as quickly as possible. So we are not holding 
things up, as the hon. member knows very well.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
minister knows very well also that the route through the courts 
could take six or seven years. In the case of  the Singer 
workers, whose average age is 82, this means there will be no one 
left at the end of the line. The employees are aware of this too, 
because they proposed a settlement out of court to the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the light of the very modest out of court settlement proposed 
by the former Singer workers last spring, and given the 
humanitarian aspect of the issue, why does the minister not 
resolve it in the next few days with the former Singer workers on 
the basis of  what they proposed to him last December?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of National Defence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister's refusal to accept the establishment of an 
independent office of inspector general means the truth about 
Somalia will likely never be told.  The minister has caved in to 
the senior military brass, the same group that so recently 
elevated secrecy and lack of accountability to an art form. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the minister reverse his misguided decision and appoint a 
truly independent inspector general with a mandate to report to 
parliament on a regular basis? 
<P><A NAME="LINK128"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, as I previously indicated we do not need a new 
superstructure.  We do need refinements to the current system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are putting in place an ombudsman who will report 
independently and will operate as a citizen independent from the 
military.  We have the same in terms of the grievance board.  We 
have the same in terms of a military police complaints 
commission.  We have a new monitoring committee to look at the 
recommendations and to ensure they are all implemented, again an 
independent civilian oversight. We have substantial civilian 
oversight of the Canadian military.  Together they are a better 
system than the one that was proposed.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</B>  Which is it, Mr. Minister, 
these warm fuzzy assurances today or what you said last week

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I remind the hon. member that all questions 
are put through the Speaker.  I ask the hon. member to please put 
his question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor:</B>  Mr. Speaker, will the minister admit 
that no inspector general effectively means no inspection of the 
generals? 
<P><A NAME="LINK130"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, 
Lib.):</B>  Absolutely not, Mr. Speaker.  There is substantial 
oversight, unprecedented in terms of the Canadian forces. 
Substantial oversight by independent civilian entities is 
proposed and will be carried out to provide the same kind of 
independent oversight that the hon. member has been talking 
about.

combined with lower interest rates on a smaller marketable debt

books by no later than next year.  I think Canadians can take 
enormous satisfaction in the fact that in the first five months 
of this year we actually have paid down $11 billion worth of 
marketable debt.  I also think that Canadians take great 
satisfaction by the fact that the net worth of households is 
rising, that consumer sales are up, that more and more

figures tabled by the government last April announced a $12.5

transfers were to fall from $600 million last year to $487 
million within the next five years. Not only has Manitoba 
suffered a $250 million cash transfer loss since 1994-95 but it 
is facing a health care crisis.  In fact the community of 
Delorine, Manitoba has lost all of its doctors and its citizens 
do not have access to health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can the minister explain, despite the floor and in spite of a

down by over $2 billion in which the province of Manitoba would 
share. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>May I also point out that Manitoba is sharing not only in the

I also point out that the Foundation for Innovation will give the

Health has a series of announcements of money going directly into 
Manitoba to help health care.

receive an allowance to reimburse them for the expenses they 
incur in discharging their duties.  There is no income tax on the

they must pay tax on any amount exceeding $500. This bill would 
double the tax exemption from $500 to $1,000. It would mean that 
volunteer firefighters would not be taxed on reasonable expenses 
incurred in their work, work which requires them to risk their

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>INCOME TAX CONVENTIONS IMPLEMENTATION ACT, 1997 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK172">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-10, an 
act to implement a convention between Canada and Sweden, a 
convention between Canada and the Republic of Lithuania, a 
convention between Canada and the Republic of Kazakhstan, a 
convention between Canada and the Republic of Iceland and a 
convention between Canada and the Kingdom of Denmark for the 
avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion 
with respect to taxes on income and to amend the 
Canada-Netherlands Income Tax Convention Act, 1986 and the 
Canada-United States Tax Convention Act, 1984, be read the second 
time. 
<P><A NAME="LINK173"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
with great pride that I rise to make my maiden speech in this 
36th Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take this opportunity to thank 
the people of the riding of Trois-Rivières for once again placing 
their trust in me, and in particular the people of the new area 
in the Trois- Rivières riding that takes in Louiseville, 
Maskinongé and Saint-Léon-le-Grand, who placed their trust in me 
for the first time.  I intend to keep doing a good job, as Mr. 
Duplessis once said, and to try to represent my constituents to 
the best of my ability by taking to heart their hopes and their 
problems, and by devoting a good part of my energy, for this is 
also fundamental for me,  to promoting, in keeping with the Bloc 
Quebecois' mandate, the sovereignist proposal, which we feel is 
the best status for the people of Quebec in the international 
community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also happy to speak to Bill C-10. If I may, I will read the 
purpose of this bill, an act to implement a convention between 
Canada and Sweden, a convention between Canada and the Republic 
of Lithuania, a convention between Canada and the Republic of 
Kazakhstan, a convention between Canada and the Republic of 
Iceland and a convention between Canada and the Kingdom of 
Denmark for the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention 
of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income and to amend 
the Canada-Netherlands Income Tax Convention Act, 1986 and the 
Canada-United States Tax Convention Act, 1984. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main purpose 
of this bill is to prevent tax evasion.  Its fair and equitable 
purpose is to prevent double taxation when a company pays taxes 
in a country with which Canada has signed a treaty. 
This is, therefore, a measure aimed at ensuring fair and 
equitable taxation for residents and non-residents, as well as at 
encouraging trade and investments between countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These 
treaties must not, however, open the door to abusive tax evasion. 
It must be kept in mind, moreover, that the purpose of tax 
conventions is to eliminate double taxation; in other words, 
profits and income earned in one country covered by the 
convention will be taxed in that country alone. A Canadian 
company earning 50% of its profits in the United States will be 
able, under certain conditions, to bring those profits back to 
Canada without being taxed once again by Revenue Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is more or less what the bill is all about. It will define 
financial and trade relations between corporations.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some things that bear repeating on the operation of our 
taxation system, and I will address it by using the May 1996 
auditor general report as my main inspiration.  First of all, 
however, I would like to make you aware that in Canada we have a 
bad example, coming from our No. 2 man in politics, the 
finance minister who, as a businessman, has a major interest in 
Canada Steamship Lines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were given some valuable 
information in <I>Le Soleil</I> on April 24, 1997 on the actions of 
that company, no doubt carried out by the agents of the Minister 
of Finance. Canada Steamship Line, until 1981, oddly enough, 
operated exclusively in Canada; since then, it has diversified, 
with globalization, and now deals, strangely enough, with 
countries that have very little taxation, countries known as tax 
havens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we saw earlier, tax treaties should be signed by economies 
which are more or less on a par, with the understanding that some 
gains and losses will result, thus the consequent dealings on tax 
issues. However, there are countries in this world where one can 
make profits, pretend to pay taxes and come back to Canada saying 
I paid my dues over there«, just like in well-structured 
countries where people really pay taxes. Such countries are 
called tax havens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, Canada Steamship Lines expanded its operations to three 
countries that are tax havens and banana republics, namely 
Bermuda, Liberia and Barbados. In Bermuda,  there is no tax on 
revenues, with a possible exemption until the year 2016. Canada 
Steamship Lines does business there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Liberia, there is no tax on ship operations. There is only an 
annual tax of $350 U.S., but no tax on ship operations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Barbados, a decreasing tax is imposed. Believe it or not, the 
rate goes from 2.5% down to 1%. Canada Steamship Lines pretends 
to pay taxes in these countries and then tells Revenue Canada 
that it indeed paid taxes, but this is against the spirit of the 
law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very unfortunate. There are probably not too many 
countries in the world where a finance minister, albeit very 
honourable, can behave in such fashion. 
People in certain circles have been saying for quite a while that 
this situation should be addressed and it has not been addressed. 
A kind of conflict of interest therefore exists which we have a 
right to denounce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would now like to quote extensively from 
the auditor general's report of May 1996, an entire chapter of 
which deals with tax avoidance.  The very fact that an entire 
chapter deals with this issue shows that there is a deep 
uneasiness with the way revenue collection is managed in the 
Prime Minister's great big Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On page 11-9 of his report, the auditor general prefaces the 
chapter by stating that “Amending tax law is crucial”. 
Paragraph 11.12 reads as follows: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—Problems in the 
application of the law need to be noted and corrected as soon as 
possible. 
</UL></UL>
<We will see how effective this “as soon as possible” is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Paragraph 11.13 states, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>11.13 We noted that 
Revenue Canada has brought to the attention of the Department of 
Finance— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because there are discussions between these people; information 
flows between them. The finance department we mentioned earlier 
is at the heart of the whole process. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>11.13 
We noted that 
Revenue Canada has brought to the attention of the Department  of 
Finance many situations suggesting that the law needed to be 
strengthened. 
When this is the case, it is customary for both departments to 
exchange views on the best way to modify the tax legislation. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He goes on to give examples of  delays. The auditor general 
criticizes among other things the fact that action is slow in 
coming despite the urgency of the situation with regard to the 
tax base, which he himself referred to.

<A HREF="#LINKT53"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can see the practical repercussions on the tax base. This is 
why there were so many cuts and why, on the back of the provinces 
and the most disadvantaged, the most vulnerable in our 
society, and I'll get back to this in a few minutes, the deficit 
was cut. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general said: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—For example, in 1989, changes to the rules dealing with 
non-resident corporations were requested by tax avoidance 
officials. The changes are still under consideration. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was in 1989: “The changes are still under consideration”. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1990, changes to rules dealing with forgiveness of debt were 
requested; the change was introduced in 1994 and became effective 
in 1995. 
</UL>
<And they were very long and involved the public purse. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1991, changes to the rules dealing with tax shelters were 
requested. These have not been finalized. 
</UL>
<The auditor general is the one saying what was requested since 
1991. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Paragraph 11.15 is very interesting, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>11.15 Our 1990 report à this was written in 1996—noted that 
the law enables a private foundation to loan back to a 
non-arm's-length donor all funds donated. Interest payments on 
the loan may also be loaned back to the donor. Revenue Canada has 
reassessed some cases where donations were loaned back, and is 
pursuing other cases, no legislative action has been taken yet to 
stop these abusive schemes. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is tax evasion. It deprives the tax system of funds it is 
entitled to and obliges the government to penalize those who have 
no money. Thus the auditor general tried as well to look at the 
government's political intention to really collect the funds due 
it to ensure greater fiscal justice. 
He went to the offices of Revenue Canada in Toronto. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In paragraph 11.25, the report states: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—the Department's large business tax auditors referred only 27 
cases to the tax avoidance unit in 1994-95. Only one referral was 
made by its large business tax auditors in Toronto— 
</UL></UL>
<Toronto,  where many large businesses are located. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only one referral was made by the large business tax auditors in 
Toronto, where many large businesses are located. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the West is not left out where money is concerned.  The 
Reform Party ought to be thrilled to hear that. 
The auditor has a kind thought for the westerners in paragraph 
11.30 of his document, where he states, this time about Calgary: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>11.30  Calgary  tax avoidance auditors have identified avoidance 
schemes in the oil and gas sector involving the inappropriate use 
of losses totalling $826 million. 
</UL>
<We are talking about big bucks, very big bucks here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This time it is a matter of tax evasion  compromising the tax 
base.  This is nothing but talk, at a time when the decision has 
been made to put our fiscal house in order, a time when the 
decision has been made that the welfare state is no more, at a 
time when it is announced that there will be no more money paid 
out unless we know where it is going, at a time when systematic 
cuts are being made in services which would, normally, be useful, 
unemployment insurance primarily. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was no hesitation here, as in the rest of the western 
world, to cut unemployment insurance, which they have blithely 
renamed employment insurance.  Now fewer than 50% of unemployed 
people can get unemployment insurance.  This is scandalous in 
itself, that people pay in and criteria after criteria after 
criteria are created with the result that, when people do get 
into the vulnerable position of losing their jobs, they are 
deprived of something they have paid into for so many years.  The 
result of this is that today fewer, far fewer, than 50% of those 
who end up unemployed are entitled to unemployment insurance.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know the shameful cuts that have been made in all provinces, 
cuts that have put the provinces in difficulty and that have 
forced them to make cuts to health care throughout Canada. 
Provincial governments have been forced to make cuts in education 
and in sectors fundamental to a civilized society. And for what 
reason? But the tax base is being destroyed, as we have just 
shown, through evasion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet, we know about the many women who 
are single parents in Canada right now and about the rampant 
poverty. We know about the staggering growth in food banks—they 
are almost doing more business than any of Canada's other banks. 
We know about the crushing level of individual debt—and if there 
were a new increase in interest rates, you know what would 
happen.  We know about the terrible situations in which people 
find themselves, and which drive too many of our fellow citizens 
to take their own lives.  We know about the number of people 
burning out in our society today.  We know that the ranks of the 
poor have swelled by 300,000 since the Liberals came to power in 
1993.  We know that 1.5 million people are unemployed in this 
wonderful country called Canada, and that the Prime Minister 
makes disgraceful claims here in the House and abroad, as though 
there were no problems, as though he were uninformed.  We know 
about the record number of personal bankruptcies being declared 
in our economy right now, which undermines both individuals and 
their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Things are not going well in this country. Why? Because the 
government  is too lax and too soft with those who hold financial 
power, those who can develop schemes such as the ones condemned 
by the auditor general because they deprive our tax base of its 
ability to better redistribute wealth. This scandal is a daily 
occurrence and, even though it was condemned by the auditor 
general, it has yet to be corrected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the issue of tax avoidance. There is the issue of 
family trusts, which is another major scandal. What emerged was 
probably the tip of the iceberg, once again thanks to the auditor 
general's work. 
We know that, on December 23, 1991, a series of discussions 
secretly took place between Finance and Revenue officials, with 
Revenue Canada almost refusing to comply with the finance 
department's order to practically amend its Income Tax Act 
regarding the transfer of assets from the Canadian economy to the 
American economy, because this is exactly what happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian tax legislation is very clear. There are two times 
when each and everyone of us must normally à and I mean normally 
à pay our dues to the Canadian tax man: when we die or when we 
leave the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following this undue pressure from the Department of Finance, 
once again, one very big, or perhaps two à it is all very 
nebulous à family trusts were able to take assets worth $1 
billion Can. each and transfer them to the United States without 
paying taxes. 
This is a very serious action, whose implications are 
unfortunately yet unknown because everything is so nebulous and 
kept secret at the expense of low income earners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has led to the cuts that 
we know about, depriving the government of hundreds of millions 
of dollars in tax revenue, anything between $350 million and $700 
million depending on the interpretation. That is how, in this 
great big country, we have come to make cuts at the expense of 
the less fortunate and at the expense of the provinces, which, in 
turn, have to make more cuts at the expense of the less 
fortunate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What this means is that an in-depth tax reform is required in 
Canada to ensure that all Canadians pay their fair and equitable 
share of taxes according to their means, their individual wealth, 
in a spirit of social justice, this social justice about which we 
have heard so much rhetoric by the likes of Pierre Elliott 
Trudeau, as the members across the way know very well. 
In a fair 
society, wealth is distributed equitably instead of being 
increasingly concentrated, because wealth that is not distributed 
does not evaporate, it is concentrated.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is safe to say that wealth is 
increasingly concentrated in Canada, as well as throughout the 
western hemisphere, where, unfortunately, approximately 200 
boards of directors or families are gaining more and more control 
over the planet, subjugating government more and more everywhere, 
in the western hemisphere and around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to a 
UN report—and I will conclude on this—if I remember 
correctly, there are 358 billionaires controlling 45% of the 
global wealth. We have problems in Canada, Quebec and the western 
hemisphere. 
It is high time 
that governments freely generated revenue and communicated more 
so that we can have, around the world, in this country and in the 
new state that Quebec will be, a fairer and more equitable 
society where everyone contributes according to his means.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jerry Pickard (Kent—Essex, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is 
a pleasure for me to speak to Bill C-10.  It is a bill that is 
wrapped in fairness.  There is absolutely no question that when 
people are treated in an unfair way that the unfairness be 
corrected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quite frankly, when the Canadian government examined what had 
happened in the tax agreements with the United States—by the way 
several other countries are involved in this tax agreement—in 
1995-96, it realized there was an imbalance in the way Canadians 
paid taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the background history to Bill C-10 and what the 
benefits will be.  I would like to compare Canadians from 1984 
onward who worked in the United States.  Take for example 
security guards working in Michigan earning $20,000 and security 
guards working in the House of Commons.  When these people added 
up their retirement benefits, those who worked in the United 
States had been given 50% of their benefits tax free, but those 
people who worked in Canada had to pay tax on 100% of their 
income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a common thought by every one of us that if there is to be 
fairness, if each person earns $20,000 and is paid equal 
benefits, the taxation should be somewhat equal. It is very 
difficult to justify a 50% reduction for those Canadians who 
worked in the United States but who claimed their taxes in Canada 
where every other Canadian had to pay on the full 100% of their 
income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe I could explain the reason why that structure existed. 
The United States had a rule at that time that it would tax only 
50% of social security benefits.  It was able to say to all those 
who received benefits such as social security, family benefits or 
disability benefits it would only charge on 50%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a totally different system in Canada.  Our system says 
“For you folks who need that extra support, we will pay health 
care.  We will pay the benefits that this country gives over and 
above a tax break in the dollars you receive”. Our structure was 
designed to make sure that Canadians got the basic services that 
they wanted. We look at the health care, the drug plans, the 
benefits that seniors have in this country.  That is not the case 
in the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, as we go along with this process and as we looked at it 
we thought that in order to bring fairness we would write a tax 
treaty with the United States before 1996. 
In that change to the tax treaty what the finance minister tried 
to implement was a system where if you drew your benefits from 
the United States you would pay the normal United States taxation 
and if you drew your benefits from Canada you would pay the 
normal Canadian benefits.

<A HREF="#LINKT56"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem that occurred at that point was that the United 
States, rather than stay with that, charged all Canadians who 
were receiving social security benefits from the United States 
25.5% taxation on those benefits and put a clause in stating that 
those taxes would be non-refundable. Even if under United States 
law they were not required to pay that much money, it still taxed 
them at a rate of 25.5%, which myself, all of the members in the 
Liberal caucus whom I talked to and the finance minister all 
agreed that the United States was being very unfair to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is the scenario that the United States implemented.  It was 
charging its own folks in their own country one rate, but 
Canadians working in that country were charged a higher rate. 
That was very unfair.  They could not file to get the 25% back. 
If they were not supposed to be paying more than 10% they could 
not make a tax filing and get the 15% back. They were just taxed 
a flat rate of 25.5% which made it that Canadians who worked in 
the United States and received social security were being treated 
very badly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister then looked at what was transpiring and 
said he would correct it.  This is a result of a lot of 
negotiations with the United States and a lot of negotiations in 
Canada to try to come up with a policy which states that all 
Canadians will be taxed in a fair and just way and Americans who 
actually earn incomes here in Canada, the U.S. can tax them in a 
fair and just way.  However, we do not want to see Canadians who 
work in the United States taxed unfairly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The result was that Bill C-10 was negotiated with the United 
States over the last many months.  We have worked on trying to 
correct those problems that were there and were being used in a 
very unfair way for taxation policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are things that we did to try to correct that policy. That 
hardship of a 25.5% withholding tax in the United States on 
Canadians is totally eliminated.  The unfairness of that system 
is gone.  Canadians who earn social security in the United States 
will have that social security come back to Canada and here in 
Canada they will be taxed at the regular Canadian rates.  What it 
really means is that instead of being overtaxed in the United 
States, all Canadians now will be taxed by the Canadian 
government and they will be taxed on the basis of fairness to all 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one slight benefit for those people who receive social 
security benefits in the United States and come back and are 
taxed in Canada.  They will only be taxed on 85% of the income 
that they receive from the United States.  In other words they 
are still a little bit better off than all other Canadians, but 
it is certainly a much more fair and just system that has been 
put in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people who are hurt by this 25.5% rule that the United 
States put in were mainly those folks who earned less than 
$30,000.  The lower your income in Canada by the time you take 
your benefits off and look at the portion of your income that you 
pay in taxes, it reduces.  As your income is lower, so is your 
tax percentage lower.  As a result we are trying to get a policy 
in place by C-10 that gives more fairness to low income 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The result of that move really makes a big difference with a lot 
of Canadians.  Under the new rules several thousand Canadians 
will pay less taxes than they did before under the other 
agreement.  In fact there will be several thousand Canadians who 
will not have to pay any taxes at all on that income. 
It is a real benefit for low income Canadians, particularly those 
who have an income of $30,000 or less.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Once this policy is approved by the Canadian Parliament and the 
U.S. Senate, Canadian authorities will be able to work to ensure 
that refunds are given to those who were overtaxed in these last 
two years.  In other words Revenue Canada is going to take on the 
job of checking what they paid to the United States and what they 
should have paid under Canadian law and make certain that they 
get refunds. Those refund cheques will go out as soon as this 
bill becomes law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill will become law when it is passed in Canada and in the 
United States.  The sooner the bill is passed the sooner we will 
get fair treatment for lower income Canadians. That is why there 
is an urgency to move the bill ahead quickly now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question that for most residents of Canada, refunds 
will be handled by Revenue Canada. As a result they will not have 
to make application to the United States. We are trying to 
simplify the process as much as we can. Where those calculations 
show they receive money back, cheques will be sent to those 
residents by Revenue Canada as expediently as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also should point out that in some cases people with very high 
incomes would probably under the rules which exist have to pay 
more taxes in the last two years than they actually paid.  We 
have agreed in that convention that no one, no Canadian will pay 
more than the U.S. government taxed them in the first place.  No 
Canadian will pay more than they have already paid.  Many 
Canadians will get a refund and will be better off. Those will 
primarily be low income Canadians.  Not just seniors as was 
pointed out earlier, but also the disabled who have benefits 
coming from the U.S. and spouses who receive benefits from the 
United States will receive tax refunds as well.  There are many 
avenues by which these benefits will be calculated and paid back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we really look at it, we have taken a tax law which in many 
ways may have been a loophole whereby some people were not paying 
anywhere near what others were paying in the tax system and with 
Bill C-10 we are bringing people to a fairness where all 
Canadians will be paying approximately the same in taxation.  All 
Canadians will be treated fairly rather than unfairly.  In the 
future no Canadians will be allowed to be overtaxed by a 
government not in this country. That is a really important issue. 
The Canadian government is taking back control of taxation for 
Canadians. That is another extremely important point that 
everyone should realize. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have received several telephone calls from people about the 
tax rule.  I had friends come to me and say that the tax 
agreement that has been struck with the United States is unfair. 
After talking with them about the unfairness of the tax agreement 
which was put in place in 1996, they all said the reason it was 
unfair is that it is taxing them in a disproportionate way to 
everybody else and it had to be corrected. It was mentioned 
earlier that there are large lobby groups that are very upset 
that Canadians were being treated unfairly by the U.S. 
government.  Bill C-10 corrects that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The faster we can get Bill C-10 passed through the House and the 
Canadian Senate and through the U.S. Senate, the quicker we can 
get fairness for all Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When we take a reporting of income from 50%, jack it up to 85% 
and somehow call that fair, I do not see the fairness in that. 
The Liberals are going after the elderly in this bill. They are 
taxing people who have the least ability to pay.  These people 
cannot go back into the workforce.  They have retired based on 
the understanding that they are only going to have to report 50% 
of what they bring in through their social security cheques. This 
government has gone ahead and jacked it up by 70% and Liberal 
members sit their with smug smiles on their faces trying to 
justify this. How can they justify it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jerry Pickard:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am really surprised 
that a member of the Reform Party would stand and say that 
because a person has worked in a factory in Detroit they should 
pay less money than if they worked in a factory in Windsor.  I am 
astonished at his viewpoint. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fairness in taxation should be fairness for all Canadians, not a 
few.  When we are talking about fairness in taxation there is 
absolutely no question that if we only charge taxes on 50% of the 
income, those folks who are only paying the tax on 50% of their 
income are being taxed less than every other Canadian. There is 
no logical reason for that to happen here in this country. When 
we talk about fairness it is not that we have changed the rate. 
Fairness is that all Canadians whether they earn their income in 
the United States, Great Britain, Canada or Germany, should pay 
their Canadian taxes in some equal and fair fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party is suggesting because we are putting up 
somebody's taxes a slight amount that it is not fair. That is 
incorrect.  They did have a tremendous extra benefit that made no 
sense in Canada. We gave all of those folks who earned their 
income in the United States and came back to Canada their health 
care, medical care, the social benefits that they receive in 
Canada and at the same time we are asking them to pay 
approximately the same amount of taxes as all other Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not understand why the Reform Party would suggest that some 
Canadians pay less taxes than others on the same income.  That is 
unfair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders:</B>  Mr. Speaker, somehow I knew the Liberals 
would justify a tax increase because that is the Liberal way of 
doing business in this country. They bellyache about how they 
think this is fair.  They think that charging people or having 
them declare 85% of this is fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it fair that these people are going to lose thousands of 
dollars of their income when they do not earn very much yet 
members across the way collect millions of dollars in their gold 
plated MP pension plans?  Brian Tobin alone, the current premier 
of Newfoundland and a former minister of fisheries, is collecting 
$3.4 million as we speak.  The premier of Newfoundland along with 
the actions of the highest pay for a premier in any province in 
this country is making over $200,000 a year in aggregate.  How 
can they possibly justify this, all of them smug with their MP 
pensions?  Why should these people be suffering the blows to the 
tune of thousands of dollars while they all collect their super 
rich pensions? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jerry Pickard:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is interesting how the 
Reform Party member turns away from the real point when the issue 
gets a little straightforward and a little tough to deal with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member feel it is important that some Canadians get 
taxed at lower rates than other Canadians?  Does he feel that it 
is fair that somebody, and we are talking of low income 
Canadians, works and receives social benefits in Canada at 
$10,000?  The Liberal Party believes that one should be taxed the 
same as somebody who worked outside Canada and comes into Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that taxation should be fair and equal for equal 
incomes.  I believe that we should make certain that this issue 
is not an issue of inappropriate change. 
It is an issue of bringing fairness to the system where some 
folks are taxed at very close to the same rate as other 
Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is 
interesting to hear the Liberals talk about fair taxation.  They 
bellyache over the idea of people paying different levels of tax 
in order to justify raising taxes.  By that same logic would the 
Liberals take people who pay 17% and 22% in federal taxes and 
raise it to 29% to match those who pay the highest level of 
progressive income tax because that is fair, because there are 
different levels of taxation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If they bellyache about differing levels of taxation will they 
come clean and support a flat tax for income taxes like the 
Reform party has been advocating for everybody? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jerry Pickard:</B>  A fair tax is our policy.  There are 
good reasons to believe that we have a system in place that has 
been very productive and has provided Canadians with a pretty 
good standard of living. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We move away from the point of looking at how taxes work. Taxes 
are paid but Canadians benefit greatly from the taxes we pay. 
Look at the seniors benefit, at the OAS benefits, at all the 
benefits we provide.  We make certain that those tax dollars are 
spent wisely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After seeing what it is like in other countries, I know in 
Canada we have the highest standard of living in the world.  We 
have a good record of defending the weak, helping the sick, 
defending the poor, helping the seniors, helping the disabled. We 
have been world leaders in social policy.  You cannot deny that, 
nor can anyone else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Year after year the United Nations has pointed to Canada as 
being the best country in the world.  All that comes about 
because of the policies that are put in place by governments in 
this country.  We have run the country extremely well.  When you 
can tell me any country that is better off than Canada, then you 
can preach the way you are.  But until you can tell me a country 
that is better off than this country, I do not buy your argument.

usual he is correct in what he says.  He makes it easier for me 
to pursue this subject. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-10 is another example of the government's caring about 
Canadians, not only for our young people and future generations 
but for Canadian taxpayers who are out working every day, paying 
taxes and supporting a country that is unquestionably the best 
country in the world.  According to recent new reports, Canada is 
also the best country in the world in which to invest.

</I></B></P><P align=left>A government which puts people first is a government that will 
ultimately provide Canadians with the services they deserve in 
exchange for the payment of taxes, which at all times taxpayers 
begrudge.  However, when the services are good and when 
government leadership is good they will accept paying taxes in 
the knowledge that they are contributing to ensuring the safety 
of our social safety net for the future, our pension system, our 
employment insurance system and our health system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-10 is an example of the government continuing to be a 
caring government.  When the amendment to the treaty was passed a 
couple of years ago it is acknowledged that there was an 
oversight or a mistake.  I had a number of constituents who were 
adversely affected by the measure which allowed their U.S. 
pension income to be taxed at source, but did not provide them 
with any means to get a deduction through the tax system because 
they could not file in the U.S. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of my colleagues from Windsor said earlier that the Liberal 
MPs in the Windsor area got together and talked to the finance 
minister.  I applaud their efforts in bringing this issue to his 
attention.  For my part, I also brought the matter to the 
attention of the finance minister, as I expect did many Liberal 
members.  Being the kind of finance minister he is, being the 
kind of government that we have, the response was “Let us 
acknowledge that we have a difficulty here.  Let us do something 
about it”.  This is an example of a government which listens. 
This government cares about the people it serves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though, in terms of numbers, there may only be a few 
thousand Canadians who are adversely affected, it does not matter 
that there are only a few thousand.  There could be a million or 
there could be ten.  The problem is that these seniors have been 
adversely affected and if as a government we can do something 
about it, that is what we have set out to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I applaud the efforts of the finance minister in responding to 
the appeals from his colleagues on this side of the House to do 
something about the oversight.  Canadians can expect that the 
government will listen to them in future sessions of this 
Parliament and hopefully beyond. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In recognition of the oversight, the new rules provide for the 
change to be retroactive to January 1996, so that no one who 
found themselves caught in this unfortunate trap will at the end 
of the day pay a penalty.  In fact, I understand that Revenue 
Canada will make every effort to automatically correct this 
problem for Canadians who have been adversely affected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me use this opportunity to say a bit more about why the 
government is caring and why it has taken the measure which it 
has in Bill C-10. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not so long ago we had the Speech from the Throne.  It contained 
numerous initiatives which, as we head into the next millennium, 
indicate nothing else but that we want all citizens to benefit 
from the turning tide, from the growing economy and from the 
social safety net which past governments and all Canadians have 
worked so hard over the decades to create.  It is in getting the 
financial matters on a strong footing that we can most 
effectively take measures to protect valuable programs, such as 
the health care system, the pension system and the employment 
insurance system.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me speak for a moment about the health care system because 
it is the very client group, the very citizens who have been 
helped through this protocol in Bill C-10. In most cases this 
group has been worried about the health care system.  I believe 
they can find in the leadership of the government, the health 
minister and the Prime Minister the very best of intentions, the 
very best of plans to ensure that the health care system 
continues to be the finest in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the chance to visit an Asian country a couple of years 
ago.  While there I discovered that as its economy was growing, 
its citizens came to a point where they wanted to institute a 
national health plan. They looked to Canada's plan and 
implemented a health care system for their country that is 
modelled after Canada's. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though we have our detractors, mostly those from south of 
the border who do not want to see the U.S. move into a national 
universal health care system, when they really get down to it 
these detractors have to admit that the system in Canada costs 
less per capita on the basis of a percentage of GDP than the U.S. 
system and covers everybody from coast to coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a system that Canadians have come to value.  They may even 
take it for granted.  It is wonderful that you can take for 
granted a system that will take care of you and a system that 
does not require that you pull out your Visa card or chequebook 
when you go to the doctor or to the hospital.  The very citizens 
who were adversely affected initially by this protocol will now 
be favourably impacted by Bill C-10.  We want to get the message 
to them that they should not be worried about the health care 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, changes are taking place at the provincial level. Provinces 
are for their own and different reasons taking measures to 
rationalize the health care system and its delivery in their 
provinces.  I believe there is a universal commitment from coast 
to coast to maintain the five principles even though there may be 
some debate between the federal government and certain provinces 
from time to time on the interpretation of those principles. Very 
few Canadians would want us to step back to decades past with one 
system for the rich and another for everybody else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an extension of the concept of a caring government taking 
this initiative with Bill C-10, I take as an example the 
pharmacare system we talked about in the campaign.  I grant this 
is not something that will happen overnight.  Maybe it will take 
five or ten years, maybe longer, to implement a national 
pharmacare system. If we do not start talking about it now we 
will never get there.  A national drug plan, a plan which would 
provide all Canadians with equal access to medically necessary 
drugs is a plan that is typically Canadian, a plan that reflects 
the values of sharing our wealth and of sharing our vision for a 
country that cares about its individual citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Along with the pharmacare plan I know there have been some 
discussions about a universal home care plan.  I see it as simply 
a mechanism to allow our health care system to extend into our 
neighbourhoods and into the homes of Canadians.  That too is a 
logical extension of the kind of thinking we see from this 
government consistently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding of Algoma—Manitoulin in northern Ontario, which is 
quite a large, beautiful Great Lakes riding, I have about 18 
First Nations communities.  Very few Canadians would disagree 
that our First Nations add so much to the culture of our society. 
At the same time there needs to be a change in the relationship 
between the federal government and our First Nations which would 
allow our First Nations to more readily achieve their full 
potential.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we heard in the throne speech and what is exemplified by 
Bill C-10 is the willingness to work with first nations so they 
can benefit, using their own leadership and their own resources 
in partnership with the federal government and with the province 
where appropriate, as can all Canadian communities from the vast 
riches of the nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we approach the next millennium no Canadian will be left 
totally behind.  We want a society where perhaps there are some 
who are richer than others but the gap is not a widening gap but 
a narrowing one.  No Canadian will ever complain about being left 
behind due to illiteracy, health problems or the fact that they 
live in one area of the country or another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though some critics have said that we have been too focused 
on deficit reduction, those critics are few and far between. Last 
Friday a constituent, a leader of a community on Manitoulin 
Island with its own challenges that is doing very well, who might 
have had reason to say otherwise told me very sincerely that the 
government and finance minister were doing a terrific job with 
the deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They started with fundamentals such as managing their own books 
the way they would want their own family books to be kept.  That 
starts a domino effect that can do nothing but favourably impact 
on all other segments of society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In getting our deficit under control and balancing the books as 
we will in the next year or so, the government is not out there 
competing for borrowings with the private sector, which helps 
keep interest rates down.  If there is any better economic 
development tool than low interest rates, I challenge my 
colleagues opposite to tell me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most of us remember the days of high inflation and high interest 
rates not only in our country but around the world.  Nobody would 
ever choose to go back to those times.  The combination of low 
interest rates and low inflation has provided an environment of 
confidence that I have not felt for a long time.  I appreciate 
the opportunity to be part of a government that has a vision, a 
plan and the will to carry out its agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 20 minutes it is difficult to say all the things we want to 
say, but I will pick out the most important ones as I go along. 
As I listened to some of my opposition colleagues, particularly 
those in the Reform Party, I heard them use Bill C-10 as a 
vehicle to talk about their alleged grief over the CPP and Bill 
C-2.  They are rolling that issue under the umbrella of Bill 
C-10.  They have had ample opportunity to say their piece about 
very necessary changes to the CPP Canadians want us to make but 
they repeatedly talk about a tax grab. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have said earlier, when workers put money toward their CPP 
and the employer does likewise, it is an investment in a plan 
that is the envy of industrialized nations around the world.  We 
are one of the few industrialized nations that has taken hold of 
the pension problem and has taken steps to correct it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard much particularly from the official opposition, the 
Reform Party, about this 9% plus rate.  It will not acknowledge 
that a private super RRSP plan may require 13% to 15% 
contributions by Canadian workers without the necessary 
protection we need for workers who become disabled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many constituents have come to see me because they look toward 
the Canada pension disability program to assist them at a time of 
great need because of a heart attack or some other medical 
condition that has rendered them unable to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we put all this together it states that the government 
cares about the people who have worked so hard to build the 
country: seniors and the people of my generation and the 
generations after who will take the baton and continue to build 
the country.  No country anywhere should stop its effort to 
build. This country is no different.  We must continue to 
contribute in whatever fashion we can to make the country 
stronger and stronger. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The actions of the government clearly are actions that will make 
the country stronger.  If we have to put up with a bit of 
criticism along the way, it comes with the territory.  It comes 
with being responsible for governing the country.  If it were not 
for our willingness to take up that challenge and make some tough 
decisions from time to time, the country would be in a very sorry 
state. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I attempt to wind up, let me reiterate the people we are 
attempting to assist through Bill C-10 are our neighbours, our 
grandparents and our parents.  These people got caught 
inadvertently in a trap.  Our colleagues across the way can look 
to the government and honestly admit that it has listened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not the first time and it certainly will not be the last 
time.  It is incumbent upon us as a government to continue to 
listen to the people.  My colleagues are regularly in their 
ridings listening to their constituents either in travelling 
office hours like I do or at town hall meetings.  By that process 
we know what people are saying.  I know my colleagues' doors are 
always open to their constituents as are the doors to my riding 
office and to the travelling office I maintain on a regular 
basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The citizens of the Algoma—Manitoulin riding are looking to the 
government to continue its leadership.  I certainly get 
complaints from time to time which are justified.  No government 
is perfect.  I would be the last one ever to say that.  I can say 
with honesty that there is no alternative for the country at this 
time than the kind of government we are capable of offering to 
the people.  I am proud to be part of the government.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, we are 
talking today about increasing the taxes to be paid by people who 
receive social security from the United States.  The government 
is perfectly willing, as it pointed out today, to tax people who 
have worked outside the country at some point in their lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just want to see if I can get a commitment from the 
government.  Is it willing to commit that it will never increase 
taxes on those people who solely collect the CPP or other 
programs in Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to get that in <I>Hansard</I> today.  In that way, 
if the government does it in the future, we can point to the 
record and say that it did not tell the whole truth on that one 
too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Brent St. Denis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it would be 
presumptuous of me or any member to try to speak for the entire 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the performance of the government since first 
being elected in the fall of 1993 we would have to conclude the 
taxpayers are in very good hands.  It has not increased personal 
income taxes one iota since being elected.  If we project that 
into the future I would say to my colleague across the way that 
his bets are best with us.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that persons work outside the country and we have been 
able to repatriate them into the domestic tax system so that they 
will be better off is a sign that the government cares. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had an alternative method in the previous system.  The U.S. 
government was the taxer and our citizens were inadvertently the 
victims.  We have corrected that.  In most cases the citizens 
affected by the bill will pay less taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If my colleague across the way looks carefully at the record, he 
can presume the taxpayers are in very good hands and will be for 
a long time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to make a 
comment about the government since it was elected in 1993, about 
how it claims to have done such a good job with taxes and about 
how taxes have not gone up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government members seem to forget that the tax on life insurance 
premiums were extended.  At the low end it brought in an extra 
$120 million a year and at the high end $210 million.  They seem 
to forget that the lifetime capital gains exemption was 
eliminated, which at its high point brought in $415 million in a 
given year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They seem to forget deductions for business meals were reduced, 
which resulted at its high in $275 million more to the 
government. They forget the changes to the tax treatment of 
securities which resulted in $60 million more per year.  They 
forgot about the air transportation tax which resulted in $41 
million in its highest year.  They forgot about the accelerated 
capital cost allowances and the $45 million it brought in, in its 
highest year.  The excise tax on gasoline brought in $500 
million.  The excise tax on tobacco increased by $65 million per 
year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They forgot about the reduction on the RRSP overcontribution 
which brought in $10 million per year.  They forgot about the 
world income tax of non-resident pensions that brought in $10 
million per year.  They forgot about the RRSP withdrawal age 
dropping down to 69, which brought in $45 million.  They forgot 
about another increase on tobacco that brought in $100 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They forgot about the overseas employment credit which brought 
in $10 million.  They forgot about the EI premiums for part-time 
workers which brought in $1 billion.  They forgot about EI 
premiums going from 3% to 3.07%, which brought in $400 million, 
and the bracket creep which resulted in them redefining income 
and bringing in $3.6 billion more.  That was just the last time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the increase to the CPP was brought in it was the 37th tax 
increase.  This one is the 38th.  How can they possibly say they 
have reduced or kept taxes decent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Brent St. Denis:</B>   Mr. Speaker, as I listened to my 
colleague across the way the first thought that came to mind was 
whether he agreed with closing tax loopholes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott:</B>  Is the excise tax on gas a tax loophole? 
Give me a break. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Brent St. Denis:</B>  The litany of tax measures he talked 
about were things his own party called for.  They go on and on 
about the CPP increase being a tax.  If we throw enough mud at 
the wall some of it will stick. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By way of a reminder, it is an investment.  We still do not know 
what the super RRSP rate of the Reform Party will be.  Some say 
it will be 13% to 15%.  How can they unfavourably compare that to 
9% plus is beyond my comprehension.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I think they only have to look at their own program to 
understand that the government, in a very responsible, very 
people oriented and caring way, has implemented changes to the 
tax system which will lead to more fairness and the closing of 
loopholes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of the day it will lead to greater confidence by 
investors outside the country and investors domestically on what 
they should do to invest in the country.  At the same time it 
will create more confidence among workers, seniors and everyone 
else in society who believes this is the best country in the 
world and it will remain so. 
<P><A NAME="LINK179"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I think I am beginning to understand what this is all 
about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we said that a tax is an investment.  I do not know, I 
am only an accountant but the last time I looked we never 
classified a tax as an investment.  I do not think that the 
average tax paying citizen who has to pay out of their pocket, 
take their wallet out and pay taxes, is looking at this as an 
investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the member opposite, from the Liberal Party for those who 
are listening, if he could reconfirm that the Liberal government 
sees taxes as investments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Brent St. Denis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think I am getting 
through.  I appreciate this exchange for no other reason than now 
some members opposite are asking themselves what is the 
difference between an investment and a tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When they talk about the super RRSP, they talk about people 
investing.  They do not talk about the rate.  I will tell members 
what the rate will be.  The rate will be something like 13% to 
15% and they use the word investment in their private super RRSP 
of the individual Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it is an investment for their super RRSP, it must also be an 
investment, at a much lower and reasonable rate, in the Canada 
pension plan.  Clearly my colleague across the way, and I believe 
he is or was an accountant, should know that an investment is 
something which gives you a payback in the future.  I expect he, 
along with other Canadians, will be able to get Canada pension 
payments back when he retires. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am really glad that my colleagues across the way are getting a 
little anxious about this.  I have a sense that some 
understanding is coming into their minds on the issue.  It is 
nice to be holding a flashlight for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An investment, for the benefit of my colleagues across the way, 
is something that provides a repayment in the future.  They along 
with their colleagues in other parties will understand the very 
big difference between a tax and an investment.  Payments to CPP 
are an investment.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney—Victoria, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to address this bill in the House.  Before I do I feel 
I have to make some comments with regard to the statements made 
by the previous two speakers, the members of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take the hon. members at their word when they talk about 
things like fairness and a caring government.  I feel it 
incumbent on me to point out that if they do believe benefits 
should be distributed fairly and the government is actively 
pursuing this I can point out numerous examples where benefits 
have not been distributed fairly. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1635"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT66"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could begin with the people in Atlantic Canada who are 
seasonal workers.  I could go on to the members of the merchant 
marines who are seeking the same kind of benefits as other 
veterans from the second world war. I could go on to talk about 
the First Nations people who are seeking the same kind of 
employment opportunities that those in central Canada benefit 
from.  I believe them when they say their government is committed 
to those things and I look forward to their introducing some 
legislation that might move us in that direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said, I feel incumbent to talk a bit about the 
importance of this bill to the people in my riding. It is an 
important bill because I represent a large number of seniors in 
Sydney—Victoria.  There is a disproportionate amount of seniors 
if we look at the demographics in terms of population.  We have a 
large number of seniors living in my riding, some of whom receive 
social security from the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason that many of the seniors in my riding receive that 
income is telling.  Many of them are seniors who went away 30 or 
40 years ago to find employment in what we used to call the 
Boston states, to find employment in New York.  The adage or the 
picture of the maritimer going down the road is as old as I can 
remember and indeed many of the seniors who would benefit from 
U.S. social security do so because there were no employment 
opportunities for them back in the 1940s and 1950s in Atlantic 
Canada, and unfortunately they have come home to retire to see 
many of their nephews and nieces and grandchildren going down the 
road again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is with some interest that the seniors in my riding who do 
receive this type of income will review this legislation.  I 
cannot help wonder as we move to amend this legislation if what 
we are really doing is preparing the next generation of Atlantic 
Canadians for their U.S. social security benefits that they might 
collect in the event that they were fortunate enough to retire 
back to the land that they did not want to leave in the first 
place but had to because of the policies of the government that 
were referred to by the previous speakers as caring and fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said, it is also interesting to see the beginning of 
what I would call a harmonization tax system between us 
and the Americans.  In light of recent free trade agreements, in 
light of recent developments it is not surprising that we are 
beginning to see a harmonization of tax systems between the two 
countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The previous speaker went to great lengths to talk about the 
health care system, how important it was to Canadians and how 
there may be some opposition and some concern about American 
giant corporations moving into that health care system.  As we 
look at the harmonization that has taken place in terms of 
economic policy and the integration of the North American 
economic factions that this government is so proud of it is no 
surprise that we see today the beginnings of some type of tax 
harmonization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now move directly to the bill.  I am interested and 
pleased to say that in the New Democratic Party we have always 
fought to prevent fiscal tax evasion and we have always fought 
for fairer taxes. Unfortunately the same cannot be said of 
government. In the province I come from, if the government is 
concerned about fair taxes, I believe that we can begin this 
debate. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1640"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT67"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the government has finally given us a bit of a 
beachhead to begin the debate that we took to the Canadian public 
in the last election on fair taxes.  If the government is truly 
interested in that it should look at some things like the GST 
and, in the province I come from, the harmonized sales tax, which 
is an unfair tax.  If the government were committed to fair 
taxation it would begin implementation of fair taxation by 
scrapping those taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government members may think this is rhetoric from the NDP and 
from the opposition benches, but I cannot help but notice that in 
the last provincial election in my home province of Nova Scotia 
the hon. premier, Russell MacLellan, who was a government 
member who voted in favour of the GST, during his leadership 
campaign thought better of it.  I cannot help but notice that the 
former provincial finance minister, the hon. Bernie Boudreau, who 
negotiated the harmonized sales tax with this government, began 
his leadership campaign to be the Liberal premier of Nova Scotia 
by saying that he had thought better of it. The conversions on 
the road to Damascus were amazing for the people of Nova Scotia 
to behold.  They will have their say on it before too long. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we want to talk about the beginnings of fair taxation, we 
could look at some of those policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the bill, parts I through V which attempt to 
avoid double taxation we have no problem with.  We can support 
those parts in principle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part VI amends the Canada-Netherlands Income Tax Convention Act, 
1986 and adds provisions concerning mutual assistance in the 
collection of taxes and the elimination of withholding tax on 
patent and knowhow royalties, which are technical amendments. We 
may be able to find our way to support those. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part VII, however, contains superficial revisions to the 
legislation from the previous Parliament and I think that we 
would find it difficult to support that section of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The group Canadians asking for social security equality lobbied the 
government to take the legislation back to pre-1996.  People made 
their retirement plans based on the structure as it was at that 
time.  There was one set of conditions that these seniors planned 
their retirement on and it has now all changed.  I am concerned 
about the consequences to the ordinary taxpayer who cannot now 
change their retirement plans the way the government can change 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those people who planned for their retirement under the rules of 
the pre-1996 legislation will not be returned to their same 
situation but will find themselves taxed at 85% of their income. 
They are justifiably concerned and justifiably outraged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague has indicated that there should be a grandfathering 
clause for those individuals and I would support that. The NDP 
will always support legitimate tax reform and has always been the 
first advocate of real tax reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again I note that the hon. member for Essex, who spoke in the 
House prior to question period, talked about how this legislation 
came into being.  She said that her constituents lobbied her, 
phoned her, and then the MPs got together and persuaded the 
Minister of Finance to listen to their concerns.  I only wish 
that the fairness talked about by government members and the 
method of introducing change could be so easily accomplished by 
those of us from outside the Ontario region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My constituents have called me to lobby me concerning changes to 
the employment act, changes to fisheries and the TAGS program. 
Every time we attempt to have the Minister of Finance so 
graciously change his legislation, or the Minister of Human 
Resources Development, we are not met with quite the same 
friendly hand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I admire the hon. member for Essex for her tenacity.  I remind 
the government that we are all in this House elected members and 
I would hope that we would receive the same consideration from 
the Minister of Finance.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
congratulate the member for his speech in opposition to the 
government legislation.  I will also ask a question.  The 
socialist to my far left talked about his opposition to the 
harmonized sales tax.  I wonder if he could muse out loud for 
Canadians his thoughts on wealth taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have given my views on 
the harmonized tax.  The hon. member is correct.  I welcome his 
question because in terms of a tax on wealth, some of the 
government members used terms like every Canadian should pay 
exactly the same amount of taxes and at the same rate and at the 
same percentage.  Of course I do not share that view, and that is 
why I oppose the harmonized sales tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If an individual is buying children's clothing or if a senior is 
paying for oil or electricity on a fixed income at the same rate 
as an individual who is wealthy, it is not a fair tax system.  In 
terms of taxing the wealthy, I think they should pay their fair 
share which would be considerably more than many of the people in 
my constituency who are on fixed incomes. 
<P><A NAME="LINK182"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the question my colleague asked the NDP member is very important. 
Unfortunately it seems as though the member did not quite hear 
it, so I will spell it out specifically for him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about what the NDP government has done in the 
province of British Columbia.  Businesses come to the province of 
British Columbia.  By virtue of the fact that they put an 
investment into machinery or equipment or into inventory, the NDP 
provincial government goes ahead and charges them a tax for the 
privilege of actually having that inventory there.  Believe it or 
not, this tax is applied to inventory and assets that the 
business does not necessarily even own.  In other words there may 
be mortgages, there may be liens, there may be any number of 
things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Take the example of an automobile inventory for a car 
dealership.  Believe it or not, that NDP government turns around 
and actually charges a 1% charge on the value of the inventory. 
The inventory has not been sold.  If the inventory is sold, the 
business actually reduces its tax rate by virtue of that amount 
being taken off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is this member's position as he sees it relative to a tax 
on wealth, a tax on assets?  Let me make the specifics of what we 
are talking about crystal clear for him.  Let us say that an 
individual had a home in greater Vancouver.  It is not unusual 
for a home in greater Vancouver to run in the $200,000 to 
$300,000 range.  Another individual may have an equivalent home 
in Winnipeg that is in the $100,000 range.  These are the assets, 
the wealth we are talking about.  Would he and the NDP at the 
federal level see going after taxing wealth in the hands of 
Canadians? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini:</B>  Mr. Speaker, given that the province 
of British Columbia probably has the most robust economy of any 
province in Canada, and given that is a direct result of the NDP 
government in that province, far be it for me to second guess the 
minister of finance for British Columbia and his policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member should know as to taxing property in Vancouver 
versus property in Winnipeg versus property in Sydney—Victoria, 
these are property matters that are left to another authority 
other than those in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I welcome a real question.  I would suggest that the hon. 
members discuss the policies of the minister of finance in 
British Columbia with him.  They might find it in their hearts to 
adopt some of them. 
<P><A NAME="LINK183"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
some days we really get enlightened in this place. Coming from 
British Columbia I find it really difficult to accept the premise 
that British Columbia is doing well at all under the NDP 
government.  I think the member should know that this is very 
likely the last term for those folks for a long, long time to 
come.  It is maybe even the last term for this young group here 
for a long, long time to come.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the NDP is interested in putting more money into 
education, culture, health and other social programs. I would 
like to ask him whether it is the NDP's philosophy and proposal 
that we raise the money for these extras which they are expecting 
by way of additional taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will be pleased to 
answer the hon. clairvoyant member who seems to have a crystal 
ball with which he determines who will and who will not be 
elected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to his question, the NDP has always been concerned 
about education, culture, health care and social programs, the 
things that have always made this country great, the things that 
this government tried to take credit for in a prior comment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding where the money would come from, it would come from a 
fair taxation policy for the hundreds of corporations and wealthy 
individuals who pay no tax to this country for those programs 
now.  It is a simple answer to a simple question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott:</B>  Mr. Speaker, indeed it was a simple 
answer which belies the fact that perhaps he did not understand 
the question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will ask the question again and I am looking for a very 
specific answer.  There have been proposals floated by the NDP 
government and their advisers in British Columbia that they could 
turn around and start to take a percentage applied to the wealth 
that people have in their possession. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We recognize that in Canada there are many people who are barely 
making ends meet.  There are many people who have minimum income 
salaries.  We recognize that, but on the other hand there are 
people who are in what we would call the middle income bracket 
which would be in the range of $35,000 to $60,000 a year. Over 
the lifetime of those people by virtue of property appreciation 
particularly in centres like Toronto and Vancouver, they have 
seen their wealth accumulate by virtue of capital gains on their 
principal residence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not unusual for people who are currently making $50,000 or 
$60,000 a year to have RRSPs in the values of $300,000 to 
$400,000.  They are the backbone of our community in terms of 
being the people who are working for their wages but who have 
accumulated a certain amount of wealth.  We are talking about 
wealth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the member the question again very specifically.  Would he 
see an NDP government going ahead and applying a percentage tax 
on the wealth of Canadians in the same way that the NDP 
provincial government has done in the province of B.C. on the 
capital in the possession of various companies? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini:</B>  Mr. Speaker, there was a great deal of 
preface to the simple question dealing with middle income 
Canadians who earn between $50,000 and $60,000 a year.  I guess 
they are middle income Canadians in the province of Alberta. They 
may be considered wealthy Canadians in other parts of this 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott:</B>  You earn $64,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini:</B>  I do not for one minute indicate that 
I am not in many ways better off than many of the people I 
represent.  I understand that.  These members ought to understand 
that as well. Like the people I represent, I have no problem 
paying a fair share of taxes because of the many benefits that I 
think this country can give me and the people I represent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think the people in these members' ridings who earn 
$50,000 or $60,000 or $70,000 a year mind paying their fair share 
of taxes because they know it derives health benefits and 
transportation for them and education for their children.  I 
think those people would not be opposed to a fair taxation 
system.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
perhaps I am in the wrong debate in this House.  I thought that 
C-10 was going to be discussed.  However I heard a lot of 
comments about CPP and Bill C-2 over the last couple of speakers; 
harmonized sales tax, which I thought was a rather interesting 
comment; RRSPs; and capital tax, which was really quite 
interesting but does not have a lot of bearing on Bill C-10. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I particularly enjoyed the comment about housing prices in the 
city of Winnipeg.  I do not know how it relates to C-10 but I can 
tell the hon. member who brought it up that in fact in Brandon 
our housing prices are 15% higher than those in the city of 
Winnipeg.  They are perhaps not quite to the level of those in 
Vancouver but that is okay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to bring this back to C-10.  The issue quite 
frankly is very relevant to me.  My constituency has a very large 
seniors population as do a number of constituencies throughout 
this country of ours, but my riding in particular through 
demographics has identified a very large seniors population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It never ceases to amaze me that when the government tries to 
fix a wrong it does it for the right reasons but unfortunately 
when the legislation is brought forward the wrong seems to be 
exacerbated in some areas which it has been with Bill C-10. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In an attempt to respond to the protests of CASSE and CARP, 
which is the Canadian Association of Retired Persons, on the 
non-refundable 25.5% U.S. withholding tax imposed on social 
security payments to Canadian residents under the 1995 tax 
protocol which was brought in by the existing government, the 
finance minister announced on April 9, 1997 the signing of a new 
tax protocol with the U.S.  Following ratification this protocol 
will be effective retroactive to January 1, 1996, the 
implementation date of the contentious 1995 protocol. Under the 
new protocol, the taxation power in respect of social security 
payments to Canadians will be returned to Canada while the U.S. 
will again assume power to tax CPP and OAS receipts of their 
residents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Initially the finance minister's announcement brought great joy 
locally as it appeared we were returning to the 50% inclusion 
rate that prevailed prior to January 1, 1996.  Further, the 
finance minister announced that upon ratification of the new 
protocol, refunds would be available to those Canadians whose tax 
in 1996-97 social security payments would be reduced under the 
new protocol.   Apparently the two governments are working 
together in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>CASSE's joy however turned to bitter disappointment when it was 
learned that under the finance minister's new system the income 
inclusion rate for the social security would now be 85%. This 
represents a 70% increase in the rate of taxation of social 
security jumping from a 50% inclusion rate to an 85% inclusion 
rate for everybody but those retirees who are not taxable having 
under $11,000 in income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This new inclusion rate will also be retroactive to January 1, 
1996 for the purposes of determining refunds, although no one 
will be required to pay more tax for 1996 and 1997 than the U.S. 
withheld.  Low income Canadians who have been hit by the 25.5% 
U.S. withholding tax should not have to wait for both the 
ratification of the new protocol and then until the summer of 
1998 for the processing of their return seeking a refund for tax 
withheld in 1996 and 1997. Retired people in this income bracket 
need the money now.  Our government should undertake to do that 
forthwith through the GIS system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister told CASSE that the first change to a 
withholding tax system was revenue neutral.  No numbers however 
have been released as to the revenue earned by the Canadian 
government in the old system or what revenue was realized in 
imposing withholding tax on OAS and CPP to U.S. residents or what 
revenue will be realized under the new system in the 1997 
protocol.  These numbers are necessary for any policy debate in 
this area and we should be pressing the Minister of Finance to 
reveal these numbers immediately.

<A HREF="#LINKT71"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not having the numbers means that we do not know whether the 70% 
increase in tax on social security first effectively occurred 
with the imposition of the withholding tax system in the 1995 
protocol or with the changes announced with the 1997 protocol or 
a combination of both. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, if the finance minister's budget is not based on the 
1997 protocol just signed which affects 1998 and subsequent 
years, our party should be prepared to roll back in taxes 
immediately that portion of the revenue increase caused by the 
1997 protocol. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, after the year fiscal year 2000 when our budget moves 
into a surplus, which I believe very strongly should be this 
fiscal year, we should undertake to return to the old system of 
the 50% inclusion rate which reflects the fact that contributions 
to the U.S. system are made out of after tax dollars and that 
under the finance minister's protocol, cross border workers are 
being doubly taxed on their retirement income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to commend the government for recognizing the 
mistake that was made in 1995.  I would further like to state 
that it is a sight for sore eyes that while it recognizes the 
mistake it made, it actually decided to do something about it. I 
wish I could commend the government further, however a few 
important items seem to be missing from this discussion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Progressive Conservative Party will not support this bill 
with the pittance of information that we seem to have here and 
without a much more significant, in depth discussion to determine 
the real effects of this bill on retired people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister stated previously that this is a revenue 
neutral bill. The minister has further entered into a tax treaty 
increasing the income inclusion from a 50% inclusive rate to an 
85% inclusion rate.  The remove of the withholding tax is a step 
in the right direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The PC Party understands that some income earners, especially 
the lower income earners, may actually see a decrease in their 
level of taxation. This is another step in the right direction. 
The Progressive Conservative Party further notes that some income 
earners will see a huge increase in their levels of taxation.  We 
in this House do not condone that action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unfortunate today that after seeing the government 
recognize and correct the mistake in a positive and progressive 
manner, it must dig further into the pockets and raise tax levels 
like this.  I hope this bill is in fact revenue neutral as the 
finance minister would have us believe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is with dismay that the PC Party must rise against this bill. 
However, I hope that through more in depth discussion and some 
changes we will be able to see a corrected mistake that will 
actually reduce taxation levels rather than raise them.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to address the speech just made by the not so 
Conservatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning their member for West Nova stood before the House 
and talked about how Bill C-10 was something good and that they 
were supporting the technical amendment that the government was 
putting on seniors.  Later this afternoon the member for 
Brandon—Souris stood and said that they are in favour of it. 
Indeed, at the beginning of the day it was supposed to be the 
finance critic for the Conservative Party who was to stand and 
say they were opposed to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we have had one speech in favour of Bill C-10 and one speech 
against it.  Where do they stand on this?  Are Conservatives in 
favour of a tax hike or not? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member was 
obviously not listening to the full body of my presentation. 
There are some good things within the proposed legislation.  I am 
sure even the hon. member would agree with that. Unfortunately 
there are inconsistencies in the bill, particularly the one with 
respect to the inclusion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from West Nova indicated that very thing, that we 
could accept some of the proposed changes, good changes which the 
Liberals have put forward but that we could not accept them based 
on the facts, figures and numbers we have at this time with 
respect to the taxation rates which will be attached to this 
bill.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spoke previously and I rise again as my colleague from West 
Nova did.  We will speak and vote against this legislation until 
we are assured by the government there will not be any additional 
taxes raised on the backs of retired people. 
<P><A NAME="LINK186"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, we on this side of the House are able to express our 
opinions freely in debate and look for the pros and cons of 
legislation.  We do not commit ourselves to restricting what we 
say simply because of the party line.  A healthy debate on all 
sides of the House is a sign of an active Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I address my comment and question to the member who just spoke. 
In my riding office I received a number of elderly constituents 
who are receiving U.S. benefits and they spoke of hardship 
because their benefits were being taxed in the United States.  I 
felt powerless to help them and told them this was a matter of 
U.S. administration and could only be resolved by a treaty 
between Canada and the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A treaty is in the process of occurring.  We have a bill before 
the House.  I accept that some members may feel it has some 
inadequacies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member agree that in addressing the concerns of low 
income seniors receiving benefits from the United States the bill 
is a good thing? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik:</B>   Mr. Speaker, my answer is unequivocally 
yes.  I said in my preamble that it is nice to see a positive 
attempt to change an injustice.  In saying that, the injustice 
was put in place by that very government in 1996 and it is trying 
to correct it now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When you accept the fact that a mistake was made, trying to fix 
that mistake is very positive.  We thank you for that.  The 
unfortunate part is that there are still unknowns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure a number of these issues will be dealt with in 
committee and some fine tuning will be done to the bill at that 
point. I am sure the government would agree that if there are 
some inequities in the legislation they should be changed prior 
to the passage of the bill.  That is democracy and I do 
appreciate that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In saying that, as part of the body of my talk I also suggested 
that the timing for a lot of those very people that you talk 
about is still extended.  Instead of a solution today we are 
looking to the summer of 1998 when a lot of these people who have 
already paid 1996 and 1997 taxation levels will not be able to 
get that refund.  We are suggesting that perhaps the government 
should consider refunding those dollars to the people who need 
them.  They are at the lower level income areas and perhaps we 
should refund those now rather than wait until the summer or fall 
of 1998. 
<P><A NAME="LINK187"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
address my question to the member from the not so Conservatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It turns out that the party has in its later thoughts this 
afternoon decided that they are now opposed to the bill.  I 
congratulate them on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since they are not voting in favour of this tax increase, how is 
the member from Brandon—Souris going to get the money to pay for 
some of the money he was begging from the government in question 
period for his constituency in Manitoba? He was bellyaching about 
not enough money being given to them. How is he going to pay for 
that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member confuses 
a lot of issues.  The question during question period was with 
respect to transfer payments to provinces.  Even though the 
transfer payments have been decreased and the budget is balanced 
we still do not have sufficient funding to go into the health 
care system.  If we wish to talk about health care, I can do 
that.  But this is Bill C-10. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quite frankly, the revenues that are generated by this 
legislation are not sufficient to cover off the $250 million that 
has been a shortfall in Manitoba since 1994 for health care 
services as well as for shortfalls in other jurisdictions. 
Seven out of ten provinces have had shortfalls in their transfer 
payments from the 1994-95 budget period up until today.  There 
are ways of coming up with efficiencies and finding other 
revenues which can be forwarded to the health care system.  It 
does not speak to Bill C-10.  I believe that this legislation 
must stand on its own.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
wonder how much longer the not so Conservatives think they can 
both suck and blow on the issue of taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On one hand, they sometimes say that they are not in favour of a 
tax hike.  On the other hand they want to get the money.  I have 
heard this continually, whether it was a meeting of their leader 
along with other Progressive Conservatives leaders in Atlantic 
Canada talking about how they wanted more money as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we have to come to a firm determination that they are 
either opposed to taxes or they are in favour of taxes.  They 
cannot suck and blow at the same time.  You cannot ask for 
programs but then say you do not like taxes. Where do they stand 
on this? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the Conservative Party 
has always been a conservative party and will always be a 
conservative party.  Certainly it is recognized by a great number 
of people in this country as being a national alternative as 
opposed to a regional party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Conservative Party realizes that there are inefficiencies 
within government. Those inefficiencies could be cut and save 
dollars in certain areas. Perhaps things like fences around 
Stornoway need not be developed.  Those dollars could go into 
areas such as health care and education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-10 speaks to an inordinate amount of taxation to the 
wrong sector of our society.  We will continue to oppose any 
types of tax increases of this nature.  In fact, we have 
suggested quite frequently that tax decreases are the way the 
government should be heading.  We should be giving dollars back 
into the pockets of those people who pay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are in favour of decreases in taxes.  We believe in 
efficiencies.  I am sure there are other parties in the House who 
do not believe in the same efficiencies as is proven by some 
extravagant expenditures in the past.  I am sure that some of 
those dollars could be put into the programs that Canadians 
really want: health care and education. 
<P><A NAME="LINK189"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Etobicoke North, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
very pleased to join the debate of Bill C-10. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill will benefit all Canadians by amending double taxation 
treaties between Canada and a number of countries.  These nations 
are the United States, Sweden, Lithuania, Kazakhstan, Iceland, 
Denmark and the Netherlands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am particularly pleased to see the amendments to the tax 
treaty with the United States.  We often hear, sometimes in a not 
very complimentary way, about the role of backbenchers in the 
government caucus. This agreement responds to the concerns of 
many members of Parliament who were concerned that many of their 
residents were paying double taxation on U.S. social security 
benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many people in Canada live near the border with the United 
States and many of these individuals have lived and worked in the 
United States and then retired in Canada.  Many of them are in my 
riding of Etobicoke North.  Over the last while I have had a 
number of constituents complain that they were being taxed doubly 
on their social security benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of my colleagues and I went to the Minister of Finance. 
We stated, in a very strong way, that this was not fair.  People 
should not be taxed doubly, particularly low income seniors who 
were being jeopardized as a result.  The finance minister 
listened.  It is because of that we have the amendments to the 
taxation agreement with the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This area can be a very dry topic.  I would like, for the 
record, to present what the bill does from the government's side. 
It is important for Canadians who are watching this debate to 
appreciate what the legislation does and what it does not do. 
Paying taxes twice on the same income or gain is not very fair. 
That is why these initiatives will avoid double taxation. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1715"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The treaties essentially reduce the rates of withholding taxes 
applicable to dividends, interest and royalties, and eliminate 
double taxation by allocating taxation rights between the country 
in which a taxpayer is resident and the source country of the 
income or gain.  For example, where income or gains remain 
taxable in both states a convention would normally provide that 
the state of residence will give credit for the tax paid in the 
other country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other ways to eliminate double taxation would consist of 
ensuring that the income or gain is taxed only in the source 
country or the country of residence.  This serves to promote 
trade and investment which, in the absence of a treaty, could be 
discouraged by the possibility that returns would be taxed twice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well the conventions generally include provisions for the 
exchange of information between revenue authorities to prevent 
tax avoidance or tax evasion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada now has double taxation conventions in force with 61 
countries.  While the provisions of each treaty necessarily vary 
from one country to another, their common denominator is that 
they benefit Canadian taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada-United States double taxation agreement is a case in 
point.  This is the fourth protocol to the convention between 
Canada and the U.S. with respect to taxes on income and on 
capital, commonly known as the Canada-U.S. tax treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the approval of parliament and the ratification of the 
United States senate the protocol to the convention will deliver 
significant tax relief to thousands of lower income Canadians who 
receive U.S. social security benefits which are subject to U.S. 
tax rates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most Canadians and many Americans reside within 80 miles of the 
49th parallel.  Many have worked in one country and as I said 
retired in the other.  Consequently both Canada and the United 
States pay social security benefits to large numbers of people in 
the other country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To avoid double taxation the Canada-United States tax treaty 
sets out which country can tax these benefits.  Currently the 
country that pays the benefit can tax all of it while a country 
where the recipient lives can tax none of it.  This results in 
hardship for many lower income Canadians who receive U.S. social 
security benefits because the United States taxes outbound social 
security benefits at a flat withholding rate of 25.5%.  This is 
what constituents came to me and spoke about, this withholding 
tax of 25.5% which was very high and very unjust. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Conversely outbound Canada and Quebec pension plans and old age 
security benefits are taxed at a rate of 25%.  While the old age 
security recovery rate applies, any non-resident pensioner can 
file a Canadian tax return at ordinary Canadian tax.  As a result 
many low income U.S. recipients pay little or no Canadian tax on 
their Canadian benefits.  I would add that other than U.S. 
citizens and resident aliens the U.S. does not allow non-resident 
pensioners to file tax returns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The protocol proposes that the country of residence have the 
exclusive right to tax social security benefits.  That means 
several thousand low income Canadians will no longer pay any 
income tax at all.  Thousands more will pay less tax than they do 
now, particularly in light of special rules exempting from tax 
15% of U.S. benefits paid to residents of Canada.  For U.S. 
recipients of Canadian benefits, Canadian benefits that are 
exempt from tax in Canada will also be exempt in the United 
States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prior to 1996 the country that paid a benefit to a resident of 
the other country could not tax the benefits at all.  The country 
where the recipient lived could include only one-half the benefit 
in the recipient's taxable income.  That meant that one-half of 
the benefits were tax free.  It also meant that those rules did 
not stand the test of tax equity with neighbours receiving 
similar levels of benefits but paying vastly different levels of 
taxes on those benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under this agreement with the United States the new rule would 
apply as of January 1, 1996, the date the current rule came into 
effect.  Excess tax collected since then would be refunded to 
social security recipients in both countries.  However there will 
be no retroactive tax increases for that period.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government will limit applicable 1996 and 1997 taxes for 
Canadian residents to ensure that they do not exceed the tax the 
U.S. collected.  For 1998 and beyond the Canadian tax that 
recipients pay will reflect their total incomes.  After 
ratification both nations will work together to ensure that 
refunds can be paid out as quickly and efficiently as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A second proposed amendment to the Canada-U.S. tax treaty 
pertains to the taxation of capital gains.  In 1995 Canada 
proposed to amend the Income Tax Act to tax the gains of 
non-residents on shares of non-resident corporations and interest 
in non-resident trusts where most of the value of the shares or 
interest is attributable to Canadian real estate or resource 
property.  Although it has not yet done so, the United States 
could under current tax treaty rules impose a comparable tax on 
residents of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a classic quid pro quo the protocol will apply the proposed 
tax change to United States residents in exchange for United 
States agreement that its real property interest laws will not 
for residents of Canada include shares of corporations that are 
not resident in the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This change which will apply as of April 26, 1995 means that 
Canadians who invest in U.S. real estate through Canadian 
companies will continue to pay Canadian tax rather than any 
possible future U.S. tax when they sell their shares.  U.S. 
investors and U.S. companies that hold property in Canada will 
still pay U.S. tax when they sell their shares rather than 
Canadian tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Turning to the Canada-Sweden tax treaty, in the bill we propose 
a small number of amendments to the double taxation and the 
convention that has existed between Canada and that country since 
1984.  However while the number of amendments is small the 
benefits are very real.  Taxpayers will pay less taxes as a 
result of reduced tax rates, which will also result in increased 
trade and investment between our two countries.  The revised 
convention will enter into force when both Canada and Sweden have 
approved the amendments and exchanged instruments of 
ratification.  The provisions would then apply on the first day 
of January subsequent to the exchange. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to Lithuania, Bill C-10 seeks parliament's approval 
to enter into a tax treaty with that country.  As there is 
currently no double taxation convention in force between Canada 
and Lithuania, there are a number of double taxation problems for 
which the proposed convention provides needed and equitable 
solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed convention does not reinvent the wheel.  Rather it 
generally follows the language and the pattern of other tax 
treaties Canada has concluded.  It also largely reflects the 
format and language of the model convention prepared by the OECD. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of more interest than structure are results.  In that regard the 
provisions of the convention will produce results, reduced tax 
rates leading to increased trade and investment that will mirror 
those of other concluded conventions and will help to promote 
economic development in both nations, in particular in Lithuania. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Concerning Kazakhstan, tax relations between Canada and that 
nation had been governed by the 1986 tax treaty between Canada 
and the U.S.S.R.  However, as of January 1, 1996 Kazakhstan 
ceased to apply that treaty.  Accordingly Bill C-10 seeks 
parliamentary approval to enter into a tax treaty with 
Kazakhstan.  Again the proposed treaty generally follows the 
language and pattern of tax treaties already concluded by Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Trade and investment between Canada and Kazakhstan are expected 
to increase upon the conclusion of the convention which will 
enter into force on the date of the exchange of the instruments 
of ratification.  Its provisions will apply on or after the first 
day of January 1996. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed double taxation convention between Canada and 
Iceland is also a new tax treaty but contains somewhat similar 
provisions to those I have addressed.  For example, it provides 
for a reduced withholding tax of 5% applicable to dividends paid 
to a company that controls at least 10% of the voting power in 
the company paying the dividends and a rate of 15% in all other 
cases.  The rate of the branch tax will also be reduced to 5%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Entry into force will entail each country first notifying the 
other that the procedure required to bring the convention into 
force, the attainment of royal assent in Canada, has been 
completed.  The convention will then enter into force 30 days 
after the date of the latter of these notifications.  The 
provisions will apply on or after the first day of January 
subsequent to the entry into force.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The penultimate country included in the legislation is Denmark. 
A double taxation convention is currently in force between Canada 
and Denmark.  First signed in 1955 and amended in 1964, it is now 
appropriate the convention referred to as the 1955 convention be 
amended further to increase trade and investment opportunities 
between Canada and Denmark.  To those ends the current 
withholding tax rate of 15% on dividends, interest and royalties 
will be reduced to 5% on direct dividends and to 10% on interest 
and on royalties.  The rate of the branch tax will also be 
reduced from the existing 15% to 5%.  The revised convention also 
provides for a number of exemptions at source, which I will not 
go into today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to pensions, currently all pensions are taxable 
only in the country of residence of the recipient.  The revised 
convention provides for the opposite.  Specifically all pensions 
including social security pensions will be taxable only in the 
source country.  Moreover, the two year exemption provided under 
the existing convention for visiting teachers will be eliminated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1955 convention also does not contain any rules for the 
taxation of capital gains.  As a result they are taxable in 
accordance with each country's respective legislation. 
Accordingly and in line with rules found in other tax treaties 
concluded by Canada, the revised convention includes rules for 
the taxation of capital gains. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to Canada and the Netherlands, which is the last 
country but certainly not the least that I will be speaking on 
today, the legislation proposes amendments to the existing 
convention between Canada and the Netherlands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1993 budget announced Canada's willingness to eliminate on a 
bilateral basis its withholding tax on royalties on computer 
software and patent and information concerning industrial, 
commercial or scientific experience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consistent with that statement, the protocol provides that the 
rate of 10% withholding tax on such royalties in the country of 
source will be eliminated or remain at zero in the case of 
computer software, which was already covered in the protocol 
signed in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The protocol also introduces a new article in the convention 
providing for mutual assistance in the collection of taxes in 
each country.  Patterned on the corresponding article found in 
the Canada-United States tax treaty, it differs only in that it 
applies regardless of the nationality of the person concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other modifications to the convention as well.  This 
protocol will enter into force 30 days after the date on which 
the governments notify each other that ratification has been 
completed.  Its provisions will then apply in Canada from the 
date of entry into force of the protocol. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have spoken for some time I will keep my concluding remarks 
brief.  I appreciate that for some the matter of international 
tax treaties may seem arcane, complex and dry.  However, that 
being said, they are extremely important and they have real and 
direct financial impacts on Canadian taxpayers.  I know the 
legislation will positively affect the taxpayers of my riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly my address articulated that in the instance of Bill C-10 
its impact on Canadian taxpayers will be overwhelmingly 
beneficial.  As such, I very much urge members of the House to 
accord speedy passage of the legislation so that those benefits 
may be realized sooner rather than later.

I will surprise the hon. member for Etobicoke North by telling 
him that I agree with him in the area of people coming into our 
constituency offices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recall very vividly a couple of years ago very low income 
people coming into our offices, many of whom for whatever reason 
were deriving a major portion of their income, meagre as it was, 
from the United States.  All of a sudden, unannounced, out of the 
clear blue sky, their income was decreased in some instances by a 
few dollars and in other instances by $100.  When a person is in 
as low income bracket as many of these people were, $100 is an 
awful lot of money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also agree with him that amendments to the regulations in 1996 
created a situation where the taxes relative to the income were 
very high and very unjust.  I ask the member if this is not an 
indictment of the finance minister.  Is this not an indictment of 
his government?

and made something happen here.  Indeed the finance and revenue 
departments will have letters on file not only from my office but 
from members from all over this House about this issue.  The 
movement under the finance minister was a bad move. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the member not really saying with his speech that yes they 
were very high and they were very unjust and the people were 
being treated unfairly, but the Liberal government of the 35th 
Parliament that brought this in did a very bone-headed move and 
actually created a serious problem for many low income seniors in 
our country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for two 
out of three of his comments and for his remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance is like any other individual or 
government and from time to time it takes some courage for a 
person to say that maybe we need to move in a slightly different 
direction.  Rather than being an indictment of the Minister of 
Finance, I think this is a clear statement that our Minister of 
Finance in fairness listens not only to members of his caucus but 
to members opposite.  I am sure he received a number of 
representations from members opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of some work within our own caucus and other 
representations, the minister has made some adjustments.  As the 
member noted, they will be very beneficial to the vast majority 
of Canadians who are in this position, particularly low income 
Canadians. I see it as a very positive step where we can move 
forward.  I applaud the Minister of Finance for having the 
courage to move in this direction. 
<P><A NAME="LINK191"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
would like the Liberal member opposite to turn his frame of mind 
if he would to those people who are being affected by this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine that in a sense he had retired based on the 50% rate of 
inclusion, that he had planned his retirement based on that 
understanding and then all of a sudden, watch out, here comes the 
Liberal government with a tax hike that is going to move that up 
to 85%, a 70% increase.  Would he feel somewhat similar to all 
those taxpayers who were surprised by the breaking of the GST 
election promise?  Would he feel wronged in the same way as the 
people who felt wronged about the GST and in the same way that 
retired people who are receiving social security from the United 
States feel wronged about it jumping to 85% from 50%? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member opposite 
for the question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 50% inclusion rate is an issue that has been raised a number 
of times in this House.  What we need to look at in tax policy 
are movements that result in the greatest tax equity.  We cannot 
have everybody coming out in a net-net-plus position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The difficulty with this change is that if we had not made these 
changes in concert with the changes in the tax treaty, some 
people would have received a huge windfall gain.  That would not 
have been equitable to those Canadians who are not subject to the 
same rules who are receiving Canada pension funds.  We would have 
created an uneven playing field so we had to make the adjustment 
at the same time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to say that this tax treaty and the moves that are 
made within it will benefit the vast majority of Canadians. In 
particular, low income seniors will benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I agree with the member's comment that we need to provide 
some kind of stability in terms of tax planning, unfortunately 
the world is not perfect and we have to deal with the world as it 
is.  The minister has made some very positive changes here that 
we should all be thankful for.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it will be recalled that,  some 20 months ago, our 
colleague François Langlois, the Bloc Quebecois member for 
Bellechasse at the time, raised the problem of pensioners in 
receipt of pensions from the United States who were being taxed 
disproportionately by the Americans.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people were therefore seeing their 
meager pension incomes being made even more meager.  Mr. 
Langlois made vigorous representations in this House at the time 
to have the situation remedied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to see our 
colleague from across the way explain to us if, indeed, this 
legislation before us now will ensure these people, particularly 
those living just on our side of the U.S. border—so we are 
speaking of  the southern portions of Bellechasse, of Beauce and 
of the Eastern Townships—of pensions that will be taxed 
reasonably rather than unreasonably. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I await the answer of our 
colleague across the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen:</B> Mr. Speaker, I must thank my Bloc Quebecois 
colleague for his comment. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This tax treaty and the amendments to the tax treaty really deal 
very specifically with the concern many members in this House 
have had, including members from parties opposite. It will allow 
Canadians a withholding tax of 25.5% on their social security 
benefits because they had lived and worked in the United States 
but who are now retired in Canada. Perhaps they are from the 
member's riding of Bellechasse or from places close to the U.S. 
border in the province of Quebec.  I am sure people there are 
affected as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This will be extremely beneficial.  I would not want to leave 
the impression that other members opposite did not have similar 
concerns.  It is one advantage in being the government of the 
day.  If people elect members who are part of the government, 
they have a chance to speak very directly to members of our own 
caucus. In that sense, I suppose all members had a role to play 
but I think the Minister of Finance is to be commended on a very 
progressive move. 
<P><A NAME="LINK193"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
is the member saying that we should be thankful that the finance 
minister having seen the error of his ways has decided to make a 
revision?  Bearing in mind that the very low income people we are 
talking about did not know this was going to be happening, are we 
supposed to be thankful? Or should we not be critical of the 
finance minister by virtue of the fact that he is doing the 
legislation retroactively?  Why in 1997 when the 35th Parliament 
was sitting, did the finance minister not come forward and give 
these people a little relief? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen:</B>  Mr. Speaker, having been elected in 1996 
I was only a member of the last Parliament for a very short 
period but I certainly would not use that as a cop-out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see it the opposite way.  Perhaps this is what differentiates 
Reform members from Liberal members.  I see the glass as half 
full not half empty.  I see some courage in members of our caucus 
saying that we have to make changes so that we can move forward 
to the benefit of all Canadians. 
<P><A NAME="LINK194"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, once 
again we continue on the saga of Bill C-10, the Liberal tax hike 
on those people who receive social security benefits from the 
United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to read portions of a letter from Olive E. Smith, 
one of those seniors who will be particularly hard done by in 
terms of the changes with Bill C-10 and all the others who are 
involved with Canadians asking for social security equality. She 
says that because of the raise in inclusion the Liberals are 
hoisting upon her, it will result in a whopping 70% increase from 
what she was paying previously.  She begs me here. She says 
“Stand up to this Liberal tax grab and persuade the finance 
minister that this is neither fair nor moral”.  On her behalf 
and on behalf of others who are involved with Canadians asking 
for social security equality, I am going to do that.

<A HREF="#LINKT79"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, these are people who cannot go back to work.  They cannot 
make up this shortfall any other way. These are people who 
planned for their retirement at a 50% rate of inclusion and the 
government wants to jack it up to 85% so it can get its precious 
tax dollars to spend on its precious programs and it is doing it 
on the backs of these people.  The government should be ashamed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to talk about how many people this affects. 
Eight five thousand Canadian residents receive U.S. social 
security.  It actually affects about 100,000 people when we take 
into account those across the border and all the intricacies of 
the plan. This affects a lot of people.  It is not even a 
question of numbers.  If it affected 10,000 people or a million 
people, the thing is that it is just plain wrong to go ahead and 
hike the taxes of these people who can little afford it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine losing 25.5% of your total income when you have already 
barely been surviving and have been forced to move if you are 
old, sick or handicapped.  These Liberals gloat about how they 
have been able to cut down the deficit but they have done it with 
36 tax increases.  Bill C-2, the CPP tax hike which will bring in 
$10 billion, was their 37th tax increase.  This is their 38th tax 
increase and it is being done on the backs of seniors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are they going to do about those people who will choose to 
leave this country rather than live under conditions like that? 
What about the job spin-off as a result?  They do not express any 
concern about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to look at their initial reaction when this 
whole issue first reared its ugly head, when they passed a bad 
law.  And now they are coming before the House to try and rectify 
it.  Indeed it is not a rectification.  Two wrongs do not make a 
right.  If there is a screw up in the first place and the 
Liberals then come back to the House to beg for a tax increase, 
they are not improving the situation at all. That is exactly what 
the Liberals across the way are doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals' first reaction when seniors told them how this 
would impact on them was they said that the seniors did not 
understand the changes.  This from local MPs in the ridings 
particularly affected, those surrounding Windsor.  They said they 
did not understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second knee-jerk reaction on behalf of the Liberals was to 
blame the Americans.  The third was to blame the previous 
government and say that it was Brian Mulroney and the 
Conservatives who had done them harm.  Fourth, we hear today that 
they are blaming the seniors and how these people are getting 
some sort of unequal treatment and they have to be taxed the same 
as everyone else and pay more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the way it went. First the Liberals did not know what 
they had done.  Then they blamed the Americans.  Then they blamed 
the previous government. And now they are blaming the seniors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to quote the Minister of Finance.  In his 
letter he says, “I can understand that some recipients are not 
in favour of the new arrangement since it means that after 1997 
they may have to pay more tax than they have in the past.  I 
believe that it will ensure that the tax system treats everyone 
fairly.”  He admits that it is a tax increase and then he has 
the gall to go on and say that it is fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By that logic the Liberals would say that the people who are 
paying 17% or 22% federal income tax should all be paying the top 
progressive rate of 29% because that is fair, there cannot be 
different rates of taxation. That is Liberal fairness, Liberal 
tax equity.  That is a joke but unfortunately the seniors who are 
being hurt the most by this are not the ones who are laughing. It 
is the Liberal MPs across the way who are collecting their gold 
plated pensions.  It is a back door tax grab. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals talked about how in 1995 they had to make changes 
and now in 1997 because they did not think it through very well 
the first time, they are coming back begging the indulgence of 
the House to give this an easy passage the second time around. I 
reiterate, two wrongs do not make a right.  If they messed it up 
the first time and have the gall to come back the second time to 
the House and say they have something better but they are 
sneaking in a tax hike through the back door, that does not make 
it right.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about those who fall through the cracks?  What about those 
people?  The Liberals talk about refunds because they recognize 
they have really gouged these people heavily.  What about those 
people who have died?  What about those people who have moved? 
As a result of those two incidents, either death or moving, those 
people will fall through the cracks and those rebates that are 
owed them, their families and their estates will not be paid. The 
government will keep that.  We can bet our bottom dollar on that 
and the finance minister will gloat in this House over the 
results on something like that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the government first brought through its changes it 
resulted in roughly $2,000 in increases and now this time around 
it is probably average out around $1,000 in increases and it 
calls that revenue neutral. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Local MPs in Windsor refer to this whole plan as revenue 
neutral.  How does $2,000 out of your pocket and then another 
$1,000 out of your pocket for a total of $3,000 out of your 
pocket make it revenue neutral?  That is a joke. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to reiterate that this is the 38th tax increase that this 
government has brought forward since it took power in 1993.  It 
is not the first time it has attacked pensions. It has done it on 
numerous occasions before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has attacked people in terms of their withdrawal 
time from RRSPs, moving it down to the age of 69.  It is going to 
bring in at the top in any given year $45 million just off that. 
That is another one of its attacks on pensions and seniors in 
this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then when it reduced the $8,000 RRSP overcontribution for those 
who were hoping to collect and use their RRSPs to bolster their 
retirement income, that was another $10 million tax on pensions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we add all these things up, with Bill C-2 to increase the 
Canada pension plan contributions to nearly 10%, and with what 
the Liberals are doing now to try to sneak this through in Bill 
C-10, they do not like old people, they do not like young people 
and I do not know who they like.  They like the Minister of 
Finance but not much else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to go through a few questions that I think the 
Liberals should have asked when they were putting this bill 
forward and when they were considering it.  First, who wants it? 
Do the seniors who are having a tax increase off this want to see 
this bill come forward?  No.  It is the finance minister who does 
but certainly not the seniors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How much is it going to cost?  That is another question that we 
have to level at the Liberals today.  If it affects only 10,000 
people with $1,000 each, that is at the bare minimum $10 million. 
If it affects 85,000 people at $2,000 each, that is $170 
million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again we have had no production here in the House today in 
terms of how much money this is going to cost, but nickels and 
dimes, millions and billions and when we add it up, pretty soon 
it is real money and it is on the backs of the seniors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does it solve the problem?  The problem was that the Liberals 
put through a bad bill in 1995. Once again they are putting 
through a bad bill as a tax hike. They complained about double 
taxation.  Instead they have replaced it with higher taxation. 
Does that in any way solve that problem, the problem being 
seniors who are having a tough time meeting ends meet and who are 
having a tax foisted on them when they are prepared for only a 
50% rate of inclusion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would it pass a referendum?  Would it pass popular consent? 
Would it carry the consent or the will of the people?  Would it 
pass the judgment of fellow citizens?  Does it have democratic 
consent?  If the Liberals put this to a referendum of seniors who 
are affected by it, it would lose overwhelmingly.  Indeed most 
Canadians would not vote for a tax increase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals have often talked today about how taxes are 
investments.  How wrong can they be?  Taxes are not investments. 
Whether it is a tax to hoist up $10 billion out of the Canada 
pension plan or whether it is a tax that brings in tens if not 
hundreds of millions of dollars in terms of those seniors who are 
collecting social security benefits from the United States, taxes 
are not investments. 
The gall of this government to do all these things in the name of 
tax fairness; there is no fairness in a tax hike or a tax 
increase.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It might be more principled for the government to lower some 
other seniors taxes.  It would be principled if it came out and 
talked about the tax decreases that it promised in the election. 
Is it going to renege on that in the same way it reneged on its 
promise to scrap, kill and abolish the GST?  Who can trust the 
Liberals?  The seniors can't.  The young people can't.  We cannot 
buy their election promises because they break them right, left 
and centre. 
<P><A NAME="LINK195"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I have a very tough question for my colleague.  Before I pose it 
I wonder if we are not really talking about some kind of sense of 
security for Canadians.  The movement of this bill is as quickly 
through the House as the Liberals can do it.  We are not about to 
let that happen because we want Canadians to see the duplicity of 
this government and the way it tries to sneak these things 
through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are doing this because we are concerned that Canadians at all 
income levels should have the ability to be able to plan for 
their futures.  I will touch back on this bill in a second but I 
cite by way of example the way the government went about 
changing the time rules.  It rolled age 71 back to age 69 
under the RRSPs, thereby effecting a $40 million or $50 million 
tax grab from unsuspecting seniors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Typically, not always, seniors who would have RRSPs might be in 
the middle to the upper end income bracket.  Those people are now 
faced with the situation of having to make major changes to the 
way their incomes as retirees will be coming to them. They have 
had to do a complete revision.  The net result of this supposedly 
no tax government is the fact that the government will 
incidentally end up with another $30 million to $50 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are the middle income people.  The concern I have in this 
instance is with the people at the bottom end.  Those are the 
people who were approaching me in my office.  I believe the 
member for Etobicoke North also admitted that these were the 
people who were approaching him.  They are the people at the 
bottom end of the scale who suddenly had the rug yanked out from 
under them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The very tricky question I have for my colleague is does he have 
any idea at all why in the world the finance minister, having 
realized that he had completely goofed and made a major mistake, 
would not have immediately changed this legislation?  Why now 
after virtually two years is he finally getting around to doing 
this, restoring a small semblance of order to the lives of these 
very low income people?  Why in the world would he have waited so 
long? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders:</B>  Mr. Speaker, sitting on this side of the 
House it is often difficult to get into a Liberal's mind and 
understand why they do what they do.  One thing I do know about 
Liberals is that they are very shortsighted.  They see only as 
far as the next election.  It is funny to note that Bill C-2 to 
raise the CPP tax and Bill C-10 to take money off the backs and 
to break the backs of seniors receiving social security benefits 
from the United States both happened right after the election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It makes me think.  Other governments in the past have had a 
certain practice of bringing through their most draconian tax 
increasing legislation right after an election in the hopes that 
taxpayers will forget the wrongs done them.  But it will not 
happen because these things have long tails, very long coattails 
indeed.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am duly impressed with the member's foresight, with his all 
encompassing knowledge and with his understanding of the 
situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His party was in the House during 1995 when the original 
legislation was passed.  With such foresight, with such vision, 
with such crystal ball gazing, where was the hon. member when the 
original legislation was put through the House? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders:</B>  Mr. Speaker, when there is bad 
legislation a party should oppose it.  Unfortunately in this case 
we did not see all the flaws in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a direct relationship with what is happening today. The 
government approached the opposition parties and said “It is a 
minor technical amendment.  Other people want it.  The seniors 
want it.  The Americans want it.  Everybody wants it.  Trust 
us”.  We made the mistake of trusting the Liberal government. 
However, I am not going to make it again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why today the Reform Party stands opposed to this bill. 
No, we are not going to go along with kid gloves with the Liberal 
government with respect to a tax increase on the backs of 
seniors, unlike the Tories who just this morning were fawning 
over what a great bill this was, over how it had so many 
arrangements with other governments and how it ended tax 
duplication so that the Liberals could raise taxes.  Liberal, 
Tory, same old story. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are opposed to it.  They were a little confused about it this 
morning, we are not. 
<P><A NAME="LINK197"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan—Shuswap, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I was in here a little earlier and I heard a government 
member say that the government has never raised personal taxes. I 
know the government has raised taxes 38 times, including this 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I go to a gas station and I pay extra tax on gas, I find it 
very personal.  I do not know about government members.  I guess 
they do not.  Government members, and we can all read it in 
<I>Hansard</I>, have stood in the House and said that the 
government has never increased personal taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member mentioned taking away the $100,000 capital gains 
tax exemption.  I think that $100,000 capital gains tax exemption 
was put in place for average workers.  It gives them the hope of 
saving something.  The government said no, it is for the rich.  I 
guess maybe Liberals do not understand that the rich with 
$100,000 buy cars for their sons and daughters.  The incentive 
for the average worker to hope to save $100,000 so the government 
cannot get its claws on it was taken away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look at all tax as legalized theft.  If the mafia had this 
government as an example— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  With respect, the 
Chair does give a certain amount of leeway, but not that much. I 
would ask you to withdraw that comment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson:</B>  Yes, Mr. Speaker.  I withdraw it. You 
are quite correct.  They could not have learned anything from 
this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member see this as a tax grab or as a benefit to 
society? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the Liberals have touched on 
this and I am going to touch on it again, and I thank the hon. 
member for touching on it one more time, the idea of whether 
something is an investment or a tax hike.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When the government raises gasoline taxes I do not consider that 
an investment, in respect to the hon. member. When it cuts back 
the age at which somebody can contribute to an RRSP before it 
converts over to a registered retirement income fund from 71 to 
69, that is not an investment either.  When it cuts back the 
over-contribution rate of $8,000 or the amount one can 
over-contribute, that is not an investment either.  When it taxes 
the worldwide pension income of people, which has now been three 
times, aside from C-2 and C-10, that is not an investment either. 
No, I do not think any of these things are investments.  They are 
tax hikes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question comes up:  What does the government use it for? 
Where is all the money going from these tax hikes?  I look across 
the way and I see a whole field of members who have taken the MP 
pension plan and do not allow others to opt out.  I look around 
on this side of the bench and I see people who stood on principle 
and have given up the trough.  The government has people over 
there who will be collecting millions of dollars in MP pensions.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
one of the most interesting things that goes on in this House is 
the kind of games we end up playing.  We do not really have any 
idea why, on the question of Bill C-2, that the government 
insisted the issue come to a vote immediately and we end up with 
it going to committee and being hidden. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we have this situation.  The government, with all of its 
wonderful leadership by people like the House leader and the 
parliamentary whip, ends up with this kind of parliamentary 
manoeuvre so that it can slip this through just as quickly as it 
possibly can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have, within Canada, an understanding that democracy stands 
like a three-legged stool. It stands on the principle of people, 
politicians and the press. The difficulty comes when we have a 
bill like this, or a bill like Bill C-2, and the government turns 
around and moves things through the House at light speed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The press does not have an opportunity to come up to speed or 
perhaps is deficient in not being able to come up to speed. If 
the press does not do its job or if the government gets away with 
moving these things through the House of Commons at light speed 
as they are prone to do, we end up with a failure in democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The failure in democracy comes when people do not realize what 
the government is attempting to slip past them. When this happens 
we drive the cynicism toward the entire political process. 
Cynicism ends up building apathy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem in Canada right now is that people have lost faith 
in the parliamentary process. 
People have lost faith in politicians because of the games that 
politicians and the parliamentary process play with them.  Many 
Canadians approach me and say “We have no idea what is going on, 
nor do we understand what is going on, nor do we believe that we 
can actually impact any kind of a change”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last time I looked the democratic process actually was under 
attack, a very subtle attack.  I would never accuse the Liberals 
of deliberately trying to undermine democracy.  But with this 
kind of action of making things move through the House at the 
speed of light so there is no way the political process can come 
under the scrutiny of the press, Canadians end up not believing 
in the process any more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we see going on at the start of the 36th Parliament is the 
pizza parliament the pundits were talking about.  The government 
is creating the kind of conflict that will lead to a pizza 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is not with this side of the House.  The problem is 
with a government that is trying to jam things through the House 
in such a way that this side of the House is going to have to 
react.  We will react. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have already seen it when the government rammed through Bill 
C-2 to hide the changes to the Canada pension plan out of sight 
of everyone.  By doing that it is hoping that Canadians will not 
realize that they are going to be ripped off an additional $700 a 
year.  The government is doing it in a very sneaky way.  It is 
doing it at a rate of only 1% a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have to realize that if they are only going to be 
taxed at 1% a year, the government is treating Canadian taxpayers 
like live frogs. How do you cook a live frog?  You put it into a 
cold pot of water and slowly increase the heat and pretty soon 
you end up with a cooked frog. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the government increasing the CPP rip-off, this massive tax 
increase, at 1% per annum starting in January 1998, Canadians are 
going to be poorer at the end of ten years by about $100 billion. 
This is the kind of action that is going on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition is attempting to slow things down enough 
so that Canadians will be aware that the government is trying to 
ram things through the House of Commons.  I think it is 
scandalous that the government is using all these parliamentary 
procedures in order to put grease under the skids of legislation. 
I object in the strongest terms to the action that the 
government is taking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are debating at this time the issue of the government pulling 
parliamentary procedures out of a hat so that it can get 
legislation through the House quickly and Canadians do not 
realize what is actually happening.  I do not blame the people of 
Canada.  I believe they respect the fact that we have a democracy 
here.  I blame the Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government is treating the House as a rubber stamp 
and that simply cannot be.  We must be prepared to stand up and 
be counted against it trying to create a rubber stamp process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the role of the official opposition, of all the opposition 
parties, to ensure that the people of Canada understand what the 
government can do.  We understand governments have the 
opportunity to enact legislation as they see fit in a majority 
government. With the lack of backing we have had from the Bloc 
Quebecois to date it is going to be a very difficult job for the 
rest of the members in the House to hold the government 
accountable. 
If the Bloc Quebecois continues to act in the way that it is, it 
will be darn near impossible to hold back the juggernaut of the 
Liberals.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Why were Bloc members here?  They were here at the behest of the 
Liberal government.  Why did they have the role of vice-chair in 
all the committees?  Why were they put into an exalted position

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott:</B>  Mr. Speaker, on a point of clarification 
for myself, I believe we are debating the motion moved by the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  We are debating Bill 
C-10.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon. member is 
quite correct.  A motion was put.  The motion was carried and we 
resumed debate on Bill C-10. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott:</B>  Mr. Speaker, in taking a look at Bill 
C-10, as I mentioned in my previous interventions, the problem 
was that the action the government took was exceptionally 
unfortunate action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I speak on behalf of the people who came into my office, people 
who are in a very low income situation.  All of a sudden out of 
the clear blue sky there were changes created to the way in which 
taxes were extracted by the U.S. before they came into Canada. 
Because the protocol was negotiated a difficulty was created for 
low income people, and I speak for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I discussed in debate with the member for Etobicoke North, 
the difficulty I have is that the government would like to see 
itself as being saved harmless in this debate.  In other words, 
like it was not the current finance minister, like it was not the 
current prime minister, like it was not even the former revenue 
minister who now sits as the fisheries minister, like it was not 
these people of the government in the 35th and 36th parliaments 
who actually brought in the legislation.  It was this government 
that goofed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe it is nice to be able to say it is great they have been 
able to own up to it.  They have said  “Let us make some 
changes”.  That is like hitting your head against a brick wall 
and stopping because it feels good.  It just does not make any 
sense that Liberal backbenchers would stand to say they have made 
a wonderful change.  What they are really saying and what the 
people of Canada have to know they are saying is that they agree 
with us that the finance minister, the prime minister and the 
revenue minister did not know what they were doing then and I 
submit do not know what they are doing now.

Liberals were applauding the Bloc member.  I go back to what I 
was saying previously about the three legged stool.  If one of 
the legs is shortened, the stool will fall over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about people, politicians and press.  Bloc 
Quebecois members are probably siding with the politicians on the 
other side of the floor.  That is fine.  They have been 
bedfellows before.  I am sure they will be bedfellows again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The difficulty is that the government is trying to ram through 
legislation at lightening speed so that the three legged stool 
falls over and the politician ends up with the ability to get 
away with murder in this case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Far be it from me to tell an intelligent member like the one 
from the Bloc how to conduct himself, but the reality is that if 
the debate had finished today and had not gone into committee, 
which it is now destined to do as a result of the lack of Bloc 
support, there would have been at least one more day of debate 
and hopefully Canadians would have been given the opportunity to

in the Reform Party that, during the 35th Parliament, the Bloc

to their attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It may well be that the judgment of the people of Canada might 
side with that of the Bloc and that of the government.  That is 
entirely possible.  However the light speed in which the 
government is attempting to jam this complicated piece of 
legislation through the House of Commons, in particular with 
respect to trying to save the embarrassment of the finance 
minister, the revenue minister and the prime minister, is the 
issue.  As an issue of parliamentary procedure we have to give 
the people of Canada an opportunity to know what the Liberals are 
attempting to pull off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case the Liberals are attempting to correct a wrong that 
their government, the same finance minister, created in the first 
place.  Now they are trying to clean it up as quickly as

include the bill being debated so that members can feel quite 
comfortable in debating the motion that the question be put. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Chair would also like to correct the record.  The motion was 
moved by the hon. member for St. Catharines and seconded by the 
hon. member for Victoria—Haliburton.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I wish to take but a few moments 
to debate this important piece of legislation.  The legislation 
is before the House today after wide consultation with Canadians, 
which led to the excellent proposal of the Minister of Finance to 
proceed with the tax convention between Canada and the United 
States of America. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us remember what we are doing.  We are presenting a bill to 
the House today to provide tax relief.  It has the approval of 
the vast majority of members of the House in most of the 
political parties represented here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me say it again because it is a word that seems to enthral a 
number of members across the way.  It will provide tax relief to 
lower income Canadians who worked in the United States and 
retired in Canada.  Those lower income Canadians were taxed at 
source in the United States and could not get their money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are in favour, as is the majority of members of the House, of 
proceeding with the legislation.

<A HREF="#LINKT89"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The measure now before the House is that we continue to debate 
this issue. Only four parties out of five are in favour of it.  I 
know that, as do most Canadians.  But the Reform Party knows 
better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Coming back to the point, we are so in favour of this 
legislation as are most members that most parties in the House 
have agreed to stay to debate it tonight in order to have it pass 
second reading.  Most parties in the House were even in favour of 
debating this issue at all stages, including report stage, in 
order to have passage quickly to provide tax relief to Canadians 
as soon as possible.  But we know who is against providing tax 
relief to lower and middle income Canadians.  The Reform Party is 
filibustering a bill for tax relief.  It is unbelievable.  Shame 
on the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The situation which we have before us is one in which we could 
say without fear of contradiction that duplicity, thy name is 
Reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I know that you, being the very independent, 
objective, neutral person that you are, will agree with me that 
the actions of the Reform Party are totally unreasonable today. 
All right-minded Canadians and most MPs in this House want this 
bill to pass.  Most MPs are willing to sit longer so that the 
bill can pass and provide the necessary assistance. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So this is what is before us today. This bill provides what most 
Canadians want. What voters in the Cornwall region, so well 
represented by the chief government whip, or the region right 
beside Cornwall that it is my honor to represent, or the region 
of Vancouver, the south shore of Montreal or elsewhere, want. At 
this time, whoever has worked in the United States and paid into 
an American pension plan has their money taxed at source and 
retained by the American internal revenue service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party is opposed to a measure that would put an end 
to a plan that withholds money for American taxes. The Reform 
Party therefore supports the fact that the American government 
keeps money from Canadians. I would like the Reform Party to 
explain that to Canadian taxpayers. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt:</B>  We have not voted yet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member across 
says he has not voted yet.  There is still time to repent. 
Members opposite can do that.  I know that a large number of them 
rose in their place.  They were against extending the debate. 
Maybe that means they are in favour of closure.  Heaven forbid 
that Reformers do not want more debate. They are against 
extending debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us get this straight. Reformers are against more debate. 
They are in favour of taking Canadian taxpayers' money and giving 
it to the American government and they do not want to help poor 
and lower income Canadians.  That is the position of the Reform 
Party.  How could that be reasonable? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, a very neutral observer like yourself would no 
doubt agree with most right-minded Canadians that this is very 
wrong.  It is very wrong and it needs to be corrected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We on this side of the House will stand as we have in support of 
the hon. Minister of Finance, who has been so valiant in 
producing this tax treaty with the United States.  This treaty 
needs to be adopted by both houses of Parliament as soon as 
possible so we can give that kind of protection to Canadians. 
That is what all of us want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that the five hours of debate has now expired so I 
will end my speech.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Guimond 
(Beauport—Montmorency—Orléans, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to start right off  by telling the Reform Party that the Bloc 
Quebecois has nothing to learn from them about democracy.  That 
is the first thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree fully with the Government Leader in 
the House when he says that this party ought to get its act 
together.  In Quebec, we have a wonderful motto: <I>Je me 
souviens</I>, I remember.  I remember that party was opposed to the 
gag imposed on debate on Bill C-2, among others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the vote came on bill C-2, 
however, that party unanimously emptied its seats. 
The westerners elected members from the Reform Parity for a 
reason:  to sit in their seats, and from  those seats to make 
their dissatisfaction known, not off in the corridors, not off in 
their offices.  That is how to make oneself heard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc does 
not, therefore, have any lessons to learn from the Reform Party 
when it comes to strategy and to democracy.  If we agree to an 
extension of this debate, it is for the men and women who work in 
the Bellechasse region, in the Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup, in 
Lévis, in the Beauce. First and foremost, we represent human 
beings, which is why we have agreed to extend debate on this 
issue. We have no lessons to learn from the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Mr. Speaker,  I have no intention of taking 
part in the debate to decide which opposition party has something 
to teach the other parties in opposition. This is not my role. 
However, I will say that it was at the request of a colleague 
from the party of the member for Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup— 
Témiscouata—Les Basques that we considered the possibility of 
debating all stages in a single day. I thank the hon. member's 
colleague for the proposal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most parliamentarians agreed. Most were in agreement up to last 
Friday. I think it was the proper approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we are having a sort of filibuster in an effort to block 
this bill. 
However, at this eleventh hour, if we may continue, I still hope 
that we might look at the bill at all stages and be done with it 
so we may give Canadians and particularly people who are retired, 
senior citizens who today live in Canada but who worked part of 
their life in the United States, this tax relief.  People should 
not have their assets seized—in fact this is just what is 
happening right now—at source as deductions that are not only not 
returned to the taxpayer but not to Canada either.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey—White Rock—Langley, 
Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask the hon. member from 
across the way whether he feels that it is fair to Canadians on 
important issues such as seniors pensions that this House debate 
the issue for five hours.  Do you honestly feel that five hours 
of debate is adequate? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The Chair would 
gently remind all hon. members to address each other through the 
Chair.  The hon. House leader for the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am not sure what the 
purpose of the question is but if the hon. member wants to debate 
it longer, we have even provided for an extension of the hours so 
she does not have to be limited to five hours. 
<P><A NAME="LINK206"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
quite surprised that this early in the game after the House has 
resumed since the election, first we had closure brought in by 
the government on Bill C-2, the very first bill by the way. And 
now we have to debate this all night.  The government must have a 
legislative agenda as long as your arm, Mr. Speaker, because I do 
not know what it will bring in next in order to allow room for an 
opportunity to debate. 
However we find out the government is rushing another bill 
through the House of Commons.  This has to do with tax 
conventions, primarily one with the United States.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think back to last year when we were debating a thing called 
family trusts.  There was a loophole that allowed one particular 
family in this country to move $2 billion out of this country tax 
free.  When it was brought to our attention the Minister of 
Finance left that loophole a mile wide, wide open for three 
months before he closed it which allowed others perhaps with the 
same amount of wealth to do the same type of thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I read in the papers over the weekend that now we find the 
loophole the Minister of Finance closed has been closed in such a 
way that small entrepreneurs who want to leave this country are 
now going to find that they are taxed disproportionately because 
the bill was not debated and examined properly in this House when 
the amendments were forced through by the Minister of Finance and 
this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ask the House leader whether this type of issue, where 
he is forcing the closure on debate, is going to again allow 
loopholes to work to the disadvantage of Canadians and the people 
who have to pay tax in this country and allow the rich families 
who support the Liberals to go home free?  Is the intention of 
this legislation to allow that type of thing or are we going to 
find common sense debated in this House where we have an 
opportunity to look at the legislation, examine it closely and 
ensure that this type of nonsense that has already gone through 
this House will not happen again? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have a couple of points. 
First I know the hon. member is conversant with the rules as is 
the hon. member for South Surrey.  Being as familiar with the 
rules as they are, they will know that the motion was passed to 
extend the hours to hear all of the brilliant discourses the hon. 
member and his colleagues are willing to give to us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Tomorrow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  I am glad the hon. member referred to 
tomorrow's speech but it is an opposition day.  This issue is not 
on the agenda of the House for tomorrow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second point very briefly is that if the hon. member across 
thinks that this bill is closing a loophole, then presumably he 
would be in favour of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is about allowing lower income Canadians to get their 
money back that right now is seized by the Government of the 
United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The first five hours 
of debate have concluded.  Therefore pursuant to Standing Order 
74, all further interventions will be of 10 minutes duration and 
there will be no questions and comments. 
<P><A NAME="LINK207"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey—White Rock—Langley, 
Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have found the conversation to be quite 
interesting.  The member is quite right.  We do know the rules of 
the House.   However perhaps Canadians do not know that this 
extension of hours is a procedural manipulation of debate to make 
sure that this debate ceases to exist after this evening's 
sitting however long that may be, instead of giving Canadians the 
opportunity to understand what this government is trying to do to 
them by deferring the debate a couple of days hence.  That is the 
issue here.  The government is closing the debate much sooner 
than it would have gone on if this procedural motion had not 
taken place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The concern that I have is for the many seniors in my 
constituency who are just finding out about the changes that this 
government is proposing to seniors benefits, to CPP and now they 
are being thrown another change.  They are worried and concerned 
because they are the most vulnerable people in our society.  They 
are older people who no longer have the opportunity to go out and 
work in order to supplement an income that they see diminishing. 
These seniors are very concerned that their government is not 
giving them the opportunity to understand what it is that it is 
doing to them.

<A HREF="#LINKT92"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My concern as a member of Parliament is that the government does 
not seem to want to allow time so that the people in our 
constituencies can understand what the government is proposing 
and understand the arguments against the proposals. What is the 
rush?  Why is the government so reluctant to allow Canadians to 
fully understand what is happening to them? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fear and concern of our seniors are real. That fear and 
concern are often based on lack of knowledge and understanding. 
The government seems to continually do procedural things to 
prevent seniors from having that understanding, so that they can 
accept change and understand why the changes are taking place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is that fear we have to live with on a daily basis as they 
come to our offices asking us “What is happening to our incomes? 
Why does the government continually change the system after we 
have ceased to work?  Why is the government always changing the 
rules on us?  When we go into retirement we have planned it with 
careful preparations to look after ourselves, then the government 
changes the rules. Why?”  I cannot tell them why. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the government trying to fix a mistake that was made in the 
last Parliament?  One would ask why that mistake was made in the 
first place. Did the government not allow ample opportunity for 
consultation with Canadians who are caught in the bind of income 
from another country?  Why did the government not consult with 
the people who are affected before coming up with the legislation 
to deal with it?  Why did the government not allow for open 
consultation with the public, with the people who are affected, 
with tax consultants and others who would be brought into this? 
Why did it make that mistake in the first place in the last 
Parliament? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would hasten to suggest that perhaps it is the same reason we 
are faced with today, that the government is reluctant to allow 
for timely discussion to allow citizens to understand what their 
government is doing.  I would suggest that it is my 
responsibility as a member of the opposition to constantly ask 
the government these questions.  Who has it consulted?  In what 
way has it consulted?  How does it know that what it is doing is 
the right thing if it does not allow the process for people to 
question what it is doing and to suggest change? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We owe it to Canadians, to our seniors who are the most 
vulnerable in our society an opportunity to understand that these 
changes may be to their benefit, but that they may have a 
disastrous effect on them and they may lose some of their income. 
They need to understand so that they may have the opportunity to 
prepare, not so that they can live a wealthy lifestyle travelling 
and whatnot, but so that they can put food on their tables, pay 
their rent, look after their health needs and the care of their 
loved ones who may be in a care situation and where they pay 
their own expenses and those of their loved ones in a care 
facility.  They need the opportunity to understand what the 
effect will be on them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In essence the government has closed the debate. It will 
continue this evening before running out of time. It will not be 
resumed two days hence.  It is unfortunate that we will not have 
that opportunity to continue it in two day's time so that we can 
get the information out to more concerned Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I move:

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The Chair recognizes

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise seeking 
clarification. As near as I can tell, with your ruling you have 
said that any motion that we may put forward on this side of the 
House is out of order because of Standing Order 25. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Standing Order 25 is very specific.  It specifically says there 
shall not be a motion entertained to adjourn the House.  There 
may be many motions, debatable, votable motions made from this 
side of the House through the course of the evening until 
midnight.  If you rule as you have that everything is out of

opposition cannot propose anything else.

<P><A NAME="LINK208"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
motion before the House makes me almost sad because of what it 
seems to imply.  It seems to imply a strategy on the part of the 
government to confuse the people of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue is very significant.  Very often what happens when a 
change is made in one aspect of legislation, especially one that 
affects such wide ranging provisions as senior citizens' benefits 
such as pension plans, taxation structures whether income taxes, 
capital gains taxes, property taxes or whatever, is that it 
affects other pieces of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government can go to the public through its representatives, 
the parliamentarians, and say “We have consulted widely.  We 
have consulted in depth.  We have heard what the people have 
said” but they have asked them only one question. The one 
question was would they like the Government of Canada to change 
the convention that would allow the Government of the United 
States to collect or withhold certain social security taxes 
rather than collecting them at home when our provisions apply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the Liberals did not ask is what are the implications for 
those who are in a higher income tax bracket?  What are the 
implications for those who are in a medium income tax bracket? 
What are the implications for other pension plans, the Canada 
pension plan, the old age security benefit?  What are the further 
ranging implications?  They did not ask that question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government provided us with legislation on the Canada 
pension plan. It wanted to change this legislation.  It did not 
indicate either what the implications would be to RRSPs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did it tell us about the clawback provisions when it came to the 
old age security benefits currently existing to those that will 
take effect on January 1, 1998?  Unless the government tells the 
whole story, it could be confusing to people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, if the Liberals tell only part of the story without 
telling the whole story with the view to changing the attitude of 
the people and their direction, they could be charged with 
deliberately leading the people in a direction in which they 
would not go if they understood the whole story. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the danger behind this legislation before us today. 
Then they are forcing the issue so that we cannot tell the people 
of Canada what is involved.  This misleads them and creates a 
situation that is false from the beginning.  It creates a 
foundation that is wrong and creates doubt in the minds of the 
people.  What is this government really all about? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians will find out.  The day is coming when they will pay 
their taxes and recognize “What in the world happens now?  I 
have to pay this tax.  I have to pay that tax.  I have to pay 
another tax and what I thought I was going to get, I don't get. 
What's going on here?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They call it an income tax.  They call it a surtax. They call it 
a clawback.  They call it a reduction in benefits.  They call it 
a shift in emphasis.  All of them lead to one thing, more money 
in the general treasury of the Parliament of Canada.  It is 
wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It confuses the people.  It distracts their attention and makes 
it impossible for them to make well-informed and solid choices.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot help but hearken back to a letter the Minister of 
Finance wrote not too long ago.  In fact it was written last 
spring.  In the letter he referred to the excise tax for 
gasoline.  Guess what he said?  He said that excise taxes go into 
the consolidated revenue fund of the Government of Canada and 
were necessary to reduce the debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has been in office since 1993.  It has not 
reduced the debt one cent.  In fact, $100 billion were added. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did the Minister of Finance say in Vancouver just last 
week?  He said that the deficit would only be $8.9 billion.  Only 
$8.9 billion more will be added to the debt of Canada.  He should 
have said that our debt had increased by $8.9 billion in the last 
year.  That is what the government is giving Canadians and it 
does not help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The difficulty is that again the Minister of Finance is 
confusing the people.  There is confusion on taxes.  There is 
confusion on seniors benefits.  There is confusion in the way in 
which the government rams things through the House.  There is 
confusion because people thought their representatives would be 
able to represent their point of view accurately, concisely, 
honestly and in a truthful way.  What did they discover?  We have 
to shut up.  That is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to get to the point where the government tells the whole 
story when it presents a program or legislation.  It should tell 
the whole story.  That is the truth.  It should not tell part of 
the story or lead in a particular direction and actually end up 
saying something, presenting something or creating a perception 
that is false.  That is going on here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I decry that kind of thing.  It should not happen.  Are there 
certain provisions in the proposed legislation that could be 
supported?  Absolutely there are.  There really are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of my major concerns is that the legislation does not treat 
all people equitably.  It does not treat them fairly.  As a 
consequence we have to vote against the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does it mean we object to everything in the bill?  No, it does 
not mean that.  It means the bill ought to tell the whole story 
and it does not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The time has come for every parliamentarian to examine every 
piece of legislation on the basis of three things.  Is it the 
truth? Does it treat people fairly?  Does it create the kind of 
perception that will give wisdom and courage to the people so 
they can go to their children and grandchildren and tell them 
what they have done for them and what benefits they have been 
given. Liberal member and opposition members need to develop that 
kind of orientation in parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Legislation like this bill and the way it is being presented 
proposes an arbitrary manipulation of the rules of the House to 
get a particular point of view across.  It confuses and misleads 
the people of Canada.  It creates cynicism on the part of people 
who ask what parliamentarians are up to anyway. The time has come 
for them to be able to say that parliamentarians represent what 
they want honestly, fairly and completely.  That is missing this 
afternoon.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I declare the motion 
defeated.  Resuming debate, the hon. member for Fraser Valley. 
<P><A NAME="LINK212"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is a pleasure for me to speak to this, not because I think we 
should be debating this bill at 7.50 p.m. but because I would 
like to set the record straight as to exactly what has gone on 
here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure a good number of the members over there have no idea 
what they just voted for.  They were told to vote and they did. 
Be that as it may, the general public should understand exactly 
what has happened here tonight.  We have a system of doing 
business here in the House of Commons. We have an orderly order 
of business for a regular day.  It starts at a certain time and 
ends at a certain time.  We have an orderly calendar.  Week in, 
week out we know where we are going to be on which week and at 
which time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This allows the order of business to be conducted with some 
decorum and some decency in this place. With the odd exception up 
until recent years that was kept day in, day out by the 
government side.  It realized that if it wanted this place to be 
productive it would work in co-operation with the opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the record this is what has happened with two successive 
bills.  We have dealt only with two bills in this Parliament, and 
what has been done?  On the first bill the Liberals brought in 
time allocation which means the end of debate.  One day of 
debate, seven hours of debate, and it is finished.  It is 
shuffled off.  If the government had its way, the bill would be 
shuffled off and forgotten. Because the first bill was the 
pension bill we were not prepared to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, it was without any consultation by the other side 
that it brought in time allocation on the first bill.  Kaboom, 
she comes in, no consultation, no debate.  It is just the end of 
the debate.  Canadians who wonder why this 73% increase in CPP 
premiums, why the changes to the seniors benefit, why all these 
tax law changes that affect seniors. They are not given a full 
hearing in the House.  They are told “too bad, no debate in the 
House”.  They sent members of Parliament here to debate but they 
are not allowed to debate because the idea of debate for those on 
that side of the House is debate just for a little while and then 
hopefully nobody will notice and we can shut down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What have the Liberals done today?  They have pulled another 
procedural stunt.  At the last hour of debate the government can 
stand up and move a motion. 
It made the motion to extend hours indefinitely, day and night, 
until this bill is dealt with.

<A HREF="#LINKT98"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is another pension bill, another tax bill for seniors whom 
the government 
should be concerned about, another bill that the opposition on 
this side of the House says it wants to hold debate on over two 
or three days.  Is that too much to ask?  Of course it is not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want us to debate tax bills and important 
international tax bills before the House.  On behalf of our 
constituents, it is our duty to stand on our record and stand up 
here and be counted.   What happens over there is that the 
government says “We cannot have that.  One day is enough. One 
day is all you get”.  It then moves this motion to extend the 
hours day and night as if the proper way to conduct business is 
until the lights go out or until the day is done and not even 
then; all night it wants to debate.  It is telling us if we want 
to debate we must stay up all night. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not orderly business.  Orderly business is ladies and 
gentlemen on both sides of this House asking each other how many 
speakers they have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Honourable ladies and gentlemen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl:</B>  Honourable.  Some of them are. However, 
they could ask how many members want to speak. Once we are down 
to five hours we are down to 10 minutes debate with no questions 
and comments.  How many speakers can there be? If everybody in 
the Reform Party spoke we would only be looking at another 20 
speakers, more than we already have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of another day of debate on Wednesday after the supply 
day or even a half a day— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cannis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, on a point of order.  The 
hon. member, with all due respect, referred to “honourable 
members, some of them”.  I would like to think that every member 
in this House is an honourable member.  If he tells us who is 
not— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  With respect, that 
is not a point of order, that is a point of debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl:</B>  I would like to thank the hon. member 
for voting for me earlier so I could continue this speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just so the public knows, there are procedural things that can 
be done on that side of the House to make difficult the 
opposition's job of pointing errors or omissions in bills, things 
that should be improved on, amendments, consideration for the 
public, raised public awareness; all those things that we are 
supposed to do on this side of the House are disallowed when that 
side of the House says that there can only be one day of debate 
per bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So far the government has a perfect record.  There have been two 
bills in the House and both bills have had restrictions on debate 
for this side of the House to even speak on the issue.  There is 
something wrong with its idea of democracy when it says it is one 
bill and shove it through the House.  They do not understand that 
the role of the opposition is to critique a bill, to try to 
improve a bill and to improve public awareness.  It is a whole 
gamut of jobs given to us by the Canadian public to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When that side of the House says we cannot do it what are we 
supposed to do?  We have to try to resort to procedural games 
ourselves.  What a ridiculous thing they force us to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That side of the House should sit down and negotiate the number 
of speakers we have left, what day we are going to bring in the 
bill, how long it will go through the House, we can go back and 
forth because we want to make sure you get your business done. 
But we have a job to do on this side of the House to do all those 
things I listed earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government feels compelled to use procedural shenanigans 
on every single bill, and it has a 100% track record so far, this 
is going to be a long four years.  Canadians gave this party a 
job to do.  They gave the other parties jobs to do as well. Those 
jobs are to hold the government's feet to the fire, to make it 
accountable, to propose amendments in order to help it design 
better legislation and to raise public awareness; all those 
things that all of us on this side of the House have been elected 
to do.  There are almost as many of us on this side of the House 
as there are on that side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, one day soon there will be a vote that this 
government is going to be awfully close to losing.  There are 
going to be many votes, some of them unfortunately without 
negotiation, without notice and without any negotiation between 
what I hope are hon. ladies and gentlemen all around. We will 
have to resort to the last resort which is to start out with the 
standing orders, then with Beauchesne's and then start duking it 
out on the procedural side. 
What a shame.  We should be debating and voting on the issues of 
the day and trying to build a better country with this House of 
Commons. When we are not allowed to do that, then this party and 
many others on this side of the House will not stand down. We 
will rise to the challenge.  We will not let the government ram 
this stuff through.

Speaker, I rise on  a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party member 
claims that they will rise to the challenge.  It will be noted 
that there are 30 Reform members here tonight.  The rest are off 
to Monday night bingo.

<P><A NAME="LINK214"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I begin by saying that the Liberal member was formerly a Tory and 
was formerly in the House.  I reserve commenting on the 
attendance of other parties when I look at the government bench, 
but I did not rise to talk about that.  I did rise to talk about 
how unfortunate I think it is that so early in this Parliament we 
have arrived at the state of affairs we have tonight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While there is an obvious tendency on the part of all of us to 
enjoy this parliamentary “silly-buggers”, it is unfortunate in 
the sense that I do not think any of this is really necessary. 
The government has not sought to engage in serious negotiations 
with respect to legislative planning.  It has done things without 
consulting the House leaders of the other parties.  The Liberals 
seem to have it in their heads that one day of debate is enough 
and that they are entitled to take whatever measures are 
necessary after a day's debate to speed things along. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just think this is a very bad sign for a Parliament which I 
had hoped had considerable promise even though it had been dubbed 
by the media as various things, that it would be a fractious 
Parliament, a pizza Parliament, that it would be this kind of 
Parliament or that kind of Parliament.  I thought we had a 
challenge here as five parties to see if we could work together. 
We started off well but we came to a very unfortunate place in 
that progress with the closure on the Canada pension plan.  And 
now we have today's situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to the government that all of this would be completely 
unnecessary with a little bit of good faith negotiating about 
what the other parties require and a little less impatience on 
the part of the government with respect to its own legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say a word to my Reform colleagues because so far I 
think they have liked what I said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has become easier and easier for governments to do this kind 
of thing because the value of Parliament and the value of 
politics per se has been so consistently debased by the kind of 
anti-political, anti-politician ethos that has been stimulated, 
enhanced and encouraged by many of my colleagues in the Reform 
Party.  The fact of the matter is that governments have found it 
easier and easier to do this because so little premium is put on 
political and parliamentary activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So much of a premium is put on efficiency and not wasting the 
taxpayers' money by paying all those people to go on and on and 
on.  But these are the very people who now want to go on and on 
and on because they think that they came here to say something 
and that what they have to say is important.  Now they are 
feeling the flames of a fire that they have added fuel to over 
the last 10 years.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have fed this cult of efficiency in trying to streamline 
the public sector and devalue what goes on in political life, in 
Parliament and in the public sector. It all makes it easier and 
easier for the kind of despotism that we see increasingly over 
there on the government side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They know they have a public out there which has been 
conditioned to say “Oh well, it is just politicians.  Oh well, 
it is not very valuable anyway.  The real decisions are made in 
the private sector.  What decisions that are made should be made 
fast and efficiently, like they are in a corporate boardroom”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a corporate boardroom.  This is Parliament.  This is 
where people talk.  That is what Parliament means, parl-iament. 
This is the place where we come to talk things out. To the extent 
that we devalue that function of Parliament, we make it easier 
for governments and we feed a fire that will ultimately consume 
all of us, including the democratic process. 
<P><A NAME="LINK215"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron (Fundy—Royal, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member for the Reform Party mentioned that we have entered into 
this debate because Reformers believe that the government has 
been usurping the parliamentary process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What Parliament has to do is to talk about the issues that 
actually concern Canadians:  that of less taxation, that of 
providing Canadians with balanced budget legislation, that of 
providing Canadians with a national health care guarantee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to point out to members of the Reform Party that 
initiatives in terms of theatreship as opposed to leadership with 
respect to legislation and the votes which we wasted time on 
after the throne speech do not provide Canadians with less 
taxation.  They do not provide Canadians with a national health 
care guarantee. This sort of thing, to actually prove a point, 
deters the professionalism of Parliament.  Therefore, I would 
encourage all members of the House to work in a more constructive 
manner.  We do not have to have showdowns and take people on on a 
day to day basis. 
<P><A NAME="LINK216"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I too 
would like to add my voice to that of the hon. member for Fraser 
Valley who indicated that it does seem to be this is not going to 
be a fractious Parliament but perhaps a raucous Parliament if the 
government continues in this vein of trying to impose its will 
without Parliament being given the opportunity to debate and for 
the people who were elected to come here and speak to be given 
the opportunity to speak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This piece of legislation was introduced today.  It is 138 pages 
long.  It is an amendment to quite a number of international 
treaties. When we read it of course it does not make a lot of 
sense because it talks about deleting a paragraph and adding a 
new paragraph in its place.  It jumps over to another part of the 
treaty to delete something else and amend something else.  We 
cannot read this as we read a book. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has only been in the public domain for one day and the 
government wants to pass it on to committee stage and bring it 
back here no doubt by next week.  It will be through to the 
Senate before we know it.  The public at large and experts will 
not have the opportunity to go through this with a fine toothed 
comb and add their professional opinion as to any potential flaws 
which might be in Bill C-10 with all of its amendments to the 
individual treaties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to draw the attention of the House to the issue 
last year regarding the Canada-U.S. tax treaty and the taxation 
of a family which took $2 billion out of this country.  As far as 
we know they took it to the United States and paid no tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While it was debated about whether the family should or should 
not pay tax, the Minister of Finance deemed the situation serious 
enough that it had to be dealt with by the finance committee.  He 
brought in amendments to the Income Tax Act to ensure that it 
would not happen again.  He allowed the situation to remain in 
the public domain for over three months so that anybody who 
wanted to take advantage of the same opportunity obviously could. 
Then he amended the tax act to prevent any other usage of the 
same methodology of transferring money out of the country.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I read in the paper on the weekend about the situation that the 
amendments brought in by the Minister of Finance dealt with the 
taxation of privately held companies. Because of the amendments 
the Minister of Finance brought in, the article suggested that 
small business people who move to the United States will now find 
themselves subject to double taxation. When people leave the 
country, it will be deemed to have been disposed of and they will 
pay taxes on it.  If they retain the asset for a period in excess 
of five years and dispose of it after that, the United States 
will tax it again because it only goes back five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we have a very simple situation.  Our business people are 
being compromised because legislation was rushed through this 
House, pushed through this House by the Minister of Finance in 
response to an issue that had erupted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I draw the parallels to this document, all 138 pages of it.  We 
have not had the opportunity to go through it in detail.  We have 
not had the opportunity to check with the professionals who make 
a living analysing and working with these documents to get their 
opinion on the validity of the changes.  We have not had that. 
Yet the government wants to stand up tonight and say “If you do 
not speak tonight, you will not be able to speak on this bill 
because it will go off to a vote and off to a committee and so 
on”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the member for Winnipeg—Transcona who talks about 
the debasement of Parliament.  I too am very concerned about the 
debasement of Parliament and the fact that we are now being 
perceived as an addendum to government, one of the things that 
has to be tolerated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A bill has to bypass its way through Parliament but that is only 
a perfunctory process.  It will become law because those members 
deem it will become law.  Not so, because Parliament is here to 
debate the pros and cons of this type of legislation. Complex 
though it may be, we are here to debate it and not to have it 
shoved down our throats by a government that wants to continue 
doing something else tomorrow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not the way democracy works.  We are here to uphold it. 
The fact that we have other members of my party around here who 
want to speak proves that we want to be heard not just on this 
issue but on all the bills coming forth that we want to debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to have the time to go back to our constituents and say 
“This is the legislation that the government is proposing. 
Should we take a stance for or against this piece of legislation? 
Is it good legislation?  Is it legislation that needs amendment 
before we can call it good legislation?  Is it legislation that 
we disagree with entirely on principle?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to be able to ask these questions of our constituents if 
we are to do our job.  Yet it is in and out of this House in one 
day flat.  We do not even have an opportunity to phone our 
constituents to find out what they are saying, far less 
distribute the contents or the principle of this bill and find 
out what our constituents think. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not a good day for democracy when we find that the 
government in the first two to three weeks of its new mandate 
wants to adopt this type of procedure and attitude.  That is why 
we have to take a stance.  We tried to take a stance on Bill C-2. 
We registered our opposition by refusing to be counted on the 
vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We stand again today saying here is a government riding 
roughshod over the democratic rights of 301 members in this room, 
all who have the right to speak on this bill but who are going to 
be denied the opportunity.  All of them have the obligation to go 
back to their constituents to find out what they think of this 
bill and to check with the professionals to find out if there are 
more loopholes in this bill before we vote on it, but no such 
luck.  Here they go again.

remember that their very small majority may wear thin. When we go 
back to our constituents and tell them how we are being run over 
and how their rights are being trampled, they will tell members 
on the government side that enough is enough and this has to 
stop; that they are supposed to have a decent debate in the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope they will have a change of heart, withdraw the motion and 
let us continue debate on this bill until all have had a chance 
to speak. Then we will know exactly what it contains so we can 
talk competently and intelligently about the fine print. I have a 
summary of the bill prepared by a research department but I have 
not had a chance to go through 138 pages. Have you?  I doubt it. 
Has anyone else on the government side? I doubt it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As somebody said before we had the last vote, stand up and vote 
and say yes because that is what you are told to do.  That is not 
good enough.  We are not here as stooges to do what the 
government tells us.  I hope the backbenchers on the government 
side will not follow that procedure but will stand up and say 
“Excuse me, what does this thing say?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want the government to give me time to read this before I pass 
judgment on whether I am supposed to vote yea or nay on this 
bill.  That is how this House works rather than as a rubber stamp 
the day the legislation is introduced.

going to do my bit to be heard in the House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK217"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I spoke to Bill C-10 during regular debate earlier today.  I 
opened debate on the bill on behalf of the official opposition 
and outlined our arguments for opposing the bill.  As we 
hopefully come to a close in this sad affair, I would like to 
review the chronology of how this unfortunate conflict came to 
be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is often the practice of government to hope that opposition 
parties will accept the rapid passage of technical bills which 
make so-called housekeeping amendments to legislation. Bill C-10 
amends various tax conventions and was presented to us and the 
other opposition parties as precisely such a bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two years ago a similar bill was brought forward to the House, 
an amendment to the U.S.-Canada income tax convention.  It was 
presented to the opposition then as a mere housekeeping bill, one 
without real substantive effect, one that we did not have to 
debate at any great length, one that could be passed if we were 
all to get along and do our business efficiently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What that bill did by establishing the third protocol for the 
treatment of social security payments to both Canadian and 
American residents was to impose a considerable and burdensome 
and prejudicial tax increase on virtually every single Canadian 
collecting U.S. social security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The members of the government, undoubtedly in good faith, took 
the mistaken advice of their officials who had drafted the 
legislation, advice which said this would not prejudicially 
affect Canadian seniors, that it would be revenue neutral, that 
none of them would end up paying higher taxes than they paid 
under the second protocol before 1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We took that on good faith.  Seniors took that on good faith. 
The current deputy prime minister, the second highest authority 
in his government, said several times on the record that the 
third protocol would not increase taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened?  When Canadian residents got their social 
security cheques after that bill had been passed, many of them 
were financially devastated.  Many were thrown into poverty. 
Members of the government know this is true.  That is why we are 
debating this bill today.  That is why we are trying to amend the 
mistake it made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I go over this history not to be redundant but to make the point 
about what it is we are doing with procedure now. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2020"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT103"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is necessary for opposition parties to identify flaws in 
bills that are presented to the Canadian people as merely 
technical amendments.  Sometimes it is necessary because the 
government, lo and behold, does not actually get infallible 
advice from it officials.  That was demonstratively the case in 
the passage of the third protocol two years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  I rise on a point of order, Mr. Speaker. 
I would like to ask if there is a quorum in the House to listen 
to my hon. colleague. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> We have a quorum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the third protocol was 
amended by the House two years ago.  The government presented 
amendments which were supposedly innocuous and benign in their 
effect.  Low income seniors got clobbered and hammered by that 
bill precisely because the opposition and the government members 
trusted the advice they received that the bill did not contain 
any deficiencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we need to take these bills seriously.  That is why 
we cannot rubber stamp them.  That is why we cannot treat the 
House, as the hon. member from Winnipeg said, as some kind of a 
board room.  Every piece of legislation that comes before the 
House is coming before the highest chamber of democratic 
deliberation in the country.  These debates must be taken 
seriously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know it may not matter to the members opposite because they, 
like I, do not have the time to read 138 pieces of legislation. Most 
of them, when they do get up to speak, read the speaking notes 
given to them by their departmental officials.  But that does not 
change the fact that this place has a history hundreds of years 
old based on parliamentary responsibility. 
It is ultimately here that the 
buck stops.  We cannot shirk that responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not standing up using these tactics out of some whimsy. I 
do not particularly want to be here at 8.30 p.m. debating 
technical bills, but I saw a flaw in this one.  As I am the 
critic responsible for it I advised my colleagues that, because 
it was a major tax increase for the Canadian recipients of social 
security benefits, we ought to oppose it.  We ought to take it to 
committee eventually and have witnesses appear.  We ought not to 
rush through committee of the whole without the people affected 
being able to have a voice in it. That is what taxation with 
representation is all about.  That is what the democratic 
traditions of the House are all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to invite my colleagues, as I did earlier today, to look 
seriously at not just this bill but all similar technical tax 
amendments to see what they really say.  Forget the advice you 
receive from finance department officials.  It is our job as 
members to dig to the bottom of this, to debate these things and 
to look at the affect they are going to have on Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to correct one thing the members opposite have been 
saying.  They have been suggesting that somehow the official 
opposition has been trying to stall the payment of retroactive 
tax payments to low income seniors who will benefit from the 
retroactive elimination of the huge mistake the Liberals made 
under the third tax protocol.  That is not at all what we are 
proposing to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would like to approve those retroactive payments as soon as 
possible, but within the context of a bill that treats all 
seniors fairly and does not increase taxes to any of them.  That 
is a simple principle on which I was elected by 60% of the voters 
of my riding to come here and advocate. My colleagues and I have 
a prerogative.  We have a privilege and indeed an obligation to 
do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of my constituents I want to put the government on 
notice.  If it tries to pull fast ones like it did today we are 
going to play these games.  Our role as opposition is to defend 
the privileges of this place, the traditions of democratic 
deliberation which this House represents.  No amount of 
arrogance or abuse of parliamentary power by the government is 
going to stop us from taking that responsibility very seriously.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is with 
mixed feelings that I stand at this time of the day to debate 
this bill because we need to have an opportunity not only to 
debate it in this House, not only to have experts who look at the 
many ramifications of the hundred pages of legislative change, 
but we should also have an opportunity to take it to the people 
back home whom we have been elected to represent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is devastating for me to find that my role as a 
parliamentarian is being limited by a government that again 
thinks it knows everything and that it cannot make a mistake. 
That is what is presumed here.  If it puts forward a motion and 
says that it wants it all finished today I would hope that what 
it is saying is that there is no error in this legislation, that 
there is nothing that can be made better for the people of 
Canada, that it is a perfect piece of legislation, so let us just 
get it on the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would have to concede that there would come occasions where 
there is a small technical change to be made where that may be 
the truth, but we do not know that.  As my colleague from Calgary 
indicated, that was the assumption made a couple of years ago 
when the legislation was passed that we are now trying to undo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the government carry on with this premise?  I am 
insulted by it and I am hurt by it.  Our respect for the 
parliamentary process and for this institution is being reduced. 
We have an obligation to maintain the integrity of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I feel so strongly that not only myself but also the members on 
the other side—we call them affectionately the Liberal or the 
government backbenchers, those who do not have a say in 
government—all have an obligation to provide scrutiny to these 
bills.  These things have a tremendous impact on our society, on 
the citizens of this country, on the taxpayers of this country. 
For the backbenchers to go along with this charade and to say 
“No, we are willing to abdicate our responsibility and not 
provide that scrutiny” I think puts them also in dereliction of 
duty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is incredible to think that the ministers who sit in the 
front rows really do know everything.  If that is really true 
then perhaps we ought to save the taxpayers a lot of money and 
just have a 20 seat Parliament and let them run it. We can just 
call it a cabinet and let them run the show.  Let us call it what 
it is, an elected dictatorship between elections.  That is what 
it boils down to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to see those backbenchers on the other side—what 
term do I use now.  It was going to be a four letter word that 
starts with <I>g</I> and ends with <I>ts</I> but I cannot use that. 
I wish they had the internal fortitude to actually stand up and 
say “I'm sent here to represent the people who elected me” and 
to stand up against the front bench of their party when they pull 
these kinds of shenanigans. This is really despicable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the greatest concerns we have in our ridings, at least I 
am hearing in my riding, is the concern of seniors with respect 
to their personal financial security.  It is being eroded big 
time.  They plan for their future and for their retirement given 
certain parameters.  Now those parameters are being changed 
rapidly and they do not have an opportunity to make adjustments 
to their earnings, to their savings plans.  Certainly they cannot 
anticipate all of the different and additional taxation rules 
that the government is giving to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It behoves us as members to show some genuine concern for the 
seniors in our society, those who are most affected by changes in 
these rules, those whose very continued livelihood depends on 
their financial security.

members opposite are going along with this kind of a charade and 
still claiming they won the election and can do whatever they 
want.  That is not good enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of Canada will rise up and revolt against this kind 
of a government.  They will say “Enough of this.  We want a true 
representational government.  We want a government where MPs are 
sent to Ottawa to represent the people”.  They should take their 
voting orders from the people who elected them and not from their 
party bosses who think they know everything and will not even 
contemplate that perhaps one of their bills or motions should be 
subject to amendment, improvement or perhaps even defeat.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise 
on a point of order.  It is inappropriate for members to refer to 
the fact that other members are not in the House.  I heard a 
member from the government side talking on that basis.  I would 
ask you to mention to him to refrain from doing so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  It is an established 
convention that members do not refer to the absence or presence 
of other members in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  This afternoon I heard from one of my 
honourable colleagues in the Liberal government that a tax was an 
investment.  Upon further questioning the member said that the 
pay back of these taxes is more taxes.  It is no wonder we are 
limited on debate of this issue and the Canada pension.  These 
folks across the way have some distorted understanding about 
taxes. They think tax is an investment.  Tax is an appalling 
affront to Canadians.  That is what it is.  It is not considered 
an investment.  I want hon. members across the way to understand 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Being the House leader of the official opposition I am usually

have to deal with people like me on an ongoing basis to get 
approval and to make the House run smoothly and quietly.  An 
individual can only take so much.  I think members across the way 
are running out of brownie points.  This could be a pretty rough 
House of Commons for the next four years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Sit down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  One of the backbenchers as far back as 
one can get has asked me to sit down.  That is just arrogance 
from the Liberal Party.  I represent the people of Langley and 
Abbotsford in British Columbia who do not wish me to sit down.  I 
am here to speak my piece. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I bring to the attention of the House a couple of other problems 
the government has.  Recently the government bypassed the House 
of Commons and delivered bills directly to the Senate.  Again it 
shows the arrogance of the government in its understanding of the 
House of Commons, its rights, privileges and responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is bad enough that closure is called in the House.  It is bad 
enough that through other technical means debate on legislation 
such as Bill C-10 is limited.  It is worse and it is appalling 
that already four bills have gone directly to the Senate and have 
not been initiated in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are more bills in the Senate than we have debated in the 
House of Commons.  I wonder what the government is thinking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  It is not democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  That is right.  It is not democracy.  Is 
it thinking that the people who were elected to the House of 
Commons to debate bills are not worthy enough to debate them?  Is 
that what we are talking about?  Why on earth does the government 
send legislation directly to an unelected, unaccountable body 
called the Senate or sleepy hollow, as I would call it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-10 represents taxation to some Canadian people.  My 
colleagues in the House have a right to debate it.  They want to 
debate it as long as they feel it is necessary.  It is not 
incumbent upon the government to limit such debate.  It is not 
right the government should limit such debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The message is becoming very clear.  The government whip should 
know it will take co-operation from all sides of the House to 
work on legislation.  The message is coming to us loud and clear. 
It is not just legislation that will have a problem in the House. 
There are all kinds of committees, bodies and other means whereby 
we work together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely the government does not want to work like this for the 
next four years.  If it does, I guess it will be a long, long 
time in here and it will not be very pleasant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have requests from the government to fly all over the world. 
We can cancel their votes in the House of Commons.  The fact of 
the matter is that there is such a slim majority in the House of 
Commons the government will be in the House a lot more than it 
was before, and it had better get used to it.

getting taxed in this country.  They are going to wonder why they 
were not well informed.  The answer is those members in 
opposition who critique these bills did not have an adequate 
opportunity.  That is the real answer to all of this.  It is 
really too bad because I think we all came here to present lively 
articulate debate on these issues.  I guess the government just 
consists of a shameful group of people who have come here to push 
legislation because they have a majority.  One of these days in 
this House they will neither have a majority nor a government.  I 
am looking forward to that day.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich—Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
there is a part of me that wanted to go home but I could not 
leave without making a few comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I apologize to my colleagues on this side of the House for 
keeping them here but it is important for me to make these 
comments.  I can talk about Bill C-10.  I have read it.  I can 
talk about the technicalities, what the bill really does, how it 
will really increase taxes and how it will really increase 
revenue for this government, but I want to talk about what the 
government is doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I admit that I am a new member in this House.  I have been here 
only a few weeks.  I had my maiden speech prepared on Bill C-2. 
My constituents asked me to speak on it.  It is a huge concern in 
the riding where I come from.  I come here and I am silenced. 
That is wrong because we live in a democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am saying this from my heart because I really do believe this. 
I followed Parliament and I was going to speak on Bill C-10 
Wednesday but I have been silenced.  The hon. member for Calgary 
Southeast said I am in the line-up.  It may happen today or it 
will probably happen on the next speaking rotation.  I read up on 
the bill and studied the effects of taxes being raised. However, 
I am being silenced and not given a true opportunity to debate 
this in the House because of the government's tactics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been here only a few weeks.  I say this very sincerely 
from my heart.  They can laugh and they can make all the rhetoric 
they want, but on two occasions I have been silenced.  That is a 
dictatorship.  There is no other word for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are we even here if the government just does what it wants? 
On Bill C-10 we could go into the technicalities of it.  We 
could talk about how this government has the figure 70% stuck and 
ingrained in its brain.  That is the one thing I have come to 
learn from both of these bills that I was going to talk about. 
The government will have raised the premiums by over 70% in Bill 
C-2. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now when I study Bill C-10, if you want to talk about it let us 
do that.  Prior to 1995, 50% would be included in your taxable 
income.  Now, guess what?  It is going to be 85%.  It is a simple 
case of arithmetic, a 70% increase.  Imagine that.  This is not 
rocket science. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can debate this bill.  I know the Minister of Finance is 
probably off smiling and padding the government coffers where all 
this money is coming into.  I am sure the government knows how 
much extra revenue this will create.  This is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government stands up on the other side time after time and 
says there have been no tax increases but they are all sneaky 
hidden tax increases.  What is even worse, it will not even allow 
debate in this House.  It just rams them through and uses any 
tactics it can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could not leave without standing up and saying that I was 
prepared to speak on both these bills.  What I see in this House 
is wrong, wrong, wrong.  It is absolutely deplorable what this 
government is doing.  It is silencing the opposition.  It is 
trying to run a dictatorship and it is going to have to be 
accountable to the people of Canada whether it likes it or not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government members can stand there and laugh but I can 
remind them that the Tories once sat on that side of the House 
and laughed too and they paid a huge price and those guys are 
well on their way to going down that same path.
