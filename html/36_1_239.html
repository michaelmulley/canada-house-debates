</I></B></P><P align=left>She said:  Madam Speaker, last week, for the second time, this 
House resoundingly supported changes to the Canadian justice 
system that would give judges the ability to set fair and 
proportionate sentences for multiple murderers, finally putting 
an end to Canada's automatic bulk rate for murder. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since that vote, many of the more than 500 Canadian families who 
have been devastated by multiple murderers have seen fit to write 
to me, call in to talk shows, or otherwise let Canadians 
understand the truth about our current system.  They have never 
been able to understand why anyone would insist that the murder 
of their child, spouse or parent should continue to be 
meaningless to the courts.  Fortunately, they have found new 
faith in parliament by last week's decision by this House and 
many have written to express their thanks to members for 
recognizing the value of the precious lives they have lost and 
the need for justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another all too common message was that of victims' families 
being told by a sentencing judge that he wished he could give a 
more meaningful sentence for the murder of their child, but that 
the law simply would not allow it.  That is the message that we 
are hearing from the judiciary in open court, a clear message 
that judges need more latitude to set fair and proportionate 
sentences for these most horrific of crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is exactly what Bill C-251 is designated to deliver.  It 
would allow a judge to look at the facts of a case where a 
murderer has been convicted of the murder of not just one, but at 
least two human beings.  The judge could look at those facts and 
make an assessment of the intent of the offender, the brutality 
of the crimes and any mitigating circumstances that may be 
relevant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having considered all of the evidence, a judge would determine 
first whether it is warranted to impose a consecutive sentence or 
grant a concurrent sentence.  If the judge determines that 
fairness and proportionality require a consecutive sentence, he 
has the further discretion to determine the length of that 
additional term of parole ineligibility, anywhere from one day to 
25 years.  I call that double discretion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For years I have heard colleagues insist that judicial 
discretion was necessary and essential even in cases of multiple 
first degree murder.  I have listened and I have learned from 
their advice.  Now judicial discretion is the cornerstone of the 
multiple murder and multiple sexual assault provisions of this 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By passing Bill C-251, parliament will be declaring that every 
victim of murder or sexual assault should matter to the court. 
At the same time it will provide judges the latitude to account 
for the specific circumstances of an individual case.  As always, 
we will be entrusting the judiciary with the responsibility to 
render fair and proportionate sentences within the parameters of 
the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the past week I have heard that for some members judicial 
discretion is not enough.  Some hold the view that a multiple 
murderer who kills his victims in quick succession should be 
immune from additional consequences arising from the second, 
third or fourteenth murder.  The next Mark Lepine, Denis Lortie 
or George Lovie should all be guaranteed concurrent, meaningless 
sentences for all but their first murder, according to this 
argument. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say that there should be no such guarantee.  There should be 
no automatic benefit to planning to kill several victims in the 
same event. 
Instead, I propose that a judge is best placed to determine what 
is fair and proportionate based on the facts.  Let the judges do 
their job.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another argument back from the slag heap this week is the 
potential cost of keeping multiple murderers in jail longer.  I 
had thought this argument had long since been put to rest, but 
back it comes when all else fails. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me be clear once again.  There can be no cost implications 
of the multiple murder provisions of Bill C-251 for at least 10 
years as the bill is not retroactive and all multiple murderers 
serve at least 10 years anyway.  We know that it will not cost 
one cent for ten years.  Moreover, multiple murderers currently 
account for about 2% of the prison population and it will take 30 
years for a new generation of multiple murderers to replace them. 
By the year 2030 the total prison population may well be 1% to 2% 
larger than it would be otherwise.  That is the price of justice 
insofar as multiple murderers are concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One reservation put forward over the last days was particularly 
curious, that being that the bill has moved through parliament 
too quickly.  One even described it as having whistled through 
parliament.  Today is the sixth time the Chamber has debated this 
bill over the last three years.  It was introduced three times 
before being made votable.  Second reading occurred not 
yesterday, but seven months ago.  It was held in committee for 
over four months and there was yet another debate at report 
stage.  More debate is yet to come in the Senate.  Parliament has 
had much time to debate this issue and render a well considered 
decision.  The House has decisively, on two occasions, voted in 
support of Bill C-251.  It is a decision that should be 
respected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For months I have been asked to put a label on Bill C-251.  Is 
it liberal to initiate this kind of change?  I decided to find 
out whether it was liberal and to find out whether people of 
different political stripes had different views about consecutive 
versus concurrent sentences for murder and sexual assault.  I 
commissioned a professional polling company, often regarded as 
the Liberal Party pollster, to find out how Canadians broadly 
viewed this issue.  What they found did not surprise me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Intuitively, I have always felt that the Canadian sense of 
justice was non-partisan.  That is the message I got at the door 
in my riding.  I got the same message in Quebec, the maritimes 
and the west.  All people, of every political stripe, from every 
region of this country, have seen the injustice of concurrent 
sentencing in their communities.  Their outrage is not political; 
it arises from the people's sense of justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pollara found that 90% of Canadians support consecutive 
sentencing for rapists and murderers on a mandatory basis.  With 
judicial discretion, that number would surely increase to an even 
higher level.  What the numbers show is very interesting when we 
examine the political parties that respondents support. 
Ninety-two per cent of Liberals polled support consecutive 
sentencing.  Support in the other five political parties was 
similarly overwhelming, with no party showing less than 83% 
support for consecutive sentencing.  Just as striking was the 
fact that women were the strongest supporters of consecutive 
sentencing, with only 5% opposed to mandatory back-to-back 
sentences.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consecutive sentencing for murderers and rapists defies the 
labels.  It is as non-partisan as the justice that victims in 
this country require. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In amending the bill, I took into account more than just the 
criticisms that some had offered.  I also wished to address 
legitimate concerns over the image given by certain potential 
sentences.  In particular, there seems to be some discomfort with 
the notion of even a Clifford Olson being sentenced to a fully 
consecutive term which could reach 275 years.  In response, I 
agreed to yet another amendment that would cap any additional 
sentence at 25 years.  Hence, sentences will not be imposed which 
go far beyond the life expectancy of most multiple murderers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have before us today a bill I believe reflects the input of 
many members of the House, including some who sadly continue to 
oppose it.  It achieves the core objective of eliminating the 
automatic bulk rate for murder that disregarded the second, third 
or eleventh victim.  It makes this progress with all the 
safeguards of complete judicial discretion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge all members to look upon Bill C-251 as a bill that 
responds to their advice and builds on the common ground that we 
have found over the past three years.  It is a bill that will 
contribute to justice by providing greater proportionality and 
fairness, and by recognizing that every victim deserves a measure 
of justice. 
<P><A NAME="LINK5"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak to Bill C-251.  It has been 
ongoing in the House for some time and, I must say, with a fair 
bit of acrimony.  I am not sure if the debate has gotten into the 
rights or wrongs of the bill.  It seems to be more that it did 
not come from one particular source or that it was not sanctioned 
by the cabinet, for instance, and therefore it is not going to 
go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This particular bill deals with a pretty basic issue in the 
country, which is whether or not multiple murderers and rapists 
are getting the right amount of prison time for their crimes.  I, 
too, have a private member's bill in the House on consecutive 
versus concurrent sentences, but it does not deal murderers and 
rapists.  It deals with individuals who are already in prison and 
who unlawfully go at large.  At a facility in my community there 
have been 23 unlawfully at large prisoners in the last six 
months.  That is only one facility out of the seven in the area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happens is that they go and commit a crime or whatever and 
get a concurrent sentence.  In other words, there is no extra 
time.  A guy goes into prison thinking he can escape on a dump 
truck or something else in order to get out.  Once he is out he 
robs a bank.  He just goes back to prison and the courts say that 
he was a bad boy and that he should not do it again.  He receives 
the same amount of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the moment, I am not going to deal with that particular 
issue, even though I think it is important, because this 
particular issue on Bill C-251 is much more important.  This is 
about people who commit severe crimes, multiple crimes, multiple 
murders and rapes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This frequently happens in my community in the lower mainland of 
British Columbia. 
Victims enter the courtroom thinking that the individual will get 
life and they will never see him again.  What happens most of the 
time is that the faint hope clause, section 745 of the Criminal 
Code, will take light and give opportunity for an individual to 
get out of prison after 15 years.

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The terrible tragedy of all that is that those parents, families 
and victims from way back when the original crime was committed 
think the person is away for life and they can put the terrible 
tragedy in their past history and get on with life.  However, 
after 15 years the person can apply under the faint hope clause 
and the battle starts all over again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am already in a situation with Colin Thatcher who is about to 
apply for a section 745 hearing.  All of the victims will once 
again have to relive the tragedy of 15 years ago.  His wife was 
bludgeoned to death 20 times and shot in the back of the head. 
They will have to relive this all over again. They are asking 
whether the punishment fits the crime.  In this case we have 
serious rape offences and multiple murders.  Very few people 
today are satisfied with the fact that an individual gets life 
because life does not mean life in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Way back, when the Liberal government did away with the death 
penalty, it said that it would bring in life as a penalty. Little 
unknown to most of us, the Liberals said that life is 25 years 
but it could be reduced by 10 years by applying under the faint 
hope clause to get an early release.  We did not know much about 
that because by the time it started it was 1992, some 16 years 
later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen some terrible situations of individuals who were 
originally up for life, and where families thought they were in 
prison for life, but who were in fact out on the street 16 and 17 
years later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have to deal with is whether Bill C-251 is an 
appropriate bill.  I sincerely believe it is.  The second issue 
is how we get it through the House of Commons.  We know that 
cabinet, by and large, is not in favour of this, but this is not 
a cabinet bill.  It is not a piece of government legislation. It 
comes from an individual, an individual with the support of a 
majority of the members in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just because it is not government legislation, it does not come 
from cabinet and it does not have the support of those in cabinet 
does not mean the bill should not be carried. It means that maybe 
the individual who brought the bill forward to the House is a lot 
closer to the grassroots of the country than the cabinet may like 
to think.  This is one of the difficulties with private members' 
bills in the House.  Cabinet thinks private members' legislation 
interferes with an agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have had considerable experience with private members' 
legislation being a member of a subcommittee that looks at it. 
This legislation is a lot closer to the grassroots of the country 
than much of the legislation put forward and tabled by cabinet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It can be said that overnight success usually takes about 10 
years in the House of Commons.  We have been at this long enough 
to recognize that this issue is not going to go away.  It is time 
for those of us who really believe in this to stand up and be 
accounted for and not to stay home because we were told to stay 
home by government members or a whip.  It is time to stand up and 
be counted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting that in the bill, as the member who sponsored 
it has said, judges have complete discretion as to whether to use 
it or not.  That in and of itself should be enough to waylay the 
fears or concerns of anybody on the other side that here we go 
down the slope of always issuing consecutive sentences.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish it could be said that judges in the country issue the 
maximums.  However, in my experience judges are often 
implementing and imposing sentences that are minimums, not 
maximums.  We see it all the time under the Young Offenders Act 
and when they deal with drugs, they give minimum not maximum 
sentences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is important here, although it says “using complete 
judicial discretion”, the next stage for me would be to try to 
convince some of these judges to use some of that discretion 
rather than the minimum sentences that they give. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If an individual is sentenced to two consecutive sentences, to a 
maximum of 50 years, is that so bad?  I am not going to repeat 
the names of those who should have it, but I am going to say that 
any individual in the country perpetrating multiple murders 
should serve an appropriate amount time for that crime.  When we 
get into two, three and four multiple murders, we should not be 
saying that one 25 year sentence is adequate.  It is not for the 
victims of the crime.

the bill before the House has had substantial movement over a 
number a years culminating today in the vote before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The original bill came before the justice committee, on which I was 
a member.  We examined the bill and eventually it came forward in 
the following manner with amendments that have been moved and 
have substantially changed the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to address three things.  First, I am going to 
address the changes in the legislation that occurred last week, 
to which the mover of the bill referred.  Second, as this is a 
private member's bill, I will be addressing my own views on the 
bill.  Third, I will also be addressing some of the comments made 
by the earlier speakers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will say that the drafter and mover of the bill has 
substantially changed the original legislation.  One of my 
criticisms of the original legislation was the lack of judicial 
discretion.  I believe the member has gone to some lengths to 
address that.  However, to some extent I think that was also done 
in an effort to get the matter back before the House of Commons. 
I do not blame her for that because it is a matter she feels 
quite passionately about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the haste to move those amendments, I have some concerns 
about the drafting.  People should know that members of 
Parliament only received these amendments a week ago today.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has not been time to adequately review them in the way we 
normally would.  Normally they should be vetted through the 
justice committee to ensure that there are no charter challenge 
objections or that they do not conflict with other sections of 
the code.  That causes me concern and I will come back to it 
before I am finished. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having provided for judicial discretion the member has narrowed 
the focus of the bill.  I ask that we have a respectful debate on 
a piece of legislation upon which members of the Chamber have 
very differing opinions.  I have listened respectfully to those 
with whom I disagree and I expect the same courtesy.  We need 
that kind of debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue has now been narrowed to what kind of society we see 
Canada becoming, what kind of society we want to build.   Is it a 
society where justice is vengeful, or is it a society that sees 
redemption in the spirit of mankind?   Not just to be critical, I 
say that because there are those who believe that justice should 
be vengeful.  There are those who believe in an eye for an eye, a 
tooth for a tooth, a life sentence for a life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having redrafted the bill, the member caused me to think 
carefully about this when I was home in my constituency.  I had a 
discussion with a young woman who is not sophisticated in the way 
bills come before parliament.  I explained to her what we were 
talking about, how there was a motion that would allow a murderer 
who commits horrendous murders—and I do not think anyone would 
say they are not—to be sentenced to two consecutive life 
sentences in the justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This young 11 year old woman looked at me and said “But you 
only have one life to serve.  How can offenders serve more than 
their life?” That is the question to ask.  How can we sentence 
offenders to more than God has given them?  How can we sentence 
them to more than their life? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is some confusion around this question.  I think the 
member for Langley—Abbotsford mentioned it when referring to 
these sentences as 25 year sentences.  There are members of the 
House who think that conviction for multiple murders is a 25 year 
sentence.  It is not.  It is a life sentence with eligibility to 
ask for parole at 25 years.  Some prisoners have been released at 
25 years and some have not.  The sentence is not 25 years.  The 
sentence is an entire life in prison with the opportunity to ask 
for parole at 25 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  No, it is not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini:</B>  A member of the Reform Party is 
yelling at me, saying that is not it.  I ask the mover of the 
bill, then, why we have changed it from 25 years to 50 years.  It 
is eligibility to apply for parole at 50 years.  That is what we 
are extending.  We are adding two or three life sentences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In nations with the death penalty would murderer be hanged three 
times?  Is that the direction in which to go?  If we say there 
should be multiple life sentences then I ask that question. Maybe 
there are those who believe that if offenders take three lives 
they should pay three times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sympathetic to the case made by the mover of the bill who 
says that many people and many victims ask if the death of their 
spouse, their child or their friend is meaningless.  I respect 
and believe this comment.  Yet surely we cannot say that by 
adding another life sentence to what is an impossible situation 
we bring justice to that family.  Surely by saying someone will 
serve 200 years when it is not a possibility only mocks the 
justice system. 
I respect those who feel differently in this regard, but to me 
there is an illogical aspect to it that plays into the question 
of whether or not we are a vengeful society.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also asking the judge to look at the offender and 
determine whether or not the offender can be rehabilitated in 50 
years.  The burden we put on the judge is to look at the offender 
and say “I believe that you are so heinous a human being that 
you cannot be redeemed for 50 years and will make that judgment 
now”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What other legislation would we pass in the House and say no one 
can change it for 50 years?  I ask members to think about that. 
Would we say a piece of environmental legislation could not be 
touched for 50 years because we as members of parliament have the 
foresight to know what will happen in the next five decades? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can we give a judge the power to sentence someone to two life 
sentences and not be eligible for parole for five decades?  We 
can, and there are members who will vote for that.  I disagree 
and I have asked for a respectful debate on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My opinion is that I cannot entrust any other human being with 
50 years of foresight.  I say that there are all kinds of 
prisoners, all kinds of horrendous human beings who have found 
redemption, maybe not at 25 years but maybe at 35 years, maybe at 
15 years or maybe at 5 years.  Can I judge that?  If I cannot, 
can I ask the judiciary to do it?  I object to the bill on those 
terms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will turn to the comments made by the mover.  Again I say I 
respect her opinion.  She referred to the Pollara poll.  Many 
people in that poll believed that a life sentence was 25 years 
and the opinions were therefore skewered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me end by saying that in a way we have perhaps increased the 
life sentence.  Perhaps we have taken more from the offender. If 
we sentence someone without eligibility for parole for 50 years, 
we take away hope and in so doing perhaps we take away not only 
their life but their soul. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to vote against the bill because my conscience tells me 
that justice is redeemable and not vengeful. 
<P><A NAME="LINK8"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> Madam 
Speaker, it is my pleasure to rise again to speak in support of 
Bill C-251.  I am pleased to follow the comments of my colleague 
from Nova Scotia, the hon. member for Sydney—Victoria. He raised 
some very soul searching and gut wrenching questions in his 
commentary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously today's debate and throughout the time that we have 
seen this issue arise in the House and in committee it invokes a 
very emotional response, as do victimization and violence in most 
instances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I pay tribute again to the member for Mississauga East for her 
tireless work on the issue and for bringing it forward.  Today's 
vote will be a testament to that hard work and determination.  It 
is because of this perseverance and persistence that we will have 
an opportunity to bring about a law that will in my opinion more 
accurately reflect the conscience of the country and the need to 
protect individuals from violent offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The basic and just principle of consecutive sentences has proved 
to be too much for some soft on crime members of the Liberal 
government.  As many members know and as has been previously 
stated, previous polls have been conducted which seem to suggest 
that Canadians overwhelmingly support the principle of stiffer 
sentences when it comes to the issue of high end violence, the 
violation of people and their lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While some members of the Liberal government defend 
rehabilitation and parole for multiple murderers and rapist, Bill 
C-251 calls for the House to defend the rights of victims of 
multiple offenders such as Mr. Olson's victims numbered one 
through eleven.  The bill would given individualized recognition 
to those victims and give their families some much deserved 
justice for the atrocities that were committed against them and 
their loved ones.

<A HREF="#LINKT8"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would also send a strong message to potential criminals that 
the Canadian justice system would no longer ignore the number of 
innocent lives that are shattered.  I urge the House to take 
action and follow the lead of the hon. member for Mississauga 
East to stop the volume discount for crime sprees, for serial 
rape and murder. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps our actions today will impact on the future of some 
loved ones.  This current incarnation of Bill C-251 reflects a 
compromise, an improvement and an explanation of many of the 
clauses that previously existed in a bill which the Progressive 
Conservatives also supported. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the current proposal cannot address the concerns of every 
member in the House or every member of society, it is a concrete 
shift in the right direction.  It will not be retroactive.  There 
have been many arguments about discretion and the imposition of 
judicial discretion on an issue such as this one.  It has been 
used on both sides of the argument quite ironically.  I suggest 
in this instance that it allows a judge increased discretion to 
reflect the applicable laws upon the conscience of the community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one is suggesting for a moment that we remove all other 
sentencing principles, the protection of the public and the need 
for rehabilitation and general or specific deterrents, 
considerations with which my hon. colleague for Sydney—Victoria 
would be familiar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It certainly does not remove the situation where a person can in 
fact be rehabilitated.  I am of the personal belief, and I have 
read extensively on this issue, that there are some in society 
who simply are not amenable to rehabilitation.  They simply 
cannot be rehabilitated.  They are those who are at the very high 
end of the violence inflicted upon individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is extremely unfortunate.  It is not something that a person 
wants to admit quite readily, but if we are to believe that the 
protection of society is the primary responsibility of 
legislators and the primary responsibility of our justice system 
then we must recognize that a very small minority of criminals in 
the country are simply beyond that rehabilitative scope. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Sydney—Victoria spoke of a 50 year 
foresight, that he did not believe there could be such a thing. I 
suggest quite the opposite.  I would rather have an attempt at a 
50 year foresight than a one year after the fact contemplation of 
what could have been done when a person was released for whatever 
reasons or whatever criteria and went out to rape and kill again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-251 was previously introduced and dealt with in the 
justice committee.  It has had intense scrutiny.  There has been 
an opportunity for members of that committee and members of the 
House to look at the issue in depth.  There has been a concerted 
effort on the part of some members of the justice committee to 
undermine and completely dismiss or remove the issue from public 
debate.  That is very unfortunate because there are significant 
number of members in this place and an overwhelming number of 
Canadians who support the initiative of the hon. member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that this is a tough, philosophic issue, as are many 
issues that we often find ourselves debating and facing in the 
House, is not justification for turning a blind eye or refusing 
to deal with each. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current language in the bill shifts sentencing for multiple 
crimes of rape and murder from concurrent to consecutive but the 
discretion still exists.  There is no mandatory minimum or 
maximum reflected in this change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current bill and its amendments do not guarantee consecutive 
sentences in any way.  It grants judicial discretion for cases 
where consecutive sentence would not be in line with our 
fundamental principles of justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill does not change the status quo from mandatory 
concurrent sentences to consecutive, barring any judicial 
discretion on behalf of defendants.  When justice chooses not to 
enforce these consecutive sentences, however, the bill has 
amendments that would require that justice explains to the 
victims and their families why these sentences would not be 
served concurrently or would be served concurrently as opposed to 
consecutively.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this legislation is enacted, judges will be given the 
opportunity to mete out an appropriate sentence for animals like 
Bernardo, Olson and Roby.  I want to put these cases forward 
because it is important in the context of the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After being found guilty of the savage sadistic murders of two 
teenage girls in the 1990s, Paul Bernardo received two concurrent 
life sentences. He can apply for judicial review of his sentence 
in 2008 and is eligible for day release in 2015. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clifford Olson is serving 11 concurrent life sentences.  His 
sentence is not all that more serious than if he only took one 
life.  That is to say all of his sentences together reflect the 
same sentence that a person would receive for taking one life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pedophile John Roby was convicted of 35 counts of sexually 
abusing children.  The victims' families were shocked to learn 
that after being convicted of 27 accounts of these assaults, Mr. 
Roby received a two year prison term.  After several other 
victims came forward, the Ontario Court of Appeal increased the 
sentence just to five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995 serial killer John Martin Crawford was charged with 
three counts of first degree murder.  After being convicted he 
will be eligible for early parole in just 15 years under the 
faint hope clause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are just some examples, some of the more extreme high end 
examples, but nonetheless they are examples for the need of this 
legislation. It would be a shift in the right direction.  It is 
my hope that this bill will also mark an important shift in the 
mindset and the philosophy of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also a welcome example of what can occur with 
co-operation.  In tribute to a member of the government, a 
backbench parliamentarian, without the support of her party 
leaders and without the support of a logical explanation as to 
why that support does not exist, she has persevered.  Under the 
current government, the debate let alone the passage of this bill 
has been opposed by a number of party members, her colleagues. 
This is a rare occasion where a vote will take place that would 
allow a very logical and very worthwhile piece of legislation to 
pass. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Much semantics and rhetoric accompany the debate but it is 
important to point out again that life in this country does not 
equal life imprisonment.  That attachment does not occur.  Parole 
eligibility in 25 years is not the equivalent of life 
imprisonment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Very few high end criminals make it to that 25 year point before 
they apply and are indeed accepted for parole.  Fifty years 
ineligibility would be a more reflective response.  It would be a 
move in the right direction if judges were permitted to mete out 
a sentence that was more reflective of the public sentiment. 
Rehabilitation and other principles of sentencing will not be 
overridden. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This greater discretion should be encouraged and embraced by 
members of the House.  Democratic principles should be respected 
as they were when previous occasions allowed members of the House 
to vote in favour of this bill.  I encourage all members present 
to support Bill C-251. 
<P><A NAME="LINK9"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul DeVillers (Simcoe North, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
much has been said this morning about this debate being a battle 
of the backbench against the government.  There are many members 
on the backbench who are not in government and have extreme 
difficulty with this bill and with the fact that it has not been 
voted through the committee system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments that are the subject of today's vote were 
negotiated while the debate at report stage was carried on. There 
are many issues that should be studied.  Certainly many of us 
feel that this bill should be sent to committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some factual errors.  For instance, what is a sentence 
for first degree murder?  It is life without eligibility for 
parole for 25 years.  In fact, the average sentence served in 
Canada is 28.4 years.  Some members disputed or denied that, but 
those facts and figures are available from Corrections Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had those amendments reviewed by Professor Allan Manson, who 
is a professor of law at Queens University.  He said that in his 
opinion “Bill C-251 in its present form is unsound 
constitutionally, an example of regressive, inconsistent and 
unjustified penal policy and the product of an irresponsible 
process of legislating penal reform”.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In those circumstances certainly because of the timeframes that 
were imposed upon the House and the lack of the bill being 
referred to committee there has not an opportunity to properly 
study this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motives for this bill are certainly commendable.  Everyone 
empathizes with the plight of victims.  In our penal system life 
does mean life, but there is the opportunity for rehabilitation. 
I think that is very significant and should be retained.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire (Longueuil, BQ)</B> moved: 
<A NAME="LINK16">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, since the government ignored most of the 
recommendations by the Sub-Committee on the Study of Sport in 
Canada, a Sub-Committee of the Standing Committee on Canadian 
Heritage, the House demand that the government place amateur 
athletes at the heart of its concerns and make a commitment to 
placing their interests before the interests of professional 
sport. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>She said: Mr. Speaker, before beginning, I would like to draw 
your attention to the fact that I will be sharing my time with 
my colleague from Témiscamingue. This will be the case with all 
Bloc Quebecois members throughout the day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must first say that I am delighted to be able to debate 
amateur sport in this House today, and I trust that our debate 
will have the attentive ear of the other side of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois is introducing the following motion on its 
opposition day: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, since the government ignored most of the 
recommendations by the Sub-Committee on the Study of Sport in 
Canada, a Sub-Committee of the Standing Committee on Canadian 
Heritage, the House demand that the government place amateur 
athletes at the heart of its concerns and make a commitment to 
placing their interests before the interests of professional 
sport. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If hon. members find this motion long, I must point out that 
every word has a meaning and a reason to be there.  I would even 
say that each problem I shall address today could easily have 
been a motion onto itself, for the problems to be addressed 
throughout this day by my colleagues are but the tip of the 
iceberg.  In fact, my impression in researching this matter was 
that it was like opening Pandora's box.  Members will, I am 
sure, get that same impression. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like hon. members to know before I go any further that I 
too was part of the wonderful world of amateur sport.  Yes, I 
was a competitive figure skater.  I loved the sport and dreamed 
of taking part in international competitions, but I had to make 
a choice.  That choice was to give up skating because my parents 
and I could no longer afford the skates, the costumes and the 
coaching. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I focused on my studies and then went into politics.  Some 
might say I am still skating, but around issues.  On this one, I 
will say right out that I want nothing to do with the kind of 
society that does not encourage its athletes, that politicizes 
sport and prefers to subsidize professional sport to the 
detriment of amateur sport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do members know what is serious here?  Nothing has changed 
in the past 15 years. Nothing.  Since the Liberals were elected 
in 1993 transfer payments for amateur sport have dropped from 
$76 million to $57 million.  We are far from an improvement.  In 
fact, I would call it a backslide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For a moment we could have believed that the Liberals wanted to 
redeem themselves when the matter of striking a subcommittee on 
amateur sport came up, but no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In passing, I would like to congratulate my colleague, the 
member for Rimouski—Mitis, who worked very hard on this issue and 
is undoubtedly following the debate today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the Bloc Quebecois participated in good faith on this 
subcommittee, we have always felt that it was just an excuse to 
support professional sport and ensure the visibility of the 
maple leaf. We are still wondering if it was not a way to 
include the member for Bourassa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The facts would certainly seem to bear us out.  It is now clear 
that the subcommittee's report accomplished nothing because the 
minister did not implement any of the recommendations that might 
have helped athletes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although we were promised that this report would be the answer 
to all the problems encountered by athletes, the government is 
giving professional sport the nod over amateur sport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What a sad comment on society, at a time when life is not easy 
for these promising athletes.  Every year they face the same 
financial constraints and must struggle to find the necessary 
resources.  The government should do more for these athletes, 
who do us proud and who give us a window on the world.  It 
should match the commitment of the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The assistance now provided by Sport Canada falls badly short. 
Additional funding for our athletes should be made available 
immediately.  Athletes cannot wait for the 2001 symposium and 
the resultant visibility for the government and its flag.  If 
professional sport is in urgent straits, amateur sport is even 
more so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As recently as May 1, 1999 one of our very well known athletes, 
Jean-Luc Brassard, asked whether athletes would have to walk 
behind their sponsors' flags.  This is not a good sign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite all the remarkable achievements of our athletes, of whom 
we are proud and who deserve greater assistance, the Liberal 
government's record on sport is a disgrace and I denounce it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the tabling of the Mills report I have had the 
opportunity to speak to our athletes. There are many financial 
problems and they must be dealt with immediately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said before, the issue of funding is among the most serious 
issues. Ten minutes are not enough to list all the problems that 
exist in amateur sport, but I will try to give an overview of 
the situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be very clear. I want everyone to clearly understand that 
the Bloc Quebecois is not opposed to professional sport. We just 
want to make sure that the interests of millionaires are not 
given priority over those of amateur sport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want the government to clearly understand that before 
funding professional sport millionaires there are questions 
that need to be answered. We should first determine the exact 
costs involved, know the spinoffs for Quebecers and Canadians, 
and control skyrocketing salaries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No independent study has yet shown the economic impact of a 
professional franchise, and no professional team has made a 
commitment to remain in its host city in exchange for taxpayers' 
support. There are still many unanswered questions regarding 
professional sport, and if I had more than 10 minutes I would 
mention many more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sport Canada only gives 8.3% of its financial 
resources to amateur athletes. Every study conclusively shows 
that athletes often live below the poverty line. Even the hon. 
member for Bourassa agrees with me on that issue. 
Coaches are not required to be bilingual and there is no 
training program to help them learn to speak French. 
Francophones are subject to serious discrimination. I could 
definitely use another 10 minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a shift toward centres such as Calgary and Toronto. For 
example, the synchronized swimming federation transferred the 
team's training location to Toronto, in spite of the fact that 
the majority of its athletes are from Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, athletes cannot engage in politics; otherwise they could 
be expelled from the Canadian Olympic Association. They must, 
however, promote Canadian unity and prominently display the 
Canadian flag. 
If the athletes forget, the minister makes sure to take flags 
along with her and constantly reminds athletes that integration 
of Sport Canada with Canadian Heritage has focused attention on 
the contribution high level sport makes to Canadian pride and to 
national unity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Amateur sport is so important to the minister that she rejects 
all measures that could really help athletes; such consistency, 
once again, from the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would hon. members like another example, just for the fun of it, 
since they are beyond counting?  In her letter to the head of 
the committee, the minister wrote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee has made a convincing demonstration of the 
necessity of solid assistance from the federal government to 
amateur sport. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such a convincing demonstration that the minister is going to 
wait a while yet. She is not too sure.  Stay tuned for further 
developments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, amateur sport is full of problems.  Did hon. members 
know that there is no system to monitor the federations, and no 
assurance that taxpayers' money will be properly managed and our 
athletes respected? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give one example: the skaters Isabelle and Paul 
Duchesnay.  They were forced to go to France to train and to 
compete for France, and now have had to go to Florida to teach 
figure skating because the Canadian skating federation refuses 
to allow them to coach here.  And the government is doing 
nothing to resolve the situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When there are problems within a federation, athletes have to go 
elsewhere if they want to continue or have simply to give up. 
This simply makes no sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I had more than 10 minutes I could also speak about another 
problem, that of francophone athletes who are often discouraged 
because they have to go elsewhere and learn English because 
national centres offer few services in French. As Sports Québec 
indicated to the Bélanger-Campeau Commission barely eight years 
ago: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unilingual francophone athletes must overcome an additional 
obstacle in Canadian selections when they are unable to fully 
communicate in their own language with their trainers and those 
responsible for selection... They have less opportunity... 
because the majority of professionals and volunteers responsible 
for the selection and training of athletes are unilingual 
anglophones. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I had more than 10 minutes I would also talk about the 
problems within the Canadian Olympic Association, but once again 
10 minutes is not very long. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third recommendation in the Mills report on the matter of 
funding for the drug program is another hot topic. Clearly, the 
minister's response to the Mills report is a vast 
disappointment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has to be understood is that there are problems in sports 
at the upper echelons, and the government was elected for 
everyone, not just for the millionaires contributing to election 
coffers.

athletes.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview—Greenwood, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, in this question and comment period I say to the member 
for Longueuil, a member from the Bloc Quebecois, that this motion 
is a great initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the chair of the House of Commons committee that tabled the 
report, it is only fair and proper for me to acknowledge on the 
floor of this House of Commons the fantastic contribution the 
member for Rimouski—Mitis made to the committee. The member, 
Suzanne Tremblay, was with us— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  The hon. member 
surely knows that we do not name members in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills:</B>  Madam Speaker, I know what the rules 
are but I also know that my friend, the member for 
Rimouski—Mitis, is not with us today. She was unable to be here. 
I know her spirit and her heart are totally behind the work we 
are doing in the House of Commons today.  She is caring and 
compassionate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must say the only problem I had with the member for 
Rimouski—Mitis was that I could never figure out why she was 
part of the Bloc.  I sensed in her a real passion for young 
amateur athletes from coast to coast to coast. As we debate this 
report today I hope we in the House of Commons can do justice to 
all the good work she did on behalf of young people, amateur 
athletes, not just from the province of Quebec, but from every 
region of our country. I had to put those remarks on the floor of 
the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also have to say that the government is passionately committed 
to amateur sport. When the Minister for Canadian Heritage 
responded some three weeks ago, she tabled a report wherein 53 of 
the 69 recommendations were accepted by the government.  It is an 
unprecedented response. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most important thing that should be put forward once and for 
all is that in the report “Sport in Canada: Leadership, 
Partnership and Accountability, Everybody's Business” there were 
69 recommendations and 68 of them were dedicated to amateur 
sport.  Only one recommendation dealt with the fact that we have 
small market professional teams which need to be dealt with in a 
serious and constructive way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we launch this unprecedented debate in the House of Commons, 
and I realize it is only questions and comments right now, let us 
make sure that our focus is on amateur sport. Let us not get 
sidetracked by the professionals.  Let us not let the media 
sidetrack us.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I in turn 
thank my colleague for his able participation on the committee. 
I think he made a substantial contribution to amateur sport. 
His heart was in the right place, and I do not fault him 
personally, but rather the government, and the response of the 
Minister of Canadian Heritage in particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also wish to concur in the kind words addressed to my 
colleague, the member for Rimouski—Mitis.  I am sure that she is 
here with us today in heart and in spirit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to tell my colleague, who mentioned 69 
recommendations, 68 of them having to do with amateur sport, 
that I fully agree with him. 
I would like to ask him whether he finds it reassuring that his 
colleague, the Minister of Canadian Heritage, has rejected all 
of the amateur sport recommendations, or at least those that have a 
positive impact and would help athletes.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire:</B> —to meet with people in the sector. She wants 
to invest money, but does nothing for amateur sport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not find this in the least reassuring, and I know that 
neither do the athletes of Quebec and of Canada.  If the member 
wants to do something, I urge him to join the Bloc Quebecois, 
because he does indeed tend to think like us when he says that 
there has to be investment in amateur sport.  He is welcome at 
any time. 
<P><A NAME="LINK19"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to take part in today's debate on amateur sport, in the 
wake of the report tabled by the Sub-Committee on the Study of 
Sport in Canada on the needs of amateur athletes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to point out that sport is an integral part of our 
culture, both in Canada and in Quebec. Everyone has, at one time 
or another, taken up one or several sports, or closely followed 
family members or friends who were actively involved in sports. 
Every community has an arena, a gymnasium and other sport 
facilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, economic spinoffs from sports are obvious in every 
community. Most municipalities have facilities that were built 
by people and that provided permanent work for others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem right now is that a great deal of attention and 
energy are focused on what must be done to help professional 
sport. The Sub-Committee on the Study of Sport in Canada is no 
stranger to the problem. Even though most of the subcommittee's 
recommendations concern amateur sport, what got people's 
attention was the future of professional sport and some 
government members were quick to take a stand in that regard. 
Yet the future of professional sport is not so— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills:</B> Is was only one recommendation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien:</B> —promising. It will never be what it once was. 
With the Americanization of professional sport, several of our 
professional sport clubs are being threatened, and it will be 
very hard to save some of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The positive effect of this is that our sports reports, of which 
there are many—one need only read a morning paper to be convinced 
of that—may give more attention to amateur sport in future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for sports broadcasts, some radio stations have five hours of 
phone-ins every day.  Perhaps they would give more time to 
covering amateur sports.  This would focus more attention on the 
unprecedented success stories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recently attended a boxing match. What goes on there can very 
easily happen in amateur sport.  It is a very good illustration 
of how things are.  A fighter's career can be over in a matter 
of seconds.  An athlete may have spent his whole youth training, 
but a few moments of vulnerability can stop him from attaining 
his desired goal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That said, there are other values to sport: team work, aiming 
for success, pushing one's limits, which can impact on our daily 
lives.  Athletes devote a great deal of effort and energy to 
their passion, and the values stay with them for their entire 
lives, as they do with those of us who participated in various 
sports when we were young. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do we give them enough support?  I think not.  A goodly number 
of our athletes lack financial support.  Of course the best of 
them, that tiny minority of athletes who manage to win medals in 
amateur sport, or an international or Olympic medal, manage to 
gain sponsorship from a company like McDonald's.  Yet few have 
sufficient sponsor support to be able to increase training time 
and perform at the level they would like. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government also has a great deal of trouble monitoring 
Canadian amateur sport associations because its financial 
contribution is insufficient.  The more room left for other 
financial partners—and partnerships are not a bad thing—the more 
the government plays a minor role and the less it can impose 
its views on choices and strategy decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1255"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT20"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT20"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1255

<A HREF="#LINKT19"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien:</B> Despite what some whiners on the other side 
of the House are saying, I have heard a member of the Liberal 
Party, whom I will quote in a few minutes, say some really bad 
things about the Canadian Olympic Association with respect to 
the Calgary clique, which had some cleaning up to do. We 
certainly agree with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have no doubt that members of the Liberal Party 
must also support the principle that the government must invest 
more if it wants to play a greater role, and I challenge 
Liberal members interested in amateur sport to tell me 
otherwise. I am not talking about the gang that looks after 
professional sports, but rather those interested in amateur 
sport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some things have to be settled: the language problems in 
Canadian federations, location problems and strategic choices. 
There is a strong pull from Calgary in amateur sport. They 
deprived Quebec of a number of sports facilities. They even sent 
athletes to train there when most of them were from Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been a lot of dubious decisions such as these, and I 
am not talking about the place French occupies in events. Even 
in events where they are trying to make a public show French is 
forgotten. Imagine what is going on in the wings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are places in the world that are more open to Quebec's 
having its own delegations at certain sporting events, and I 
would like to see Canada being more open. Would it not be just fine to 
see Canada and Quebec competing in the finals of an 
international hockey tournament? It would be extraordinary and 
something else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When these same professionals were on strike and organized 
hockey tournaments before the start of the season, they 
established regional groups very different from our Canadian 
political groups. There was a team from Quebec, and it was great 
to see the game. It was also great for once to watch our 
professionals not play for money, because they were on strike at 
that point. The competition was really interesting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should, among other things, increase its 
financial involvement with all the federations. There are 
currently a number of sport federations that are not even 
funded. How can they be expected to develop and to help 
athletes? There should be a review of all of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The selection of those federations that are currently getting 
help is highly questionable. Several need support but are not 
getting it. The government should quickly look at this issue. 
This was in fact one of the subcommittee's recommendations, but 
the government did not follow up on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate the hon. member for Longueuil for raising this 
issue today, as the hon. member for Rimouski—Mitis did before. I 
hope this debate will at least have the effect of reviving the 
report of the Subcommittee on the Study of Sport in Canada, 
which had been shelved. 
When I say that it was shelved I am being positive. Indeed, for 
all I know, it may well have been thrown into the garbage. 
Let us hope for the best, that the government will dig it out 
and implement a number of recommendations included in it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many people are actively involved in amateur sport and are 
expecting positive developments and signals. At a time when 
professional sport is becoming less appealing to many people who 
enjoy watching sport, this is a good opportunity to promote 
amateur sport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is somewhat disconcerting to ordinary people to see 
professional sport millionaires sometimes drag their feet and not 
perform as well as expected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Amateur athletes do not have that luxury. When we attend a 
baseball game we may see a player earning $4 million or $5 million 
performing poorly. 
An amateur athlete cannot afford not to turn in a good 
performance during a competition because, unless he meets the 
very high standards he needs to qualify, he may lose the little 
support he has from sponsors, as well as from the government. 
He cannot afford to make any mistakes if he wants to survive in 
his sport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a much greater respect for amateur athletes than for some 
professional athletes.  We are all proud of Gaétan Boucher, 
Myriam Bédard and Sylvie Fréchette.  Canadians of whom we are 
proud include swimmers Alex Bauman and Victor Davis, who 
projected a positive image and did Quebec and Canada proud. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One danger is that the government will simply see this debate as 
an opportunity for political visibility. 
It would be just like the Minister of Canadian Heritage to want 
to tattoo a maple leaf on the best athletes' foreheads to make 
sure that Canada is visible at competitions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not the goal.  The goal is to support athletes.  Instead 
of conducting propaganda campaigns, as she did with the flag, 
the minister should provide funding for the daily expenses of 
these people so that they have a decent income while they are 
training, so that their passion for what they do will not be 
fettered.  Let us agree: what we need is not a flag campaign, 
not money for visibility, not money for the government, but 
money that will go to athletes.  If we keep that as a goal we 
will be on the right track.

</I></B></P><P align=left>That the motion be amended by adding after the word 
“and” the following: “immediately”.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We are moving this amendment because we want action now, not 
commitments in principle saying that the government will study 
50 or so proposals at some distant date.  We want action now 
and that is why we are adding the word immediately to the main 
motion.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I would 
first like to thank my colleague from Témiscamingue, who made a 
fine presentation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, with the little time he had at his disposal, I would 
have liked for him to speak more about the impact that Quebec 
having its own banner might have. Where did he get this idea and 
what would be the effect? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for her 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only yesterday I was involved in public events. We were 
discussing various subjects of concern to people, who are 
increasingly interested in what happens internationally, whether 
it involves the economy, various subjects or different 
variables. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number expressed the desire to see us on the international 
stage soon, whether it be in the Olympics or other events. It 
was not just the sovereignists saying so. There were federalists 
as well who would like to have Quebec with its own group, its 
own team in certain international competitions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, this is already possible in the Francophonie games. 
But here again, we could have a debate on the selection of 
athletes, how it is done, whether the Canadian or the Quebec 
teams have precedence in the selection of the people taking 
part. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to add one thing that I did not have time to 
develop in my remarks. We have extremely capable athletes. Where 
I come from we have Denise Julien, in badminton, who is a great 
athlete. At the moment, however, Canada sets its own standards 
for athletes going to the Olympic Games. In theory, it wants to 
send the people most likely to be among the best. While 
she is among the top 20 in the world, she may not be able to 
meet the standards Canada sets in order to go to the Olympic 
Games. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the whole business as well of elitism or of the 
visibility that the federal government is aiming for with its 
athletes. These are participatory sports, and our best athletes 
in Quebec and in Canada should be able to go. If Canada does not 
want to send them under its banner, it should let us send them 
under our own.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview—Greenwood, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, it is very important that our listeners and viewers 
today understand that the motion on the floor of the House of 
Commons is essentially about amateur programs in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They would be a little confused if they did not understand that 
currently we have a Canada games system where each and every 
province goes to the games and has its own flag.  That condition 
already exists for the Quebec teams, the Prince Edward Island 
teams and the Ontario teams.  It is called the Canada Games.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important to remind the Bloc Quebecois that there has 
never been a player from the province of Quebec, who put a Team 
Canada jersey on his or her body to represent Canada on the world 
stage, who has said that he or she did not think it was one of 
the greatest experiences in his or her life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not bastardize the great work we have done in the House 
of Commons, as the member from Rimouski has done in talking about 
amateur sport, by trying to bring in the notion of separatism for 
athletes.  There is not an athlete who espouses that theory who 
has put on a Team Canada jersey. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien:</B> Madam Speaker, I cannot help but smile at the 
hon. member's grandstanding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, we have all heard about the Canada Games. We were 
not talking about the Canada Games, but about Quebec having its 
own delegation. Of course, our athletes are in a difficult 
situation and I am not asking them their point of view. However, 
when athletes start wondering if they will have to wear their 
sponsors' trademarks at the next Olympic Games, there is indeed 
a problem with the level of funding for amateur sport and our 
athletes do not feel they are getting the support they need from 
the federal government that is sending them to compete at the 
international level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Private corporations are making up for the lack of funding and 
commitment from the government and soon enough they will have 
our athletes covered with their trademarks from head to toe and 
defending their interests instead of those of the country these 
athletes should be representing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member should reflect upon this and go after his own 
colleagues, who choose to close their eyes or to worry only 
about professional teams, without lifting a finger to help 
amateur sport.  They have not done a single thing to help the 
people in amateur sport. 
<P><A NAME="LINK23"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Coderre (Bourassa, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I find 
it regrettable that members of the Bloc are trying to get some 
credibility at our athletes' expense. Not only that, but we saw 
from their speeches that they do not have the depth, passion and 
credibility of the member for Rimouski—Mitis, whom we miss. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been working on this issue for two years. Contrary to 
those who are trying to score political points because they have 
yet to make a breakthrough in this House, I have met 
individually with each and every Canadian and Quebec federation, and 
when we are able to meet them all together, I challenge those 
members who are trying to score political points to find out who 
those people want as representatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week, I was at the general meeting of the Fédération du 
patinage de vitesse du Québec, which took place at the Auberge 
des Gouverneurs in Sainte-Foy. Some people there told me “Mr. 
Coderre, you don't want to get involved in flag flaps. You 
really work for athletes and we acknowledge the fact that your 
government has already given its support to 53 recommendations 
out of 69”. This is an important point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While some members are trying to make political hay at the 
expense of professional sports, athletes will be judge and jury 
and will understand. The Bloc is taking a position against 
professional sport. One individual, by the name of Lucien 
Bouchard, got involved in the Expos situation. The first thing 
he said was “I will never invest in professional sport. I will 
never invest in Montreal's Expos. This is inhuman. 
This does not make sense”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Several months later, the head office—I am not talking about the 
valets—said “Okay, we will give between $7 million and $8 million a 
year for 20 years”. Not a tax abatement but a direct 
contribution amounting to some $160 million, because the head 
office understood that professional sport is an industry which 
generates revenues of $300 million and represents 35,000 jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will stop talking about professional sport, because they have

</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Témiscamingue mentioned sports fans and open 
lines. However, when there is a serious problem in sport issues, 
do experienced sports columnists, people who gave their life for 
amateur sport or for sports in general, ask themselves “What 
will the Bloc do about it?” People would be more inclined to say: 
“All the Bloc wants is to create winning conditions for a 
new referendum”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People want to talk to the hon. member for Bourassa, to my 
friend, the chairman of the Sub-committee on the Study of Sport 
in Canada, and to my friend, the hon. member for Ottawa—Vanier. 
What does that mean? That means a very precise thing: the Bloc 
tried once again to make some political hay on sports. The hon. 
member for Témiscamingue predicted that the report would die 
after only 48 hours, but we are still talking about it. Then 
the Bloc Quebecois decided to raise the issue of sports in the 
hope of scoring a few points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk about specific and important issues. I will not 
talk about the Bloc, but about amateur sport and especially 
about athletes. It is true that opposition parties did not 
support all of the report. They would have liked to go further 
on some recommendations. However, one thing is certain. Those 
who predicted that the subcommittee's report would be stillborn, 
who today are trying to make some political hay with it, failed 
to grasp one thing, that the subcommittee's report is the first 
one in 30 years to examine the whole future of sports in Canada. 
That is my first point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second point is that the report on sport is the beginning of 
a process. This means it will take some time. This means we will 
be talking about the sport issue. The separatists tried to 
produce a minority report and to throw their venom at us. We 
decided to take a stand on amateur sport. We decided 
to take a stand for athletes, because it is true there are 
problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is because this government followed through with our 
demands that we demonstrated once and for all that we, on this 
side of the House, want to work in the interests of athletes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some things must be done about taxation. Instead of making 
personal attacks, as does the hon. member for Longueuil, who is 
trying to score points because she has not yet made a 
breakthrough in the House, Bloc members should have suggested 
some alternatives. 
In this report, which they have rejected outright, there are things 
that are extremely important; so much so that the finance 
minister decided to follow up by planning consultations 
at prebudget committee level for the next budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While they are trying to wage flag wars to campaign for the 
referendum and to create the winning conditions, we have decided 
to see the associations. Do we think people at Sports 
Québec will fall in love with this gang on the other side? Who 
do they come to talk to when there is a problem and 
when they want not only to send a message but also to find a 
solution? It is not to the gang on the other side. Let us be 
serious. They talk to my colleague, they talk to me, they talk 
to the minister and to the parliamentary secretary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we have proven to be sensitive to this issue, and if we have 
established our credibility and our intellectual honesty, it is 
because we have decided to take a stand on certain issues. We 
heard remarks a while ago about the Canadian Olympic 
Association. I am one of the instigators of the boycott of the 
last movie, which was in English only and produced by 
Americans. Guess what? Not a single senator, not a single 
member of parliament on this side went to see this movie, 
because we all know this is a bilingual country and there is 
problem here that needs to be dealt with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this does not demonstrate our sensitivity and our concern for 
both official languages in amateur sport, I fail to see what 
could do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Secondly, it is obvious that we need to bring forward a new 
approach to our tax system. 
This excellent report presents a blueprint for our society 
to improve the social, economic, political and 
environmental quality of life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This report makes suggestions that cannot all be implemented 
overnight. We have suggested alternatives. We have decided for 
example, to have a tax credit per child for parents with a 
household income of $75,000 and less. These things are 
important, but they have been set aside. The finance minister 
has decided to go ahead with prebudget consultations.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other point, and I think it is important to mention it, is 
that, while they make a fuss in an attempt at flag wars, in an 
attempt to score points because servility is the order of the 
day, we came up with a very important recommendation. This 
recommendation provides for a sports summit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will recall that two years ago there was a health summit. 
What happened with it? In the latest budget, the most important 
item, the cornerstone, was health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, if we create not only a sport summit, but one that is 
chaired by our Prime Minister, there is no better decision 
making than that. Give us time. We will work, we will send a 
positive message and, from that, things will certainly start 
moving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to launch an appeal to the associations, to the 
federations and to the athletes. I do not care what the other 
side may think. What I know, for example, is that people have 
given us this credibility. 
I invite federations and athletes to tell their viewpoint and to 
take an active part, like the president of Sports Québec, 
Jean-Guy Ouellet. I want all federations to be involved in this 
process. It is not a matter of trying to make the referendum the 
cornerstone, as they are doing the other side, but they should 
provide the solutions, approaches and, especially, show us their 
importance in this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can do things together. I have no interest in swapping a 
maple leaf for the fleur de lys on team jerseys. That is of no 
interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what was said last week—and members can check 
it—when the Fédération de patinage de vitesse unanimously gave me 
its support. Its representatives said “Finally, here are 
politicians not involved in the flag flurry, who want to work 
actively for our welfare. 
They want to help athletes. They want to help parents”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I invite all those who are really interested in athletes and 
sports, not 
those interested in making political points at their expense, to 
become fully involved in this process and to work so that 
together we may find a solution that is viable and meaningful, 
because our goal, their goal, is to work for the well-being of 
society. 
<P><A NAME="LINK24"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I hope 
that simply rising in this House will not make the member for 
Bourassa feel persecuted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to remind him that he is the king of 
personal attacks. He has not stopped talking about members of 
the Bloc Quebecois. Maybe he has not heard my speech, so I will 
remind him that I said clearly that the Bloc Quebecois is not 
against professional sport. Far from it. We just want to remind 
the government opposite that it must place amateur sport at the 
heart of its concerns. I too made a little tour, as did the 
member for Bourassa. I know there is determination on the part 
of the athletes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one thing I would like the member for Bourassa to 
explain to us. During the subcommittee hearings on October 29 
the member for Bourassa expressed his indignation. 
Here is what he said “I will ask him (the Commissioner of 
Official Languages) to investigate and make sure that any 
problem of accessibility is settled, whether it has to do with 
documents, translation or services”. 
Can the member for Bourassa tell us if he followed through on 
that commitment made at the subcommittee hearings? He was 
talking about Jean-Guy Ouellet. Can he say a few good words about 
him? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to remind him that the colleague who 
worked with him for a year is from the riding of 
Broadview—Greenwood. It would be good for him to keep that in 
mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Coderre:</B> Madam Speaker, it is extremely easy for me to 
praise someone like Jean-Guy Ouellet, who dedicated his whole 
life to amateur sport and who worked tirelessly including—and 
this is for the information of the member for Longueuil—in 
university volleyball. 
He was also a referee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We discussed these issues. Instead of 
going on tours, I deal with the issue. When we worked together, 
including at the Canadian university volleyball championship, we 
discussed this sort of thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did indeed apply pressure regarding official languages. These 
are issues. However, contrary to members opposite, I looked for 
solutions and alternatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By contrast, what members across the floor decided to do— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Coderre:</B> the poor martyrs opposite are whining. If 
only they listened, it would help them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I have to say is helpful to me also, because it will help 
Canadians see who is serious about this issue. I will simply say 
that yes, we do think there is a language issue here.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, we also think there are all manner of problems, but that is 
no reason to throw the baby out with the bath water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are aware of what they are up to as compared to what we are 
trying to do.  We really want to work toward solutions and solve 
problems.  From the start, they have tried to use personal 
attacks and demagoguery.  They have tried to say that the sport 
millionaires contribute to slush funds.  I do not know what 
funds they are referring to, or which sport millionaires. 
Answers to those questions are needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For us on this side of the House, what is important is to work 
together and to continue the good work.  Of the 69 
recommendations, 53 have been accepted.  Looking at all of the 
parliamentary committees, this was a relatively inexpensive one, 
costing only $15,000, yet it attracted a great many people and 
triggered a public debate. That is what is important to us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some people over there who have been carrying on about 
this, like the hon. member for Témiscamingue, who has been at it 
for some time now, telling us that we do nothing but speak of 
professional sport.  Unlike the people on the other side, I have 
no need to backtrack on what I have said.  Right from the start 
I said that we needed to focus on amateur and professional 
sport, because this is an industry that brings in $9 billion 
and is responsible for 260,000 jobs and 1.1% of the gross 
domestic product. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not going to put our heads in the sand, not like 
Lucien Bouchard.  At one point he said “It is unthinkable that 
we would help the Expos, but, on the other hand, maybe it is a 
good thing because now the federal election is over. So, when it 
comes down to it, we will put in $160 million”.  People will be 
in a position to judge who has the greater credibility in this 
matter. 
<P><A NAME="LINK25"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
usually the member for Bourassa makes me laugh. What he says 
often has to be taken with a grain of salt. Today, however, I do 
not find it funny at all. Amateur sport is a very important 
issue and the member for Bourassa is trying to give the debate a 
type of levity I do not really care for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, things have to be said in all honesty. If the 
member for Bourassa really complained to the official languages 
commissioner—we have checked and it does not seem to be the 
case—then I would ask him to table his letter of complaint. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Coderre:</B> Madam Speaker, it is not the first time that 
I complain. Way back when I talked to the commissioner. If 
the files do not reflect that, that is another matter, but I 
will check. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK26"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I am very pleased to rise to debate this particular topic.  I 
would like to completely change the tone of where we have been. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would first like to recognize the dedication of the member for 
Broadview—Greenwood to this particular topic and commend him for 
having made the effort to bring focus to the issue, which is 
indeed a very important issue here in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member made an intervention earlier and he is correct when 
he states that the report does examine all aspects of sport.  He 
will also recall that as the heritage critic for the Reform Party 
at the time, I chose to boycott the hearings.  Unfortunately, the 
reason I chose to boycott the hearings, has been borne out. I say 
this in all sincerity, but I never believed there was a 
commitment on the part of the Liberal government to do anything 
with the report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report itself is an excellent report.  The work of the 
people involved in generating the report is good.  The 
determination of the member to make this happen was also good. 
Unfortunately, there never was a commitment on the part of the 
heritage minister or on the part of the government to ever do 
anything with the report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the time, I called it the hockey report because I predicted, 
unfortunately correctly, that it would deteriorate into a 
discussion about the NHL and about hockey.  It has deteriorated 
into a worthy discussion about taxes, particularly taxes as 
compared to U.S. jurisdictions. 
Indeed, all Canadians and all businesses are looking for relief 
from the government at some future point in time for at least a 
recognition of how the Canadian tax level puts us at such a 
severe disadvantage against the U.S.

<A HREF="#LINKT25"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I note that the Minister of Industry is going to be proceeding 
with a summit of the mayors and all the people involved with the 
NHL teams in Canada, I believe in the next couple of weeks. 
Certainly that side of the issue has received the high priority 
that I predicted it would receive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been some good suggestions.  Ron Bremner, the 
president of the Calgary Flames, has suggested that there are 
lotteries that relate to the scores that happen in the NHL.  He 
wonders why the NHL cannot get some proceeds from those 
lotteries.  That is worthy of consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I note that when the Edmonton franchise was in deep trouble it 
ended up giving $2 million of concession fees; that is, earnings 
from concession sales in the Northlands Coliseum to the new 
group.  That, by the way, was just fine by me because the 
Edmonton Ice, the junior team that was there at the time, was 
looking for a home.  They ended up in my home in Cranbrook, B.C. 
and are now the Kootenay Ice.  So there was a concession there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things that was not covered, which was because it was 
an all-encompassing report, was that it would have been helpful 
to have noted that the NHL Players' Association also gains great 
revenue with tens of millions of dollars of merchandise sales 
that goes into the players' association pocket.  There is a lot 
of money within the system as it presently sits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also note that the issue of taxation is not just a federal 
taxation issue.  The Molson Centre, as I understand it, is hit 
with a bill of some $12 million annually in municipal taxes. That 
is more than all the other franchises pay in all of the United 
States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, there is the Canadian exchange rate which, of course, 
is another function of how the government continues to mismanage 
the Canadian economy vis-à-vis the U.S. economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point is that this was, unfortunately, all predictable. 
Hockey is a high profile issue.  It is, after all, our Canadian 
sport.  I cannot think of another country where there is as much 
attention paid to any individual sport as there is here in Canada 
as far as ice hockey and the NHL are concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is missed and what is essential in the report is the whole 
issue of a discussion moving toward a commitment by the 
government to coaching programs and to facilities.  I look at the 
Canada Games as being a good thing that the government is 
continuing to carry on.  If the Reform Party was government, we 
would carry on the whole idea of the Canada Games because that is 
where we are involved with facilities, national organizations and 
national coaching programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An unfortunate fact of life and politics is that all these 
things end up leading inexorably toward things like the Olympics 
and very high profile issues like that which again become a 
financial commitment from the government.  There seems to be a 
lack of understanding on the part of the government that it is 
the amateurs and amateur sport that ultimately feed into the 
Olympic program and, for that matter, even into the NHL. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe, and I know my party believes, that it is very 
important for kids to be active in amateur sport.  This is a way 
in which kids can be focused.  This is a way in which we can 
build our society.  This is a very healthy outlet for young 
people today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to re-establish our priorities for amateur sports 
without a doubt and I have indicated the two areas.  Number one, 
because of the high profile of the NHL, we knew that it was going 
to fall off the track and become a hockey report.  Number two, 
because of the high profile of international sports like the 
Olympics, again we end up focusing on events like that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There does not seem to be any recognition of the travel expenses 
or any kind of tax relief for people who are involved in making 
sure that their kids have an opportunity to take part in sports 
or, for that matter, in cultural events.  There is just a total 
lack of recognition, a complete void of any attention to the 
many, many dollars and hours that parents, guardians and team 
adults put into amateur sports.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that respect I agree with the motion of the Bloc.  I agree 
that there has to be more attention.  As I said at the outset, I 
have already commended the member for Broadview—Greenwood for 
having brought forward this report, but where is the commitment 
of the government to the report?  Where is the commitment of the 
government to enact the necessary things that are required in the 
report? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, we may have to re-invent the wheel.  In other 
words, at a time when the government finally gets serious about 
amateur sport, about seeing tax relief and support for parents 
and guardians, and the community, who are attempting to support 
children who are involved in sports or in cultural events, at 
that point, unfortunately, although this report will act as an 
excellent template, an excellent starting point, I would see it 
probably being done all over again.  That is really unfortunate 
considering the amount of hard work that the member and the 
committee put into it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is a compilation of all of us, all of us in the House and 
the people watching this debate; all Canadians.  Part of who we 
are is how we interact with and react to each other.  Amateur 
sport plays a very important part in how we relate to each other. 
It brings us together in good, healthy competition and 
camaraderie around events.  I would commend to the government of 
the day that it take another look at this whole issue and finally 
get serious about enhancing amateur sport in Canada. 
<P><A NAME="LINK27"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, NDP):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I have a very brief question for the Reform member 
for Kootenay—Columbia with respect to tax breaks.  He has talked 
about tax breaks for Canadians.  In the recent federal budget we 
saw a tax break for the very wealthy individuals in this country. 
For example, if a person is making $1 million a year in the 
current fiscal calendar year, he or she will receive a tax break 
of about $8,000 for that million dollars earned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a matter of fact, there are 650 hockey players in the NHL who 
are paid, on average, $1.187 million U.S. per year, which 
translates into about $1.8 million Canadian.  I am wondering 
whether my Reform colleague would agree with the Liberal tax 
break for these very wealthy hockey players who, in this calendar 
year, on the basis of those wages, will receive a $13,000 to 
$14,000 tax break, when in effect those in the middle and lower 
income groups will receive maybe $150.  What does he think about 
that?  Does he support that?  How would he rectify the situation 
if he does not support it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott:</B>  Madam Speaker, that is certainly a very 
thought provoking question.  The reality is that as a percentage 
of their income the people at the high end of the income scale 
receive a significantly smaller proportion as a percentage of 
their income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem that we are faced with and the problem that is an 
immovable object is the fact that if I am playing hockey for the 
Calgary Flames or the Vancouver Canucks or the Toronto Maple 
Leafs, the tax scale against me in Canada is significantly 
greater than it is if I am earning that money in the United 
States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I happen to think that $1.8 million is a grotesque amount of 
money.  I cannot imagine earning that kind of money in the first 
place.  I really seriously question, as do many Canadians, that 
level of income for professional athletes.  Nonetheless, it does 
bring us to the point that the difference in the tax rate for 
people in Canada versus the tax rate for people in the United 
States is a good 10 to 15 percentage points. 
That is too big a difference.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott:</B>  Yes, I do support the tax cuts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If nothing else, the point that has been drawn out is the fact 
that we have to have more of a level playing field between 
ourselves and the United States, which shares our markets and is 
our biggest competitor. 
<P><A NAME="LINK28"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview—Greenwood, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, the member stated in his comments that he boycotted the 
committee.  However, because he spoke today he obviously read the 
report.  He knows that 68 of the 69 recommendations in this 
report dealt with the amateur sport fabric of the country.  He 
knows that 53 of those 69 recommendations were accepted almost 
immediately when the minister announced the response to the 
report three weeks ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the member persist in saying that this report is only 
about hockey?  Why does he not acknowledge the 53 decisions that 
the government supported and that only one of the 69 
recommendations concerned hockey?  The House is about dealing in 
hope.  Why does the member repeatedly say things that he knows 
are not factually correct? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott:</B>  Madam Speaker, very briefly I will say 
exactly what I said in my speech.  Yes, 68 of the 69 
recommendations in the report had nothing to do with the NHL.  My 
prediction was that, unfortunately, this report would end up 
dealing with NHL issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The industry minister is not having a meeting about amateur 
sport with people across Canada.  The industry minister is having 
a high level meeting with mayors and people involved with the 
hockey industry.  The member for Broadview—Greenwood makes my 
point, which is, what was the point of preparing the report if it 
is simply going to receive lip service from the heritage 
minister? 
<P><A NAME="LINK29"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, NDP):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am very pleased to join in the debate this afternoon. 
I support the Bloc motion, which states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, since the government ignored most of the recommendations by 
the Subcommittee on the Study of Sport in Canada, a subcommittee 
of the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage, the House demand 
that the government place amateur athletes at the heart of its 
concerns and make a commitment to placing their interests before 
the interests of professional sport. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to congratulate my colleague, the member for 
Broadview—Greenwood, for having chaired this committee.  I was a 
member of the committee for the last three months.  My colleague 
in the New Democratic Party caucus, the member for Kamloops, 
Thompson and Highland Valleys, sat on the committee on behalf of 
our caucus for a number of months prior to my arrival.  Both the 
member for Broadview—Greenwood and my colleague from Kamloops, 
Thompson and Highland Valleys did a fair amount of work, 
particularly in promoting the growth and development of amateur 
sport in this country.  I wanted to acknowledge that because it 
is very important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a citizen of Canada I have participated in a number of 
amateur sport activities.  I have coached soccer, T-ball, hockey 
and curling, which most members know is a big sport in 
Saskatchewan.  In essence, what I am saying is that athletics and 
amateur sport are very important cultural activities in our 
country.  In particular, amateur sport promotes a very positive 
mental attitude and physical well-being.  It promotes physical 
fitness.  It provides skills in personal achievement and motor 
skill development.  It is a very healthy focus for competition. 
It also teaches young people and adults the very significant 
value of co-operation and working with each other to achieve a 
common goal. 
It provides a sense of belonging and camaraderie.  It enhances 
communication and interpersonal development for our youth.  That 
is why I support initiatives with respect to the amateur sport 
recommendations in this report.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an aside, I want to say that I co-sponsored a bill in the 
House of Commons, which was passed, which made hockey our 
national sport.  The member for Kamloops, Thompson and Highland 
Valleys moved the bill.  I co-sponsored the bill and I am very 
proud of that because it is an indication, in my view, that I 
represent a number of members of parliament in terms of saying 
that sport is a very important activity and a very important 
value in which we all can participate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many positive things in the report that I want to 
briefly touch on because my time is limited.  I support, as does 
the New Democratic Party caucus, a number of issues.  For 
example, we support the Government of Canada undertaking a sports 
facility infrastructure program which would improve and increase 
the number of facilities, in particular in communities that do 
not have adequate facilities.  We support the eligibility for 
charitable tax deductions to be extended to qualified provincial 
and territorial level not for profit sport organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I might add that in Saskatchewan we have gone one step further. 
About 20 years ago we turned over the lottery proceeds for Lotto 
649 and other lottery revenues to the sports organizations in 
Saskatchewan so that they can fund amateur sport, and they do 
that very well.  They are in charge of marketing and selling the 
tickets and gathering the revenue, as well as paying their share 
of the taxes to the provincial and federal governments.  They 
also play a very important role in developing the sports 
organizations in our province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also very supportive—and this is something that I 
personally recommended—of examining the possibility of creating 
a non-refundable tax credit for annual fees that parents pay for 
their children taking coaching, officiating or first aid courses, 
as well as deducting some of their fees for sports, up to about 
$1,000, because it becomes very expensive when there is more than 
one child.  I know people who have three and four children who 
all want to get involved in sports.  That costs money.  How do we 
facilitate these youngsters getting more experience in the sport 
world?  Perhaps we could provide tax deductions for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys 
recommended a millennium sport bond.  He called it a sport bond, 
but the committee enhanced it by calling it the millennium sport 
bond.  This would be a mechanism which would allow individuals in 
this country to invest in bonds, and the revenues and interest 
from those bonds would be shared with the investor and with those 
sports organizations which issue the bonds.  We think that would 
be a good opportunity to broaden financing for the sports world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the New Democratic member on the subcommittee I issued a 
minority report.  I did not agree with all of the recommendations 
because there were some which I felt I was unable to support. For 
example, one of the recommendations was to look at further tax 
considerations for professional sport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take hockey, for example.  There are 650 professional 
hockey players in the NHL.  The average income is $1,187,000 U.S. 
or $1,800,000 Canadian.  That is the average income of the 650 
players.  This is an example of perhaps going the other way in 
terms of expenditures for hockey.  Prior to issuing salaries, the 
owners received money which was for their benefit and that of 
their families.  Now it is being spread out to the hockey players 
and their families.  It has gone the other way in the sense that 
some salaries are $4 million, $5 million and $6 million U.S. per 
year for particular hockey players. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is competition, but it is hurting Canadian hockey teams. 
Our concern with respect to the subcommittee report is that we 
are looking at providing them with additional tax breaks before 
they deal with their own problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, in the Canadian Football League there is a pooling 
arrangement.  All cities pool their revenues and the weaker 
markets are subsidized by the wealthier markets.  For example, 
the Saskatchewan Rough Riders, which play out of Regina, which 
has a population of 200,000, subsidize the Montreal Alouettes, 
the Toronto Argonauts and the B.C. Lions.  We are a small 
community, but we make money in our community with our football 
team and we pool with the bigger communities.  We do not have a 
problem with that.

<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NHL does not do that.  For example, before they sell one 
ticket, the New York Rangers get about $50 million U.S. off the 
top from American Cable Systems Corporation, the company that 
owns them.  That is cash they have to play with in terms of 
paying for expenses and salaries.  That drives up the salaries of 
players like the great Wayne Gretzky and others which is good as 
they deserve to be paid well, but it is a disadvantage for every 
other hockey team market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada it is the same time situation.  The Montreal Canadiens 
pay $11.2 million a year in property taxes.  Should this be a 
responsibility of those provinces and cities that do not have an 
NHL team or should it be the responsibility of the the Montreal 
urban governments?  They are the ones charging the taxes.  If 
they have a problem and the Montreal Canadiens cannot pay the 
taxes, maybe they should reduce their taxes.  I would support 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why should Saskatchewan, Manitoba or the Atlantic provinces 
support additional tax breaks for these franchises when their 
municipalities are jacking them around in terms of high taxes? I 
say let the municipalities address the issue.  The Montreal 
Canadiens pay more in property taxes than 21 U.S. franchises 
combined.  Do we want the Canadian taxpayers to subsidize 
Montreal further?  I and other Canadians think not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a few other issues here.  Should they get tax breaks? In 
the budget the Liberal government which is are so supportive as 
it says of low income people, gave the millionaire hockey players 
on average $14,000 a year in tax cuts. People making $50,000 a 
year got $200 in tax cuts.  What a fair system that is. It is 
unfair and we should look at this situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The subcommittee on sport has made some very positive 
recommendations with regard to amateur sport.  The Liberal 
government has failed to act on those recommendations.  I urge 
the government to revisit those particular recommendations in the 
report, those issues that will support our young people and will 
support the development of amateur sport in this country. Because 
farmers in western Canada are facing a financial disaster, the 
lowest income since the depression, because health care is being 
cut back at the federal level, because our social safety net is 
being butchered by the Liberal government opposite, maybe the 
government should look at those as priorities before it looks at 
the wealthy hockey players and the wealthy owners of the hockey 
teams. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support the motion of the Bloc. I seek unanimous consent to 
make the motion votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  The hon. member seeks 
unanimous consent to make this a votable item.  Is there consent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> No. 
<P><A NAME="LINK30"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview—Greenwood, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I thank the member for Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre for 
his great contribution to the subcommittee.  His insight and his 
own family experience in terms of working with young people and 
bringing that knowledge to the subcommittee were sincerely 
appreciated by all members on all sides. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to go back to the member's comments on the professional 
side of this debate.  We will repeat this many times today. In 
our report there was only one recommendation called the sports 
pact which dealt with the professional sports systems.  It would 
have been very easy for us to say let us forget about the 
professional stuff because it is going to create too much 
controversy and criticism because all Canadians will do is focus 
on the salaries of the multimillionaire players. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important for us to let the House and Canadians know 
the reason we took on that very tough decision of signalling to 
Canadians that we have a problem on the professional side.  The 
NHL alone over a five year period contributes $1.35 billion to 
all levels of government. That money goes into the treasuries. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1350"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT30"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These NHL teams are not being subsidized.  They are sending huge 
sums of the money to the various treasuries in Canada, those of 
the municipal and provincial governments and even the national 
government. Canadians in the end will decide. I think it is very 
important that as we criticize the high salaries of the players, 
we should also be well aware of what the treasuries in Canada are 
receiving from the professional sports industry.  I think $1.35 
billion over five years is a substantial amount. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that our smaller market teams are facing difficulties. 
We know there is a strain because of the exchange rate of the 
dollar and the disadvantage to our tax system.  We did not say 
the government should absolutely deal with tax fairness, but we 
did we have a problem and it is a debate for all Canadians.  When 
we have this debate, let us not refuse to acknowledge the great 
contribution made to the treasuries by the professional teams. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon:</B>  Madam Speaker, the member makes an 
interesting point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is one of the issues I did not raise because I ran out of 
time. I am glad he has raised this point and I can raise it now. 
We obtain revenues from the professional franchises.  However, a 
$120,000 box in a hockey arena costs the taxpayers of Canada 
between $27,000 and $30,000 a year.  That is the amount the 
company gets to write off against its income and that is a loss 
of revenue to the federal treasury.  I do not know what it is 
provincially but we can add another 30% or 40% to that. Tens of 
millions of dollars subsidize the hockey teams now through 
subsidizing the boxes. If a business buys a set of hockey tickets 
at $5,000 or $6,000 a ticket, $10,000 for a few tickets for the 
business and public relations, guess who subsidizes that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not saying it is wrong.  I am just saying we should put the 
facts on the table and make sure that Canadians know how many 
millions of dollars are subsidizing professional sports already 
so we can have a fair debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We did not have an opportunity to obtain that information from 
Revenue Canada.  I hope at some point the minister will table 
that information so we can see exactly how many millions of 
dollars subsidize these hockey teams to the tune of taxpayers' 
loss to tax expenditures. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</B> Madam 
Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I would like some 
clarification about the question that was asked by the member. 
The only member who answered no was not in 
his seat and popped out from behind the curtains like a 
Jack-in-the-box. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> I have to say to the hon. 
member that I heard more than one no. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK31"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to speak in support of the Bloc motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my pleasure to say that I was part of this debate from the 
beginning with respect to the subcommittee that was headed by the 
hon. member for Broadview—Greenwood.  I congratulate him on the 
effort and passion he brought to that subcommittee.  I know the 
work of all the members was appreciated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the subcommittee on sport heard hours of testimony. 
We heard a passionate debate on both sides of the divide.  We 
read hundreds of pages of documents which spoke of the benefits 
of active and well funded amateur sport organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most contentious issue was obvious.  It is the same 
contentious issue which is before the House today, the issue of 
some form of subsidy for professional sport.  Hockey is the sport 
that has been singled out most often, but it is fair to say other 
sports are being jeopardized as well.  Here locally the Ottawa 
Lynx are under a very crucial time period with respect to their 
funding.  The Montreal Expos have experienced problems.  The CFL 
time and time again has been struggling to make budgets and 
payrolls. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to state quite clearly on the record that the Progressive 
Conservative Party supports all of the recommendations with 
respect to amateur sport in Canada.  We are strongly in favour of 
the recommendations that encourage Canadians to engage in a more 
active and healthy lifestyle as well as those that promote the 
idea of ethics in sport, the integration of disabled persons into 
sports and their governing bodies and the support of parents and 
coaches in Canada.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada urgently needs an overall improvement to amateur sport. 
It bears mentioning that if we do not make those recognitions and 
contributions financially there will be a price to pay at the 
other end.  I am talking about the criminal justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was raised in a small community in rural Nova Scotia. I 
participated in amateur sport, rugby, hockey, baseball and most 
sports on the go at high school and at the amateur level.  I was 
constantly reminded by parents and coaches that I would stay out 
of trouble if I hung around ballparks and rinks as opposed to 
standing on a street corner and getting involved with drugs and 
criminal activity.  Those are real facts and challenges faced by 
Canadians, parents and children alike. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer to some of the correspondence I received in regard to 
the issue before the House.  I received a letter from Dal Bryant 
on January 14 which I will quote in part:  “I am a parent of 
three athletes.  My observation however was that unless you were 
very well off, your children would not even be provincially 
competitive and just plain forget the national and international 
levels”.  This comes from a parent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Charles Schafer wrote on January 7:  “Amateur sport is a 
benefit to all communities at the grassroots level. These sports 
and athletes have been underfunded and often ignored by the media 
and politicians alike.  This is where I would like to see my tax 
dollars directed”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The final reference is to the Nova Scotia director of the 
Federation of Canadian Archers.  Eric Mott wrote the following 
words:  “Our national athletes receive zero dollars.  We 
presently have several athletes who are in training at the 
National Archery Centre in Quebec, one of which trains eight 
hours a day and has to pay for her training to represent her 
country internationally. Imagine having to pay to train to 
represent your country”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is obviously not just professional hockey.  It is not just 
any one sport we are talking about in the broader context of this 
debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I state again quite clearly that the Progressive Conservative 
Party does not endorse recommendations that would hand over 
subsidies outright to professional sports. This would be a 
failure to account for the actual overall costs of the subsidies 
and the effects they might have on those franchises. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before the recommendations can be truly debated, there is a need 
for a full and proper examination of the concept of income 
sharing among professional organizations such as the NHL and a 
concrete plan for how any form of subsidy would benefit the 
greater overall community and promote greater community 
involvement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No real assurances have been given from the league, the players, 
the owners, the associations.  Mr. Wayne Gretzky has a bit of 
spare time on his hands now. Perhaps we could get some of his 
wisdom and insight because it is the wisdom of Solomon, and I am 
not talking about the previous speaker, that is required here. 
We need a real debate on how the effects of subsidizing sports 
ahead of important issues like health—

still have half of your time left and you will have the floor 
when we return to debate if you so seek it.

Canadian Navy sailed for France as part of the massive allied 
armada.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Food Inspection Agency has proven itself incapable 
of taking decisive action to protect our health.  When imported 
raspberries poisoned hundreds of Canadians last year, it refused 
to step in to ban the imports because of liability concerns. 
When salmonella tainted alfalfa sprouts poisoned nearly 200 
people, the CFIA backed away from reporting the industry 
responsible.

jobs and stopped conducting annual safety audits of meat 
establishments.

For the sake of seeing whether we really know what a conflict of

the following:  First, a businessman receives a multimillion

subsequently buys a half million dollars worth of land from that

</I></B></P><P align=left>They are prepared to resume these discussions but, if no

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister called the ethics counsellor in January 1996

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion, and of the 
amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  When the debate was interrupted, the 
hon. member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough had the floor. 
He has five minutes remaining for his remarks. 
<P><A NAME="LINK232"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I look forward to finishing my remarks as they 
pertain to the Bloc motion before the House for debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was at a point in my remarks where I was emphasizing the 
importance of recognizing not only the contribution that sports 
make in terms of the effect it has on providing children and 
youth with an activity, but the downside of not putting financial 
resources into that aspect of Canadian culture and the effect it 
will have on the other end.  If there is not sufficient emphasis 
put on activities such as this there is a social cost to pay with 
respect to our criminal justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the report highlights the importance of putting emphasis 
on Canadian sport.  Another aspect that is somewhat intangible 
and somewhat difficult to quantify in terms of how much money 
should go in is the aspect of Canadian culture and the sense of 
pride it gives to Canadians in having competitive sporting teams, 
not only at the professional level but at the amateur level as 
well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also believe that the report, under the guidance of the Chair, 
highlighted the cultural aspect and importance of sport in the 
country to give Canadians a sense of pride and to give them 
something to unify them and cheer for collectively at times of 
international competition, such as the Olympics, and regionally 
at the Canada Games.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a constituent in Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough named 
John Brother MacDonald who has been a fierce competitor, a 
tireless supporter of amateur sport and, later in his years, a 
coach and referee.  He epitomized this concept and this 
psychology that sport makes many contributions at many levels. He 
used to say, sometimes jokingly, “f you cannot be a good sport, 
you can at least be an athletic supporter”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debate taking place today is certainly one of great 
importance.  It should not just be focusing on whether we give 
tax breaks to the NHL.  That is an obvious issue of great 
consternation and it is an issue that will continue to plague the 
national hockey league in the country because of the economic 
issues that surround it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also comes down to priorities.  Do we as a country, 
specifically as a government, decide to allow an industry, which 
professional hockey has become, to be subsidized when we know 
there is a huge surplus in the players' fund that is untouchable 
and untaxable?  We also know there are markets, particularly in 
New York and in Florida, where Canadian hockey clubs cannot be 
competitive, cannot return the revenues and do not have the 
market to accumulate revenues like those teams?  Sadly, we have 
seen, and it has been noted, the loss of teams in Winnipeg and 
Quebec and some of our clubs are currently in jeopardy of moving 
south of the border. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate the Bloc for having the foresight to bring the 
matter forward again.  I would suggest, on the specific issue of 
subsidies for professional teams, that it comes down to one of 
priorities.  Canadians, for the most part, have said quite 
clearly that it is not palatable at this time to offer tax breaks 
when we still have huge problems with unemployment, health care, 
and other sectors of our economy.  It is simply a matter of 
choosing priorities and singling out where the money is most 
needed and will be best received. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I again put forward that the Progressive Conservative Party's 
position is in support of the motion.  I would suggest that we 
have an opportunity here to single out and look separately at the 
issue of professional franchises and their subsidization, but we 
should be encouraging and implementing the other very important 
recommendations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish we had time to expound on one other aspect, that of 
gambling and the huge revenues that are generated both legally 
and illegally.  We know that the provincial and federal 
governments have stepped into this area with respect to 
professional and sometimes amateur sport.  However, I suggest 
there is more we can do in terms of having a return from the 
aspect of gambling that stems from sport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to develop sound fiscal policy that is consistent with 
the development of amateur sport and the preservation of 
professional sport in Canada.  With this in mind, I and the 
Conservative Party support wholeheartedly the motion put forward 
by the Bloc.  I would once more put forward a request for 
unanimous consent to we make this a votable item. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Is there unanimous consent that the 
item be made votable? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  No. 
<P><A NAME="LINK233"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
listened with great interest to what the member had to say.  I 
know he was on the subcommittee and has studied this matter in 
great detail.  I regret to say that although I have had a 
lifelong interest in sports, being actively involved in sports, 
chairing the Ontario Summer Games and things of this type, I am 
not as well informed as he is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot help but notice that the Bloc motion mentions something 
about an emphasis on professionalism as distinct from the support 
of amateurism.  It is my understanding that the federal 
government spends roughly $60 million a year on sports.  I know 
about the seven national sports centres.  I know about the Canada 
Games.  I have been involved with those.  It is a wonderful 
device for bringing on young people and for encouraging sports in 
the regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that a great deal of the money goes directly to our 
international athletes and that they get support of various 
types. 
I also know there are special initiatives for women athletes, for 
athletes with disabilities and for first nations and Inuit 
people.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a question concerning the motion.  Could the member give 
me some idea as someone who was not on the subcommittee how much 
of this expenditure is going to the professional sport mentioned 
in the motion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for his question.  I have always felt that he was a very good 
sport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My understanding of the intent and the spirit of the Bloc motion 
is one of setting a priority between any commitment of fiscal 
responsibility on the part of the government toward professional 
sport coming subsequent to the issue of a firm commitment to 
amateur sport and the development of our programs on an amateur 
level.  That is my reading of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for any concrete dollars or any figures that permanently 
attach, I am afraid I am not familiar with them, even having sat 
as a member of the committee.  The chair of the committee might 
be able to provide that information.  As far as the dollars go, I 
know one figure that was mentioned here.  That was $1.3 billion 
in terms of revenue returned to the economy as a result of the 
contribution of professional sport in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The crux of the matter, as the member is aware, centres around 
the issue of offering some form of subsidy or financial incentive 
to our current franchises.  This is what we are at a sticking 
point on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do we put that priority ahead of the other priorities that were 
set out quite clearly in this report, that we should be putting 
money into amateur sport, the development of Olympic programs, 
the development of community sport and all the very positive 
benefits the member has pointed out which flow from that level of 
sport as opposed to professionalism? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK234"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbinière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to take part in the debate on the motion moved by the member for 
Longueuil. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, since the government ignored most of the recommendations 
by the Sub-Committee on the Study of Sport in Canada, a 
Sub-Committee of the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage, the 
House demand that the government place amateur athletes at the 
heart of its concerns and make a commitment to placing their 
interests before the interests of professional sport. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am delighted at my colleague's initiative because, since the 
report of the Sub-Committee on the Study of Sport in Canada was 
tabled, there has been no initiative from members opposite 
except the April 28 announcement by the Minister of Industry, 
who said he was calling the first meeting of all professional 
sports stakeholders to try to find out the status of hockey club 
franchises and Canadian teams here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the report say?  It says no to any additional funding 
for amateur sport, but yes to any activity that will ensure the 
federal government's visibility, and maybe to professional 
sports demands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take a look at professional sports, particularly the 
hockey millionaires who are doing nothing to help their teams 
survive. 
These millionaires play well one year and gather impressive 
personal statistics and then they completely forget about their 
teammates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can take, for example, the most arrogant of all players, the 
star of Colorado, who hit pay dirt and recently criticized his 
teammates following a defeat. For most of these millionaire 
hockey players, there is no loyalty to their team or to their 
fans, no commitment to the community, except for some rare 
players—and we all remember the unfortunate incident with the 
Ottawa Senators' No. 19. The owners give in to their 
players' every whim. They build huge sportsplexes and then come 
to Ottawa to complain about being broke. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about the wages. In 1970 the earnings of a hockey 
player were four times those of an ordinary worker; in 1980 
they were eight times; in 1990 ten times; and in 1996 38 times 
those of ordinary people. 
No serious business granting these kinds of salaries to its 
employees would stand a chance of surviving. It would be doomed 
to bankruptcy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know what is going on in Pittsburgh. Tampa Bay is short 
$20 million. Most of the handful of Canadian teams, including the 
Sainte-Flanelle, otherwise known as the Montreal Canadiens, are 
losing money.

<A HREF="#LINKT51"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people come to Ottawa to complain about their situation. 
Then we have to listen to the hon. member for Bourassa, who 
buys the principles of this false crusade. In fact, the hon. 
member for Bourassa takes part in numerous radio sports hotlines 
in Montreal and Quebec City, where he only talks about 
professional sports and completely ignores amateur sport. His 
behaviour is unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Coderre:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. I have no 
problem debating ideas in this House, but we have heard too many 
personal attacks and falsehoods since the beginning of this 
debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, it is true that I often talk publicly about professional 
sport, but I always talk about amateur sport as well. I ask the 
member to withdraw his remarks because he said that I only talk 
about professional sport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It seems to me that this is a matter of 
debate and not a point of order, but a representation has 
already been made. The hon. member for Lotbinière may address 
the representation made by the hon. member for Bourassa in his 
remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Odina Desrochers:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think these are points for 
debate, and if the member for Bourassa is uncomfortable with 
what he told sportscasters, it is not my problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few moments ago, the member for Bourassa—and this is true since 
he was in the House—bragged about having met with each of the 
federations, but he forgot to mention that he has also met with 
the majority of hockey club owners in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, the member for Bourassa feels a lot more at home in the 
front rows of professional hockey club arenas than in the front 
rows of those who defend amateur sport. This is understandable 
since two hockey clubs contributed directly to the Liberal Party 
of Canada's election fund in 1996-97: the Calgary Flames 
contributed $4,433, and the Ottawa Senators contributed $6,235. 
And at the Molson Centre— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Coderre:</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish to raise a question of 
privilege. The member for Lotbinière has insinuated that certain 
people contribute to campaign funds and this reflects on me. 
This is a question of honour and I ask that the member withdraw 
what he said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we had to start looking at all the money spent by the Bloc 
Quebecois, we would have plenty to say. I raise the question of 
privilege because it is unacceptable to say things like that. 
They are not only indulging in petty politics at the expense of 
athletes but they do not even know the issues they are talking 
about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I did not hear the remarks attributed to the 
hon. member for Lotbinière. I heard him referring to numbers 
which were not about contributions, election campaigns or 
anything of that kind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Bourassa will have the opportunity, during 
questions and comments, to make clarifications. We can wait 
until then. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Odina Desrochers:</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish to say that it is the 
member for Bourassa himself who made the connection and who 
asked us for evidence. I brought this evidence here this 
afternoon. Two hockey clubs have contributed to the electoral 
fund of his party, the Liberal Party of Canada. I do not 
understand why he does not feel concerned about the situation, 
because he is a member of the Liberal Party of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, let us talk about the Molson Centre, which received half a 
million dollars to put the maple leaf on the ice. This is 
another nice gift from the Minister of Canadian Heritage. Under 
the circumstances, it is really degrading to see how these 
people are defending amateur sport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can imagine the disappointment of the chairman of the 
subcommittee when he saw his report put aside, after having 
worked for weeks and weeks on the issue of amateur sport. 
Unfortunately, the heritage minister did not listen to him.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only thing he has learned is that while the Canadian 
heritage minister was abroad her parliamentary secretary 
tabled, on April 28, 1999, the government response of the report 
and forgot all about the contents of the subcommittee's report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know a lot of members opposite cringe when they are told the 
truth. It rubs them the wrong way. Maybe they will have more to 
say to sports fans tonight, but I do not need these fans to 
speak my mind in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the heritage minister asked the Canadian Olympic 
Association to postpone the announcement of the city that would 
be the Canadian candidate for the Olympic games in 2010 so as 
not to hurt Mr. Charest's chances in the last Quebec election, 
she broke the Olympic charter. And I know what I am talking 
about, having worked with the organizing committee of Quebec 
City for the 2002 Olympic Games. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal Party and the hon. member for Bourassa have become 
experts in political and media manipulation, in propaganda 
campaigns and misinformation every day, every month. They are at 
it again today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I ask for the unanimous consent of the House to 
make the motion of my colleague from Longueuil votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is there unanimous consent to make the 
motion votable? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> No. 
<P><A NAME="LINK235"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Coderre (Bourassa, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am happy to 
see the true face of the Bloc. People will notice that, apart 
from personal attacks, no solution was brought here. Besides 
exchanging the flag of Canada for a fleur de lys, not much was 
said since the beginning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a question to ask based on a quotation. In the Saturday, 
March 13 edition of <I>Le Soleil</I> there was a report entitled 
“Quebec Games, a Flag Flap. Quebec prefers to pay rather than 
accept Ottawa's partnership”. Apparently, the Government of 
Quebec had paid the tidy sum of $200,000 to prevent the federal 
government's presence during the Quebec Games in Trois-Rivières. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was not revealed by a politician but by the games' director 
general, Mr. Réjean Tremblay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These lackeys are playing holier than thou and claiming that 
members on this side are big bad wolves, but from the beginning 
they have been levelling personal attacks against us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the very famous member for Lotbinière—who, 
perhaps this time will know what he is talking about—to 
comment on the statement made by the Jeux du Québec's director 
general, Mr. Réjean Tremblay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does he agree? Is he happy to know that the mother house in 
Quebec City decided to buy off the games in order to keep out 
the maple leaf? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is he in agreement with this decision? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Odina Desrochers:</B> Mr. Speaker, first of 
all, I am not familiar with the memorandum of understanding that 
was in place between Quebec and the Jeux du Québec organizers. 
However, knowing the honesty and objectivity of the Government of 
Quebec, it certainly did not propose a propaganda protocol of 
the type the other party has become a specialist in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A maple festival was held in my riding.  Plessisville had a 
Canada Place tent imposed upon them.  That is propaganda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is a propaganda specialist.  That is all I have 
to say to those on the other side of this House.  They are not 
familiar with the issue.  They do not know what was in the 
memorandum of understanding between Quebec and the Jeux du 
Québec organizers.  Before they rise to speak they ought to get 
their facts straight. 
<P><A NAME="LINK236"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to make a preliminary comment in order to set things straight 
after the speech by the member for Bourassa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of my colleagues have risen to speak, and one of the 
very concrete things suggested to this government was to put 
more money into the various federations.  Some are not getting a 
cent at the present time.  That was even one of the 
recommendations of the subcommittee. If the member for 
Bourassa has amnesia, that is not our problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask a question of my colleague from the greater 
Quebec City region. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1545"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>How did they make the choice of candidate cities for the 
Olympics when some ministers in the Liberal government openly 
supported Vancouver and the supposed staunch defenders of 
Quebec in cabinet remained totally silent?  How did this lack of 
support go over in the Quebec City region? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Coderre:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  I would remind 
this House that the Quebec caucus, yours truly among them, 
supported Quebec's candidacy.  I did so publicly on CHRC. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Once again, I do not believe this is a point 
of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Odina Desrochers:</B> Mr. Speaker, I must say that Quebec City was 
very disappointed. However, given the operating style of the 
government, which does not honour its objectives and which 
meddles in Olympic matters, it was not surprised to lose its 
candidacy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What proved that it would be lost was the intervention by the 
Minister of Canadian Heritage a few days before the ballot 
to prevent the release of the results. This was the definitive 
proof that they already knew Vancouver would be the candidate 
and it was out of fear of losing votes in elections in 
Quebec—Quebecers are very proud—that she hid this information. 
This is the way the government works. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebecers are not fools. They know the government. They accept 
the decision, but they know where the Liberals come from. 
<P><A NAME="LINK237"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles-A. Perron (Rivière-des-Mille-Îles, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
seing the behavior in this House, I am not sure I am pleased to 
rise this afternoon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wanted to speak about the Mills report, which was very well 
done, a job the member should be proud of. However, it was with 
regret that I noted that the Minister of Canadian Heritage 
trashed the recommendations of the report on amateur sport in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, on April 28 the Minister of Canadian Heritage turned 
down all of the recommendations calling for additional money for 
amateur sport. She said yes to every activity that would ensure 
the visibility of the Canadian flag. With the help of the Prime 
Minister, she passed the recommendation concerning professional 
sports on to her friend the Minister of Industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Amateur athletes were horrified. 
I would like to quote at least three statements by athletes and 
by directors of federations on the Mills report and what the 
minister said on April 28. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, here is what John Thresher, head of Athletics Canada, 
said, as reported in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> on April 29, 1999: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the standpoint of G-7 countries, our Canadian athletes are 
second class citizens. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebecer Jean-Luc Brassard raised the following question: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should we perhaps in the future march behind our sponsor's flag? 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>And, finally, here is the most bitter, which comes from Lane 
MacAdam, president of the Canada Games Council: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a black day for amateur sport. It would appear that the 
government has chosen hockey millionaires over the 1.3 million 
poor children who have no access to sports. Amateur sport has 
been cheated.

<A HREF="#LINKT54"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That same day, April 28, the Minister of National Revenue held a 
meeting with the mayors of the cities that have the main 
franchises in professional sport to find ways to help 
professional sport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that meeting, I believe the minister called another meeting, 
scheduled for mid-June, where he will ask mayors and provincial 
officials to provide means such as tax breaks, tax holidays, 
sales tax reductions or others to help NHL teams to the tune of 
at least $10 million. These NHL teams are playing in a small 
market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we are still waiting for a definition of small 
market. Does it apply to cities such as Ottawa, Calgary or 
Edmonton, or does it also include Montreal, Toronto or 
Vancouver, when compared to an American market such as New York? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the six NHL Canadian teams play in small markets, this means 
that the municipal, provincial and federal governments will have 
to provide $60 million annually to these teams, through all 
sorts of schemes. Over a five-year period, we are talking $300 
million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not saying that these teams do not need the money. However, 
the government's priority should be to put money into amateur 
sport, because it is amateur sport that is really suffering in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a few suggestions for the Minister of Industry. 
Before deciding to help professional sport, particularly hockey, 
as he said, the minister should ask himself the following 
question: Do Canadian taxpayers help fund professional hockey 
teams? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They do through tax deductions given to companies for 
entertainment expenses, meal expenses and the purchasing of 
tickets. Such deductions amount to tens of millions of dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before making a decision, the minister should ask himself 
another question: Should he give priority to the funding of 
professional or amateur sport? Personally, I think amateur sport 
should have priority over professional sport, which is 
experiencing serious problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Professional sport should first solve the problems it is facing, 
the first and most serious one being skyrocketing salaries. 
What gets professional clubs into trouble is players' salaries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, on February 16, 1999—not so very long ago—in an address 
to the Canadian Club in Toronto, Mr. Aubut, former president of 
the Quebec Nordiques, said “The worst threat to professional 
sports teams in Canada, and you all know it, is the meteoric 
rise in players' salaries”. 
That is what Mr. Aubut said and I think he is right. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1555"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT55"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other problem plaguing our professional sports is the 
presence of the average spectator at games.  In 1977 the 
average cost of a hockey ticket was $7.89.  In 1994 it had 
jumped to $33.66.  The increase in the consumer price index for 
the same period was 245%, while the price of tickets jumped 
430%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on for hours about the national league's problems. 
Like my Bloc Quebecois colleagues, I think the government's 
first priority should be to fund amateur sport. Our millionaires 
in hockey and other professional sports are truly spoiled. 
According to a Southam News poll, the government should watch 
out because 71% of Canadians are not in favour of using tax 
dollars to help professional teams. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If assistance is provided for hockey, what about other 
professional sports, such as soccer, baseball, and football, 
which all have the same money problems? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, I beg this government to spend money on amateur 
sport rather than professional sport. 
<P><A NAME="LINK238"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mauril Bélanger (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to remind the 
member for Rivière-des-Mille-Îles who just spoke that the motion he 
was supposed to speak to reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That...the House demand that the government place amateur 
athletes at the heart of its concerns and make a commitment to 
placing their interests before the interests of professional 
sport. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member spoke for 10 minutes and he used 85% of his time to 
talk about professional sport. 
He says he is very concerned about amateur sport and he wants 
the government to give priority to amateur sport, which it 
already does. 
As a matter of fact, the $57 million spent yearly by 
the Department of Canadian Heritage on sport in Canada goes 
entirely to amateur sport. Professional sport gets nothing. I do 
not know if he would like our priorities to be geared even more 
towards amateur sport. I personally hope that, in the future, we 
will be able to increase our support for amateur sport, but 
amateur sport already gets 100% of our funding for sport, so 
what more does the member want? How could we give amateur sport 
greater priority? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the hon. member explain the fact that his party has 
expressed its opposition to a recommendation—it is opposed to 
several recommendations, but I am talking about one in 
particular—regarding the creation of a department of sports and 
youth? Since the member himself wants everything to be done to 
help amateur sport, how can he explain the Bloc's position 
against the creation of such a department? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles-A. Perron:</B> Mr. Speaker, first of all, I want to tell 
my hon. colleague on the other side, who will have a seat for 
life since he hails from a Liberal area, in Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If he believes so much in amateur sport, why does he not want 
the Bloc Quebecois motion to be made votable?

sport, but I have always maintained that, before giving one 
penny to professional sport, we should do everything in our 
power to support amateur sport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The chairman of the subcommittee who gave his name to the Mills 
report has done a remarkable job. The section of the report 
relating to amateur sport proposes many solutions to the 
problems, including the creation of a sport department. But what 
good would that do? We had a sport department when the 
Conservatives were in office. Patronage was rampant, as it is 
today. Friends were appointed to head the various federations. 
Things would be the same as they were then.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time with one of my 
colleagues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a pleasure to take a few minutes this afternoon to talk 
about the importance of supporting our athletes in Canada, 
Canada's amateur athletes in particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to take a moment to brag about the Belleville Bulls who 
this year were the champions of the Ontario Hockey League.  They 
had a tremendous showing in the Memorial Cup. I know, Mr. 
Speaker, that they took out the team from your city of Kingston 
very early. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member does not want to go 
out of order in his remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lyle Vanclief:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am just making a valid 
point.  The Belleville Bulls had a very successful year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see the success that amateur athletes bring not only to their 
own team but to the economic activity and the spirit in their 
community.  It takes nothing away from the pride the other 
amateur athletes in the riding of Prince Edward—Hastings and 
across Canada bring to us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to congratulate the member for Broadview—Greenwood and 
his subcommittee for bringing to the attention of all Canadians 
the importance of sport right across our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to take a few minutes to talk about how the Government of 
Canada shows its strong support for amateur sport through a 
number of important programs, particularly through the direct 
funding provided to athletes under the athlete assistance 
program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This program has provided outstanding benefits to Canadian 
athletes for many years.  It clearly demonstrates that the 
Government of Canada has placed athletes at the centre of the 
support structure for amateur sport in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a branch of the Government of Canada, Sport Canada supports 
the achievement of high performance excellence by Canadian 
athletes in international sport.  By doing so it strengthens the 
contribution sport makes to Canadian pride, to Canadian identity 
and to our society in general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the key components of this program is the provision of 
direct financial support to Canada's international calibre 
athletes.  This support is provided through Sport Canada's 
athlete assistance program.  The program was initiated in 1976 
and since that time has provided a focal point for the 
government's support to amateur sport. The support contributes to 
the accomplishments of our athletes who in turn become heroes and 
role models for Canadian youth.  It contributes to the 
strengthening of national pride and unity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The program has evolved over the past 23 years to a point where 
now on an annual basis about 1,200 Canadian athletes, including 
those in such games as the Paralympics are financially supported 
through the program. These athletes represent Canada at 
international competitions on an ongoing basis in over 50 
different sports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1998-99 the government through the athlete assistance program 
provided over $7 million in direct financial support to these 
athletes to assist in their living and training costs.  As well 
it provided over $1 million in tuition support to assist Canadian 
athletes in completing their post-secondary education.

<A HREF="#LINKT57"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main goal of the program is to contribute to improved 
Canadian performances at major international sporting events such 
as the Olympic Games, the Commonwealth Games, the Pan American 
Games, the Paralympic Games and World Championships.  To this end 
the assistance program identifies and supports athletes already 
at or having the potential to be in the top 16 in the world. 
Eligibility for program support is subject to the athletes' 
availability to represent Canada in these major international 
competitions and their participation in national team preparatory 
and annual training programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to providing direct financial support to Canada's 
international calibre athletes, Sports Canada also provides 
financial support to Athletes Can.  This is a program of services 
and leadership which benefits our current and retired national 
team athletes and works with others in the sporting community to 
ensure a fair, responsive support system for all athletes. 
Athletes Can was provided with a contribution of $200,000 in 
1998-99. Similar funding will be provided in 1999-2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of this support contributes toward the creation of role 
models and sports heroes for Canadian youth. Canadians can 
recognize and feel the sense of pride in the accomplishments of 
so many of our athletes.  I could take the time to list a number 
of them but I know other speakers will refer to them, whether 
they be hockey players, track athletes, kayakers, paralympians, 
all of our athletes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are just a few examples of how we support and recognize 
the excellence of our amateur athletes in Canada. The government 
places the interests of amateur athletes at the heart of our 
concern.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the minister for taking part in this debate on our opposition 
motion. It is good to hear a minister talk about amateur and 
professional sport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister talks a lot about the money the federal government 
gives athletes through Sport Canada, but I would like him to 
put that in perspective, considering the fact that the money 
given to athletes by Sport Canada accounts for 8.3% of its total 
budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, is the minister aware of the fact that this is not 
enough? Second, our athletes—and I will not get into the 
technicalities, but they have to be among the top eight in the 
world—receive about $800 a month. Is he aware of the fact that 
athletes are the poorest of the poor in our country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to hear what he has to say on another point. His 
colleague, the member for Bourassa, made an announcement last 
Friday, saying that the government would do the same for amateur 
sport and mass sport and would transfer some of its lands and 
parks to the provinces and municipalities so they would become 
accessible to all those who want to engage in sporting 
activities. This followed on the rumour that the federal government 
wanted to give some land to the Montreal Expos. What does the 
minister think of all that? Does he agree, yes or no? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lyle Vanclief:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for her comments but I think the hon. member needs to get her 
facts straight. I believe if she looks at the contribution from 
the budget she referred to, it is about twice what she referred 
to.  Fifteen per cent of the budget is used to support amateur 
athletes and amateur sport along with a considerable amount of 
indirect support for our athletes in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of us in the House would like to have more money to spend in 
a lot of places.  What we need to do and what we try to do to the 
best of our endeavours is make the best investment we possibly 
can with the money. We are proud of our level of support to 
amateur sport and recognize the importance of it for our 
athletes.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview—Greenwood, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, quite frankly I wish I had a little more than 10 
minutes.  To spend a year of parliamentary life on an issue and 
to summarize it in 10 minutes will be a challenge. I will deal 
with a couple of issues I feel passionately about in terms of my 
commitment to their being implemented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to say to the hon. member for Longueuil, I celebrate her 
initiative in putting this debate on the floor of the House of 
Commons.  I salute again the hon. member for Rimouski—Mitis who 
I know is with us here in spirit. Her contribution throughout the 
whole year and a half as we listened to hundreds of witnesses and 
read hundreds of briefs will be around for a long time in this 
Parliament of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My passionate interest in amateur sport stems from an 
educational background during my formative years in high school. 
I had the privilege and pleasure of going to a Catholic private 
high school in Toronto, St. Michael's College School. The school 
was run by the Basilian Fathers, an order of priests who believed 
that the whole person could not be developed unless sport was an 
integral part of their development. They believed that the key to 
a young person developing academically, spiritually and obviously 
physically was to make sure that sport was an integral part of 
their program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the privilege of knowing men like Father Henry Carr, CSB, 
Father Mat Sheedy, CSB, Father Art Holmes, CSB, Father Brian 
Higgins, CSB, Father Tom Mohan, CSB, Father Jim Enright, CSB, 
Father Cecil Zinger, CSB, Father Norman Fitzpatrick, CSB, and lay 
teachers Jack Fenn, Dan Prendergast and Mike Lavelle, men who 
believed that coaching and working with young people was a 
vocation. These men believed that there was a theology of 
sport. In other words we were not there just to develop the body 
but it was part of developing and maturing the soul as well. That 
is something that has slipped today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard witnesses.  The Coaching Association of Canada told us 
that hundreds of schools across Canada no longer had coaching 
staff to look after their representative teams.  It is almost 
unbelievable in a country like Canada that there are high schools 
without coaches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to get back to pressing the nerve of Canadians that 
developing the fabric of this community and country must have a 
sport component attached to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few years ago Cardinal George Flahiff, CSB wrote a paper on 
the theology of sports.  He gave a lecture in 1955 to a group of 
coach educators.  I only want to read two paragraphs from it but 
it is very important: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The immediate or proximate end of sports, as well as of 
gymnastics, physical education and similar activities, is not 
hard to define; it is the training, development and strengthening 
of the human body from both the static and dynamic points of view 
(i.e., from the point of view of its physiological development 
and from the point of view of its use in action).  But there are 
higher ends, too, towards which all sports must tend if they are 
not to fall short of the function they are meant to fulfil as 
truly human activities. 
The body is not an end in itself; along with the soul, which 
animates it, it makes up the unity that is a human person.  The 
soul has the higher function; it directs the body and, so to 
speak, uses it for the purposes of the human person as a whole. 
As a result, sports and all physical education can serve higher 
and more remote ends than the one mentioned; for, the more 
developed and better trained the body is, the more readily and 
effectively can it be used to further the development, interior 
as well as exterior, of the whole man.  This is to suggest that 
sports have a very real role to play in the perfecting of a human 
person and, common with all human activities, they must have as 
their ultimate aim to bring man closer to God.

</I></B></P><P align=left>That was a quote from Cardinal George Flahiff, CSB, from this 
paper in 1955. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe this is a part of the report that we are not focusing 
on.  When people ask me which recommendation in the report I am 
most committed to, I tell them that it is the recommendation that 
deals with the 1,300,000 young people under 16 who are living in 
poverty and do not have access to organized sports.  That is the 
essence of the report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talk in the House about fiscal priorities.  We have been 
obsessed with the fiscal priorities here over the last eight to 
ten years.  We heard witnesses, doctors with qualifications, who 
came to us from the section of Health Canada that deals with 
physical fitness.  Those doctors told us that if we could 
mobilize, motivate and energize another 10% of Canadians to spend 
half an hour a day on physical fitness, the treasury of Canada 
could save approximately $5 billion a year just in health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we are scratching our head over $60 million to look after 
young kids who do not have access, when we have been told by the 
best in the Government of Canada that if we mobilize Canadians to 
become more physically fit we will save billions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report is not about professional athletes.  It is not about 
sucking up to millionaire hockey players.  The essence of the 
report, the 68 out of 69 recommendations, as we said when we 
tabled it, are like a seamless piece of fabric. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The professional system in the country depends entirely on the 
amateur development system.  We cannot have a good professional 
system if the amateur system is not sound.  I am saying something 
on top of that point.  Forget their commitment.  Only one in 250,000 
young kids becomes a professional athlete.  What we need is a 
society where people have the dignity and the confidence to feel 
that their potential has been fully developed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I go back to my Basilian mentors: the Father David Bauers, the 
Father Ted McLeans, the Henry Carrs, the Tom Mohans and the 
Cardinal Flahiffs who have convinced me that one cannot develop a 
whole person academically and spiritually unless sport is an 
integral part of their life.

tabled 53 of the 69 recommendations in a positive way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the spirit of the Liberal Party and especially the vision 
and spirit of the Prime Minister.  I believe in the not too 
distant future that every single recommendation in the report 
will be implemented in some way, shape or form.  I thank all 
members who worked on the committee for their co-operation.  We

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, first 
of all, I wish to thank my colleague from Broadview—Greenwood. 
I also wish to acknowledge the work he has done throughout the 
entire subcommittee process.  I feel that he has shown his 
interest in, and his passion for, amateur sport and he deserves 
praise for this.  I share some of his points of view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He has a lot to say about the recommendation on professional 
sport.  I would like to point out to him that this 
recommendation, which the government has adopted, is going to 
cost more than $500 million, contrary to the measures on amateur 
sport, for which there is nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some good recommendations on amateur sport, although 
there could be plenty more, but there is nothing new on the 
concrete measures to be undertaken shortly to help our 
athletes involved in amateur sport in Quebec and in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have done a fair amount of research recently and have had many 
contacts with athletes and federations.  I would like him to tell 
us a bit about how we as parliamentarians can help these sports 
federations and associations.  There are a number of problems of 
discrimination, as well as those relating to language, to French, 
and to internal administration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sports Canada does not have control over these associations, yet 
there is a lot of money at Sports Canada. How can 
parliamentarians give a bit of help to these associations and 
these athletes? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have to humbly say 
that we never advocated $500 million to the professional sports 
realm.  That was never part of the deal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our commitment to the developmental part of the amateur sport 
fabric in the country, including the physical fitness component, 
was somewhere in the neighbourhood of $60 million a year for the 
next five years, which was $300 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also put on the table some areas where we thought moneys 
could be generated.  Currently, all the lottery moneys in the 
country, which the then Prime Minister Joe Clark gave away to the 
provinces in 1979 in exchange for support for his leadership, or 
a payoff for his leadership, are going directly to the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe there is an opportunity for getting together with the 
premiers and saying that a portion of those moneys should come 
back into the amateur sport fabric, especially those gaming 
systems where they use the professional sports' logos.  I see 
great hope for that in the future. The Minister of Industry for 
Canada has currently set up a system where all those things are 
being explored. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as interfering with the operations of the amateur 
federations on a day to day basis, I really do not think as 
parliamentarians we should interfere with the way they operate 
other than the fact that I think we should make sure that all of 
the facilities and all the opportunities across the country are 
there in both official languages. 
<P><A NAME="LINK243"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to commend the member for his work on this committee 
and for this report that he has put out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also a very strong advocate for and supporter of amateur 
sports.  In fact, I have spent a good majority of my life 
promoting it and coaching at different levels in high schools 
throughout both the United States and Canada.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one thing I need to be refreshed on, because the report 
was rather lengthy.  I cannot recall whether there were any 
recommendations regarding the funding or the promoting of what I 
used to refer to as good sport, in other words, getting good 
qualified people who are going to run these various programs and 
work with young people to make them understand that there is more 
to this whole episode than just the sporting activity itself, 
that it goes far beyond that.  What recommendations are we 
addressing regarding the qualifications of the providers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we have a coaching 
crisis in the country today.  The Coaching Association of Canada 
appeared in front of our committee and went into fine detail 
about the lack of support for coaching and the need for more 
certified coaches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have appealed to the Minister of Human Resources Development 
Canada.  One of our recommendations was to have the whole area of 
coaching put into human resources development in the same way we 
classify information technology people, the construction industry 
or any other sector of the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that if the private sector through industry and 
government work together to top up some support for properly 
qualified coaches, we could quickly re-invigorate the coaching 
system in Canada.  It seems to me that the teaching realm no 
longer has the same type of commitment to coaching that it had 25 
and 30 years ago. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It is my duty, pursuant to Standing Order 
38, to inform the House that the questions to be raised tonight 
at the time of adjournment are as follows: the hon. member for 
Halifax West, Public Service Pension Plan; the hon. member for 
Winnipeg North Centre, Health. 
<P><A NAME="LINK244"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
the great pleasure of rising today to speak to the motion put 
forward by our 
colleague, the member for Longueuil. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To talk about sports is to take a look at society. At the 
moment, I think that our societies are going through difficult 
times and facing great change and I believe that sports are also 
undergoing considerable upheaval. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sport can at times reflect our society; therefore analyzing 
sports is somewhat like trying to understand where our society 
is headed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like events of today, sports sometimes take us to extremes, 
which makes me think it is difficult to understand the tangents 
and directions intended with certain decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debate today concerns the difference between amateur and 
professional sports. 
We have to look at the values held by the public and society in 
general in order to give priority to sports or set it aside. 
Naturally, there is a difference to be made between the two 
types of sport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier I heard my colleague opposite speaking of the benefits 
of amateur sport, and I think the remarks were excellent. 
Throughout my youth I was involved in sports and competitions. 
Sport becomes a passion and it is good for both physical and 
mental well-being. It promotes a team spirit, a taste for 
challenge, enjoyment of competition and the feeling of 
belonging, sometimes to a region. When we represent our region, 
it is interesting to do and very praiseworthy, but it is also 
interesting for the people of an area, of a region or of a 
country to identify with a sports team. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I sincerely believe that sport has many virtues on a human 
level, but direction is important. I was speaking earlier about 
identification with teams. We need only look at professional 
sport, hockey teams such as the Montreal Canadiens, for example, 
which is part of the Quebec culture, and I would even say 
Canadian culture, because the Canadiens hockey team has made a 
name for itself throughout North America.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said earlier, changes and disruptions in our society lead 
to certain inconsistencies. It is currently the case with sport, 
and this in many respects. I am very interested in anything that 
has to do with the growing gap between the rich and the poor. 
Earlier I said that hockey could be an interesting reflection 
of today's society, and I think it is absolutely true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report of the Subcommittee on the Study of Sport in Canada 
includes some very fine suggestions for amateur sport, but the 
government will take taxpayers' money to invest it in 
professional sport. 
I will not necessarily criticize this decision today, because I 
did not sit on the committee. However, I am convinced that my 
comments reflect the views of a large segment of the public, 
which finds it regrettable that we would now be making such 
decisions in our society. We are not alone. In the United 
States they invest billions of dollars in sport stadiums, while 
cutting funds for education and health care. I happen to believe 
that education is absolutely critical for future generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are aberrations in a society that claims it has to 
tighten its belt. We are investing in sport teams that pay 
incredible salaries to their employees. I will not mention any 
figures, since everyone here is aware of the huge salaries paid 
to professional athletes. I think everybody is familiar with 
this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such a societal issue cannot be resolved in 10 minutes. Still, I 
am concerned and I wonder where it will stop. If this trend 
continues, and it is clear that it will, players' salaries will 
keep going up. I cannot see a cap being put on players' 
salaries because they are currently determined by the market. 
When the market is totally left to its own devices, this can lead 
to some aberrations. I think that professional sport is a prime 
example of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, in spite of all the kind words of the member opposite 
regarding amateur sport, we are still faced with a government 
initiative in support of professional sport. Obviously, I did 
not review all the direct consequences of promoting or not 
promoting professional sport. 
From an economic standpoint, we know that professional sport 
creates jobs, but when we take a look outside the stadium and 
see that our society is getting poorer and we are having to pay 
already ridiculous salaries, I must admit that I am in a 
quandary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier I mentioned education, as did the member opposite. I 
think there can be a very direct link between sports and 
education because very often we learn a sport at school.  This 
has benefits for the body and the mind.  It is good for our 
young people to be able to take part in sports at school, and 
they should be encouraged to try to beat their own records. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier in the debate some members mentioned that it was a 
disgrace that a country such as ours lacked sports trainers. 
This is also a worrisome phenomenon.  I could mention other 
worrisome phenomena, such as the invasion of Nintendo games.  As 
a young boy—and that was not so long ago, no more than 10 
years—it was normal for me to be outside playing hockey.  Today, 
many young people routinely stay cooped up indoors playing 
Nintendo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To sum up, we could study all facets of amateur sport and their 
benefits today, but I think that the initial debate is more 
about the government's decision to invest less in amateur sport 
and more in professional sports.  There is food for thought 
here, more than I can cover in 10 minutes.  However, I am 
pleased to have taken part in the debate.

Speaker, I cannot let the assertion by the member that the 
government has made a commitment to professional sport and not to 
amateur sport stand.  There are ongoing discussions with the 
smaller market teams in Canada which are struggling, but no 
decision has been taken.  If the member would read the sport pact 
section of the report he would see that it is all quid pro quo. 
In other words, not 10 cents would be spent on the professional 
side of things unless there was an equal or proportionate amount 
for the amateur sport fabric in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I say the amateur sport fabric I am not just talking about 
hockey.  We have over 550,000 registered soccer participants, 
boys and girls, in this country.  Even though hockey is our 
national sport and even though we are going to work very hard to 
figure out a way to keep the smaller market teams in Canada, make 
no mistake about it, nothing will be done unless the amateur 
fabric is also on the table.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphan Tremblay:</B> Mr. Speaker, if the government took good 
measures today, if it were in line with the Mills report and 
if money went fairly and justly to amateur sport, I would be 
delighted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this opposition day—which I do not like to call an opposition 
day, but rather a debate day—influences the government opposite 
so that it puts greater emphasis on amateur sport priorities, I 
would be delighted and I would not feel that I have wasted my 
time today.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have a 
quick comment drawn from the hon. member of the government 
benches who just spoke.  He stated the quid pro quo, that there 
would be equal funding for professional and amateur sport. 
Although I am not an expert on this issue, I know a bit about 
sports.  It seems there is a bunch of sportsmen on the government 
benches, but I think they are mostly jugglers.  They are trying 
to juggle truth and fiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely Canadians and parliamentarians would not spend a penny to 
support professional athletes in this country.  They already have 
all of the tax deductions.  They have all of the potential to 
make a profit that any other business in Canada has.  They 
already have all of those breaks.  Surely we would not spend one 
penny, not one penny, to support professional sports in this 
country.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mauril Bélanger (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to put a 
question to the member who has just spoken in order to find out 
how he reconciles his party's position with what he wrote in the 
report we are debating today, in part, the Mills report, as the 
dissenting report, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We recommend and encourage greater study of the issues of 
subsidies to professional sport franchises with a mind to 
ensuring their presence in Canada is balanced with the best 
economic interests of all Canadians. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report was signed by the House leader of his party and 
critic, a member of the subcommittee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does he reconcile his remarks with those of the dissenting 
report prepared by his party? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</B> I rise on a point of order, Mr. Speaker. I 
think that the member for Ottawa—Vanier is a bit confused. He has 
just put a question concerning a comment addressed to the member 
for Lac-Saint-Jean. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1640"></A>

</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Lac-Saint-Jean had time left to complete his 
remarks and to finish his response. Subsequently, if the member 
has intelligent questions to ask, he may do so. However, I invite him 
to follow the debate, because he is not even following it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> This is the questions and comments period. 
The member for South Shore asked a question that was directed 
really toward the government, I believe, and not to the member for 
Lac-Saint-Jean, who made his speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> It was not up to him to answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Afterward, the hon. member for 
Lac-Saint-Jean did not rise, so I recognized the hon. 
parliamentary secretary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is now the turn of the hon. member for Lac-Saint-Jean. If he 
wishes to respond, he has 30 seconds to do so during the period 
for questions and comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphan Tremblay:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am unable to answer the 
question from the member opposite because it was directed at the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
take part in today's debate, and to congratulate my colleague, 
the member for Longueuil, on her initiative for this opposition 
day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also congratulate the member for Rimouski—Mitis for her work on 
the subcommittee, where she contributed a number of rather 
interesting clarifications on the study of sport in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague's motion reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, since the government ignored most of the recommendations 
by the Sub-Committee on the Study of Sport in Canada, a 
Sub-Committee of the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage, the 
House demand that the government place amateur athletes at the 
heart of its concerns and make a commitment to placing their 
interests before the interests of professional sport. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that the most pressing problem of this government's 
present policy on sport is the priorities and the mandate 
adopted by the Department of Canadian Heritage with respect to 
sport.  The priority is to promote national unity, which is a 
propaganda mandate.  We are strongly opposed to using sport to 
promote national unity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sole objective of amateur sport in Canada should be to 
promote excellence, and not to use athletes to serve a political 
ideology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the Minister of Industry will be following up on the 
mandate given him by the Prime Minister to save professional 
hockey in Canada, and calling a meeting in mid-June at which the 
provinces and the municipalities concerned will have to help 
fund sports millionaires, this same Liberal government is 
dismissing out of hand any additional funding for amateur sport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to point out that a few weeks ago I tabled a 
petition in the House signed by over 1,000 people in my riding 
deploring the fact that this government wants to subsidize 
sports millionaires. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear once again that the federal government is choosing 
the rich over the poor.  The federal government is in urgent 
need of re-examining its priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In November 1998 the Subcommittee on the Study of Sport in 
Canada submitted its report to the government.  Most of the 
report's recommendations dealt with the increased support that 
ought to be given to amateur sport, but recommendation No. 36 
proposed that the government invest millions of dollars in 
professional sport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what all members of the public are opposed to. 
When asked, everyone in Canada, and everyone in Quebec calls for 
no more investing millions of dollars in professional sport, 
for no more support to be given to what are termed the 
millionaires of sport.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this government had any gumption it would understand that 
if there is any money to invest it could go into amateur sport, 
to the athletes who are often from poor backgrounds, whose 
parents have had to do without things that would have 
contributed to their well-being in order to support their 
children and encourage their top performance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On April 28, 1999, while the Minister of Canadian Heritage was 
out of the country, her parliamentary secretary tabled the 
government response on her behalf. This government said no to any 
additional funding for amateur sport; yes to activities that will 
enhance the visibility of the federal government, such as the 
holding of a symposium on sport to be chaired by the Prime 
Minister; and probably yes to professional sport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois has always said that the subcommittee on 
sport was nothing but an excuse to support professional sports. 
Once again, the facts seem to bear this out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is considerable consternation in the world of amateur 
sport at this time.  To quote Lane MacAdam, President of the 
Canada Games Council, as reported in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> of April 
29, 1999: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a black day for amateur sport. It would appear that the 
government has chosen hockey millionaires over the 1.3 million 
poor children who have no access to sports. Amateur sport has 
been cheated. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The head of Athletics Canada, John Thresher, said this in the 
<I>Globe and Mail</I> the same day: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Compared to other G-7 countries, our athletes are second class 
citizens. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is what Jean-Luc Brassard had to say, as reported by Pierre 
Bourgault in the May 1, 1999 issue of the <I>Journal de Montréal</I>: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will we have to parade behind our sponsors' flags in the future? 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since they took office in 1993, Liberals have done everything 
except support the development of Canadian amateur sport. They 
have made it a political issue more than ever before. Members 
will certainly remember that the heritage minister asked the 
Canadian Olympic Association to delay the announcement that 
Quebec City had lost its bid to host the 2010 Winter Games. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have reduced their financial support for amateur sport by 
more than 35%. The envelope went from $76 million to $57 
million, including the recent addition of $50 million over 5 
years announced by the heritage minister in 1998. The 
predictable result is that, since 1993, 22 national sports 
associations no longer receive funding from Heritage Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope all those watching understood what I just said. Since 
1993, 22 national sports associations have stopped receiving any 
funding from Heritage Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the Liberals rejected the recommendations made in the 
report of the Sub-committee on the Study of Sport in Canada, 
accepting only those that will not cost anything, that will 
ensure government visibility, or that will allow the funding of 
professional sport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would have a lot more to say about such an important issue, 
but I will conclude by responding to the member for Bourassa, 
who does not seem to understand the concrete proposals made by 
the Bloc Quebecois to support our athletes.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Our recommendations are: to provide adequate funding for the 
INRS-Santé laboratory in Pointe-Claire, which remains without a 
contract for the current year and which may not even get all the 
money pledged for 1998-99; to fund the upgrading of its 
facilities, at a cost of some $500,000; to fund all sport 
associations; to review the criteria used to deliver certificates 
to amateur athletes to promote excellence in Quebec and Canada; 
and, finally, to exclude politics from sport. 
<P><A NAME="LINK249"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the more I read on the issue, the more I am surprised by the 
silence of some Liberal Party members. They may well crow and say 
they invest a lot of money and work for amateur sport, but when 
we examine the figures, we see quite the opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the member if she finds it normal that since Liberals were 
elected in 1993, that is six years ago, money invested in 
amateur sport has dropped from $76 million to $57 million. 
Moreover, our dollar is worth less today than in 1993 and there 
is a huge difference in the amounts invested, almost $20 million 
between 1993 and 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Canadian Heritage may well want to spend $10 
million a year of what she says is new money for five years, but 
we will still be under the amount spent in 1993. Everyone in 
this House claims that amateur sport is important and says we have to 
invest in that area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, the opposite is happening. These budgets were slashed. 
I know that some Liberal members agree with me, namely the 
chairman of the subcommittee which studied the issue and tabled 
a report. I know very well that the chairman who tabled this 
report shares my opinion, but in actual fact nothing is being 
done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Bourassa boasts about working a lot for amateur 
sport. I believe he is actually working much more for 
professional sport. Does the member find it normal that between 
words and reality there is a discrepancy of more than $20 
million? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pauline Picard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my hon. 
colleague from Berthier—Montcalm for his question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No, it is not normal. The cuts to amateur sport mean that the 22 
national organizations I mentioned earlier are subject to a new 
funding framework. They are doomed to oblivion because their 
funding was abolished. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why we maintain that the federal government has once 
again chosen to help the rich instead of the poor. This is also 
why the government must rethink its priorities where amateur 
sport is concerned. It should encourage and support our amateur 
athletes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to give another example. When the issue of propaganda 
was addressed earlier, it was said that out of the $1.3 million 
allocated to arenas, $900,000 was handed to the Corel Centre 
and the Molson Centre to ensure high visibility for the maple 
leaf. This is very upsetting to us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have athletes living in poverty and getting very low wages, 
while the government chooses to subsidize sports millionaires. 
These people earn $3 million to $4 million every year, while our 
athletes, who truly need to be supported and from whom we expect 
excellence, only get between $189 and $800 a month.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. George Proud (Hillsborough, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
will be sharing my time with the hon. member for 
Dufferin—Peel—Wellington—Grey. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a pleasure for me to rise today to speak to this motion. 
I want to congratulate the mover of the motion.  Allow me to 
inform the House of the hard work that the Subcommittee on the 
Study of Sport in Canada has done and to say that I was honoured 
to be a member of that committee.  I also want to talk about the 
government's continued commitment to sport in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This afternoon I would like to emphasize the value of sport in 
Canadian society and to look at the government's role in sport, 
all that we must do as we approach the 21st century and all that 
we have done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Subcommittee on the Study of Sport in Canada put the 
interests of Canadian culture and health on the discussion table. 
It was interesting to deal with policy that affects both health 
and culture.  I do not think there is any other issue that 
connects health issues with cultural issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sport is culture and sport promotes healthy lives.  Sport is the 
point at which the game and fitness merge.  It is where health, 
through increased fitness, meets tradition.  We as Canadians have 
a long tradition of sport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why I consider this subcommittee and its mandate to be 
so important.  We investigated the potential scope of and 
rationale for federal involvement in the promotion of amateur 
sport in Canada and we determined that we must give amateur sport 
a push. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a true appreciation for amateur sport.  I think that is a 
result of being from a maritime province.  In my home province of 
Prince Edward Island sporting events provide a place where we can 
get together socially, catch up on the latest news, tell stories 
and see friends. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the first thing many families do when they relocate 
is to seek out a sports club.  They join these clubs because they 
already know and like the activity and want to socialize with 
others who share common values.  Sport encourages social 
interaction.  It also increases a healthy society, both mentally 
and physically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sport involvement is vital in improving the chances of youth at 
risk.  These young people are not only at risk because of a 
passive health risk posed by an inactive lifestyle, but the 
lifestyle also drives them toward actively destructive or 
self-destructive activities such as substance abuse, anxiety, 
depression and violence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sport and physical activity offer an inherent sense of direction 
as well as a safe and constructive outlet for youth energy.  In 
addition, the regular physical activity which sport provides 
naturally makes young people physically, mentally and emotionally 
healthier.  Ask a friend whose son or daughter is involved in 
amateur sport and more often than not they will tell us that 
their child does not smoke, does well in school, is motivated, is 
energetic and is going to or has already enrolled in some form of 
post-secondary education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting how physical activity is less prevalent today 
than it was 30 or 40 years ago.  It is obvious that as our 
society becomes more technological we as a nation are becoming 
more inactive.  I have often wondered where our inactivity comes 
from.  One possible explanation is that when Canada was formed as 
a nation people had to be active in order to function in their 
daily lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Up until the post-war period people relied much more on manual 
labour to make a living.  Technology has now made it possible for 
us to choose to lead less active lives.  Street hockey has been 
replaced by video games.  The Internet is making us more insular. 
Television is becoming a leisure activity, taking a huge chunk 
out of our recreation time, from 17 to 19 hours a week for 
children between the ages of 2 and 17.  Ironically, much of it is 
spent watching sports events. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we approach the 21st century and information technology, the 
Internet and computers become more common, the tendency of people 
to be inactive will increase.  We will be able to shop from home, 
talk to our friends and play recreational games over phone lines. 
It all points to a more insular and less active society. 
Frankly, this scares me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This sort of inactivity is deadly.  Inactivity is a primary 
factor for cardiac disease, affecting one in five Canadians. 
Often an inactive adult was an inactive child and that is why we 
as a committee recognized the need for continued support for 
amateur sport and for children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obesity is also a result of inactivity, which in turn increases 
the likelihood of stroke, hypertension and diabetes. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1700"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These diseases cost the Canadian health system millions of 
dollars each year.  It has also been proven that girls who 
participate in physical activity will be less susceptible to 
osteoporosis as adults.  According to the Canadian Olympic 
Association, Canadian children are 40% less active than their 
parents were at the same age.  A survey of grade two students 
found that one in four children cannot touch their toes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned earlier, sport is one avenue of achieving a 
physically and mentally healthy population.  Promoting physical 
activity is an investment that increases the well-being of 
Canadians while reducing health care costs.  As the chairman of 
the committee just said a few minutes ago, according to the 
committee's report reducing the number of inactive Canadians by 
just 10% would result in an additional saving of $5 billion in 
health care costs.  There are very clear benefits to increasing 
the number of Canadians actively involved in physical activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How do we increase the number of active Canadians?  We must 
guarantee that sport and fitness are accessible to all Canadians. 
I have spoken on my occasions in my constituency on the value of 
sport and fitness and what it means to be active.  I often refer 
to Canada as having a system of amateur sport that is truly 
accessible, a system where anyone can play as long as he or she 
has the interest and the talent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Increasingly this is not the case.  Our system looks more like 
it did when class distinction determined if one was involved in 
sports.  Some families have children registered in sports 
organizations.  Some families do not.  Some teams have 
sponsorship.  Some teams do not.  The government understands the 
benefit of increased participation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Accessibility is key to increasing the participation of 
Canadians in physical activities.  Our committee recognized this 
and recommended that an incentive for individuals to donate to 
not for profit sports organizations was needed.  We suggested 
that eligibility for charitable tax deductions be given to 
provincial sports organizations.  Imagine if we could give a 
donation to a sport club and receive a tax receipt.  This would 
make it an awful lot easier to donate money.  The donator would 
be happy.  The government would be happy.  Most important, the 
sport club would be happy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Special tax treatment allowing provincial non-profit 
organizations to issue tax receipts is a clever idea.  The 
government has decided that this proposal will be put into 
existing government efforts through a joint government-voluntary 
sector round table process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the committee looked at all the issues facing Canada as a 
whole we found that certain segments of society were 
underrepresented and we recommended that something be done.  In 
January 1998 the Minister of Canadian Heritage announced a 
program called the new funding for sport.  This program would 
inject $10 million per year for three different initiatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One initiative set targets to ensure that underrepresented 
groups have fair access to opportunities to participate in sport. 
A system of accountability has been developed that will track 
funding to ensure that opportunities for underrepresented groups 
are increased.  These groups include aboriginals, women and 
athletes with disabilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has responded so that the playing field will be 
level, so that the values which result from involvement in sport 
are offered to everyone, not just the financially secure, and so 
that all teams young and old have a chance to thrive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another part of guaranteeing this is making sure that coaches 
and volunteers are looked after, that sponsors are given 
incentives so they can fund local amateur sports, and that we 
formally acknowledge the importance of amateur sport as a 
positive influence in the community and the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada will continue its policy and funding 
support of sport in Canada.  For example, Sport Canada has been 
awarded an additional $10 million per year for new funding for 
sport programs as outlined in a red book commitment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our commitment to sport is demonstrated through our annual 
contributions through Sport Canada.  It has been said many times 
today that over $57.8 million in total are allocated for Sport 
Canada contribution programs, $26 million of which are 
contributed to national amateur sports organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we suggested in our committee work, national coaching 
institutes are very much a part of Sports Canada's ongoing 
interest.  A portion of the $2 million in annual support to the 
Coaching Association of Canada goes toward national coaching 
institutes across Canada.  This is not enough but it is what is 
there today and much more is needed.  In 1999-2000 the government 
will spend an additional $3.5 million specifically targeted for 
coaching support as part of the new funding for sport 
initiatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the area of coaching support our objective is to provide 
increased support to high performances coaching and to create new 
full time positions for high performance coaches in order to 
enhance international athlete development and improve athlete 
development programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like coaching, the government is also committed to creating 
competitive venues for amateur athletes.  Canada's amateur sport 
is celebrated when the Canada Games convene. 
The Canada Games with its motto “Unity Through Sport” has been 
a mainstay of the Canadian amateur sport system since its 
inception in Quebec City in 1967.

amateur sports clubs and events within it.  My home province of

amateur sport.  Whether it is junior hockey, sailing, golf,

</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand the value of sport— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I am sorry but the 
hon. member's time has expired.

<P><A NAME="LINK251"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question will be a short one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member seems to have really followed the debate, read 
the report, and followed everything that was said when the 
subcommittee on sport examined the question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like his comment on what Sports Québec said eight years 
ago at the time of the last study. 
What it said was as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only rarely are national associations able to deliver services 
properly in French, whether providing documentation or 
delivering programs.  Moreover, the development of national 
training centres in cities offering little if any services in 
French also constitutes a demotivating factor for a number of 
francophones in the field. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since then we have had many examples of this, including Nagano 
where everything was in English.  French appears not to be used, 
or banished from amateur sport even at fairly high levels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the hon. member has experience and appears to be abreast 
of the issues, I would like to ask him whether he finds it 
acceptable that everything, or practically everything, is in 
English, and that all francophone amateur sports people and all 
the people working in amateur sport are at a disadvantage 
compared to the anglophones. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. George Proud:</B>  Mr. Speaker, Canada is a bilingual 
country.  Anyone can have the sport of choice in the language of 
choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the international scene English is the international 
language.  We did make recommendations that all these sporting 
events be made bilingual. 
<P><A NAME="LINK252"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the Liberal 
member made reference to the fact that only a small proportion of 
Canadians can touch their toes.  I just want to point out to him 
that if God wanted us to touch our toes, He would have put them 
where our knees are.  Then I would be able to do that too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seriously, though, my question has to do with federal support of 
amateur sports.  The greatest contribution the federal government 
can make toward amateur sports is to enable families to have 
enough money left in their pockets to look after the needs of 
their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The way it is right now we are taxed to death at every turn. 
Governments at all three levels spend 50% of our earnings.  After 
we pay for our rent, our transportation, our clothing, our food 
and our utilities, there is no money left. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many families, and I have spoken to some, who would 
like to have their youngsters enrolled in some amateur sports but 
they cannot afford the money.  It costs quite a bit to enrol them 
and to pay for their share of the rental of the facility and so 
on.  Why do we not just simply give families a tax break, leave 
more money in their pockets so that they can do that, and let 
them participate? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The idea of taxing everybody to death and then trying to pick 
out some groups to give grants to is insane.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. George Proud:</B>  Mr. Speaker, many of the recommendations in 
our report deal with tax breaks to individual families.  We all 
know how Reform views amateur sport funding as a waste of money. 
We just have to look at the May 1998 edition of the waste report 
produced by Reform member for St. Albert in which he listed all 
the examples the Reform Party considered to be wasteful 
government spending.  He included the $9,720 grant that our 
government provided to a particular athlete in 1996. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, I believe there has to be more tax breaks for people to get 
their children involved in amateur sport.   We put that in our 
report.  I think we will see it come to fruition in the days to 
come. 
<P><A NAME="LINK253"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Murray Calder (Dufferin—Peel—Wellington—Grey, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to comment on 
the government's response to the recommendations of the 
subcommittee.  I am pleased that the government has taken action 
on over 75% of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member's question implies that athletes are not 
currently at the heart of the concerns of the government. Nothing 
could be further from the truth.  I am pleased to be able to 
speak about the government's commitments to athletes in our new 
funding both to the athletes directly and to the systems which 
support them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to speak about a commitment the government 
made to athletes during the last election campaign.   We promised 
an additional $10 million per year for five years.  We have kept 
that promise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On January 22, 1998, the Minister of Canadian Heritage announced 
the new funding for sports:  $10 million per year starting in the 
1998-99 fiscal year for five years.  At that time the minister 
said that when one of our athletes succeeds on the world stage 
all Canadians from every walk of life and every corner of our 
nation shares in that victory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what this announcement is all about.  Indeed that is 
what Canada is all about.  This announcement was about providing 
additional support to athletes in three areas:  training, 
competition opportunities for athletes, support for coaches of 
athletes and direct assistance to athletes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time the new initiatives would enhance the 
government's efforts related to access and equity for 
traditionally underrepresented groups including women, athletes 
with a disability and aboriginal people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seeing Canadian athletes represent Canada on the world stage 
provides Canadians with a strong sense of national pride. 
Canada's high performance athletes are excellent role models for 
all Canadians, particularly our youth.  Their achievements instil 
pride and inspire youth to pursue excellence in sports and other 
endeavours.  Our athletes also serve as international 
ambassadors, reflecting Canadian values in the world at large. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sports provide Canadian youth with important opportunities for 
personal development as well employment skills through 
specialized training and experiences.  With the new funding for 
sports the federal government's budget for sports is about $60 
million per year.  Of that $8.8 million go directly to athletes, 
$35.4 million to sports organizations and programs, and $15.5 
million to games hostings.  The athletes are at the centre of our 
expenditures whether directly or indirectly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give a few more details about the new funding for sports 
and how it is being used to directly benefit Canada's high 
performance athletes.  In the area of athlete support, the 
purpose of these new funds is to support more high performance 
athletes who are in the developmental stage.  This support is 
important for young developing athletes because of full time 
training on a year round basis which is necessary for athletes to 
be competitive at the international level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before the new funding for sports the number of athletes 
receiving assistance was quite frankly insufficient to ensure 
continued development.  We needed to provide additional support 
to developing athletes and we have done that.  In addition, we 
wanted to support more female athletes and to provide more 
support for athletes with disabilities.

<A HREF="#LINKT71"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our objective with the new funding for sports in this area is to 
provide direct financial support for living and training expenses 
and tuition support for an additional 300 high performance 
athletes each year.  We are providing additional assistance to an 
increased number of senior level national team athletes and an 
increased number of junior and developing athletes and an 
increased number of athletes with a disability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Murray Calder:</B>  I agree with the hon. member behind 
me, it is good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second area of the new funding is coaching.  Access to 
qualified coaches is a key ingredient for athletic success.  In 
the area of coaching support, our objective is to provide 
increased support to high performance coaching and to create new 
full time positions for high performance coaches in order to 
enhance international athlete development and to improve athlete 
development programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An increased number of qualified and full time coaches is widely 
recognized as essential to Canadian athletes achieving their 
potential in international competition.  Also critical to 
achieving this objective is the creation of stable employment 
positions, including adequate compensation and professional 
development opportunities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through the new funding initiative we will increase the number 
of federally funded high performance coaches; increase the number 
of coaches working with athletes with disabilities; supplement 
existing salaries and honoraria for current high performance 
coaches; support professional development and training 
opportunities for coaches; provide apprenticeship and mentoring 
initiatives to increase the number of women in career track 
coaching positions; provide coaching development opportunities 
for aboriginal coaches.  Our overall objective is to double the 
number of high performance coaches currently funded by the 
Government of Canada over the five year period of the new funding 
for sports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third area of investment with the new funding for sports 
relates to increasing access to high performance training and 
competition opportunities.  Access to top calibre international 
competition is necessary for our athletes to achieve their 
objectives in the international competitions, including world 
championships, the Olympics and Paralympic Games.  It is not 
enough to simply train without testing skills and abilities 
against world level competition.  Our objective with this new 
funding is to provide high performance athletes with increased 
access to world class training programs and services and to high 
calibre competitions in order to improve results at world 
championships and the Olympics and Paralympic Games. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Specifically the new funding has provided more opportunities for 
high quality training, improved the training environment through 
the provision of enhanced services for athletes, and provided 
more opportunities for athletes to compete at international 
events.  In addition, the funding has been made available to 
develop programming for aboriginal athletes who have demonstrated 
a high performance potential. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the short term the new initiatives to be undertaken for 
athletes through the new funding for sports should result in 
enhanced performance by athletes at the Olympics and Paralympic 
Games in 2000 and 2002 and at other world championships.  In the 
long term they will also provide much needed support to develop 
top level high performance coaches and nurture the development of 
the next tier of athletes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are very proud of our commitment to high performance athletes 
through our ongoing financial support and in particular the new 
funding for sports.  We are proud of the many young Canadians who 
compete for Canada on the international stage.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I agree 
that sports and amateur sports in particular is very important. 
It is a very essential part of our society and something which 
certainly builds character in our young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one thing I would like some clarification on by the 
hon. member. He spoke quite a bit about investment in high 
performance athletes, high performance coaching, high performance 
training and so forth, about the top level.  While that is 
important, sometimes there is tremendous pressure for our young 
people to always be on top. People have gotten past the stage 
where they can enjoy sports, have fun, relax and build character 
that way.  Sometimes there is so much pressure on young people to 
always be at the top, to be at a high level and of top quality. 
It creates more stress and concern for them than if they could 
just enjoy the sport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member talked about the funding that has been provided and 
the investment being made in our young people.  What form of 
funding or investment is available for families? Perhaps the 
children are in one parent families and they cannot afford the 
latest high quality equipment that would make them look 
professional.  They would like to just go out, have fun and be 
encouraged in sports in that way.  What is the government doing 
in that regard? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Murray Calder:</B>  Mr. Speaker, in my own community I 
have been a Kinsmen dealing with service clubs for 25 years.  We 
have worked with minor sports in our area.  I agree with what the 
member is saying, that sports is to have fun but there are also 
role models in sports.  That is what we see the government 
committing money to right now, the role models on the 
international stage whom we try to emulate in the small sports we 
have fun with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member asked what is available for families.  There are a 
number of initiatives the government is working on right now in 
terms of single wage earner families and so on.  There are tax 
issues where we are working for low income Canadians.  These all 
fit into giving Canadians extra money so they can spend that 
money where they see fit.  If it happens to be sports, then that 
is what they do. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK255"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
earlier today I put a question on budgets to my colleague 
from Drummond. I will put the same question to an hon. member 
of the government party, to see if he thinks the situation is 
normal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the years of drastic cuts, the budget for amateur sports 
was reduced to less than $50 million a year, while the 
government gave more than $20 million to the infamous Canada 
Information Office and about twice the budget of amateur sports 
to propaganda, including the million flags project of the 
Minister of Canadian Heritage. 
During the same period, funds given to amateur sports were 
dangerously reduced. Even with the funds that the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage calls new, the budget for amateur sports 
remains at about $57 million when, in 1993, before the Liberals 
came to power, it was $76 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government member says that the government is very proud of 
our amateur athletes and our coaches when they win medals, but 
the amounts invested and the cuts made since the Liberals came 
to power do not necessarily reflect that pride. Could we not say 
that there is a contradiction between what the Liberals say and 
what they do? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Murray Calder:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member across 
the way talks about contradiction.  Let us go back six years to 
1993 and look at where the finances of the country were at that 
time.  We were running a $42.5 billion deficit.  We had close to 
$600 billion of accumulated public debt.  Our government came in 
and got the financial house of the government back in order.  He 
is right. Cuts were made to amateur sports.  Cuts were made to 
everything to get the government's books back in line.  We have 
done that.

generating surpluses we would start putting the money back in in 
a strategic fashion.  That is exactly what we are doing right 
now.  We are living up to that commitment.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
sharing my time with my hon. colleague from Esquimalt—Juan de 
Fuca. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate the opportunity to respond to this motion which I 
support.  It has a lot of good things in it. I will also comment 
on the Mills report on sport in terms of the positive things and 
of course some negative things that have come out of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I caution all committees, or whomever will be responsible for 
putting these kinds of things together, that we be careful with 
regard to creating another federal department.  It brings in 
another bureaucracy which we have a tough time funding now.  We 
are bureaucracy crazy. Everything is run by bureaucracies.  I 
would really be cautious with this idea of setting up a separate 
federal department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of suggesting a study be done on the feasibility of 
legalized betting on sport, I would suggest we forget the study. 
The Liberal government seems to be study crazy.  It has more 
studies for this and that and committees looking at this and 
that, studies on seniors and sexuality and all these idiotic 
committees. Another one is legalized betting on sport.  Legalized 
betting is not what sport is all about.  Forget the committee. 
Just scrap that whole idea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have spent many years of my life educating and coaching our 
youth.  I recognize the vital role that participation in 
organized sports can play in the upbringing of Canadian children. 
I had many years of experience in coaching both as a professional 
coach in the United States and as a volunteer coach in Canada.  I 
have seen firsthand over and over again the very positive 
contribution of participation in sport by our youth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There can be little doubt in anybody's mind that this is a good 
idea.  To promote sport is an excellent means of preventing crime 
by our young people.  It is an excellent way to provide 
opportunities for those who have the talent to excel in their 
abilities.  One thing in the last member's message I kept hearing 
over and over again was high quality this, high quality that, 
high quality here and high quality there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I always have felt that one major thing in any sporting 
department or purpose was to provide the opportunity for persons 
such as those in grade 1 and grade 6 who had the desire to 
participate but because of where they lived or commitments 
required by their parents for the high cost of equipping them to 
play hockey or to buy a baseball glove it would be totally 
unaffordable.  Over and over again I have seen in my years of 
experience that these kinds of things are not available to 
everybody as they ought to be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I get concerned about seeing $800 million put into a program 
where $100 million of it will be for infrastructure without any 
qualifications of what that really means. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we need is the ability for our young people to have the 
opportunity to participate and be part of a program that teaches 
life skills other than the high quality of skill of a particular 
sport.  The program needs to teach good citizenship and good 
health.  It needs to teach a number of things that will have long 
term benefits for them particularly when they get to an age where 
they can participate in activities in their communities as an 
adult.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was always a firm believer that team competitive sports such 
as hockey, football, basketball and so on were very good. 
However, along with them we need support for sport that will 
provide skills to individuals so that when they become adults and 
part of a family they can participate in other sports that are 
not competitive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having been in the United States and having coached 
professionally, there are some real advantages to having a 
program in place that will provide the avenue to work with young 
people and provide some high quality coaches that will train and 
teach them the best way to deal with particular programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately when I was in the United States the philosophy of 
playing to win and having fun turned out to be winning is not 
everything; it is the only thing.  When that kind of attitude 
begins to exist problems start to develop. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have seen young people in amateur sports who had participated 
in a competition and won a division or zone competition.  After 
their team had participated and worked together to win a 
particular title and had fun doing it, they advanced to the next 
level of competition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is at that point throughout the country where there seems to 
be an attitude that it has to be really competitive.  They pick 
all-stars from other teams within the division instead of using 
the same dozen or twenty young people who managed to make this 
accomplishment.  There is an attitude that exists in Canada that 
we need the all-stars from the other teams.  Consequently the 
young people who helped the team to get to where it was were 
heartbroken and were staying at home while the better players 
went on to higher competition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are the things that are disheartening, the very basic type 
of ideas.  Unfortunately the report fails to get to the heart of 
the matter of what affects young people.  What do we expect of 
our athletes and sport people when they are in schools?  I cannot 
help but think about that terrible tragedy in Littleton, 
Colorado, where two people stated that the targets for their 
activities would be jocks, athletes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember some very stringent rules in some of the schools I 
worked in.  Not only did we do our best to encourage others to 
participate in whatever sport we were in, but for those people 
who were not inclined or did not have the desire to go into 
sport, the athletes in turn would show great respect for their 
desire to go into music, drama or whatever it was.  They had a 
mutual respect for one another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of an attitude that began down in the United States that 
the captain of the football team, a macho sort of athlete, is the 
king-pin of the school, they tend to tread on the other people 
who have other things in their hearts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not address those things in our sporting areas.  One of 
the problems is when we start throwing money without good ideas 
into a project.  Money is not the answer to sports.  Availability 
is, making it possible for all to participate.  That can be 
handled best at the local level in our communities and not by a 
magic bureaucratic department creation, not by a government that 
will look after everybody's best interest.

T-shirts or caps so the young people would look like a uniformed 
group. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are missing the boat when we forget about the spirit of sport 
at that age of young people and start concentrating on pouring 
money in so everyone can excel at great lengths.  That 
acceleration will happen in spite of what goes on. We always felt 
that if we looked after everybody the great ones would come out 
of the crop, but not because of tons of money being spent to see 
it happen and a concentration at that level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage the committee to continue to look at this report.  I 
would like it to involve even more people who could come up with 
some ideas to enhance sport and to provide an opportunity for 
young people.  Sport is a very important part of our lives for 
the development of citizenship, good health and a sense of 
belonging.  Let us not ruin it by creating big bureaucracies 
which are no solution.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
listened very carefully to what the member had to say.  He is 
right.  We should never be in a situation where high performance 
sport is the only objective of the system, the only objective of 
our young people.  I think of sport as having to do with far more 
than simply training the body.  It has to do with training the 
mind and many of the points made by the member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know if the member has looked at that part of the 
government's sports program which deals with the Canada Games.  I 
use the Canada Games as simply one example.  The federal 
government commits $60 million to sports.  We are missing a great 
deal if we forget the volunteer activity which the member 
describes and the activity and roles of the provinces and the 
schools.  This is not the be all and end all of sports in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A part of the budget goes toward supporting the Canada Games. My 
understanding is that 45,000 young people between the ages of 18 
and 22 or 23 have participated in the Canada Games in the last 
few decades.  Hundreds and hundreds of thousands of young people 
have tried out for the Canada Games. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have attended two or three of them and they are far more than 
sports events.  They are festivals at which students from all 
over the country, young athletes of different standards, come 
together and participate.  For some of these athletes it is the 
peak of their sporting career and often the peak of their career 
as young Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada Games which come out of federal funding is part of a 
pyramid.  I was chair of the Ontario Summer Games which is for 
younger athletes.  We had in our community 2,000 to 3,000 young 
people, younger than those in the Canada Games.  Tens of 
thousands tried out for the Ontario Summer Games.  I am sure the 
same applies in Alberta, British Columbia, Quebec and other 
provinces across the country.  Those games were funded in part by 
the provincial governments and lead toward the Canada Games, the 
national festival of sports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Has the member been to any Canada Games?  Is he familiar with 
the sort of festival of sport it is for young people, not simply 
for high performance athletes? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I understand what the 
member is stating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Back in 1983 in my area I had the pleasure of serving on the 
committee which was putting on the Alberta provincial summer 
games.  Two years later we had the Alberta provincial winter 
games. 
A tremendous amount of work and effort went into providing 
opportunity for young people.  There were great celebrations.  It 
was phenomenal.

<A HREF="#LINKT76"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the trials and competitions prior to qualifying to come to 
the provincial festival were every bit as big in the minds and 
hearts of the young people who were trying at the lower level. 
The province and the communities made certain that young people 
were shown some appreciation for their efforts, whatever they 
could be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To go from a provincial level to a national level can only be a 
dream for a lot of young people.  I reiterate the need for 
maximum participation before getting to those levels, or the more 
people involved the better the whole system will be.  I do not 
want to see tons of money targeted for one area without making 
absolutely certain that we cover as much as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am certainly proud of the Canadian amateur games.  I cheer for 
our athletes as loudly as anybody.  It gives me a good feeling 
when one of them achieves.  If we are to talk about amateur 
sport, let us not narrow the scope.  Let us keep it broad and 
available to Canadian children everywhere. 
<P><A NAME="LINK258"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I thank my colleague from Wild Rose for letting me share 
his time with him.  I also congratulate the member for Longueuil 
for her fine intervention today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very important motion.  As an Olympicophile and one 
who had a long time dream of participating in some form but had 
no chance whatsoever of doing so, it is a great pleasure to speak 
to the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From Donavoan Bailey to Norris Bowden, Greg Joy, Sue Holloway, 
Debbie Van Kiekebelt, Kathleen Heddle and so many more, the 
Canadian Olympic amateur athletes and indeed professional and 
other athletes who have worn the Canadian flag so proudly on 
their shoulders have done us proud for many decades.  They have 
embodied the finest elements of being Canadian and in many 
instances have shown us what it is like to be the best of being 
human. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion goes to the heart of something that is very important 
and very dear to Canadians: sport, particularly amateur sport. We 
have seen much excellence and heroism among our Olympic athletes. 
We have also seen them as superb role models for not only the 
young but also the old.  I would argue that the cherished dream 
of Baron Pierre de Coubertin lives on in the hearts of many 
athletes in the country today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many Canadian athletes, particularly those who have competed in 
the Olympics, have succeeded not as a direct result of what we 
have managed to do for them in an organizational capacity but 
what they have managed to do for themselves.  Many amateur 
athletes have lived lives of poverty, indeed below the welfare 
level, in order to compete in a sport that they love and do 
Canada proud. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The root of this debate is how we can improve the situation for 
our amateur athletes.  I would argue there are things we can do. 
We can make sure that money gets directly to the athletes.  The 
money should not be invested in a bloated bureaucracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We invest a sizeable amount of money.  It is understandably 
limited because there are so many priorities. More of the money 
rather than going into bureaucracy must be focused directly on 
the athletes who need it most, on the hard edge of sport in 
Canada; not on the organizational capacity but into the pockets 
of the athletes to enable them to eat, travel and survive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore I would argue that we need to downsize the bureaucracy 
in many amateur athletic sports and focus the funding on 
successful sports.  We currently fund over 70 sports in the 
country, which I would argue is too many. 
We have to make choices.  We need to decide which sports are more 
important for Canada's identity and fund those selectively.

<A HREF="#LINKT77"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not to say that we should ignore the other ones, but 
there are ways of getting funding for them.  For example, when a 
particular sport becomes very successful, then a percentage of 
those funds can be poured into general revenues for sports that 
do not make much money.  Successful sports, such as track and 
field, rowing and sports that generate funds, can be used to pour 
into sports that are less attractive from a funding perspective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can also try to develop some innovative private-public 
partnerships.  We have talked about tax incentives for investment 
from the private sector.  We should consider using an adopt an 
athlete or adopt a sport for the private sector.  The quid pro 
quo is that the particular advertising group can get money from 
advertising at the specific sports venues and generate something 
for them in that way.  Those are the things that can be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to draw to the attention of the House something the 
Canadian Olympic Association has been doing to address a very 
important problem and one that is largely going undiagnosed and 
unrecognized in our society; that is the inactivity among our 
youth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are going to have an important and profound impact on the 
health of Canadians, in particular among the youth, we need to 
make sure that the youth get into healthy practices.  One of the 
healthiest things they can do is engage in a sport.  Sports are 
good for our health.  The earlier we begin engaging in regular 
physical activity, the easier it will be to keep up with that 
physical activity when we are older. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, starting early will give youths good habits that 
will enable them to carry on with healthy sports habits later in 
life.  This will give us a health dividend.  We know that regular 
activity and exercise is healthy for us.  It lowers the risk of 
cardiovascular problems, other health problems and increases 
longevity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Olympic Association has tried to push forward an 
innovative program of using Canadian Olympic athletes as 
ambassadors for sport, using them as role models to push sport 
among youth, not necessarily at a high level but at the 
grassroots. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the federal government chooses to take a leadership role with 
the provinces and is willing to approach the ministries of 
education to work with the Canadian Olympic Association, I think 
that would be a fantastic partnership.  We would be able to use 
these Canadian heroes, who have competed nationally and 
internationally for us, as ambassadors for sport and to really 
have an aggressive campaign to convince our youth that competing 
in sports early on is very important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We not only must convince the youth, but we must convince their 
parents.  I have had many parents come into offices that I have 
worked in as a physician asking that their child be excused from 
physical education.  It is very unfortunate that in many of those 
cases the request was not for good medical grounds, but because 
the child did not want to participate for various reasons.  Sport 
can be made an integral part of people's lives and it is 
important that it be started early. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to address the aspect of professional sports.  Much 
has been said recently about whether we should or should not fund 
professional sports to keep them in the country.  In a word, the 
answer, in my view, is absolutely not.  How can we justify giving 
money to professional sports where people are making millions of 
dollars a year, when we have people on the street who might be 
making $17,000 or $20,000 a year?  How can we justify taking 
their hard earned tax dollars to pay for professional sporting 
groups to stay in the country?  We cannot and we should not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem of professional sports in the country and why they 
are leaving is an indicator of a much larger problem that is 
affecting Canadians from coast to coast.  It is taxes. 
Taxes are driving Canadians, Canadian companies and the best of 
what we have south of the border because the tax structure is so 
skewed.  A family of two makes at least 44% more in the United 
States than they do here. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1750"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT79"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT79"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1750

<A HREF="#LINKT78"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarly, the professional teams in the country are unable to 
compete with those teams south of the border because their taxes 
are high.  The province of Ontario has an 10% entertainment tax 
on tickets for these sports.  In the case of the Corel Centre in 
Ottawa, its property taxes have gone from $1.1 million to a 
proposed $7 million in less than seven years.  That is 
ridiculous.  We also have the only publicly funded and publicly 
owned highway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we need to do is lower taxes not just for professional 
sports but for Canadians from coast to coast. I am glad the 
problem was brought up by the professional sporting groups. It 
shows that not only are they labouring under high tax rates but 
so is the rest of Canada.  They are also having a problem because 
the Canadian dollar is so low. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason the Canadian dollar is so low is because the 
government has put its tail between its legs and lowered the 
Canadian dollar to increase productivity rather than trying to 
deal with the elements of productivity such as taxes, education 
and rules and regulations, amongst others.  It does not address 
that.  It just lowers the value of the Canadian dollar to make 
our exports more competitive.  In the process, however, it 
damages and hurts many Canadian companies that have to deal in 
U.S. dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to sports, Canadian athletes show some of the 
finest examples of what it is to be Canadian.  In the words of 
Lord Alfred Tennyson, in his poem <I>Ulysses</I>, he said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To strive, to seek, to find and not to yield. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the motto of many Canadian athletes.  I think sports are 
something that Canadians are all proud to participate in, to 
honour and to uphold. 
<P><A NAME="LINK259"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my friend in the Reform Party, the member for 
Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, made some good points with respect to 
amateur sports.  He also indicated that professional sports 
franchises should not receive any more tax breaks, but that he 
supports tax breaks for everybody. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a couple of points I want to make.  The municipal 
governments in the country, for example, Ottawa, benefits 
directly as a community from the Ottawa Senators through jobs, 
other taxes, revenues and fees.  It also charges the Ottawa 
Senators about $4.2 million in property taxes, which is now 
burdening the Ottawa Senators and is pressuring them to move out 
of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to these municipal property taxes, which are 
extremely high, does the member think that all of Canada, 
including Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca constituents and those in 
Saskatchewan and Manitoba that have no pro hockey teams, should 
be asked to subsidize the municipality of Ottawa which is a 
charging these pro teams exorbitant taxes and is driving them out 
of the country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does he support the current tax situation for professional 
hockey teams?  Let us look at a company that buys a big box in an 
arena for about $120,000.  The taxpayers now support that box 
purchased by a business to the tune of $27,000 to $30,000 on the 
$120,000 through lost tax expenditures.  Does he support this 
continued multimillion dollar support of pro franchises? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does he agree with his Reform colleague, the member for 
Kootenay—Columbia, who said this morning that he supports the 
tax breaks given to the wealthy hockey players?  There are 650 
NHL hockey players, averaging $1.8 million a year in salaries, 
who have just been given a Liberal tax break in this budget of 
about $14,000 each on average.  Does he agree with that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, the 
whip of the NDP.  He has a load of questions and I will do my 
best to answer as many of them as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In response to his last question, which was the most obvious, I 
most definitely do not agree.  I have absolutely no interest 
whatsoever in supporting tax breaks for people who are making 
millions of dollars.  However, what we do support are across the 
board tax breaks for everybody.  That is the issue here. 
I am glad my colleague brought up this issue.  The problem which 
professional sporting groups are faced with, not only here in 
Ontario but across the country, is the fact that taxes are too 
high.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Ottawa Senators and the Corel Centre pay taxes which exceed 
the revenues of their ticket sales.  They have a 10% selective 
entertainment tax.  Why is the provincial government doing that? 
It is only hurting the ability of these teams to stay in the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a fetish of engaging in taxes, whether we are talking 
about municipal, provincial or federal.  The federal government 
has been offloading its tax burden to lower levels of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All we ask is that the federal government lower taxes across the 
country.  We have seen the success of this being done in other 
parts of the world.  We could look at Britain, we could look at 
northern Europe and we could look at the experience in Alberta, 
where the taxes are much lower and the economy is booming.  That 
is what we need to do federally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank my colleague for pursuing this initiative because it 
will be productive.  Maybe some day the government will listen to 
us.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mauril Bélanger (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of

question, but a comment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would not want to encourage local discord between the city of 
Ottawa and the city of Kanata.  I say to my colleague from 
Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre that it is the city of Kanata which 
receives the property tax.  That is why in the recent outburst of 
enthusiasm the mayor of the city of Ottawa made sure that people 
were corrected.  He was actually chastising them for distancing 
themselves from the Kanata Senators.  Let us make sure we have 
the facts straight on the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I look forward to my hon. 
friend from the government pursuing with his caucus opportunities 
to lower taxes, not only for professional sports but, more 
important, for Canadians from coast to coast.

opposition, to make that a reality.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mauril Bélanger (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened carefully 
throughout the day to the comments from all sides. At some 
points, it was very interesting and relevant, and at others, I 
must unfortunately admit that it was less so. This is the way 
things work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would take this opportunity to correct certain comments and 
errors of fact made during the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am happy to be able to speak to this motion on behalf of my 
colleague, the Minister of Canadian Heritage. 
I am delighted to reaffirm, as this motion indicates, that 
amateur sport is at the heart of the concerns of the Government 
of Canada. The government made a commitment to record its 
concerns and those of its amateur athletes on its list of 
priorities and it fully intends to honour this commitment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am happy to be able to say, contrary to what has been repeated 
so far, that the government will act on more than 75% of the 
recommendations of the parliamentary subcommittee on sport in 
Canada. It is most encouraging to see committee work being given 
such enthusiastic support by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I never tire of discussing the reasons Canadians from coast to 
coast are proud of their country. Amateur sport is one of the 
reasons we are proud to be Canadians. 
We feel nothing but pride when we think of the Olympic and 
Paralympic Games in Nagano, of the Commonwealth Games in Kuala 
Lumpur, of the Arctic Winter Games in Yellowknife and of the 
Pan-American Games to be held very soon in Winnipeg. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also the young 13 year old, Alexandre Despatie, who won 
the gold medal in diving in Kuala Lumpur last year. He is the 
youngest gold medal winner at the Commonwealth Games. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regardless of our preferences—skiing, skating, sailing or 
whatnot—in any sport we can name, there are Canadian champions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has always gathered a team of exceptional athletes, 
regardless of the size of the competition or the place it is 
held.

</I></B></P><P align=left>These committed and dedicated athletes have everything they need 
to compete against the best athletes in the world. They proudly 
walk in the stadium and wave our flag high, as do athletes from 
all over the world incidentally, before the Bloc accuses our 
athletes of excessive national pride as it has, unfortunately, 
been doing all day by accusing everybody of trying to politicize 
the debate. How absurd. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When these athletes enter the stadium, we are walking with them, 
step by step, the Government of Canada included. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know we should not always be criticizing, but I would like to 
take this opportunity to talk about the member for Lac-Saint-Jean, 
who did resist the temptation to politicize the debate. In my 
view, he has managed to pull away from the prattle offered to 
him. Unfortunately, I cannot say the same for others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us get back to the subject. They can also take part 
in exciting and unique competitions, like the Olympics or the 
Paralympics, the Pan-Am Games or the Francophonie Games that will 
be held here in the national capital region in 2001. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every time we see our athletes compete we feel a sense of 
pride. In Canada we have very talented athletes who work hard 
to succeed. They have often proved it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, talent cannot bloom and flourish in a vacuum. 
It has to be developed, fed, supervised and encouraged until it 
reaches the highest level of perfection possible. This is how 
champions are born, and champions reflect well on Canada. They 
are a source of motivation for all Canadians. They need our 
support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sport Canada makes available to athletes a number of tools to 
fully develop their talent and skills, including direct 
financial assistance through the athletes assistance program in 
the form of benefits and living and training allowances; 
support to 38 national sports organizations to set up a high 
performance program; support to 11 multi-sport/multi-service 
organizations such as the Coaching Association of Canada, the 
Canadian Centre for Ethics in Sport, the Canadian Association 
for the Advancement of Women and Sport and Physical Activities; 
support to the hosting of high performance games, selected 
international sports events, and world championships held in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada Games are a key element of the government's direct 
assistance to athletes. 
Since their inception in Quebec in 1967 these games have been 
one of the cornerstones of the Canadian amateur sports system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recognizing the importance of this great sports event in Canada 
we will continue to support it financially and politically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada offers another kind of support to 
Canadian athletes by providing them with further assistance in 
investing in development, competition and training. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have set up a national network of sports centres across 
Canada. These allow our high-performance athletes to aim for and 
reach excellence in an ethical and honest way, in a harassment 
free environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We now find national sport centres from coast to coast, as I 
said earlier, more specifically in Victoria, Vancouver, Calgary, 
Winnipeg, Toronto, Montreal and in the Atlantic region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is also making its mark on the international sport level. 
I am pleased to point out that Canada will host the next world 
conference on women and sport in 2002. This conference will be 
an opportunity to discuss one of our most important priorities 
for the advancement of sport in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consistent with the commitment made by the Prime Minister in the 
red book, the Government of Canada has increased funding for 
high level sport by $50 million over the next five years. In 
this regard, I think we should rectify the statements made by 
the hon. member for Berthier—Montcalm. 
He said the government reduced by about $20 to $30 million, I 
believe, its contribution to amateur sport, starting in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we must not forget to say, if we want to inform people 
properly, is that in that year the budget provided for an 
expenditure of $26 million in connection with the Commonwealth 
Games in Victoria. This is not a recurring expenditure.

agencies and departments. These members should present real 
numbers to people instead of trying to invent, as they did 
earlier today. The reduction in question was in the order of $7 
million, and not around $30 million as they seemed to suggest 
earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All these measures taken by the Canadian government result from 
discussions with the sport community in this country and from a 
national roundtable with athletes, coaches and national sport 
organizations. 
The result of these measures is the following. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada now provides financial assistance for living expenses and 
training to an additional 300 high level athletes so they can 
train to compete at the international level. This 
number includes 100 handicapped athletes and brings the total 
number of subsidized athletes to more than 1,200. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also 
provide funding for 100 full time high level coaching positions 
and have improved opportunities for coaches to attend 
professional development programs. Moreover, those funds allow 
high level athletes to have better access to quality training 
and to compete in an increased number of 
international sporting events. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to mention the fact that this investment in our athletes 
and coaches also includes important measures in support of 
women, native and handicapped athletes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As sport is every Canadian's business, we also encourage the 
private sector to do its part so that amateur sport can flourish 
in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a matter of fact, at the national conference on sport and the 
business sector held last December, co-chaired by the Minister 
of Finance and the Minister of Canadian Heritage, the 
participants came to the same conclusion as the Sub-Committee on 
the Study of Sport in Canada: it is essential to strengthen the 
relationship between sport and the business sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to take this opportunity to thank the chairman of the 
subcommittee, the member for Broadview—Greenwood, as well as all 
other members of the subcommittee for their thorough study of 
this issue, which helped to identify various measures that can be 
taken to support Canadian athletes. The subcommittee encouraged 
Canadians to focus more on the impact of sport on our economy, 
our culture, our national identity, our health, and rightly so. 
It also highlighted the need for the Canadian government to 
support amateur sport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In its report the subcommittee insisted on the benefits of 
sport to our health and to young people at risk, as well as on 
the crucial role that sport must play in the development of 
native communities in Canada. I am proud to say once again that 
the government will follow up on 53 of the 69 recommendations 
contained in the subcommittee report, or 75%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of these recommendations can already be implemented. For 
example, the authors of the report expressed concern about the 
fact that women, handicapped and native athletes are 
marginalized. This is the kind of concern that influenced the 
development of the sport funding and accountability framework in 
1995. We are presently looking at ways to strengthen the 
accountability system so as to promote increased participation 
by Canadian athletes from underrepresented groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the latest meeting of the national centres co-ordinating 
committee there were discussions about minimum requirements 
with regard to women, handicapped athletes, athletes who do not 
have access to the centres, as well as official languages. These 
requirements will be included in the accountability agreements 
with the centres. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of official languages, since the question was 
raised a few times, I would like to mention two very important 
points. In 1997 Sport Canada established, as a prerequisite for 
any contribution to national sport organizations, an 
accountability contract to be phased in between 1998 and 2001 
which states the official languages requirements for national 
sport organizations. It requires, for example, an active offer 
of services in the preferred language of the applicant, 
including telephone services, the publication in both languages 
of all official and technical documents, policies and 
procedures, such as selection and appeal procedures, and the 
provision of bilingual services at all national and 
international events.

<A HREF="#LINKT82"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On that same point, I would also like to mention the Canada 
Games agreement which includes a complete section on official 
languages, covering all obligations of the host society in the 
area of official languages before, during and after the games. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It mentions all the policy obligations and more. The 1997 Canada 
Games, held in Brandon, were recognized by the Commissioner of 
Official Languages for the excellent services provided in both 
official languages during the games. I thought is was important 
to mention this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must recognize that there are difficulties and problems, but 
there is also a will to correct them, to become better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thanks to Sport Canada, we will take a number of steps in 
response to the recommendations in the report. For example, we 
will continue to fund the Aboriginal Sport Circle as we have 
done since 1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will also continue to work with our provincial and 
territorial counterparts to put in place a funding environment 
for the North American Indigenous Games. We will try to 
establish governmental partnerships in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sport Canada will examine the issue and make recommendations on 
the basis of the legislation governing the Canadian government's 
commitment to sports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will again look at the Fitness and Amateur Sport Act to 
determine its appropriateness for the next century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to add that the government's responsibility to 
favour, promote and further sport in Canada is provided by the 
legislation constituting the Department of Canadian Heritage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Very soon we will start planning a millennium conference on 
sport to be held during the first quarter of 2001. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such an important symposium will necessitate the creation of 
partnerships with provincial and territorial governments, 
amateur sport organizations, athletes, coaches, the media and, 
naturally, the Canadian government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hopefully participants will be able to determine the evolution 
of sport in the next century, the influence it can have on 
society and the changes it can bring about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are examples of measures the government intends to take to 
promote amateur sport and implement the report of the 
subcommittee on sport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, even before tabling the report we clearly indicated 
that sport was at the top of our priority list. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government has clearly shown, when it comes to supporting 
athletes and trainers, that it does the best where it is 
important to act. I remind my colleagues of the $10 million a 
year increase made to the sport budget for the next five years. 
As soon as we succeeded in eliminating the deficit that was one 
of the first envelopes that was increased. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will be happy to learn also that at the same time we 
promised to increase the Canada Council's budget, and that was 
done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consequently, it is not true that we have ignored most of the 
recommendations in the subcommittee report, as certain members 
across the way are saying, because we have acted on 75% of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's decision to act on three-quarters of the 
subcommittee's recommendations is consistent with the efforts it 
has made until now to ensure that amateur sport plays an 
important part in Canada. 
<P><A NAME="LINK262"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
many questions for the parliamentary secretary, who is praising 
the minister's response and is proudly saying that the 
government will support 53 of the 69 recommendations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like him to remind us how much the recommendations 
the minister agreed to implement will cost compared to the 
recommendation on professional sport. I would like him to tell 
us about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like him to tell us what he knows about sport 
federations and associations. There are obvious and dangerous 
problems for athletes; discrimination and language problems, as 
well as coaching problems. Sport Canada has no training or 
incentive program to encourage coaches to speak French so that 
our athletes could at least understand what their coaches were 
saying.

<A HREF="#LINKT83"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the government intend to do in that regard? As far as 
the minister is concerned, in any case, it will be nothing at 
all. I would like to hear what the parliamentary secretary has 
to say about that. He says that all is fine and dandy in amateur 
sports and that the government believes in it, so much so that 
22 sport federations no longer receive subsidies from the 
government. How can he explain that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For my last question, it seems that the federal government is 
considering giving the Montreal Expos a piece of land in 
downtown Montreal for the sum of $1. 
How can the parliamentary secretary justify this? Would he 
consider giving a similar piece of land or the same kind of help 
to amateur sport that would indeed be interested in such a large 
piece of land for such a modest sum? Is this conceivable for the 
parliamentary secretary? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mauril Bélanger:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to come back to 
one of the comments I made earlier following the speech of 
another member. I was mentioning that most of his speech dealt 
with professional sport, while the Bloc's resolution deals with 
the importance of placing the interests of amateur sport before 
the interests of professional sport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I might point out to the member for Longueuil that this is 
precisely what I have done in my presentation. I have placed the 
interests of amateur sport well before those of professional 
sport, because Sports Canada looks after amateur sport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to remind the member of what I said earlier about 
funding. The whole envelope of Sports Canada is used for amateur 
sport. I hope that the member will acknowledge that. Sports 
Canada does not support professional sport and I do hope the 
member recognizes that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the coaching program, I found the suggestion made by the 
member for Longueuil interesting. She suggests we include an 
official language aspect in training programs or training 
support programs for coaches. I will remember that suggestion. 
It will be not only my duty but also my pleasure to pass it on 
to the minister and other people involved in Sports Canada and, 
if need be, improve the training program. We remain open to such 
suggestions, as we have been in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will leave the professional sport issue to others, in this 
case the Minister of Industry, since his department is 
responsible for professional sport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must underline, as others have done today, that no decision 
has really been taken on the issue of support for professional 
sport. 
I must admit that the debate will certainly be vigorous, 
depending on what is recommended, because public opinion is 
quite divided on the issue. Up to now everyone has an opinion, 
even those voters who have called me. People may not all have 
the same opinion, but everyone has one. So the debate promises 
to be interesting and I would be remiss if I did not leave it to 
those who should be dealing with it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened intently to the hon. member for 
Ottawa—Vanier talk about amateur sport.  He spoke about amateur 
sport throughout most of his dissertation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only conclusion one can draw from this is that here we have 
another Liberal example of words rather than action.  We hear 
nothing but words from the government opposite when it comes to 
supporting a number of very key sectors in the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to the farmers of Saskatchewan who are undergoing 
the worst agricultural period economically since the Depression, 
the government talks about helping them, but it does not help 
them financially.  It is all words and no action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hear around the country about all the problems with health 
care.  When $6 billion is cut back every year for five years, 
some $30 billion, and most of that from health care in terms of 
its responsibility, that is an action I think Canadians can 
relate to very well.  It has taken a very bad action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today in the House we are talking about amateur sport and the 
lack of support by the government, the lack of action in response 
to the Mills report on amateur sport in Canada.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Ottawa—Vanier referred to the Kanata Senators. 
All of a sudden they are the Kanata Senators when it is a tax 
issue.  The Ottawa region charges the Ottawa Senators $4.2 
million in property taxes and Montreal charges the Montreal 
Canadiens $11.2 million a year in property taxes.  The $11.2 
million is more than what all of the 21 U.S. based hockey teams 
pay collectively in property taxes.  Even with the exchange rate 
it is more.  We have a very serious municipal tax problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Ottawa—Vanier has disowned the Ottawa Senators 
and has called them the Kanata Senators.  Can he elaborate on the 
support the taxpayers of this country and the Liberal government 
are giving professional sports franchises now? Would he tell us 
how much it has cost us to give each of the 650 pro hockey 
players in this country a $14,000 to $15,000 a year tax cut in 
this year's budget?  How much is that costing taxpayers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How much is it costing taxpayers to subsidize the purchase of 
seasons tickets for all these pro sports franchises? For example, 
a sports box in the arena for the Ottawa Senators may cost 
$100,000 to $120,000.  We are providing for the business that 
buys a box a tax subsidy of between $23,000 and $30,000 a year 
depending on the price of the box.  In addition to the seasons 
tickets bought by businesses, how much are we subsidizing wealthy 
franchise owners, wealthy hockey players and players of other 
sports such as basketball players through the actions of the 
Liberal government? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does he support the rollback of these exorbitant property taxes 
by the municipalities which benefit directly? Ottawa receives the 
benefits of tourism, jobs and all the economic activity that 
happens as a result of the Ottawa Senators being here.  I like 
the Ottawa Senators.  It is one of my favourite teams and I think 
it should do very well, but should all the taxpayers in this 
country continue to subsidize the municipalities that benefit 
from the property tax revenues? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mauril Bélanger:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will try in the short 
time left to respond to some of the hon. member's comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be curious to know if the member voted for or against 
budgets where the deductibility of some of the expenses he 
referred to, be they boxes or tickets and so forth, was reduced 
by this government.  I am saddened to hear him say that he voted 
against that.  If he were consistent then he would have supported 
these measures in the budgets we have introduced.  On that basis 
alone, his question and his reaction to that are rather 
inconsistent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the matter of the Kanata Senators, I did mention that it was 
a quote from the mayor of Ottawa over which I am presumably 
getting into deep doo-doo right now.  In defence of the mayor of 
Ottawa who said that, it was in jest in front of a crowd of about 
1,000 people and was presented that way. Incidentally I thought 
it was a rather good way of instituting a debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, some comments have been made as to how far we go down 
that road and we are not going to go alone.  The local 
municipalities, the players, the teams and so forth would have to 
be part of the package, if ever there were a package, but that is 
neither nor there. I wanted to make sure my friend, the mayor of 
the city of Ottawa would still be speaking with me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the matter of amateur sports, I have to remark on recent 
years. I am not from western Canada but the member is.  I hope he 
appreciates the money the taxpayers of the country put into the 
Commonwealth Games in Victoria and the Olympic Games in Calgary 
and the money they are putting into the Pan Am Games in Manitoba 
coming up this summer and the myriad other events, international 
competitions and so forth.  That is part and parcel of the 
contribution of Sports Canada to amateur athletes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, we do concrete things.  I have highlighted three of them in 
the member's part of the country and we are happy that they were 
all successful.  We wish the best of luck to the Pan Am Games in 
Manitoba.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to take part in this debate. As a trained 
recreation specialist who worked at the municipal level for 15 
years, I am happy to see that the mover of the motion is a woman, 
namely the member for Longueuil. Too often in the past when open 
line shows dealt with sports it was mostly men who were 
interested in the topic.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am happy that it is a woman who 
introduced the motion. The member for Drummond, with whom I sit 
on the Standing Committee on Health, also took part in the 
debate. I ask the following question: Why should we be involved 
in sports and physical activities? In my view, first and foremost 
for health reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provinces, the municipalities and also the federal 
government have a role to play in amateur sports. Decisions to 
compete in the Olympic Games or other international games are 
made at the federal level. 
It is too bad for Quebecers, because we would like to decide for 
ourselves, but in the present situation the federal government 
does it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the present federal Liberal government really looking after 
our athletes? When we look at numbers we have to say no it is 
not. It made many cuts and I have countless examples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two weeks ago I attended the Canadian handball championship at 
Laval University. There were women's teams and men's teams. 
There were also community teams. Quebecers are particularly good 
at this sport. I spent part of the weekend there. I was supposed 
to be there only one day, but I went back the next day 
because of the high level of competition. The performances 
were outstanding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I talked to the athletes and coaches. They told me how the 
competition had been funded. Guess how much money the federal 
government put into those Canadian championships. Not a penny. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Quebec government, through various departments and health 
and education programs, and with help from the Université Laval, 
some Bloc members and a bit of publicity, finally managed to 
hold this Canadian handball competition. It is an absolute 
disgrace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could also talk about a third of the sports organizations, 22 
out of 60, that cannot perform at the international level 
because of a lack of funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the recommendations of the subcommittee on amateur sport 
was that at least $100,000 a year be allocated to every 
association. 
What would that mean? It would mean an office, one regular 
employee, a knowledgeable professional in that sport who would 
be able to advise coaches and support volunteers. The proposal 
was turned down. It would have cost $2.2 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Ottawa—Vanier, who told us that everything is 
fine, should take a look at this problem. When we have a third 
of all sports associations doomed to closing down because the 
federal government has decided to drop its support and the hon. 
member tells us that everything is fine, is this not 
extraordinary? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not have much time left— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mauril Bélanger:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the hon. member wants to put words in my mouth, he could at 
least quote me correctly. I have never said that everything is 
fine and I challenge him to find the passage in <I>Hansard</I> where I 
have said so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> This is obviously a point of debate. I know 
we have different views about the things that are said in this 
House, but this is not a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé:</B> Mr. Speaker, I understand why the member for 
Ottawa—Vanier would be annoyed when such things are said to him. 
With a third of the associations threatened, he has every reason 
to react. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I will read the text of the motion brought forward 
by the member for Longueuil. It reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, since the government ignored most of the recommendations 
by the Sub-Committee on the Study of Sport in Canada, a

heart of its concerns and make a commitment to placing their 
interests before the interests of professional sport.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>PUBLIC SERVICE PENSION PLAN 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK267"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
Liberal government's grab of the pension surplus was not only 
offensive but pathetic and embarrassing.  The pension belongs to 
Canadian forces troops, public sector workers, the RCMP and 
others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government decided that cooking its own books was 
important enough to loot its employees' pension funds.  This fund 
belongs to the members of the plan.  Any surplus should be used 
for the benefit of the members and others affiliated with the 
plan such as retirees and widows. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some 670,000 members of the pension plan are affected.  The 
allocation of any surplus should address the contributions of 
those over half million Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the employees' pension benefits act a principle was 
established that surpluses do not belong to anyone and that 
allocation of surpluses need to be approved by a two-thirds 
majority of the plan members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One legitimate reason exists.  What reason exists to 
differentiate between a noble action and the simple cash grab we 
have seen by the Liberal government?  What reason would the 
government have for not using the surplus to improve the benefits 
accruing to the members of the plan who created that surplus? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me as if the Liberal government has made a political 
decision to set a precedent for pension plan comptrollers to take 
the money and run.  The government tried to use cheap political 
game playing to make it look as if the outcry against this near 
larceny was from a small fringe of one union.  That cheap 
political trick was nonsense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An advertisement placed in the Ottawa <I>Citizen</I> against this 
cash grab was signed by many, including Canadian Military College 
Faculty Association, Council of Graphic Artists, Canadian 
Merchant Service Guild, and the list goes on and on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However the government wants to grab the money, put it in its 
coffers and say that it has wrestled down the debt, but it will 
have done so on the backs of those who need the plan, those who 
have contributed and worked hard.  It will be done in the same 
way the EI fund was grabbed and taken away from those who are 
unemployed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We realize over 670,000 members of the plan are affected. The 
allocation of the surplus needs to address the contribution of 
these members who have contributed to the plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We often hear the government say that the taxpayer owns this 
money and that it is the taxpayer it must protect.  The people 
who contributed to the plan are also taxpayers.  We must look at 
their benefits and their rights.  This is a democratic principle. 
People should have the right to say what they feel should be done 
with the surpluses in their pension plans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who are we affecting with the legislation?  We are affecting the 
Canadian military, the people who are fighting over in Kosovo. 
While they are away fighting the government is back here grabbing 
the surplus from their pension funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also affecting the RCMP, the people we entrust to keep 
law and order, to put their lives on the line fighting crime, and 
to do all kinds of things to protect society.  While they are 
protecting society, who is protecting their pension fund?  It is 
certainly not the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A grave injustice has been done.  I am pleased to provide the 
government with this opportunity to apologize, to set the record 
straight and to ensure that every cent of funds dedicated to this 
plan is left in the pension fund or put to direct use to improve 
the benefits of the plan in a way that is acceptable to the

misses the point when he compares our commitment, as he did 
earlier in his question to the minister, to NATO and our 
willingness to provide government employees with pension plans 
that are more in line with the realities of today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I totally disagree with him when he says the government was 
bombarding the pension plan of our armed forces.  That is quite a 
little play on words.  We know the NDP is very strong in terms of 
its rhetoric.  On the contrary, Bill C-78 sweeps the cobwebs out 
of plans that were designed more than 30 years ago and needed to 
be updated and improved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also have enormous difficulty understanding why the member 
persists in saying that the pension plan surpluses belong to 
members of the Canadian forces, the public service and the RCMP. 
The President of the Treasury Board has stated in the House on 
several occasions that government employees did not have to 
assume any financial risks associated with funding these plans.

</I></B></P><P align=left>If the member takes the trouble to read the bill carefully, he 
will see the proposals being introduced and passed in Bill C-78 
and Bill C-71 will provide government employees with more

</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Halifax West should also keep himself better 
informed about everything the government is doing to improve the

</I></B></P><P align=left>I stress that the bill enhances and protects the benefits the 
public service, the RCMP and Canadian forces employees and 
pensioners receive and that the benefits as defined in their 
plans will continue to be theirs and guaranteed by the 
government.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I want to pursue an issue I raised in the House 
regarding the reuse of disposable medical devices.  This matter 
came to light in February of this year as the result of some 
excellent investigative work by a reporter with the Winnipeg 
<I>Free Press</I>. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was revealed that disposable medical devices were being 
reused in hospitals in Winnipeg and elsewhere across Canada.  Let 
us be clear.  We are talking about medical devices licensed for 
single use only.  We are talking about repeated use of catheters 
and other devices contrary to manufacturer warnings and despite 
the real possibility of disease transmission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should also be noted that since the time I raised this matter 
in the House a report has been released by Winnipeg 
microbiologist Dr. Michelle Alfa confirming there is a danger 
that surgical devices reused against the advice of manufacturers 
might transmit infections between patients or break down inside 
the body. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has the federal government's response been?  The Minister 
of Health said he would consider calling a meeting of provincial 
health ministers in order to develop, possibly, a national policy 
on this issue.  Does that not just blow us away?  We are at a 
loss for words in terms of that response. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we have a problem of national proportions, a practice that 
is certainly risky and potentially lethal, and a matter that 
falls directly under the jurisdiction of the health protection 
branch.  Where is the federal government?  In essence nowhere. 
Even the spokesperson of the manufacturers of medical devices 
said surely Health Canada has some role as a protector of the 
public health of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a clear-cut case of federal government negligence and 
dereliction of duty, reinforced by the fact that the government 
has sat on a report for five years which warned of widespread 
concerns about the risk of reusing disposable medical devices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For five years the government has known that reused disposable 
devices like catheters and tubes going into the stomach and 
intestines can cause the transmission of disease and even 
breakdown in the patient's body.  To make matters even worse, for 
three years the government has had the benefit of a comprehensive 
set of guidelines done by the Canadian Health Care Association 
and provided to all health care facilities regarding the reuse of 
single use medical devices, and still nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other countries have taken action.  France and Sweden forbid the 
use of disposable medical devices.  In the rest of Europe 
equipment must be certified.  Any kind of reused equipment must 
be clearly certified indicating it continues to meet standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why not in Canada?  Why has the government forsaken health 
protection?  Why does it not act on a study that is five years 
old?  Why does it not put in use the recommendations of the 
Canadian Health Care Association? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Doctors want national policies.  Manufacturers want action. 
Patients clearly want to see the government uphold its 
responsibilities under the Health Protection Act.  Why does the 
government not act and act now?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Eleni Bakopanos (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to respond further to the hon. member for Winnipeg 
North Centre concerning the reuse of single use medical devices 
by hospitals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The practice of resterilizing and reusing devices labelled by 
the manufacturer of single use devices has been common in Canada 
for some time. 
Since 1994 there have been a number of major conferences on the 
issue.  At none of these conferences were serious fears expressed 
about the hazards of the practice.

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1991 the Quebec minister of health has published three 
guidelines in this regard: first, to endorse the practice, then 
to annul the first notice and, finally, to again amend it in 
order to permit reuse under certain conditions. All of this 
points to confusion regarding the dangers of this practice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1994 and 1996 Health Canada provided funding and support for 
research to the Canadian Health Care Association for the 
development of two policy documents on reuse, which were largely 
accepted by Canadian hospitals and published in the United 
States by the Association for the Advancement of Medical 
Instrumentation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Delivery of health care and the types and the use made of drugs 
and medical devices in hospitals are provincial and territorial 
matters. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health Canada has demonstrated leadership in developing national 
guidelines on reuse.  The department is willing to work with the 
provinces, the territories and the advisory committee on health 
services to continue that work. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The motion to adjourn the House is now 
deemed to have been adopted. Accordingly, this House stands 
adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 
24(1).
