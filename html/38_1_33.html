<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The House resumed from November 24 consideration of the motion that Bill C-7, an act to amend the Department of Canadian Heritage Act and the Parks Canada Agency Act and to make related amendments to other Acts, be read the third time and passed.
</p><A NAME="Int-1037720"></A><a HREF="#Int-1037781"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Alan Tonks (York South—Weston, Lib.): </b>Mr. Speaker, I am delighted this morning to rise on Bill C-7. The bill is in fact a reaffirmation of the government's absolute desire and commitment not only to review the responsibilities associated with our natural heritage with respect to our parks and historic designations within our parks and natural environment, but also to make sure of the continuity required with respect to our built history, to make sure that there is a very clear delineation of responsibility with respect to maintaining what Canadians have a right to. Their natural and their built heritage should be protected, administered and managed in manner that is in keeping with the high degree of responsibility we all feel for our heritage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As members will know, then, the bill is an act to amend the Department of Canadian Heritage Act and the Parks Canada Agency Act and to make related amendments to other acts. As I said, it will delineate responsibilities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thrust of my comments today will be about the action plan on establishing new national parks and national marine conservation areas within the context of the bill, two subjects which members have said from time to time are issues they really want to get into.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will give members a little history.  On December 12, the control and supervision of the Parks Canada Agency was transferred from the Minister of Canadian Heritage to the Minister of the Environment. This transfer was given effect through an order in council.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On July 20, 2004, another order in council came into effect relating to responsibilities for our built heritage. It was required in order to clarify the earlier order in council. First, control and supervision of the historic places policy group, that group and its responsibilities, was transferred from the Department of Canadian Heritage to Parks Canada. Second, the powers, duties and functions related to the design and implementation of the program that had built heritage as their primary subject matter were transferred from the Minister of Canadian Heritage to the Minister of the Environment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-7, as I have indicated, will update the legislation to reflect these directions and these responsibilities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill deals with the machinery of government and  does not contain any substantive policy provisions. It simply gives legislative effect to the direction that the government reorganization was taking, as announced on December 2003, in particular as it affects Parks Canada.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to amending the Department of Canadian Heritage Act and the Parks Canada Agency Act, Bill C-7 also amends statutes through which Parks Canada delivers its mandate: the Canada National Parks Act; the Historic Sites and Monuments Act; the Heritage Railway Stations Protection Act; the Canada National Marine Conservation Areas Act; the Saguenay--St. Lawrence Marine Park Act; the Species at Risk Act; and the Canada Shipping Act. All of these are associated statutes that are implicated by this transfer. But there are no additional funding requirements related to Bill C-7, as the jurisdictional responsibilities with respect to funding, works and associated initiatives obviously are within the budgets of the relevant departments.</p><A NAME="T1005"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1005"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1010"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1000"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1005)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parks Canada's organizational integrity has been maintained.  The Parks Canada agency remains committed to working with Canadians to protect and present nationally significant examples of Canada's natural and cultural heritage for present and future generations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it would be an understatement to say that the examples of that unique heritage, which in fact is a reflection of the various cycles of immigration and our first nations and aboriginal peoples and so on, are top of mind with respect to our heritage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to take a few moments to talk about the Parks Canada story. I think it is a global best practice. It is a story that is worth repeating often in order for us to have a sense of just how absolutely spectacular this country is in terms of its natural heritage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure that from the House's perspective Canada's national parks, national historic sites and national marine conservation areas are  somewhat akin to the soul of our country.  They are a central part of who we are and what we are and in fact what we want to be.  It is  what we signal to the world that is so important with respect to the preservation and the stewardship of the natural heritage we enjoy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These places are obviously places of wonder and awe for those Canadians who have travelled from coast to coast to coast.  I happen to be one of them.  I am never above and beyond being totally impressed with what God has given us as a natural environment.  It is just so absolutely awesome, even in the global context. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each of those places also tells its own story because the people who live in those areas have a special kinship with respect to their natural heritage and their built heritage.  In fact, it is a reflection of a very regional kinship that people have with their own immediate environment. It is one that they wish to share with all Canadians and in fact with the world.  It is unique.  That natural environment, our built environment, is also a reflection of the mosaic that we refer to as Canada.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we cherish as part of our national identity, we also recognize as part of our national responsibility.  If we feel so strongly on the one hand how special our heritage is, then equally we have to rise to the challenge in terms of our accountability to nurture and preserve it.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Canadians share the responsibility to preserve and protect Canada's unique cultural and natural heritage.  Together, we hold our national parks, our national historic sites and our national marine conservation areas in trust for the benefit of this and future generations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada has the distinction of having established the first national park service in the world.  Over the decades, our system of national parks has grown to 41 national parks and reserves, preserving for future generations almost 265,000 square kilometres of lands and waters.  There are plans to add an additional 100,000 square kilometres through the creation of eight more national parks.  This legacy is possible in large part because provincial and territorial governments, aboriginal and first nations people and local communities have worked with us to create many of these new national parks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The creation and management of national parks is a delicate balance between protection of ecologically significant areas of importance to wildlife and meeting economic and social needs of communities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government of Canada is committed to working with aboriginal people, local communities and other Canadians and stakeholders to protect our precious national heritage through the creation of new national parks and national marine conservation areas.  When I say the Government of Canada, I include that this particular issue is a non-partisan issue in which all members of the House on both sides, in all parties, feel the same with respect to the protection of our natural and built heritage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In October 2002 the government announced an initiative to substantially complete Canada's system of national parks by creating 10 new parks over the next five years.  This will expand the system by almost 50%, with the total area spanning nearly the size of Newfoundland and Labrador. We have already created two of these 10 new national parks with work continuing on eight other proposals. Five new national marine conservation areas will also be created.</p><A NAME="T1010"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1010"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1015"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1005"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1010)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada is blessed with exceptional natural treasures.  We owe it to Canadians and to the world to protect these lands and waters.  The action plan calls on Parks Canada to work with all of its partners, the provinces and territories, aboriginal and rural communities, industry, environmental groups, labour and all others, to complete this effort.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In March 2003 the government allocated $144 million over five years and $29 million annually thereafter toward this effort. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The action plan has already produced two national parks. The new Gulf Islands National Park Reserve of Canada protects 33 square kilometres of ecologically rare land in the southern Gulf Islands of British Columbia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At over 20,000 square kilometres the new Ukkusiksalik National Park of Canada protects virtually an entire watershed close to the Arctic Circle in Nunavut.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we speak, the whole issue of ecological balance is being discussed.  We have had  the recent Arctic report  out of Iceland and   a conference is going on with respect to countries that have responsibility for the Arctic. Our mandate is to be  accountable to preserving the Arctic.  We all know there are huge challenges with respect to global warming and  the Arctic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other parallel concerns are being expressed through reports that will be coming to the House.  As a matter of fact, there will be a report today with respect to water quality in some of our natural areas, one of which is the Great Lakes Basin, that will be a parallel effort in an attempt  to make sure that these natural areas are protected, the latter being water quality.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ukkusiksalik Park is a product of an agreement between the Government of Canada and the Inuit of Nunavut forged over several decades of hard work, all focused on protecting land, water, caribou  and polar bears for present and future generations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specific sites for more national parks will be selected in other natural regions across Canada, the southern Okanagan; the lower Similkameen in interior British Columbia; Labrador's Torngat Mountains and Mealy Mountains; Manitoba's lowland  boreal forests; Bathurst Island in Nunavut; and the east arm of Great Slave Lake in the Northwest Territories.  Just to speak about those potential inclusions geographically gives one the sense of the vastness of Canada.  Sites for the two remaining national parks are being identified by Parks Canada.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Negotiations to establish the Torngat Mountains National Park Reserve in northern Labrador are nearing completion.  Members will be pleased to know that this longstanding proposal will protect some of the highest mountains in North America east of the Canadian Rockies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In March 2004 the Premier of Manitoba and the former minister of the environment signed a memorandum of agreement identifying the boundaries for public consultation for a national park in the Manitoba lowlands.  They also committed to negotiating a national park establishment agreement by May 2005.  Both parks will make significant additions to our worldclass national parks system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government is also working with partners to establish five new national marine conservation areas, adding an estimated 15,000 square kilometres to the system.  This will be a major step for global conservation of marine habitat.  Canada has the world's longest coastline and 7% of its fresh water.</p><A NAME="T1015"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1015"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1020"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1010"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1015)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This commitment to creating a new marine conservation area is consistent with recent Speeches from the Throne in which our government made a commitment to create new marine protected areas as part of the ocean action plan.  These national marine conservation areas will be located in ecologically unrepresented marine regions. Four sites have been identified, including the Gwaii Haanas off British Columbia's Queen Charlotte Islands, western Lake Superior, British Columbia's southern Strait of Georgia and the waters off the Îles de la Madeleine in the Gulf of St. Lawrence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While a site for the remaining national marine conservation area has yet to be finalized, Parks Canada has received a number of proposals from local communities, a testament to the growing interest in the conservation of our marine heritage. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the government will accelerate its actions over the next five years to improve the ecological integrity of Canada's 41 existing national parks.  This will implement the action plan arising from the report of the panel on the ecological integrity of Canada's national parks, which  was endorsed by the government in April 2000.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two initiatives, the action plan to establish our system and to expand our system of national parks and national marine conservation areas and the action plan on ecological integrity, are the most ambitious initiatives to expand and protect national parks and national marine conservation areas in over 100 years, indeed, since Banff National Park of Canada, Canada's first, was established in 1885.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parks Canada needs to get on with the job and Parliament has assigned the job to it. I urge all   members, for the reasons I have attempted to articulate in my comments, to support the bill as a major step forward in outlining and saying to Canadians that the House, the government and all parties understand the responsibilities with respect to the stewardship of our natural and built environment, and that the bill is a step toward maintaining that accountability with all Canadians.</p><A NAME="T1020"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1020"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1025"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1015"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1020)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1037781"></A><a HREF="#Int-1037785"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1037720"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Richard Harris (Cariboo—Prince George, CPC): </b>Mr. Speaker,   I was very impressed with the commitment the member for York South—Weston   has to the preservation,   protection and  enhancement of our national parks which, as everyone in the House knows, are the most beautiful national parks  that can be found anywhere in the world. He talked about responsibility and stewardship.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My party will  be supporting the bill  because we have to do whatever it takes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member, in his speech, talked about the government's commitment to the protection of our parks. He talked about the ecologically rare areas we have in Canada. I think every one of our parks can fit into that category. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am wondering if the member for York South--Weston is aware of a very imminent   threat that is about to occur and is, as we speak, already occurring  on the west side of both the Banff and Jasper National Parks, which is the  very large amassing of mountain pine beetles.  They are continuing an  easterly movement and   will destroy every single mature pine tree in both of those parks if they are not arrested and dealt with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is important and I have to be critical of the government. This is a natural ecological disaster happening in the province of British Columbia.  The reason that those beetles  are there is that  despite discovering the presence of the pine beetle back in the early nineties and numerous calls to the federal government from the province of B.C. to recognize this as a natural disaster, inasmuch as the ice storms in Ontario and Quebec and  the floods in Manitoba, every request for assistance to mitigate  and   arrest the damage  and  progress of the mountain pine beetle has not been responded  to by the federal government, to the point now that these bugs are on the western side of both Banff and Jasper National Parks.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would ask the member whether the government   is as committed as he  says it is.   After hearing the  passion with which  the member gave   his presentation, I believe   he is committed to doing everything he can, so I would ask him the following. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, did he know about the presence of the mountain pine beetle and the damage they have caused and are causing on the western side of Jasper and Banff National Parks?   If so, will he do everything he can to press the Minister of Canadian Heritage and the Minister of Natural Resources to come immediately to the aid of the province to help  mitigate the damage and stop the spread of the mountain pine beetle? </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we do not do that we will  see a forest fire in the province of B.C. and in the westerly part of Alberta where those parks are, just as sure as we are speaking today, the magnitude of which we have never seen. This creates the most absolutely timber dry wood as an ultimate end that  is ripe for a lightening strike.  We could find both of those national parks in an imminent state of being ready for a fire disaster to hit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will the member please direct some efforts toward the ministers responsible to recognize the magnitude of the beetle infestation,   the imminent danger and the damage that is already being caused to those two national parks?</p><A NAME="T1025"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1025"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1030"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1020"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1025)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1037785"></A><a HREF="#Int-1037791"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1037781"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Alan Tonks: </b>Mr. Speaker, I truly appreciate both the spirit and the substance of the question. As the member was reflecting on the nature and implication of the mountain pine beetles, I also was reflecting on the impact a similar invasive species, the Asian longhorned beetle, has had in my constituency in Toronto.    In many constituencies, the Asian longhorned beetle is decimating softwood, in particular, ash, such as mountain ash and other species of ash, in Toronto and the area. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member might not be aware that there are signs all over, trying to cloister the impact of the Asian longhorned beetle.  It is having a similar impact in urban settings where it is so necessary to have trees to maintain the ecological balance. It now has been found that the Asian longhorned beetle is not only just a seasonal problem, but it is permeating itself.   It can hibernate in the winter and re-emerge in the summer. It is a very serious issue. In that instance a strategic initiative is taking place, coordinated between the provincial and local governments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot give a total answer, but I can give a process answer and possibly a substance answer. The first  is to get the information as to what is being done with respect to the mountain pine beetle.  There is absolutely no challenging the cause and effect that the member has established. It does implicate on this bill and the spirit behind it. That case can be established. Having established the case in terms of what is going on, how effective we are, it then is a jurisdictional issue as to how we can establish a process that will deal with it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will get as much information for the member on what the nature of the issue is at this point.  Then there might be the opportunity to raise it as a matter before the House and have the appropriate minister give an overview, or an inter-jurisdictional plan from heritage and natural resources, so the whole House can be informed as to not only what is going on, but what the future plan is.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just in asking the question, the member has done a service to the issue which this bill is based on, and that is that we all are accountable for our natural heritage. This is not a partisan issue. We have been given that responsibility.  If the member has defined and identified an issue that is of concern in that geographic area, Banff and Jasper, it is an issue for all Canadians.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can assure him that I will get the information in the first instance of what we are doing, and then we can use that as the basis to satisfy ourselves as to whether that is enough.   Then we can take it on from that point.</p><A NAME="T1030"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1030"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1035"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1025"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1030)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1037791"></A><a HREF="#Int-1037793"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1037785"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Joe Comartin (Windsor—Tecumseh, NDP): </b>Mr. Speaker, I would like to put this to the speaker from the Liberal Party and the chair of the environment committee.  Does he not think there is a missed opportunity on the part of the government to not only transfer responsibility for Parks Canada to the environment department, but also to strengthen the legislation that would protect our parks and, in particular, would protect the parks from invasive species, from land uses adjacent to the parks?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could he comment on the need for that type of strengthening of our Parks Canada legislation?</p><A NAME="Int-1037793"></A><a HREF="#Int-1037837"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1037791"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Alan Tonks: </b>Mr. Speaker,  with respect to the member's question, I will read from an overview.

</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That  would take some steps toward allaying the fears that have been expressed and have led to an amendment with respect to the bill to take the “may” out and to make the Minister of the Environment as the accountable person.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think members can see from the responses I have given how seriously I take the accountability with respect to the intent of the bill.  Therefore, members might know that I also would not be opposed to being very sharply definitive in terms of ultimate and absolute accountability. If that is determined to be the Minister of the Environment, then I would have no problems with that.</p><A NAME="Int-1037837"></A><a HREF="#Int-1037863"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1037793"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Joe Comartin (Windsor—Tecumseh, NDP): </b>Mr. Speaker,  I rise with a great  desire to speak to the bill, not only because of my involvement in the previous Parliament but because our party has concerns with regard to where we go as a country with  our natural areas, particularly those areas that are encompassed by the Parks Canada legislation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-7, now at third reading, is being treated as a housekeeping bill in the sense that all we are doing is transferring responsibility for our parks, both on land and in water, to the Department of the Environment, from heritage.  Our party has pressed for that transfer for a long time. I believe it is necessary for Canada to do this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, we need to place in context where we are    with our parks, again both on land and in water. One of the things that I want to address is a concern  with   the attitude of the government toward our parks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we have heard from the previous speaker in some detail, we have a proud history of developing and taking care of our parks.  However, that is dated history.  As we heard from the previous prime minister, the plan is to expand our parks, and we need to do that.  There is an international standard that we need to meet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I travel both within the country and, more important, outside the country, it is interesting   to see the attention   paid to Canada in this area. Canada has large undeveloped areas.  They are still in their natural state.  There is an expectation across the globe   that we will foster protection for those areas. The concern that I and my party have is  we are not doing a good enough job.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The standard internationally is that 12% of all our land, and that includes  both in the water and on land, is to be set aside and preserved in its natural state.   If we do a superficial analysis, we are fairly close to that, especially when we take into account the lands that we expect will be moved over into our national parks.  We have moved reasonably well at a theoretical level. However, the reality on the ground and in the water is different.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last Parliament, we moved to expand our facilities in the water, in the form of marine conservation areas. I would point out one of the other countries that has taken more of a leading role.  Australia, is way ahead of us in this regard.   It had marine conservation areas of a similar nature almost two decades ago.  We only got to it about two years ago.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The concerns  we have, with the role  the federal government has played or this Liberal administration has since being elected in 1993, is that the parks have deteriorated.  Any number of reports, which have come out in the last four to five years, show that not enough money has been spent to maintain the existing parks.  Not only are the buildings within the parks themselves deteriorating quite noticeably, so are the natural areas.  We need to   address those reports and   meet the requirements   set out in the recommendations, and we are not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, it was quite interesting to see what happened when the previous prime minister announced that we  would have these 10 new parks.   That was about two years ago.  The funding  to go with that was woefully inadequate.  It simply would not do it.  This is perhaps the height of hypocrisy.  Those parks     took in areas that had substantial first nations  land claims against them.  I would suggest, without prejudging the outcome, that it will be established that the first nations claims are valid.</p><A NAME="T1035"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1035"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1040"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1030"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1035)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prime minister of the day was in fact proposing to convey land into the public sphere that ultimately is not public land, it is first nations land.  That is a real problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, in the last Parliament, as I said earlier, we passed the legislation dealing with marine conservation areas.  However, there is no way near enough money to protect them.  In fact, the legislation has some major flaws in the provisions about what would be permitted in those marine conservation areas, including dragging off the east coast that would destroy the coral that is there.  This is one of the major reasons that we should be protecting that area.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On both the east and west coasts, it would allow for exploration for minerals, and oil and gas deposits which in most cases require the use of explosives.  This would damage the biological integrity of those areas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a situation where at the pronouncement level it looks good.  However, when we get down to the reality of what is happening in our parks, whether on land or in the seas, we are not carrying through to meet that international standard that we are being expected to by the world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to go back for a minute to the role that first nations have played in this area.  The reason we are close to having the 12%, the international standard, is because the first nations claims, particularly in the northern territories, have provided us with a good deal of that percentage.  It is one that I think we have to recognize as a society and as a government.  We have to acknowledge that what they have done as a people is to protect the biological integrity of the areas that they control.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to deal a bit more with the threats that we are faced with in the parks and that we would like to have seen addressed in this bill.  As opposed to this simply being a housekeeping bill to transfer responsibility, we would prefer to see more in the way of regulation and legislation that would protect our natural areas in our parks and marine conservation areas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to talk about the attitude that we saw expressed by the government.  We moved as a party, on behalf of our member for Skeena—Bulkley Valley, that the responsibility be directly attributed to the Minister of the Environment.  The bill, as it originally came before the House before it was successfully amended, provided that any minister or other individuals within the Privy Council Office could be designated as responsible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This goes to the essential attitude that this government has had since 1993 of seeing parks sort of off on the side and not having a champion, not having an advocate.  When Parks Canada was with heritage, the heritage minister obviously had conflicting responsibilities: to protect the arts and culture, broadcasting, et cetera, and Parks Canada was an additional responsibility.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of that, we saw a dramatic deterioration in the parks.  It is appropriate that we put it back into an environment where we have the minister who, one would expect, and I do not say we always get that from these ministers, would play that championing role, that advocacy role within the government and within cabinet to see to it that the parks do not further deteriorate and in fact the remedial work is done. They should be brought back to the standard one would expect and new parks would be properly protected.  Boundaries would be built around them so that we would not see any deterioration in those parks, or usages within those parks that would be inappropriate and incompatible with maintaining them in their natural state.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need that person in the cabinet.  We moved that amendment and want to acknowledge the support that we received from the opposition parties on that amendment.  We got it through successfully earlier this week.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What it says to us as a party is that the Liberal government is really not serious.  We would like to see other issues addressed.  We are obviously not going to get it.  We will support this bill because it is important to have the transfer made from heritage to environment.</p><A NAME="T1040"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1040"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1045"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1035"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1040)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we would have appreciated and expected that the government would have taken a more proactive role in seeing that other protections were built into the legislation so that our parks would meet the standards that the international community is expecting of us and more importantly, that Canadians from coast to coast to coast are expecting of us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We talk about the national identity of Canadians and the angst that we sometimes go through.  We know that our health care system is one of the programs that we point to that separates us from other countries and that makes us proud to be Canadians. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The national parks fit into that category as well, whether it is in the Maritimes, again offshore or onshore, whether it is in central Canada, in the Prairies, in the Rockies, in B.C., or up north in the territories. In every area there are national parks or natural areas that we are proud as Canadians to say we are protecting and we will protect. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the essence I believe of being Canadian. If we travel, especially in the developed world, we are looked at as having the best of both worlds.  We have an economy that is strong, but we also have been able within that to protect our parks. It is very important that Canadians do that and it is very important that we continue to do that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This legislation does not advance us much in that regard. Other than making the transfer and hoping that we end up with an advocate within the government and within cabinet, it does not advance us much in that regard, in spite of the expectations of both Canadians and the world as a whole.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to spend a couple of minutes on other threats that are applicable to the parks.  Threats that I would ask the government to consider subsequently in regulation, because some of this could be done by regulation.  Some of it will have to be done by legislation and some of it has to be done by way of cooperation with the provinces and our neighbour to the south, the United States.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to build corridors in order to preserve any number of species. Some of those corridors go down into the United States. A good number of them go east and west across provincial boundaries and cross into areas where there are provincial parks.  We need to develop a much more efficient system of working with the provinces and the United States to assure that those corridors will be established and will be maintained so that we stop losing the habitat for  so many of our species.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can point as one example to the grizzly population in Banff which is under very severe threat because the gene pool is so limited. There is not enough diversity in that gene pool and we badly need to develop a corridor for the grizzlies within that park so that they would be able to move in and out in a much more natural and effective way to maintain that gene pool.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, there are a number of areas that we need to work on with the provinces because we need to protect the area adjacent to our national parks. We have, in a number of places, quite significant suburban types of development, large developments going in immediately adjacent to parks and putting significant pressure on the national parks. We need to be working with the provinces around land use control in order to ensure that there are buffer areas that are natural or semi-natural, that will act as a buffer for our national parks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to be very clear that we will not allow incompatible usages in our parks, whether it is mining or forestry, and we can go down the list. I mentioned earlier the use of explosives in the exploration for mineral resources in marine conservation areas. It is extremely detrimental to the natural species that inhabit those areas and we need to put an end to the ability of the private sector to do that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a number of cases, that is work that can be done within the national government, but there are other times when assistance is required in cooperation with the provinces. Therefore, we need to be developing more extensively our relationships in that regard.</p><A NAME="T1045"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1045"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1050"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1040"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1045)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, we recognize that this is a housekeeping bill.  It is one that we as a party are going to support because we badly need to have that champion, that advocate for the parks that has been so sorely missed in the last 11 to 12 years under this Liberal administration.  We need that person and we need that person to do the job, which is to fight hard to ensure that protections are there and that the funds to develop and protect the parks are in place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will support the bill, but we are also asking the government to give serious consideration to additional regulations, legislation and the diplomacy that we need to build with other jurisdictions.</p><A NAME="T1050"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1050"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1055"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1045"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1050)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1037863"></A><a HREF="#Int-1037874"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1037837"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Speaker: </b>Is the House ready for the question?</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House resumed from November 23 consideration of the motion that Bill C-22, an act to establish the Department of Social Development and to amend and repeal certain related Acts, be read the second time and referred to a committee.</p><A NAME="Int-1037874"></A><a HREF="#Int-1038034"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1037863"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Maria Minna (Beaches—East York, Lib.): </b>Mr. Speaker, this legislation is important because it reflects some of our most deeply held values: the belief, for instance, that all Canadians deserve a chance to live rich and rewarding lives, and the genuine concern that our communities express for our most vulnerable members, including children, seniors and people with disabilities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-22, which would create the Department of Social Development Canada, is a vehicle through which we can achieve a most worthy goal: to help Canadians translate their ideals into meaningful and effective actions on behalf of the society we all share.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill would give legal effect to a transformation that began last December when the former Human Resources Development Canada department was split into two departments, including this new Department of Social Development Canada.  Building on the many highly successful programs and services long delivered by HRDC, Social Development Canada intends to become a centre of expertise in social policy and programs which will ensure that Canada maintains and indeed surpasses our global reputation as a caring nation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mandate of the new SDC is to secure and strengthen Canada's social foundations while respecting the jurisdictions of all levels of government. Its vision is to create a country where everyone plays an active role.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To strengthen Canada's social foundations, SDC will work with its partners to promote the social well-being of and income security for Canadians.  In concrete terms, Social Development Canada will focus on the social needs of Canadians, whether that be through income security or other types of programs and services.  While all Canadians stand to benefit equally, the department will have a particular focus on children, people with disabilities, seniors, families and caregivers, and the voluntary and not for profit sector.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me emphasize that Social Development Canada is hardly alone in this.  Indeed, in pursuit of its mission, it is working closely with other federal departments and other levels of government and is actively engaged with non-governmental organizations and communities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also underscore that the legislation before us casts nothing in stone.  As proposed, the department would be a living, breathing entity ready to respond to our needs and evolve along with them.  In the next few minutes, permit me to outline some of the new department's key priorities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us begin with children, our most vulnerable resource.  As you know, Mr. Speaker, my government is committed to ensuring that every child has an opportunity to attain his or her own potential.  With our partners, the Government of Canada is pursuing a comprehensive strategy to support families with children.  Since 1998 a cornerstone of this strategy has been the successful national child benefit, a flexible tax relief program that helped lift 55,000 children out of poverty in the first two years alone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All children, no matter what their circumstances, deserve an opportunity to learn and develop even before they reach school age.  That is why the Speech from the Throne observed that the time has come for a truly national system of early learning and child care, a system based on the four key principles of quality, universality, accessibility and development.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also believe that it should be a publicly administered and not for profit system and that these objectives need to be entrenched in a legislative framework.  That way, each province and territory will be able to address its own particular needs within the national framework.  There is broad consensus that affordable and accessible child care is no longer a luxury. It is a necessity for Canadian working families, whether headed by one parent or two.  We therefore want to work with our partners to respond to this reality. My government will also be investing $5 billion toward the reality of this program over the next five years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Persons with disabilities are another priority for SDC.  We are working to level the playing field for people with disabilities to ensure that Canadians with disabilities have the same chances others do to achieve and succeed in our country.  We recognize that they have abilities that differ from others and we want to support them in achieving their full potential.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Social Development Canada delivers Canada pension plan benefits for people with disabilities, along with programs such as the opportunities fund.  Under the new labour market agreements for persons with disabilities, the Government of Canada contributes funding to provinces for programs and services to promote the full participation of Canadians with disabilities in the labour market.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to seniors, our focus is on active living.  We provide seniors with the support they need to be active participants in their communities.  Again, Social Development Canada has programs to achieve that purpose.  Nearly five million Canadians receive benefits through the Canada pension plan and the old age security program.  Many more are helped out of poverty through the guaranteed income supplement, which my government has already promised to increase by up to $400 for a single person and up to $700 for a couple.</p><A NAME="T1055"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1055"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1100"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1050"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1055)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am particularly enthusiastic about another program spearheaded by Social Development Canada. Known as New Horizons for Seniors, it will work with partners to develop activities that keep seniors fully engaged in their communities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians have also told us that providing support to families and family caregivers needs to be a priority of the Government of Canada. Indeed, family caregiving is a growing issue as more and more Canadians enter the “sandwich generation”, those with the dual role of raising their children while being an informal caregiver to an aging parent or a person with a disability.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government of Canada recognizes the vital role of Canadians who care for aged or infirm relatives or those with severe disabilities and is committed to helping people better balance work and family responsibilities, and it recognizes the important contribution of caregivers in Canadian society. That is why the government will be investing $1 billion in the family caregiver program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The social economy is a venerable tradition in Canadian communities. We think of co-operatives, credit unions, community economic development associations and  a lot of non-profit groups. Canada's not for profit organizations, community groups and volunteers are major partners in building strong and resilient communities. They fill a growing and very real need in Canadian society.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why SDC is an enthusiastic supporter of the social development partnerships program and the voluntary sector initiative, measures that reach out to the more than 161,000 not for profit organizations and six million volunteers who work so selflessly to strengthen the social fabric of Canada.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all of its programs, SDC believes it is crucial to work with partners: the provinces and territories, of course, the  municipalities, not for profit groups and agencies, and the  voluntary and not for profit sector. This collaborative approach recognizes that many social programs are shared jurisdictions. It also increases capacity throughout the community in both the private and the  voluntary and not for profit sector</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to support the bill.</p><A NAME="T1100"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1100"><!-- Hour: 11--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1105"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1055"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1100)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1038034"></A><a HREF="#Int-1037915"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1037874"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Speaker: </b>The hon. member has completed her remarks, so there will be an opportunity for questions and comments following statements by members, on which we are now about to embark.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The family doctor has been called the pillar of health care in Canada.  As we strive to ensure the sustainability of our cherished health system, we need to make certain that we have a system that recognizes and supports the vital work of our GPs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the son of a family doctor, I know the burdens placed upon them.  They work tirelessly on our behalf and they are the face of health for most Canadians, but the burdens on our family doctors are significant.  The workload is staggering and the compensation has not kept up with the times.  We must do more to ensure that these key caregivers are supported. We must ensure that more are trained in our medical schools.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are privileged in my riding to have some of the most capable health professionals as family doctors.  I am speaking of people like Dr. Jake O'Connor, former Canadian family physician of the year, and Dr. Louise Cloutier, chair of the board of the Canadian Medical Association, both of whom are actively involved in their community and in the fight for better health for Canadians.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We thank our family doctors for their commitment and their service.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, this program has not been renewed for the next two years, although doing so would enable 180 workers and 35 companies to reach the break-even point.  I cannot understand why the Minister of Human Resources and Skills Development  is delaying the go-ahead on this program, which has already proven itself, costs a mere $600,000 and has generated $4 million in spin-offs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister needs to give the go-ahead right away to these workers who are worried at seeing the agreement termination date of December 10 approaching.   This is an opportunity for the government to demonstrate its desire to contribute to the development of the regions of Quebec.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Kinsmen Club of Cornwall donated $5,000 and the dinner raised another $6,000. All of the money raised will go toward a project to double the size of the hospital.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Budgets for CBC radio correspondents in Chaleur Bay and the Magdalen Islands were cut, and now the CBC just transferred its correspondent for the Chaleur Bay region to its facilities in Matane, moving him more than 200 kilometres away. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rather than promoting regional development, the CBC prefers to abandon the regions. Yet, in September 2004, its CEO, Robert Rabinovitch, said that the CBC had a duty to provide a balanced and high-quality information service on which all Canadians could rely.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Gaspé Peninsula and the Magdalen Islands deserve better. This situation must be corrected and it must be corrected quickly.</p>

Many of our future teachers, nurses and engineers are being forced to forgo career dreams simply because they cannot afford the high cost of tuition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Alliance of Student Associations has put together a list of recommendations that will assist Canadians from low income backgrounds to obtain an education that could in turn provide a brighter financial future. Among those is a recommendation to provide funding through a dedicated Canadian education transfer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These recommendations come from those who are directly affected by the increasing costs of education, the students. These are people who want to better themselves and the future of Canada through education. They also want to see that all Canadians, regardless of their financial situation, have the same opportunities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe the Liberal government should take a lesson or two from Canada's post-secondary students.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Born in England in 1920, Arthur Hailey began his writing career while a Royal Air Force pilot during the second world war. After the war, Arthur Hailey moved to Canada, became a Canadian citizen and began writing television screenplays. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was in Canada that Arthur Hailey wrote <i>Flight into Danger</i>, his first television screenplay. It  was broadcast live on the CBC in 1956 and later in England and the United States to huge audiences and great acclaim.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Building on his success in television, Arthur Hailey moved on to write novels. In total, Mr. Hailey wrote 11 novels about ordinary people facing extraordinary ordeals. Hailey's novels include international bestsellers <i>Hotel, Airport</i> and <i>Detective</i>. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On behalf of the Government of Canada, I salute Arthur Hailey.</p>

Marlene Jennings (Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Canada—U.S.), Lib.)</b>: <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, on May 3, 2004, the Clerk of the Privy Council informed the public accounts committee that, on about three occasions over two years, deputy ministers had come to him to say that they had strongly advised a minister that something the minister wanted should or could not be done. He also made it clear that this was not to be interpreted as meaning that ministers wanted to do anything illegal and that, indeed, in every instance, the actions taken were consistent with the law.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, as deputy of the Prime Minister and head of the public service, and to promote effective management of the public service, the Clerk of the Privy Council must be in a position to receive full and frank information about internal governmental operations. As well, ministers must be in a position to express freely their opinions and views, and to share them with their deputy ministers in confidentiality. This point was also made before the public account committee. These important principles are recognized in the Privacy Act and the Access to Information Act.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asking the Clerk of the Privy Council to disclose opinions or views that a minister may have expressed on a confidential basis, in a context such as here where all actions taken were consistent with the law, would draw him into a political role and be contrary to the convention of neutrality of the public service.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disclosure of such information would therefore prejudice both the confidential nature of the discussions and the importance of protecting the neutrality of the public service.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-22, an act to establish the Department of Social Development and to amend and repeal certain related Acts be read the second time and  referred to a committee.</p><A NAME="Int-1038280"></A><a HREF="#Int-1038295"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1038272"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms. Nicole Demers (Laval, BQ): </b>Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister's decision to divide the Department of Human Resources Development into two distinct departments, Human Resources and Skills Development , and Social Development, ignores the realities and needs of Quebec and of the other provinces and territories. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must say that I am really impressed by the ingenuity and creativity of this government in coming up with ways to interfere in areas that came under provincial and territorial jurisdiction.  Imagine just for a moment all that energy being focussed on ensuring that each province received its fair share in order to meet its responsibilities toward its citizens.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, this department is just one more example of the astronomical amounts being sunk into a whole series of federal administrative duplications, rather than being redistributed to the provinces to put an end to fiscal imbalance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I worked for years in the community sector and I have sat on many boards of organizations in Laval. In particular, I was on a committee called the Comité permanent des aînés du secteur 2, whose mission was to end isolation among seniors and help them to a better life through meetings, leisure activities, training and information. I also sat on the  Conseil des médias communautaires, a community media council providing an Internet portal and newsletter for community groups in Laval. I was involved in the  Centre d'aide et d'accompagnement aux plaintes, which offers support in making claims and getting results to people having problems with the health or social services systems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was also active with a program called 1,2,3 GO! which helps infants and their parents get a good start in life, and with the Maison des grand-parents de Laval,which gives seniors a chance to pass on their knowledge to young people, through intergenerational activities such as letter-writing, knitting courses, homework help and many other things, so that they can continue to share what they have learned and what they have become. In addition, I was a member of the Association québécoise de défense des droits des personnes retraitées et pré-retraitées, which is Quebec's leading advocate for seniors' rights. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, I was active in the Carrefour d'interculture de Laval, an organization that welcomes new immigrants and refugees, helps them get established and  helps them deal with the tragedies they may have experienced. I was active in the Coopérative de développement régional Montréal-Laval, which does cooperative development,and  in the Forum de la population de la Régie régionale de Laval, a public forum to ensure that health and social services decisions reflect the true needs of the people of Laval. Finally, I sat on the  Comité consultatif du poste de police communautaire du secteur 2, which works with all social and economic partners to provide a better quality of life to residents of the Laval-des-Rapides, Pont-Viau and Renaud areas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I am very familiar with the serious situation in Quebec caused by the fiscal imbalance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It might be thought that even I, as a dedicated and committed sovereignist, was tempted by some of these new programs that are being proposed. Happily, even though I come from a poor  environment, and though I may engage  in poor politics, if one believes the campaign speeches by the Quebec lieutenant, unlike him, I do not engage in petty politics. When the federal government takes advantage of the fiscal imbalance it has itself created  to grab jurisdictions that never belonged to it, that is petty politics. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, on November 1,  the Quebec lieutenant made the following statement to <i>La Presse</i>, “We are talking about addressing the priorities identified during the last campaign but, when that is done, we will move on to other challenges which, this time, will be more within our jurisdiction”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With statements like these, the situation is not about to be resolved. A person has to be totally ignorant of the problems  facing real people and the needs of Quebeckers to strut about like that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I took a closer look, I realized how pernicious the implementation of these programs was. A case in point is the social development partnerships program, designed to provide grants and contributions to non-profit organizations working to  improve the quality of life of persons with disabilities, children and their families, and other vulnerable or excluded populations, and to address their social development needs.</p><A NAME="T1220"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1220"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1225"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1215"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1220)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, there is the voluntary sector initiative, designed to enhance relations with the voluntary sector. For the duration of the initiative, both sectors would work together to facilitate access by these organizations to federal programs, technology and more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, there is the new horizons for seniors program, to support a range of community-based projects intended to enable seniors to participate in social activities, pursue an active life and contribute to society.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such direct federal interventions with community organizations are a blatant  invasion of the jurisdictions of Quebec and the provinces, which maintain a relationship with these organizations through the  health and social services network. Their sole purpose is to create dependency on programs which are not sustainable and which makes beggars out of the organizations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These organizations deserve better. On a daily basis, by conviction, and often  calling—it is fair to talk about a calling when we see the salaries paid in the community sector—thousands of people are busy helping, supporting, informing, training and caring for    thousands of others, who would be on their own otherwise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I worked in community services for over ten years and I know a thing or two about it. I know that people worked 70, 80 or 90 hours a week and got paid for only 30 or 35 hours. They work these hours because they believe they can help people get through their problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fiscal imbalance often has tragic effects, and people who work in this field can detect them. They can see the effects and understand them. They work with seniors, some of whom unfortunately have not received the guaranteed income supplement, because it was not made available to them or they  were not given the full retroactive payment  to which they were entitled. When you go to the homes of people like that you see that they have nothing in their fridge. They have to choose between buying medication or food. It is appalling and outrageous. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government of Quebec is in the best position to assess the real needs. It does not just hand out money. It intervenes through a stable, structured and long-term policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Québécois cannot therefore support the creation of a department that, by definition, interferes in the jurisdictions of Quebec and the other provinces. This government keeps promising to respect the jurisdictions of Quebec, but, in fact, the opposite occurs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This government has a reputation for interfering, and we simply do not believe its promises any more. Although I believe the minister has good intentions, I do not believe that his government has good intentions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the inclusion of the Bloc Québécois amendment to the amendment in the Speech from the Throne requiring the government to fully respect the jurisdictions of Quebec and the provinces, we must remain vigilant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this government would keep to its own responsibilities and honour the agreements and promises it has made with people in areas under its responsibility, I think this would go over better.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look at assistance for veterans. I know all about this. My father is a veteran. He fought in World War II. He spent six years on the front lines. He fought in every campaign: Italy, Poland, Holland and North Africa. He was a scout, which meant he slept in the trenches.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he came home from the front, a broken and exhausted man, he was suffering from various conditions for which the authorities would do nothing, or claimed nothing could be done.  We spend 20 years fighting to get him hearing aids.  We spent 20 years trying to prove that his deafness was due to having to sleep in the trenches and in close proximity to exploding shells and bombs for the whole length of the war.  It was a dreadful experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, my father is no longer with us, and so has not been able to profit from this new generosity toward veterans.  There are, however, others who are still suffering and are not yet covered, not yet compensated for their contribution and their courage.</p><A NAME="T1225"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1225"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1230"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1220"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1225)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now they dare bring up the idea of a new department in charge of social affairs.  I cannot get over it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly, despite the addition of the Bloc Québécois amendment to the amendment in connection with the Speech from the Throne obliging the government  to respect the jurisdiction of Quebec and the provinces, we need to remain very much on guard.  The only thing the government wants is to weaken the provinces still further, to interfere even more in areas of jurisdiction that do not belong to it, by trying to fool the public.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For 2002-03 alone, these intrusions represent $81 billion, which is 44% of federal expenditures and 55% of the government's operating expenses.  This is a disgrace.  The question we would be entitled to ask is this.  Would this by chance be a new department created in order to give this government the high profile it used to get from the sponsorship program?  Or is it viewed as a replacement for the Canadian unity fund? </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would invite all parties in this House to listen to reason and vote against this bill. </p><A NAME="Int-1038295"></A><a HREF="#Int-1038300"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1038280"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Eleni Bakopanos (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Social Development (Social Economy), Lib.): </b>Mr. Speaker, I am not surprised at the speech made by the hon. member for Laval, who is a new member of this House, because I have been hearing the same thing for 12 years in this House. For 12 years, all the members of the Bloc Québécois have been saying the same thing on this subject, that it comes under provincial jurisdiction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we are well aware that in their opinion, Canada should not exist, and the departments that have anything to do with Quebec should not exist either.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There  was a report by a House of Commons committee which proposed, after careful analysis, that the two departments should be split. There was a minority report, based on the same argument we keep hearing in this House, the one about provincial jurisdiction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, there was a department to look after Canadian citizens from birth to death, from the beginning of their lives to the end. This department existed. Therefore, this bill had to follow up on the committee's recommendations. That is what we are doing today in the House. We are not talking about a social engineering project like the Bloc proposes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, since this department was created, we have experienced very good collaboration with the federalist government in Quebec. Therefore, we will continue to work together on the areas in this department's portfolio, bearing in mind the people  it serves. It is a form of collaboration, after all. We must work together with our provincial colleagues, with all the non-governmental organizations and with all the volunteers. That is what we are trying to do with this bill, to give legal form to something that already existed and has now been split into two parts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a question for the new member, for whom I most certainly have great respect. I am familiar with her commitment to voluntary and non-governmental organizations. With regard to the programs under this department, should we not have such cooperation with the provincial government, to ensure that, especially where Quebec is doing good things, we can provide the resources? Should we not continue to collaborate? That is my question for the hon. member.</p><A NAME="T1230"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1230"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1235"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1225"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1230)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1038300"></A><a HREF="#Int-1038302"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1038295"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms. Nicole Demers: </b>Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague for her question. I have great admiration for her also. I am aware of her social involvement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are indeed totally in favour of the federal government  giving the money to Quebec, so that we can look after these programs ourselves. What we have a problem with is the federal government taking upon itself to run these programs. Let the government give us the money and correct the fiscal imbalance and, believe me, these programs will be well managed by Quebec. As my hon. colleague said, Quebec has       very good expertise, and long experience with community programs for seniors, children and the sick.</p><A NAME="Int-1038302"></A><a HREF="#Int-1038305"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1038300"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. André Bellavance (Richmond—Arthabaska, BQ): </b>Mr. Speaker, I do have a question for my hon. colleague, who made an excellent speech. The parliamentary secretary claims that this government has an excellent relationship  and fruitful discussions with the Government of Quebec. Even if the current government in Quebec is a federalist one, I have news for her.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quebec's employment, social solidarity and family minister, Claude Béchard, who is a cabinet member in the federalist government in Quebec, had a motion put before  the National Assembly to make sure he had the  support of all the members in negotiating with the federal government. This motion was introduced on November 3, 2004, that is to say, very recently. I will read what it says, if I may. It is very short:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>

</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Try as they may to have us believe that there is agreement, that is not true when it comes to respect for jurisdictions. That is what I would like to ask of my hon. colleague who made an excellent speech on this bill which is, once again, another example of encroachment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like my hon. colleague to elaborate on all these encroachments by the federal government in the case of the provinces, and Quebec in particular, which are the source of so many problems.</p><A NAME="Int-1038305"></A><a HREF="#Int-1038307"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1038302"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms. Nicole Demers: </b>Mr. Speaker, just look at the problem with child care. It is indeed a problem that concerns us all. There are also problems with the community agencies, as I was saying earlier, and with parental leave.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The list is so long that I could spend another 10 minutes explaining all the problems that have not been resolved because of the fiscal imbalance. There is a problem with employment insurance and everything that comes under Quebec jurisdiction, such as persons with disabilities, people with specific problems, education. The list goes on. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank my hon. colleague very much for his question. I will end there.</p><A NAME="Int-1038307"></A><a HREF="#Int-1038309"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1038305"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Eleni Bakopanos: </b>Mr. Speaker, I cannot let the words of the hon. member go unanswered.  Of course, the hon. member tells us what the Quebec minister said but I can assure him that the minister was there at the table with us.  He was there to negotiate. That is what was said, they are prepared to sit down with us to negotiate. At the moment, the final agreement is not signed. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one on this side has said that Quebec's child care program is not  the best in the country.  On the contrary, we have said it is the best.  I am from Quebec.  My riding is in Quebec. I know exactly what services are available.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a few problems, however, as far as training is concerned.  That is what I hear from people in connection with day care and the situation needs to be remedied.  I think that the $5 billion we are prepared to invest and to share with the provinces will enable us to create a program, or continue the one in place, where there is one. The minister has said that thought will be given to this in January when we again sit down with the representatives of the provinces. Mr. Béchard is part of the negotiating group.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the difference between the way things were in the days of the Parti Québécois government, and  now that there is a Liberal government in Quebec. They are prepared to sit down, to negotiate, to work together. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I ask again: should we not have a negotiating table, precisely so that we can negotiate in areas where there is shared jurisdiction between the federal and the provincial governments and where we can work together?  We are prepared to work together.</p><A NAME="T1235"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1235"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1240"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1230"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1235)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1038309"></A><a HREF="#Int-1038311"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1038307"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms. Nicole Demers: </b>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is surely aware that a committee has already been struck to deal with the fiscal imbalance.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we all know, life expectancy in Canada has risen substantially over the past century. As a result, the number of people 65 and older is expected to double, from 4.6 million last year to 9.2 million by 2041.</p>
<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One obvious consequence will be felt when the baby-boomer generation hits retirement age. Instead of contributing to pension funds, they will be drawing on them. Already nearly five million Canadians receive benefits through the Canadian pension plan and old age security programs and that number has nowhere to go but up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is this cause for alarm? No, it is not. It simply requires us to recognize the reality and to prepare for it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is more, we ought to focus on the wonderful contributions that seniors make to our families, our communities and our society. We should be figuring out ways to encourage and promote their active engagement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is one of the key purposes of this new department of Social Development Canada: to serve as a focal point for initiatives for seniors, initiatives including income support programs to prevent seniors from living in poverty, and other programs to involve and engage them in their communities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seniors need enough money to live on, to be sure,  but they need something else as well.  They have to feel that their lives are full and worthwhile.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Social Development Canada, working with its many partners in the provinces and territories, municipalities, the private sector, the voluntary sector and learning institutions, is taking important steps to achieve both these ends.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government of Canada currently spends more than $63 billion a year on programs and services for seniors.  This includes almost $21 billion for universal old age security pensions, nearly $16 billion for Canada's pension plan for retired workers, $5.8 billion for the guaranteed income supplement for low income seniors, and more than $4 billion for other survivor and death benefits as well as health care.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is reassuring to know that our public pension system is there for our most vulnerable citizens.  Indeed, public pensions have helped reduce the proportion of seniors living below the poverty line from 20.8% in 1980 to 7.3% in 2000. As OECD statistics confirm, Canada is a world leader in alleviating poverty among seniors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Social Development Canada will continue to administer these programs with the same level of professionalism and courtesy that Canadian seniors have come to expect.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A secure source of income is critically important for all our seniors, but with men now spending more than 17% of their lives in retirement and women close to 28%, we need to take the broadest view possible.  We need to think about quality of life.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that seniors can easily get cut off from the rest of society.  This is not uncommon after somebody loses a spouse, especially when their children and grandchildren live far away, yet social engagement is essential because it translates into greater physical, mental and emotional well-being.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, many seniors do keep very busy.  A few, about 6%, remain in the paid workforce after they reach 65.  Nearly one in five give back to their communities through volunteer activities. Many more provide transportation and child care and run errands for friends and families. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to support such engagement and expand on it to give as many Canadian seniors as possible a chance to remain active participants in our society.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why Social Development Canada has unveiled the new horizons for seniors program.  The new horizons program will support community based projects to encourage seniors to participate in social activities, pursue an active life and contribute to their communities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seniors' organizations, volunteer groups, community based coalitions, municipal governments and aboriginal groups will be able to propose a variety of projects eligible for funding under the program budget of $8 million this year and $10 million in the year ahead.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Initiated and led by seniors, each project will harness the skills, experience and wisdom of older Canadians in activities that will benefit their local communities.  That will be good for seniors and good for everybody around them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that neighbours and families have vital roles to play in keeping older Canadians connected to their communities, but this does not mean that governments cannot help as well. Social Development Canada's role will be to provide the resources to turn good ideas into reality. It will also serve as a clearinghouse for those good ideas so that one community can learn from another.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we can all agree that there are real and tangible benefits for a society that looks after its older members.  The well-being of seniors is a priority for the Government of Canada.  That is why the Prime Minister created a new cabinet position and appointed the hon. member for Trinity--Spadina as Minister of State for Families and Caregivers.</p><A NAME="T1240"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1240"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1245"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1235"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1240)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seniors with strong connections to their families and communities are well positioned to share the wisdom of their experience with others, whether informally or more formally through voluntary activities or paid work.  Healthy and socially connected seniors are more likely to live independent lives, an outcome that the Government of Canada is working to support.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Social Development Canada will coordinate policy work at the federal level and in cooperation with the provinces to ensure that seniors' programming is aligned to achieve the best results for current and future seniors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a society we are enriched by the wisdom and knowledge of our older citizens.  The Speech from the Throne put it best: “Canada's seniors have earned the right to be treated with dignity”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Support for our country's aging population is an important priority of the Government of Canada.  Under the leadership of Social Development Canada, we will have the mechanisms to bring all the partners together, to focus on the challenges and opportunities of an aging society, and to ensure we have the programs and services that will allow all Canadians to live the final years of their lives with comfort and dignity.</p>
<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to state, as I asked the hon. minister today in the House, what the government's priority for seniors is going to be.  He clearly outlined the government's priority.  It is one that respects our seniors, our voluntary sector and people who are afflicted with handicaps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my riding of Davenport and across this country, seniors play a vital role in community services.  Seniors are the backbone of the volunteer sector.  They are the ones who contribute most to our society.  Because of that, because of their contributions to this country, we strive to make their lives better, to have them live in dignity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the various announcements the government has made and the creation of the new ministry and department, this is an issue where the government has a focus on seniors, on people with disabilities and of course on people who are volunteering and giving so much to our communities.</p><A NAME="T1245"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1245"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1250"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1240"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1245)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill.</p><A NAME="Int-1038322"></A><a HREF="#Int-1038331"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1038311"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. André Bellavance (Richmond—Arthabaska, BQ): </b>Mr. Speaker, I have listened very carefully to what the hon. member had to say.  Of course this new department would have a great deal to offer many people, seniors in particular.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is not where the problem lies.  The problem lies mainly with the encroachment into areas of provincial jurisdiction, and the jurisdiction of Quebec in particular.  We have all understood it: what we want is for the federal government to respect its jurisdictions as set out in the 1867 Constitution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My hon. colleague has just been referring to the guaranteed income supplement. We know that this is a battle that the Bloc Québécois has been waging tirelessly for some time. The hon. member for Saint-Maurice—Champlain can testify to that, as he has put a great deal of effort into it.  In Quebec, 68,000 seniors have been deprived of the GIS, and in all of Canada , 270,000.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the hon. member  why his government, despite all its fine words and expressions of good intentions, will not agree to make the GIS fully retroactive.  That way, it would be able to go back. not 11 months, but 11 years.  As a result, all the people who have been deprived of the GIS since 1993 could now be getting it.  It must be made retroactive, and retroactive back to 1993. I would like the hon. member to explain to me why they are passing off the creation of this department as a cure-all, when there are still people in  need, still people whom this government has deprived of the guaranteed income supplement and full retroactivity of that supplement</p><A NAME="Int-1038331"></A><a HREF="#Int-1038333"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1038322"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Mario Silva: </b>Mr. Speaker, I want to point out that this is an important issue for all members, not just Bloc Québécois members. I believe that all members here are very concerned about seniors. I can unequivocally state that, in our country, this government spends in excess of $63 billion annually on services programs for the elderly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also important to mention that public pensions have helped reduce the proportion of seniors living below the poverty level. Indeed, the percentage went from 20.8% in 1940, down to 7.3% in 2000.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We continue to try to reach more and more people. I am proud that our government made it a priority to help vulnerable people in our society, including seniors.</p>
<p>[<i>English</i>]</p><A NAME="Int-1038333"></A><a HREF="#Int-1038337"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1038331"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Randy Kamp (Pitt Meadows—Maple Ridge—Mission, CPC): </b>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member's speech was very well done and clearly presented. I have a question and perhaps a comment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand  from the throne speech  that the government is  telling us that seniors are now a priority.  It has never really seemed like that and certainly all  the seniors I speak to in my riding   have a hard time seeing that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today   I understand   that there are intentions to raise the guaranteed income supplement.  That is a good thing, I think, but my question is, what are the criteria?  How does the government decide, both for    the amount of the old age pension itself and then   for the supplement?  How does the government pick this number?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seniors have been asking me that over the years. I have never known for sure just what  the government bases this on. Is there is some sort of basket of goods that they are supposed to be able to buy for this?  Most seniors still seem    pretty poor to me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The  second question relates to seniors and their benefits and also to people on disability.  This might be outside  the realm here, but what really bothers me is these people  who live right on the edge of being able to survive,  have a hard time putting money aside for income tax, and then at the end of the year owe income tax.  It might be only $200 or $400, but when  people     have no disposable income, how are they supposed to pay this?</p><A NAME="T1250"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1250"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1255"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1245"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1250)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1038337"></A><a HREF="#Int-1038339"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1038333"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Mario Silva: </b>Mr. Speaker, indeed, the issue of  seniors is very important for the government and, as was outlined in the Speech from the Throne,  the  government is increasing the guaranteed income supplement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my riding of Davenport, seniors play an incredible role in   community development.  It is something that I have kept a very close watch on  and have been quite involved with   for a number of years.  I understand the issues of seniors quite well. I understand the importance of seniors living out their lives with dignity and respect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I alluded to,  the government in fact is  reaching out to seniors and is now working   to implement some of the details  in relation to the increase of the guaranteed income  supplement. Certainly the seniors in this country are a priority for the government.</p><A NAME="Int-1038339"></A><a HREF="#Int-1038349"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1038337"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP): </b>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have this opportunity, on behalf of the New Democratic Party, to speak to Bill C-22, regarding the new social development bureaucracy and the new ministry of social development. I note with interest that our critic for this area recommends that we support the bill at this stage because we support the idea of restructuring HRDC into two separate entities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were always critical that HRDC was too much. It was a mega portfolio, a massive undertaking, that was clearly too big for any one minister to manage. The issues and subject matter being dealt with were overwhelmingly difficult to manage, especially when we looked at the type of issues with which it had to deal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note the new Minister of Social Development deals with issues such as the Canada pension plan, the old age security program and the guaranteed income supplement. I hope, in a broader context, the new Minister of Social Development would not simply administer programs, but would help guide the government in a new national objective, a new set of priorities, regarding social development so we could think outside the box and dare to dream of elevating the standards of living conditions for all Canadians in measurable ways and then put in place a yardstick to measure that progress.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I take no pleasure in pointing out that the campaign 2000 was recently on Parliament Hill reminding us that over one million Canadian children live in poverty, in what one could argue is the wealthiest and most successful democracy in the free world. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly, our priorities have been skewed or our interests have been diverted and we have not paid enough attention to the area of social development. We should be measuring the progress of the country not by the monuments and structures in our cities and not by our GDP, but by the quality of life of Canadians. Maybe the Minister of Social Development could be seized with that issue as a national priority.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My riding of Winnipeg Centre is the third poorest riding in Canada. Some people do not realize that, and I take no pleasure in pointing that out either.  Of all the families in my riding, 47% of them live below the poverty line and 52% of all the children.   I raise this with a matter of great urgency, especially in this era of cutbacks. The cutbacks have come from social programs. Granted we have paid off the deficit, but we have left an enormous social deficit in its wake. I can testify to that on a day to day basis.  I deal with this reality every day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We went through an era of the 1990s, which was a record profit era for Bay Street, Wall Street, the banks and corporations and record era of cutbacks in social spending.  The predictable consequences are  record numbers of poor kids in my riding and all the predictable outfall of that. Somehow we have been derailed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a socialist, granted, so maybe I am jaded and biased in this regard. I have a theory  that the big money has controlled things in Ottawa for so long that all of our bills, laws and legislation are geared to look after the interests of big money, and everyone else has been forgotten. I can point to the social conditions in my riding as evidence of that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think it is by neglect or innocent oversight that we have allowed these circumstances to overwhelm certain regions. I point to the guaranteed income supplement as an example. My colleague from the Bloc Québécois pointed this out, quite rightly.  I do not care how busy the Minister of HRDC has been in recent years.  What the Liberals did in the administration of the guaranteed income supplement was nothing short of cruel.  They knew full well that hundreds of thousands of Canadian seniors were eligible for the supplement, but they did not get it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They knew this because of the income tax records of those Canadians. They knew full well that these Canadians, by virtue of the amount of money they earned from other sources, were eligible for this payment, but they took no steps to advise them of that. We had seniors living in abject poverty when they could have been receiving another $500 a month. There is a natural justice issue here.  These people had a right to know. Then when we called attention to this, they used the guise of the Privacy Act. They said that it would be a violation of a senior citizen's privacy, if Revenue Canada told HRDC that the person was eligible for this benefit</p><A NAME="T1255"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1255"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1300"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1250"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1255)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think seniors would complain if somebody advised them that they were eligible for another $300 to $500 a month when their income has to be lower than $12,000 a year to be  eligible. These are poorest of the poor, yet the government hid behind the guise of the Privacy Act so it did not have to give these seniors the benefits they were due. That did not happen because the Minister of HRDC was too busy and seized with other issues. That happened as a conscious choice of the government trying to pay down the deficit on the backs of the most vulnerable people in society. It is reprehensible, and I condemn the government in the strongest possible terms for that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An added irony to this is the Privacy Act does not seem to apply if a person who is collecting EI benefit crosses the border for a day. Let us say from my home town of Winnipeg, a person on EI crosses the border to buy some jeans in Fargo, North Dakota and comes back through the border. The border customs agent turns him or her in to employment insurance officers saying that the individual is on EI and is supposed to look for work all day, every day, not driving across the border to shop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Somehow it is not a violation of people's privacy to rat them out because they took an afternoon drive, but it is an invasion of privacy to advise senior citizens that they are eligible for a $500 a month guaranteed income supplement premium. What kind of pretzel logic is that?  That is what I mean when I said that some of these policies bordered on cruelty. They certainly were not designed in the best interests of Canadians. I do not know in whose interests they were designed, but it was not to benefit us to the maximum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I   would point out another thing. The government has paid down the deficit on the EI surplus. There is no secret there. The Auditor General reminds us of it all the time.   We went through riding by riding across country. When I say “we”, we hired professional pollsters to do this. They analyzed the impact, riding for riding. In my riding of Winnipeg Centre, the third poorest riding in the country, the cutbacks to EI alone cost $20.8 million a year. For people who were already at the margin, if not poor, this pushed a lot of people from the edge of being working poor to unemployed to abject poverty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imagine what we would do if we could attract an industry into our ridings that had a $20.8 million payroll. We would pave the streets with gold to attract businesses like that to our ridings. Those guys in the government cut that payroll out of my riding with one stroke of the pen, when they changed the EI provisions to where nobody qualified any more. No wonder there is a surplus  in EI. Nobody qualifies any more. We have to pay in, but we cannot pull out.  The government paid down the debt on the back of that surplus.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other thing on which the government paid  down the debt was the $30 billion cut from the Canada health and social transfers. Where did it get the remaining $30 billion? At the time I did this math, there was a $30 billion surplus in the EI fund  and the government announced a $100 billion tax cut. A further $30 billion came from the public sector pension plan. People forget  there was a huge surplus in that pension plan. It was built up largely because the government let go or fired a third of the Canada public service during those cutback years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rather than negotiate some sharing mechanism with the beneficiaries of the plan or simply admit that this was the employees' money, part of their wages and therefore their benefits should go up, the government took it all. The last act of Marcel Masse, when he was president of the Treasury Board, was to force, through closure, a bill through the House which gave the government the right to grab all $30 billion  out of the public service pension plan surplus, call it the property of the Government of Canada and put it into the general revenue.</p><A NAME="T1300"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1300"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1305"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1255"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1300)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is no secret that it did not take any good money management skills to pay down the debt and deficit.  The government took it out of EI from unemployed workers, the most vulnerable people in the economic force. It took it out of guaranteed income supplement payments to low income seniors.  It took it out of the public service employees pension plan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the   paucity of social development standards that we see in the previous government.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I rose today to say I support Bill C-22, I support having a minister perhaps responsible for social development.  However, I can serve notice right now that we will be holding the government to a standard.  We will have our own yardstick by which we will measure progress and that measurement will be this. Will there be less poor kids in my riding? Will anything we do in the House ever elevate the standards of poverty and living conditions of the people in my riding?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last thing I would point out is the face of poverty in my riding is by and large native. I can say without any hesitation and without any fear of contradiction, the overwhelming majority of the people living in poverty, and true abject poverty by anyone's definition, are off reserve aboriginal people who flock to the city in the hope of finding some measure of opportunity. In many cases they go from the days drudgery in their reserve to the inner city of Winnipeg.  Desperation is what they find when they arrive.  There is no social services network really left. There is a mere shadow of what it used to be when we used to talk about the just society.  We used to say that the number one priority of Parliament and of government was to elevate the standards of living conditions of its people. That seems to have been lost in the shuffle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, we had a decade of record profits in businesses and corporations and a decade of cutting, hacking and slashing.  What happened to the post-war labour compact? Perhaps our new Minister of Social Development would like to talk about that when the department gets  up and running.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the post-war years, there was a deal, a tacit agreement with labour that when productivity went up and when profits went up, workers' wages were  supposed to go up, thereby creating a burgeoning middle class, thereby having a healthy economy. That was thrown by the wayside. Somehow  the Liberals  decided they did not need to live up to their end of the bargain anymore. Now record profits do not justify any sharing with employees. In fact, it  justifies in their mind a screwing down of standards and labour laws and a reduction in the rate of unionization, the only effective tool for elevating the living conditions of most working people, with free collective bargaining.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am anxious to speak to our new Minister of Social Development when the new bureaucracy is fully engaged and up and running.  These are glaring shortcomings and oversights that we take note of on this side of the House.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have already said that in my riding, 47% of all the families live below the poverty line.  Overwhelmingly the face of poverty is native. The National Association of Friendship Centres is struggling to try to cope with servicing the needs of aboriginal people in the communities in Quebec and in other provinces in Canada. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been visited by the National Association of Friendship Centres.  It has said that it exists as a national chain of institutions. It is already up and running. It is a structure that could  deliver some of these services to non-status, off reserve and Métis people who are floundering in the inner cities, needing assistance to get into the mainstream economy, whether it is life skills training of access to adequate housing, et cetera.  Many of these services could be delivered through the Association of Friendship Centres were there the political will to do so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rather than set up any new bureaucracy and  try to invent new institutions to deliver services to low income aboriginal people in the inner city of all of our major cities, I urge the new minister to forge a relationship with the National Association of Friendship Centres.  It might form some kind of a service delivery contract, single window operation to reach out to people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In closing, we expect the new Department of Social Development and the new Minister of Social Development to set targets for social indications of progress in the same way that the government set targets to eliminate the deficit and tackle the debt.   We want to see new targets and a new yardstick to measure progress which results in less kids living in poverty and a better standard of living in our inner cities. That is something that we could be proud of as members of Parliament if we use that as our indication of progress as Canadians.</p><A NAME="T1305"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1305"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1310"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1300"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1305)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1038349"></A><a HREF="#Int-1038437"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1038339"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was listening very carefully to the hon. member's speech and to some of his comments on some of the issues that we will be tackling, together  I hope, both on the committee and   within the lifespan of this Parliament.  He  raised some very important issues with which we will struggle and, as a new ministry, we will learn.   As  I have always said, we always must learn from the past.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A question that came up earlier concerned the seniors' supplement. I think the minute   the government  knew  there was a problem  it  put measures in place to assure that ever senior who was entitled to the supplement   received the supplement.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians who are listening to the debate  should know that   1.5 million seniors    receive over $5 billion in guaranteed income supplement benefits  and that since 2002, 285,000 letters were mailed out by the department to seniors who had not applied for the supplement and who might be eligible. Letters and personalized application forms using our tax system were used and over 172,000 more people subscribed.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the responsibility of every one of us in the chamber to make sure that even if there is one senior who is entitled to the guaranteed income supplement   that the senior will have access to it.  I put out a householder  encouraging them to do so. If any member in the House knows of any senior who is not receiving  the supplement and should be,   I encourage them  to please let the department and the minister know.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also want to talk about eliminating poverty because   it has been an issue in the House for far too long. Even if one child lives in poverty, we cannot be proud of that.  We must make sure that we eradicate the social deficit, as the hon. member said, and as effectively as we eliminated the economic deficit in the country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After  the report of campaign 2000, certain measures were   taken to decrease  child poverty and poverty in general in the country.   The opposition members referred to the $5 billion that is on the table  for the national child care program.  They said that it was a very good initiative and that we should be putting money on the table for  a national child care and early learning system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We  did  introduce  the Canada child tax benefit which has provided $7.7 billion in income support to low and middle income families. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The  member talked a lot about the poverty issue.   Besides the fact that we have put measures in place  and that campaign 2000 said that these measures were in the right direction, would the member  say that the establishment of this new ministry is a step in the right direction in terms of assuring that programs and services will be--</p><A NAME="T1310"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1310"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1315"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1305"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1310)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not believe   we have done enough to make sure that everyone who is eligible for the guaranteed income supplement is getting it.  It  really is not up to members of Parliament to knock on every door and ask seniors whether they  may be eligible for this. The government is the one that knows who they are, how much they make  and whether they are eligible. It is through their income tax returns that the government can  see quite plainly if a person is making less than the $12,000 a year, or whatever the cutoff is, if they are eligible and how much they are eligible for.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the  onus is  on  government to make sure   it gets this necessary income supplement to everyone  who is eligible for it.</p><A NAME="Int-1038356"></A><a HREF="#Int-1038358"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1038354"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Andrew Scheer (Regina—Qu'Appelle, CPC): </b>Mr. Speaker, I   have a quick question for the hon. member for Winnipeg Centre.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He spoke a lot about  the damage done to his riding when social development programs are not applied equally.  However I think the tone of his party in particular is very discouraging. He referred to it as an industry in his riding.   </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would the member  not agree that the best way to address  poverty line issues and child poverty would be to  create jobs in the areas that need them, and that instead of having an industry of public programs and social assistance, to pursue economic policies that would actually result in the creation of new jobs?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my riding  in Saskatchewan, which, unfortunately, is under a regime of socialism and communism, the  jobs are not there because  the policies of the NDP, which  we have seen   federally and provincially, discourage the creation of jobs and drive business out of those areas  and then we see a further cycle of dependence on public programs and social assistance.</p><A NAME="Int-1038358"></A><a HREF="#Int-1038361"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1038356"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Pat Martin: </b>What an idiot.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously our first choice is to have opportunities for work for everyone.  I can point to one thing that would point us in that direction. On the desk of the Minister of Finance  right now   is a duty remission order that he could sign that  would extend the duty remission for garment manufacturers for a further seven years. I have  43 garment manufacturers in my riding and many of them do employ immigrants and aboriginal people who come into my riding looking for work, but they will  topple like dominoes if the Minister of Finance does not sign the duty remission order  because the garment industry needs that support while it transitions to the stresses of the new global marketplace.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with him that jobs are the number one priority and that the best social program in the world is a job, but the Minister of Finance could help us in that regard in my area by signing that duty remission order ASAP.</p><A NAME="T1315"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1315"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1320"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1310"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1315)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

It was very interesting. I had the opportunity to visit his riding not long ago, during the symposium on child care. I found that, even though Winnipeg may be poor, it is a city where people are very welcoming and generous. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My riding is also very poor. There are people who, for the most part, are on welfare because they are not entitled to employment insurance benefits. We certainly wonder why the government wants to create a new department when it is not even able to meet the needs and demands of the people who are entitled to EI benefits because they have been paying premiums for years. This is insurance, not a program that the government is paying for. It is the people who are paying for this.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder how my colleague can think that his province is unable to provide social and community services to its citizens, when the government that would want to do so, the federal government, is unable to manage its own programs or to solve problems such as mad cow disease, the softwood lumber dispute and scabs. These are very important issues that fall under its jurisdiction. How can the member believe that this government would be better than his own provincial government at solving the problems in his province?</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canada health and social transfer has been an abject failure in terms of block funding for post-secondary education, health care and social services.  Perhaps through this new Minister of Social Development we will be able to argue that basic needs in our communities are not being met by their current structure, their current policy and their current miserly treatment in the transfer of money to the provinces so that we can deliver those programs in our own jurisdictions.</p>
<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><A NAME="Int-1038365"></A><a HREF="#Int-1038369"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1038363"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Jean-Claude D'Amours (Madawaska—Restigouche, Lib.): </b>Mr. Speaker,  last December, the Government of Canada established the Department of Social Development to provide a centre of expertise for social policies and programs, thereby enabling Canada to maintain and strengthen its reputation as a nation that cares about the well-being of its population.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past 10 months, Social Development Canada has taken bold steps in support of its mandate. Now, in introducing a bill to provide a legal basis for the department, we are building on the work accomplished and laying the foundation for a more aggressive approach to social issues at the federal level. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With its 161,000 non-profit organizations, the Canadian volunteer sector represents both a social and economic force in our country. Once again, I want to stress that, when we say that there are 161,000 non-profit organizations across the country, we have to pay attention to this great force.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The basic purpose of  volunteer work and non-profit organizations is to ensure that we can  help not only our region, our city or our province progress further, but the whole country. It is therefore extremely important to work with and support these organizations which, in practice,   make a useful contribution, very often, in more specific ways than the government or other institutions could.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Non-profit organizations, including charities, provide a full range of services to meet human needs: child care, elder care and youth recreation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many organizations focus their efforts on the members of    groups which are often marginalized, such as persons with disabilities, aboriginal people and new immigrants. They provide services such as education and training, housing and shelter, and   places of worship. In so doing, they improve the quality of life of millions of Canadians.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While providing essential services, non-profit organizations also give Canadians an opportunity to reach out to their fellow citizens. Newcomers to Canada, for instance, get acquainted with their   adoptive country through volunteer work, not to mention that this is an opportunity for all these newcomers  to gain valuable and fulfilling work experience. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All in all, more than six million Canadians give their time to non-profit or community organizations. This is a donation of more than deux billion hours of work every year. I want to say that despite my full schedule, both in the past and the present, I have taken part in voluntary activities many times. I thought it was very important, not for myself, but like those millions of other Canadians, in order to help and encourage the rest of the population. In fact, when we belong to an organization that provides assistance to the public, we are certainly not doing it for our own personal good.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The assistance provided to these organizations is often dismissed as marginal. Nevertheless, we must never forget that without the concern of the people who keep voluntary organizations and volunteerism going, it would be even more difficult to ensure that everyone in our country is very well taken care of.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two billion hours of work is a great deal. The Canadian people give many hours of their time so that everyone in Canada can benefit. Two billion hours of work per year is quite a contribution for the entire population of Canada and for its well-being.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether they are delivering meals to seniors in their homes, coaching in minor league sports or offering respite care for families in need, our volunteers are doing essential work that reflects well on Canada's dynamic communities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we talk about delivering meals, I would just like to point out that in my home region the Canadian Red Cross offers this service. But the service does not appear simply by saying, “We will do it”. It can only be provided by hundreds of volunteers all over Canada who donate their time and energy to help those who need it most.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our volunteers also contribute to community life outside Canada's borders. They give their time to organizations that create awareness of the need for pollution controls, that establish bridges of hope and understanding between cultures, and that increase the ability of developing countries to help themselves.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These actions show compassion and well-understood personal interest. Once again, I have been aware for a number of years of the importance of working with these organizations and with the people who are attracted to them. It makes it possible for us, in our communities, to ensure that we can help others with needs greater than ours, and contributes to social progress in this country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the day, what is given comes back. In other words, as sustainable development takes root in these countries, the entire Canadian population will benefit from the emergence of a safer world that is more stable and more prosperous.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The not for profit and community organizations in Canada are important allies in creating solid and dynamic communities. Not only do they fill a real and growing need, but they speak on behalf of the most vulnerable in Canadian society. Since they are close to  ordinary people, they give the government valuable information that can help improve social policy.</p><A NAME="T1320"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1320"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1325"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1315"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1320)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I say they give the government valuable information, I believe that it is important,  as parliamentarians, to take some time to talk to these people and get involved in these organizations in order to have a better understanding. That is not to say we do not understand. Nonetheless, we have to make sure we have a better understanding of the needs and the benefits of the not-for-profit organizations  that work in the volunteer and community sector. This will facilitate the establishment of a link to  provide information to the government so that we can move closer toward really  good social policies, as we are doing today. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The volunteer and community sector is at the heart of what is most often called the social economy. It includes all the not-for-profit companies and activities utilizing people and companies to benefit communities across the country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Canada, some 10,000 social enterprises and organizations  employ roughly 100,000 people and produce  $20 billion in annual revenues. This is extremely significant in terms of revenues, but even more significant in terms of  the number of people who have the opportunity to work at these social enterprises. Some 10,000 people working at 100,000 companies is significant, and it is extremely important to recognize and promote these  companies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government is determined to foster the social economy. In fact, it has already started to  reach its budget commitments of 2004 in this regard. The funding has been allocated to three priority areas. First, there is $100 million over five years in support of financial initiatives that will increase lending to social economy enterprises. As I mentioned, we can see that this contribution is important to help these social economy enterprises move forward and prosper in the country.The funding in the second initiative includes $17 million over two years for a pilot project for strategic planning and capacity building of community economic development organizations. Finally, in the third initiative, $15 million over five years will go to the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council in support of community based research on the social economy. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is extremely important to recognize these social economy enterprises and the importance of social economy in this country. It is important to recognize them because, often, they do not get the attention, but people need a little help that is often more moral than financial. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This investment in the social economy will total $132 million. However, funding is not enough. The government is committed to helping foster the environment that supports social economy enterprises. To this end, as the Speech from the Throne said, the government introduced a new  Not-for-Profit Corporations Act, an initiative of Industry Canada.</p><A NAME="T1325"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1325"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1330"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1320"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1325)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new legislation will modernize the regulatory framework, increase public confidence and streamline rules for charities. It will help create the necessary conditions so that social economy enterprises can prosper. In principle, everyone will benefit, since these enterprises put their surpluses back into the community.   </p><A NAME="T1330"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1330"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1335"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1325"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1330)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1038369"></A><a HREF="#Int-1038376"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1038365"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Marcel Proulx): </b>It being 1:30 p.m., the House will now proceed to the consideration of private members' business as listed on today's Order Paper.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said: Mr. Speaker, Bill C-259 is an act to eliminate the excise tax on jewellery.  I think it is instructive to read the brief preamble and the actual legislative change in the bill, but before doing so I would like to say that I have had the bill in the hopper for a number of years.  It is finally coming before the House largely as a result of the fact that we have changed the the way we draw bills.  I was fortunate enough to win the lottery from the standpoint that my bill was picked sixth in this Parliament for private members' business.  I feel quite blessed in that regard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-259 is now a timely bill.   When I first put it forward, we were dealing with a circumstance where this change had been promoted by the jewellery industry for decades, if not generations.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now what has really changed is that we have everyone involved, right from the mining industry through to the retailer who has anything to do with diamonds and/or jewellery of all kinds, including costume jewellery.  They are all now involved in this.  Any item deemed to be jewellery that is sold at retail for more than $3 is subject to this tax.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since I first introduced the bill in the House two Parliaments ago, Canada has become a diamond powerhouse, so the urgency of removing this anachronism of a tax is greater than it has ever been.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The preamble of the bill states: </p>

</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is pretty simple.  The preamble actually says a lot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is what Canada is currently doing. If we have an item manufactured outside of Canada and imported into Canada and it is identical to an item  manufactured in Canada, we tax the made in Canada item and do not tax the item coming from outside.  This is obviously killing jobs. The excise tax on jewellery is a 10% levy paid by manufacturers on the sale price of items manufactured in Canada and by importers on the duty paid value of imports.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House of Commons finance committee reported in 1996 that the tax was an anachronism and concluded that it should be abolished.  It said the same thing in 2004. The revenue collected from the tax in 2003 was $87 million.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the growth in the diamond industry, it is now producing government revenues at current rates of about $500 million a year.  Canada is currently the third largest manufacturer of diamonds in the world.  By the year 2012, Canada is going to be the number one producer in the world.  Government revenues from this burgeoning industry are far more than the much smaller revenues that are coming in as a consequence of this unfair and discriminatory tax.</p><A NAME="T1335"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1335"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1340"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1330"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1335)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The average Canadian household spends about $170 per year on taxable jewellery, so the average Canadian is affected by this tax.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The threshold for defining taxable jewellery is items that cost more than $3.  Therefore, on every jewellery imitation at a Kmart or a Zellers or a Wal-Mart, the tax applies in Canada, but of course that tax does not apply in those same stores in the U.S. We are penalizing ourselves and driving business across the border, where even expensive jewellery can avoid the taxation because people bring it back under the $750 tax exemption for returning residents.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steven Parker appeared before the finance committee.  He is a small business jewellery manufacturer based in Vancouver, whose company employs about 20 full time people making wedding rings, family rings, earrings and necklaces. He had these observations about the tax.  He is at a tax disadvantage compared to imported products because the 10% tax applies to all his costs, including marketing, distribution, manufacturing and payroll costs.  He can import and have a lower cost base that he applies the 10% tax to; it would be based on landed value only.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steven Parker and others would manufacture more jewellery in Canada.  Two large Canadian jewellery manufacturers relocated outside the country since the 1998 investigation by the finance committee simply because they got tired of waiting for the government to remove this excise tax.  They concluded it was not going to happen.  The companies were tired of being undercut by manufacturers outside of Canada, so they relocated. This tax is demonstrably killing jobs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About one-half of the jewellery sold by value in Canada contains diamonds.  Saskatchewan will soon be joining the Northwest Territories as a world class diamond producer.  Any of the premiers who are involved in jurisdictions where diamond production is either present or about to be are calling for the removal of this tax.  It is pre-empting local jewellery manufacture.  It is pre-empting tourists buying jewellery made in Canada because they know they can get it cheaper elsewhere.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Mining Association of Canada said this in May of this year:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>In less than a decade, Canada has emerged as a diamond powerhouse...By providing the right mix of fiscal and regulatory policies, governments have the opportunity to maximize the contribution of Canada's diamond industry to the benefit of all Canadians.</small></td>

</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the key recommendations is “eliminating the federal excise tax on jewellery”.  There is virtual unanimity on this subject.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the application of this tax is an art, not a science.  It is applied unevenly. This is very threatening to businesses that are looking for predictability on their taxation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The finance committee this year heard from Mo Charania of Ottawa, a third generation jeweller with five stores.  In 1999 he had an excise audit covering the previous three years.  He was assessed over $800,000 in excise tax and was prepared to wrap up his business because that was a bill he could not pay. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon investigation of discrepancies and other ways to interpret the tax, especially in terms of how a manufacturer is defined, in his case, because of  these discrepancies and differences they were able to reduce his tax bill to $340,000, which meant having to sell only a couple of the five stores in order to pay the bill.  I say “only” rather satirically.</p><A NAME="T1340"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1340"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1345"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1335"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1340)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon further investigation, it became apparent that other companies were not being assessed by the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency because of an administrative policy created outside of the legislation which allows the excise to be paid at a discounted value for multiple items of the same article produced for retail.  By application of this formula, it was not an $800,000 bill, nor was it a $340,000 bill.  In fact, Mr. Charania would receive a credit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This tax is incredibly complicated and very subjective in its application.  On the part of the business owner, it often requires manual tracking rather than computerized tracking because of these characteristics. Also, it is subject to different opinions of and rulings by different auditors and people within CCRA.  That is why CCRA has created a guide on how to apply it that is outside of the legislation. Only some of the businesses to whom this tax is being applied are even aware this guide exists. Obviously not all of the auditors, even with that interpretive document, operate the same way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is fairly easy to summarize many of the reasons why we should axe this tax. Consumers are paying a hidden luxury tax for non-luxury items.  We can hardly describe a $3 item of costume jewellery as a luxury item.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadian jewellery retailers and manufacturers are discriminated against. Canadian jobs are lost.  Canada will soon be the largest producer of diamonds in the world and our diamonds will cost more in Canada than anywhere else.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The finance committee has recommended that the tax be abolished.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First nations want the tax abolished; they are important participants in the diamond industry at the mining level and also increasingly in the value added participation. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A really important aspect is that retaining this tax is driving the jewellery industry in Canada underground.  The volume of illegal evasion and legal avoidance of the tax is estimated to be in the range of 50% of recorded sales or larger.  In 1990 recorded sales were $2.3 billion, just to give a benchmark of what kind of numbers we are talking about. When we get that kind of avoidance or evasion, the GST is also completely avoided, which means that in all likelihood this tax is actually revenue negative for the government and an incredible burden for the business community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is time to axe this tax.  I have a letter from the member from Oak Ridges completely agreeing with my statement.  That is dated January 30 of this year.  I have a letter from the chair of the Manitoba caucus completely agreeing with my position.  That is dated February 6 of this year. I have a letter from the minister of resources for the Northwest Territories that says the same thing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My time is up, Mr. Speaker.</p><A NAME="T1345"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1345"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1350"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1340"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1345)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1038388"></A><a HREF="#Int-1038391"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1038376"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore—St. Margaret's, CPC): </b>Mr. Speaker, my colleague has done an absolutely stellar job of bringing forth this bill.

We hear a lot of talk and speculation by the Prime Minister, of course it is when he is abroad,  on  making Yukon, the NWT and Nunavut into  provinces, but no discussion from him on how these territories should fund their provincial governments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, with the burgeoning diamond industry in the north, well instituted mining industries throughout the north, this would be one source of revenue for them and we hear about value added every day in this country. We tell all of our producers that we must have value added, yet we have a punishing tax that the government has done absolutely nothing about.</p><A NAME="Int-1038391"></A><a HREF="#Int-1038394"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1038388"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. John Duncan: </b>Mr. Speaker, my colleague's comments allow me to say a couple of things I forgot to say. My colleague from Durham, who seconded this motion, talked about a jeweller family, Hooper's Jewellery, which has been operating for 60 years and for the last two generations, the owners have wanted this excise tax removed. This tax has been there for 86 years. I know in the case of my own community, Preston Jewellers has been fighting this tax and I continue to receive letters concerning this issue. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People have made such good cases in the last 10 years on several occasions before the finance committee and with their own independently commissioned reports and submissions to the finance department.  They felt the case was so strong and the promises were so strong, that when there was no delivery at budget time, they have actually given up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This private member's bill has reawakened  some real optimism and they are thinking that this time it might really happen. It is rather inconceivable that members from all parties in the House of Commons are going to reject this notion. The tax is an anachronism.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of the north and the provinces, the Premier of the Northwest Territories has stated publicly his real concern on several occasions. There is  a burgeoning diamond industry and the Northwest Territories is getting about 4% return on the royalties. It is the same argument for the east coast offshore oil and gas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the east coast offshore oil and gas debate I empathized with Premier Handley's position because eventually the provinces, the territories and industry will find other alternatives or these ventures will not proceed simply because they are not the beneficiary.  It is too indirect when the moneys go to the federal authority and then the federal authority transfers them back on a different basis and reduces or increases them on a one to one basis based on the royalties.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not a happy situation and needs to change. My bill does not address the bigger question. It only addresses abolishing this tax.</p>

Eleni Bakopanos (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Social Development (Social Economy), Lib.): </b>Mr. Speaker, Bill C-259 proposes the repeal of the excise tax on jewellery.  I am pleased to have the opportunity to respond to this proposal having worked with my colleague, the former parliamentary secretary to the minister of finance, as well as my colleagues on the finance committee and the Liberal caucus on this very important issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jewellery and watch products are the only products that are subject to a hidden luxury tax.  I agree with the Canadian Jewellers' Association, with which I have worked  with for the last five years, including its former president, Mr. Pierre Akkelian,  that the federal government is discriminating against this industry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people believe that we are attempting to remove a luxury tax, yet this tax applies to inexpensive jewellery.  Jewellery is not luxury.  One in three households buy jewellery and the average household in Canada spends less than $130 annually, the hon. member said $170,   on jewellery and watches.  The average expenditure   in fact for a female is actually  $98 and for  a male it is  $36, according to statistics that were furnished by Ernst and Young.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four million to five million households bought jewellery in 2001 and most of them are low and middle income households.  Low and middle income households account for   50% of the sales of jewellery.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my culture, being of Greek descent, we always buy jewellery for every newborn child.  The grandmother tends to buy jewellery, under $100 normally, and gives this as a gift to the child. Looking at the statistics, it is very strange that we would in fact tax a wedding band that costs sometimes around $100 or $200, perhaps more, and we do not impose an excise tax on the wedding gown that costs maybe $1,000 or $2,000.  So there is some incongruity in terms of our tax system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A single mother, for instance, may buy a pearl necklace. It is important to keep in mind that it is not a luxury tax.  It is in fact something that would help low and middle income families. As I said, in my culture, it is an automatic thing  to do.  We normally   buy some jewellery for our children.  The average receipt, even from a chain like Birks  Canada, is under $400.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, other true luxury items, and I have always pointed this out to both the present Minister of Finance and the former ministers of finance, such as yachts, expensive cars, designer clothing are all exempt from this tax. In my opinion this tax should be abolished.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a starting point, I would note that this private member's bill is one of 15 such bills that have been tabled in the current session, each of which requests some form of tax relief in specific circumstances.  The proposed measures cover a broad range of initiatives, such as the income tax treatment of adoption expenses, herbal remedies, and fees paid for participation in physical activity or amateur sport. I understand that additional private members' bills proposing tax relief are waiting to be tabled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There can be little doubt that these proposals reflect genuine concerns about  how Canadians interact with and are affected by the taxation system. At the same time, it must be recognized that each and every one of these proposals carries a cost to the fiscal framework.  In fact, the 15 private members' bills amount to $2.5 billion per year.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the fiscal cost that is associated with these private members' bills, one must also consider the difficulties that they may pose for the integrity and robustness of the taxation system and fiscal framework that the government works under.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taken in isolation, any one of the private members' bills may raise important issues  and  express intentions that deserve attention and investigation.    I am already on the record that I agree with the removal of this tax.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we should not lose sight of, however,  is the cumulative effect that a series of such bills could have on the taxation system.  Individual proposals, even those with a relatively modest fiscal cost, could result in an inequity vis-à-vis other taxpayers who would then need to have their circumstances reviewed.  Proposals that are evaluated on a stand-alone basis may have unintended consequences or create difficult precedents. A series of such measures may well increase the complexity also of the taxation system or even create opportunities for tax avoidance and evasion, as the hon. member has stated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the basis of these considerations, I would suggest that a certain degree of caution is appropriate on the part of the government in terms of studying this bill lest the government lose sight of its longstanding commitment to fiscal responsibility.  If there is something that we have come into government to do, it is fiscal responsibility.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the hallmarks of the annual budget process is the consultation that takes place with the government asking Canadians for their input to help determine the difficult choices that must be made among competing priorities.  Every year, as the hon. member pointed out, the Canadian Jewellers' Association has come before the finance committee with  at least two reports, if I am not mistaken because I am not a member,   that have  suggested that the government do remove this tax. Both the Liberal members and the chairs, who were Liberal, agreed and there was, I believe, all party agreement. </p><A NAME="T1355"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1355"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1400"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1350"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1355)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In  its May 5, 2004 appearance before the finance committee, the Canadian Jewellers' Association reiterated its request for a repeal of this tax and raised several concerns about this tax. As the hon. member said, the act's  $3 tax threshold suggests that the federal excise tax on jewellery is a remnant from a bygone era, something that was once considered a luxury but is no longer considered a luxury. It is the only remaining luxury tax still levied by the federal government</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While taxes on alcohol and tobacco can  be justified, rightly or wrongly, for health promotion reasons, there seems to be little justification for the excise tax on jewellery as a luxury tax, since other luxuries, as I mentioned earlier, do not face a similar tax. Furthermore, according to the association, because Canada's tax system largely moved away from excise taxes with the replacement of the complex manufacturers' sales tax with the more transparent GST, the CRA no longer has the ability to administer a tax as complex as the federal excise tax on jewellery.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In its presentation to the committee, the Department of Finance disagreed with the characterization of the federal excise tax on jewellery as a luxury tax, noting that “most jewellery sold in Canada is relatively inexpensive and purchased by average consumers”. The department agreed, however, with the Canadian Jewellers' Association that the tax favours imported jewellery over domestically manufactured jewellery and that deficiencies in the tax “make it prone to tax avoidance and evasion”.  The department has agreed with everything that we have said so far. According to the department, if “the jewellery excise tax were not already in place, it is less than certain that Parliament would want to legislate one today”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to add a point that perhaps was not raised by the hon. member. The president of the World Jewellery Confederation, CIBJO, wrote to the Prime Minister and stated that Canada was the last remaining country to have a jewellery tax. Australia and Russia have removed it because of the diamond industry and we are the last remaining country with this tax. Canada cannot be competitive internationally because of this excise tax. As a member of Parliament, I have had the opportunity to make recommendations to the finance committee.  The elimination of the jewellery excise tax is one of the issues that I have raised and supported.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To assist the government in its support for small business, following up on budget 2004, the Minister of Finance wrote to the chair of the finance committee asking that the committee take an active role in assessing the merits of a number of measures proposed to support business. The finance committee has recently delivered its second report dealing with excise duties and taxes as they affect vintners, small brewers and jewellers. The report from the committee recommends some form of tax relief for each of these three industries, including a recommendation to phase out the excise tax on jewellery over a five year period.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In delivering its report, the finance committee is mindful of the need to assess competing priorities and the fact that limited fiscal resources are available, but the committee is making a  recommendation to the minister. The government supports small business and will continue to review measures to improve the environment for small business to succeed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note that the private member's bill also proposes to eliminate the excise tax on jewellery and makes particular note of Canada's role as a diamond producing nation. I want to put on the record that I agree with the hon. member's statement that Canada is a diamond producing nation and we must be competitive. We are known worldwide as having an exceptionally good diamond industry. I agree with his comments that we will continue to help, especially in aboriginal communities. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mining exploration in Canada, including diamonds, should be supported by targeted income tax provisions designed to recognize the special operating environment of this capital intensive and high risk industry. Provisions include the write-off for capital costs and the carry forward of resource deductions.  Exploration companies also derive considerable benefit from the ability to flow expenses that would not otherwise be claimable within the company to investors in flow through shares.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has taken several recent actions to improve the taxation of the resource sector. I will end by saying that I agree with the hon. member. Liberal members and other members of the finance committee have been supportive of the removal of this measure.</p><A NAME="T1400"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1400"><!-- Hour: 2--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1405"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1355"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1400)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

When we think of jewels, we think of James Bond in <i>Diamonds  are Forever</i>, or Marilyn Monroe singing <i>Diamonds are a girl's best friend</i>.  Unfortunately, I do not think today that I would have got far offering Marilyn a $5 diamond.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada and Quebec both have their jewellery industries.  This is why I will be supporting Bill C-259 of my colleague for Vancouver Island North.  In Canada, the jewellery industry has a total worth of $1.2 billion, most of this is concentrated in small and medium businesses.  Some 4,500 companies employ a total of 35,000 people.  In Quebec there are about 9,000 such workers in 1,200 companies. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As has been pointed out, hon. members need to keep in  mind that this excise tax was created in 1918 to help with the war effort.  We won that war, but unfortunately that tax, like many others, although meant to be temporary, had a tendency to put down roots and is still with us.   I would give just one other example of such a tax: the income tax that was inaugurated during the second world war. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, at that time, it was a tax on luxury goods, such as  jewels and watches. While a $3 item of jewellery was a luxury item in 1918, as was mentioned earlier today, it is no longer the case today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what exactly is the excise tax? According to the Excise Tax Act, it  is a federal tax collected on goods that are imported, or made or produced in Canada, based on the duty paid value of imports, or the sale price in the case of the item made or produced in Canada. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will give all three examples, although the bill only applies to jewels. People at that time spoke of 10% of the portion of the selling price or duty paid value over $50 of clocks and watches for  household or personal use, except railway men's watches, another example of the anachronism of those regulations, and watches specially designed for the use of the blind.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also 10% on all kinds of articles made in whole or in part of ivory, black amber, amber, coral, mother of pearl, natural shells, tortoise shell, jade, onyx, lapis lazuli or other semi-precious stones. Finally, something pertains a little  more specifically to us, it is 10% on articles commercially known as jewellery, whether real or imitation, including diamonds and other precious or semi-precious stones for personal use or for adornment of the person, and goldsmiths' and silversmiths' products except gold-plated or silver-plated ware for the preparation or serving of food or drink.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, there is no denying that this tax no longer plays a role at all. We are talking about $3. I have three children who regularly ask me for some change on the weekend. They come back, indeed, with trinkets and some jewels from the discount store. I am surprised to think that they paid a 10% tax on the value of a good for which they may have paid $4 in the first place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Worse yet, the cost of administering this tax is not known with certainty. According to the Canada Revenue Agency, its administration would cost a maximum of $1.5 million a year.    However, it has to be mentioned that the Canadian Jewellers Association told the Standing Finance Committee that administering this tax would cost somewhere between $7 million  and $14 million. I agree that there is a very wide gap, but given the often erroneous forecasts by the finance department, I would be inclined to grant more credibility on this issue to the Canadian Jewellers Association.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would appear increasingly unjustified to collect such a tax on jewels as luxury items. In the current context, in other words in 2004 and no longer in 1918, other luxury items are not treated this way. One could mention, only as an example, yachts, estates, mink coats, caviar and champagne. Nowadays, they are considered luxury items, but they do not come under the scope of this tax.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Liberal colleague took great pleasure in mentioning the whole gamut of measures proposed in various private members' bills which increased the costs for the government. I can understand why the government is concerned to some extent, as this excise tax generates roughly $55 million in its coffers.</p><A NAME="T1405"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1405"><!-- Hour: 2--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1410"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1400"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1405)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the government is really concerned about how to make up for this loss of income, allow me to remind it that the Minister of Finance is  planning to put  $31.5 billion in the contingency reserve over the next five years. So, I do not think that a little $55 million will jeopardize the government's balanced budgets. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of its representations to the Standing Committee on Finance, the Canadian Jewellers Association pointed out, among other things,  that  while the jewellery excise tax applies only to imported and national items, Canadian jewellers are facing a relatively higher tax bite for three reasons. First, the duty paid value is generally lower for importers than    the sales price of Canadian items of jewellery. Second, the popularity of Internet   sales makes it easier to order from abroad jewellery that is then imported into Canada, while avoiding—bearing in mind that this is legal—duty and taxes. Third, the excise tax is in fact a tax on stocks in the sense that it limits the quantity of jewellery that a dealer may stock, display and sell.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to reiterate something the Liberal member opposite said in her speech because I thought it was important. She said that in her presentation to the Standing Committee on Finance, the Department of Finance and the  Canadian Jewellers Association agreed that the tax favours imported jewellery over domestically manufactured jewellery and that deficiencies in the tax make it prone to tax avoidance and evasion. According to the department, if the jewellery excise tax were not already in place, it is less than certain that Parliament would want to legislate one today. I doubt it as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why we feel that the federal jewellery excise tax is outdated: it no longer meets any social policy objective nor it have the characteristics a tax should have. What are those characteristics? They are: fairness, effectiveness, ease of administration and transparency.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that this tax has a negative impact on employment and the viability of the jewellery sector. Even the provincial, Quebec, and territorial ministers of mining agree that this tax should be eliminated in order to encourage the retail sale of diamonds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Representations have been made over the last few years by various stakeholders. In committee, the Bloc Québécois, among others, expressed its position a number of times on this issue. Also, back in 1996, the Standing Committee on Finance proposed various recommendations to eliminate this excise tax, and these recommendations were adopted. I sincerely hope that Bill C-259 will be passed by the House. We will support this legislation.</p><A NAME="T1410"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1410"><!-- Hour: 2--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1415"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1405"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1410)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

Ed Broadbent (Ottawa Centre, NDP): </b>Mr. Speaker, all the arguments in favour of the bill, notably by the mover himself, have already been made and I will be brief in reasserting a number of those to explain why my party gives its support, as it did at the committee stage, for the bill.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As has been pointed out, this tax was first introduced in 1918  and, as my colleague from the Bloc has just said, it remains an anomaly. With the tax system now it is the only luxury tax left in the country. As a result of this tax, diamonds mined in Canada cost more here in our country than anywhere else in the world, which  is ridiculous. We have become recently the world's third largest supplier in value of rough gem quality diamonds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Northwest Territories   a boom is going on. Currently  some 47 different mining exploration projects are going on in that part of the country alone. It is an important basic industry for us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our jewellery industry employs some 40,000 people in over 5,000 businesses, many of which are small businesses and a number of which are cottage industries in small communities that are disadvantaged by this tax.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, we support the bill because removing the tax simply makes sense for Canadians,  Canadians who mine diamonds, small businesses that sell jewellery  and Canadian consumers wherever they may live.</p><A NAME="Int-1038410"></A><a HREF="#Int-1038417"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1038405"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Lloyd St. Amand (Brant, Lib.): </b>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to deliver comments to private member's Bill C-259, which asks hon. members to repeal the excise tax on jewellery.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first point I would like to make concerns the importance of private members' bills.  The proposals that are put forward by individual members represent an important link between Canadians, their elected representatives and our parliamentary process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where private members' bills affect the taxation system, as is the case with Bill C-259, it is especially important that the government take careful note of the intentions that are being expressed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present case, the idea is to repeal the excise tax on jewellery, a long standing federal tax that raises in the order of $85 million per year.  Repeal of this tax is being put forward as a means of providing relief for the jewellery industry.  Private member's Bill C-259 also makes special note of Canada's  status as a diamond producing nation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to address each of these points in turn, starting with the excise tax on jewellery as a tax that  affects small business in Canada.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government supports small business in Canada and continues to review measures to improve the environment for small businesses to succeed.  Indeed, the suggestions from entrepreneurs and small businesses have formed an important part of the budget consultation process over the past recent years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to assist the government in identifying the best options for future consideration from among the many competing priorities, the government requested in budget 2004 that the Standing Committee on Finance undertake the important role of assessing the merits of a number of measures proposed to support small business.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, in October 2004, the finance committee delivered its second report highlighting the role of excise duties and taxes as they affect Canadian winemakers, small brewers and jewellers. The committee recommended that tax relief should be provided to each of these industries including a recommendation that the 10% excise tax on jewellery be phased out over a five year period.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the finance committee noted that there are many other instances where small businesses would benefit from appropriate tax changes and that the number of worthy proposals far exceeds the capacity of the government to fund these changes in a fiscally responsible manner.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this context, it is interesting to note that there are currently 15 private members' bills affecting the taxation system that  have been tabled in the current session.  The estimated fiscal cost of these proposals is as much as $2.5 billion per year.  I understand that additional bills are in line to be tabled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly, with such a great range and breadth of requests for relief, it is incumbent on the government that these proposals be managed in the context of a comprehensive approach to tax policy and fiscal planning.  Individual proposals must be evaluated through a process that carefully assesses competing priorities with a view to preserving the fundamental principle of fiscal responsibility.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against this backdrop, the report from the finance committee will receive very careful consideration, as will other proposals for tax relief that  are received during the budget consultation cycle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to now address Canada's role as a diamond producing nation.  The emergence of this industry in Canada has been nothing short of remarkable.  With exploration expenditures of more than $1.5 billion over the last 10 years and the establishment of two worldclass mines in the Northwest Territories, Canada now accounts for about 15% of world diamond production and is the third largest producer by value after Russia and Botswana.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada has a long tradition of mining and exploration, along with a number of important tax provisions that are designed to recognize the unique operating characteristics of the industry.   </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These provisions include writeoff for capital costs and the carry forward of resource deductions.  Another important feature of the mining taxation regime is the ability of exploration companies to flow expenses that would not otherwise be claimable through to investors in flow-through shares.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has recently taken action to improve the taxation of the resource sector, including a number of measures that were announced in budget 2003: reducing the corporate tax rate on resource income; phasing in a new 10% tax credit for exploration and pre-production expenses relating to diamonds and other qualifying minerals; and phasing out the federal capital tax, an important measure for capital intensive industries such as mining. </p><A NAME="T1415"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1415"><!-- Hour: 2--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1420"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1410"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1415)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For its part, the excise tax on jewellery poses no competitive disadvantage to the Canadian mining industry as exports are not subject to the tax. In sum, the mining taxation regime including the excise tax on jewellery, provides a strong base for mining and exploration in Canada, including diamonds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is worth noting that the Ekati and Diavik diamond mines are the largest private employers in the Northwest Territories with a total of 1,300 direct employees. This is clearly a great boost for the north, an area where the government continues to make strategic investments to facilitate economic and social growth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the provision of roughly $2 billion per year in transfer payments, the federal government also provides funding initiatives that are tailored to meet specific needs in the north. Budget 2004 for instance announced the following measures: $90 million over five years to support a northern economic development strategy; $3.5 billion over 10 years to clean up contaminated sites, over 60% of which is expected to occur in the north; and $51 million over 10 years to conduct seabed mapping of the Arctic continental shelf.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As well, in the fall of 2003 the Government of Canada announced $190 million for northern infrastructure investments and $155 million for a national satellite initiative to provide high speed broadband Internet access services to improve access to telehealth, e-business and distance learning services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Budget 2003  included other measures which will benefit the north, including $25 million over two years for the aboriginal skills and employment partnership, $20 million for aboriginal business Canada and $16 million for northern science.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of these measures will greatly facilitate economic and social progress in the north, including the development of skills and infrastructure that will support the mining industry and diamond industry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would be remiss if I did not return briefly to expand on the fundamental issue of fiscal responsibility. I have already commented that private member's Bill C-259 is but one of many bills seeking relief from taxation in specific circumstances.  No matter how well intentioned these bills are, the government must nevertheless be mindful of the cumulative fiscal impact, as much as $2.5 billion, and also the inherent difficulties of considering these proposals on an ad hoc or piecemeal basis that does not provide an effective mechanism for assessing and evaluating competing fiscal priorities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the last 10 years the government has pursued an unwavering commitment to budget balance and fiscal prudence within the context of an integrated policy and fiscal framework. The net result has been an impressive record of economic and social progress.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has put forward seven consecutive surplus budgets, achieved a $61 billion reduction in the federal debt and an annual saving of $3 billion on debt servicing costs. Cumulative tax reductions of more than $100 billion have been delivered since 1996, with a primary focus on middle and low income families.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government is not convinced that the repeal of the excise tax on jewellery  should be undertaken, at least not on the basis of private member's Bill C-259. Repeal of the tax is one of many competing priorities, particularly as among measures to support small business.</p><A NAME="T1420"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1420"><!-- Hour: 2--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1425"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1415"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1420)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1038417"></A><a HREF="#Int-1038420"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1038410"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore—St. Margaret's, CPC): </b>Mr. Speaker, it is certainly a pleasure for me  to speak to  private member's Bill C-259 put forward by the member for Vancouver Island North. When he spoke earlier, I had the  opportunity to ask a couple of quick questions.  I said that he had done an absolutely stellar job in presenting this bill. I wanted to put that on the record one more time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an important bill.  It is important not just to a burgeoning diamond industry in Canada's north, but  it is important to our resource sector. It is important to  the gold mining industry, the silver mining industry, the gemstone industry across this country, and specifically and probably most important right now, to the diamond industry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1918 a  tax was brought in, which obviously  was  to pay for some of the reparations of World War I and the cost of sending Canadian troops abroad.  At that time, just as the Income Tax Act which was brought in  after World War II, it seemed to be  a good and  important idea, but  today,  times have changed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a bit apprehensive and concerned. In his speech the government member who just spoke used all kinds of flowery words about fiscal responsibility and whether the government must look at this in a piecemeal fashion or use a bigger umbrella.  I have some real concerns that the government will try to find a way not to support this  piece of legislation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is one thing to talk about the importance of private members' bills and   it is another thing to support them.  This is a good bill.  The industry has  been requesting it  for years.  It is important and the government needs to support it without any ifs, ands or buts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to speak about the Department of Finance for a minute. There was a  study done by the Department of Finance about removing the excise tax. Remember that jewellery is the only luxury item that still has excise tax on it.  People can buy a $50 million yacht in this country and not pay excise tax because it is not a luxury item.  People can buy caviar, champagne or a mink coat and none of those are luxury items.  Those are necessities of life.  Yet a person cannot buy a piece of jewellery worth over $3 because that is a luxury. It  is just wrong-headed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The study done by the department concluded that removing the tax would not have a significant impact on contraband activity and therefore, would not offset lost revenue.  I would like to speak to that for a second. How did it come up with the conclusion that it would not have a significant impact on contraband activity?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though the Canadian dollar has increased in value, it is still worth less than the American dollar.  However, our jewellery costs more because there is a 10% tax on it.  We are going to pay 17¢ on the American dollar to go to the United States to save 10% on a piece of jewellery, which we are going to smuggle back into the country.  And this would not stop that?  It would absolutely stop it in a heartbeat. People would not even consider it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why would a person buy  a $5,000 diamond ring in Canada and pay $500 more than he or she  would have to pay south of the border?  The person could put it on his or her finger and wear it home.  Everybody would do that.  Everybody is doing that. This bill is only common sense.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any money lost, or any thought of losing money, would be more than compensated by the increase in jewellery sales and the collection of the GST, which is 7%, on those sales. This is not rocket science.  Even Liberals should be able to figure this out. This is common sense, straightforward, financially sound legislation and it is long overdue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at a couple of numbers.  In 2003 11.2 million carats of diamonds were mined in Canada for a total of $1.7 billion.  That is out of two mines, the Ekati  and Diavik mines. There are  another three or four mines ready to come on stream.  There is another diamond mine in Nunavut ready to come on stream.  A half carat diamond has been found in northern Alberta. Diamonds have been found in northern Saskatchewan.</p><A NAME="T1425"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1425"><!-- Hour: 2--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1430"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1420"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1425)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have finally signed, through the United Nations, an accord to reduce the blood diamond industry of the world.  We have the best source of quality gemstones in the world.  We are continuing to punish the industry by saying it has to pay 10% more, ship them abroad.  If people want nice diamonds, they can go to Antwerp or Boston.  Perhaps there is a secret message, and the Liberals  want us all to go somewhere else.  I am not sure.  We really have to deal with this.  Tongue in cheek aside, it is an extremely important industry.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along with that $1.7 billion diamond industry, Canada is the seventh largest gold producing nation in the world. Canada mined 152 tonnes or $2.7 billion worth of gold, with no value added.  Keep Canadians, and northerners in particular, as hewers of wood and drawers of water.  The government does not want them to think for themselves or to set up an industry that would allow them to become financially secure, independent and produce for themselves.  Even the rest of Canada cannot not take advantage of that.  It exports it and then considers giving it back.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silver would be another idea.  Canada produced 1,254,712 kilos or 1,229 tonnes of silver last year.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a golden opportunity here.  All we have to do is get rid of this punishing excise tax.</p><A NAME="T1430"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1430"><!-- Hour: 2--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1425"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1430)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1038420"></A><a HREF="#Int-1038417"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Marcel Proulx): </b>The time provided for the consideration of private members' business has now expired and the order is dropped to the bottom of the order of precedence on the order paper.</p>
