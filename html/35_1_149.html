<P>
	He said: Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure to introduce this 
bill to amend the Broadcasting Act.
<P>
	In recent weeks Canadians have made it clear that they dislike 
intensely the policy of the CRTC in allowing cable companies to 
demand payment for channels which they have not ordered or 
authorized. The CRTC in return has said that this is a necessary 
evil of introducing new channels.
<P>
	The bill that I have introduced today will amend the broadcast 
policy section of the Broadcasting Act to ensure that the CRTC 
no longer has any discretion in terms of necessary evils such as 
negative option billing. This will limit the control of cable 
companies over their customers, something about which 
Canadians have expressed strong opinions.

Madam Speaker, I have two petitions to present today. The first 
has 830 signatures from constituents in my riding of 
Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt.
<P>
	The petitioners would like to draw to the attention of the 
House that the rights and authority of parents over their children 
have been eroded by legislation and other acts of the 
Government of Canada, as well as the interpretation of these 
laws by the courts and the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
<P>
	Therefore the petitioners call upon Parliament to return to 
parents, teachers and people in authority the right to exercise 
judicious control over the actions of children and protect the 
rights of people in authority to use reasonable force to modify 
the behaviour of children as currently set out in the Criminal 
Code of Canada, section 43.
<P>
	They are also calling for amendments to the Young Offenders 
Act and the Charter of Rights and Freedoms and other acts that 
may apply to reinstitute the authority of law enforcement 
officers in dealing with children or minors.

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="GUNCONTROL">GUN CONTROL</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, the second petition adds again to the growing 
number of people from Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt who 
are opposed to any additional gun legislation. With this petition 
there are 1,356 people who now call on Parliament to oppose any 
further legislation for firearms acquisition and possession and 
to provide strict guidelines and mandatory sentencing for use or 
possession of a firearm in the commission of a violent crime.
<P>
	The people of Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt feel that we 
have a crime problem, not a gun problem. I agree.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I think it is time to 
remind members that when they are presenting petitions, adding 
to the prayer of the petition is considered debate. I would ask 
members to keep their interventions short. Even saying you

	<B>Hon. David Anderson (for the Leader of the Government 
in the House of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, 
Lib.)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, pursuant to Standing Order 68(4)(a), the 51st report of the Standing 
Committee on Procedure and House Affairs presented to the House on Friday, 
November 25, 1994 be concurred in.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am delighted to rise today to participate in what really 
is a historic debate. It is historic not because the idea of 
redistribution is something that is new or that there is anything 
particularly novel or revolutionary about the bill that is before 
the House, or will be before the House as a result of today's 
debate, but because this is the first time in the House we have 
used a new procedure established about a year ago for dealing 
with the business of the House in allowing committees to draft 
and bring in bills.
<P>
	The 51st report of the Standing Committee on Procedure and 
House Affairs contains in it a draft bill to amend the Electoral 
Boundaries Readjustment Act. In fact it replaces the Electoral 
Boundaries Readjustment Act. That bill was drafted by the 
members of the committee who have been working on this for 
some considerable period of time.
<P>
<B>(1020 ) </B>
<P>
	As chairman of the committee I am particularly pleased to be 
able to speak on behalf of the government House leader to 
propose this motion for concurrence to the House.
<P>
	Adoption of this motion will constitute an order to the 
government to bring in a bill based on the committee's report. I 
am optimistic that the House will deal with this motion quickly 
today so that concurrence can be had. The government will then 
move rapidly to bring in a bill with some minor adjustments 
possibly in language which can then be referred to the 
committee once again for a  detailed study and possible report to 
the House and action.
<P>
	The purpose of this new procedure is to strengthen the role of 
members of Parliament in bringing their ideas to bear on policy 
decisions affecting legislation. The Standing Committee on 
Procedure and House Affairs had ample opportunity to hear 
witnesses put forward views on the bill that has been put before 
the House as part of the committee's report.
<P>
	In my view the committee members worked together very 
well and in a very non-partisan way to come up with what in 
terms of our best judgment would constitute a good new set of 
rules governing the redistribution of electoral boundaries in 
Canada.
<P>
	I would like to thank the members of the legislative counsel 
branch of the House of Commons, Ms. Diane McMurray and Mr. 
Louis-Philippe Côté, for their assistance in the drafting of the 
bill.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I would like to thank the Chief Electoral Officer of Canada, 
Jean-Pierre Kingsley, and his staff members, Jacques Girard 
and Carol Lesage, who assisted the committee in its work.
<P>
	The committee was also assisted by witnesses from across 
Canada, who came to Ottawa in July when we spent three days 
discussing ideas and suggestions on redistribution. I would like 
to thank them because their help was invaluable.
<P>
	I would like to thank more particularly the committee 
members who worked so hard in July and since then, reading the 
drafts of the report and making suggestions for improvements. 
My special thanks to the hon. members for Bellechasse, Calgary 
West and Kindersley-Lloydminster, who, together with 
government members, tried to find the most effective way to 
change this legislation.
<P>
	On this side of the House, the hon. member for Ontario, the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Public Works, the 
hon. member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell and the hon. 
member for Scarborough-Rouge River also made a major 
contribution.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Our meetings were extremely productive. We worked well 
together and I think the report reflects that, notwithstanding the 
dissent of the Reform Party on two important points. I hope to 
deal with those in my remarks.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9381"> 9381 </A></B>
<P>
	How did we get to this point on this issue? People ask why 
we embarked on a change in the redistribution act. I suggest 
there were several problems with the old law and those are the 
problems we have tried to rectify.
<P>
	First, the proposed maps which came out last year just shortly 
after Parliament first met came with no forewarning and no 
opportunity provided to members of the House for input into 
what those maps might contain. Members of the House and some 
members of the public were presented with what appeared to be 
a fait accompli. It was done at the very opening of a new 
Parliament immediately following an election based on those 
maps. The committee has addressed this problem. There will be 
consultation before the first map is produced the next time.
<P>
	Second, the commissions were not required to provide any 
justification for their proposals, although some commissions 
did so in any case. It was accordingly difficult, if not impossible, 
for members of the public and for members of Parliament to 
understand the rationale for the changes that were suggested or 
for them to make constructive ideas as to how the maps might be 
improved. The committee has made it plain in its report that 
commissions must explain the rationale behind their decisions.
<P>
<B>(1025 ) </B>
<P>
	Third, the criteria for drawing boundaries were very general. 
Therefore the commissions could take virtually any approach 
they wished and the approach could differ from one province to 
another.
<P>
	We found it difficult as members of Parliament and as 
members of the public to criticize the proposals because it was 
almost impossible to have any standard by which those 
proposals could be measured. The draft bill attempts to clarify 
the criteria while maintaining the overall principle of effective 
representation.
<P>
	Fourth, many members complained that the commissions 
made completely unnecessary changes to electoral districts just 
for the sake of doing a redistribution. The committee has also 
dealt with this matter.
<P>
	Fifth, many members of the House expressed concern about 
the size of the House of Commons and its continuing growth. 
The committee studied the matter but did not recommend any 
particular change from the present law.
<P>
	Finally, the Royal Commission on Electoral Reform and Party 
Financing that reported some years ago made a number of 
recommendations concerning redistribution which were never 
considered in the last Parliament.
<P>
	In fact, the Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Act really has 
not been reviewed thoroughly in 30 years. Therefore the 
committee took the opportunity to look through every part of the 
act, to look at the recommendations of the Royal Commission on 
Electoral  Reform and Party Financing and make a series of 
recommendations to this House.
<P>
	The first issue I want to talk about is the cap or reduction in 
the number of seats in the House of Commons. Members of all 
parties came to this issue hoping either to cap membership or to 
reduce the size of the House of Commons. After very careful 
consideration of the matter, after hearing witnesses on this point 
and after reviewing the report of the commission I referred to, 
the majority of the members realized that a cap or reduction was 
simply not feasible at this time.
<P>
	Under the present formula, there will be a modest growth in 
the House from 295 members to 301 after the next election. The 
difficulty with a cap or a reduction is related to constitutional 
problems, particularly the guarantee that no province will have 
fewer seats in the House than there are in the other place.
<P>
	The number of senators is not equal or related to population 
size. It is in no way tied in with population as is representation in 
the House. The cap in the number of seats here would perpetuate 
the current inequities in representation by ensuring that the 
provinces which have hit their senate floor cannot go below that 
and the provinces that are growing would not be able to get the 
additional seats to which they might otherwise be entitled.
<P>
	I am aware that members of the Reform Party disagree with 
the committee's judgment in this matter. They believe that the 
House could be reduced to 265 members, a significant cut from 
the current membership of 295. In their view that cut would not 
significantly jeopardize the equality of votes in this country. 
That is not a view that is shared by the majority members of this 
committee, nor does the majority believe it is what Canadians 
want.
<P>
	In the province of Ontario most members will represent a 
riding of approximately 100,000 people. That is a large number 
of people to represent. It entails a significant volume of work 
and transactions with the constituents. The Canadian public 
would not be well served were we to increase significantly the 
size of ridings.
<P>
	The ridings in some provinces would get much larger than 
those in other provinces. Without pointing to any direct 
examples there are some ridings in Canada that have fewer than 
20,000 people in them. That is a very small riding compared 
with one with 100,000 although obviously the geographic 
difference in size may be very dramatic and indeed often is.
<P>
	The difficulties of representation in a country as vast and 
diverse as Canada obviously are significant ones. The 
committee tried to grapple with that, but given that the increase 
was only six members it concluded this was not the time to make 
any change or reduction.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9382"> 9382 </A></B>
<P>
	Many Canadians say they would like to reduce the size of 
the House of Commons. However when it comes to accessing 
a member of Parliament and finding the member available to 
deal with concerns or to meet with constituents, clearly the 
opportunities would decrease were we to increase the size of 
constituencies. My own view is that Canadians would find that 
they prefer the current set-up or something very similar to it.
<P>
	In 1986 amendments were made to reduce the growth of the 
House of Commons. These changes reflected a balance between 
ensuring representation by population and the desire for a 
smaller House. Under the pre-1986 formula the House of 
Commons would have grown to almost 400 members. In 
comparison, the modest growth to 301 is acceptable and 
necessary to ensure that the growing places in Canada are well 
represented.
<P>
<B>(1030) </B>
<P>
	Given the seriousness of the issue however and the genuine 
interest in dealing with it, the committee recommends this 
whole matter of the size of the House be revisited with a goal of 
overcoming the barriers to a cap before the 2001 census. We will 
have had the benefit of the quinquennial census in 1996. We will 
be able to see what the growth in the population is and where the 
shifts have occurred.
<P>
	If members in the next Parliament feel they are able to make 
changes to cap the House at 301 or reduce the numbers, they 
would be free to make that decision based on the further analysis 
available to them in the 1996 census.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The second problem is the method by which commission 
members are selected. According to the committee, there was a 
problem with the selection process. We heard a number of 
witnesses on the subject, many of whom indicated that we had a 
good system but there were always certain considerations, 
political or otherwise, involved in the selection process.
<P>
	The committee decided that the process could be made far 
more open and recommended several changes. First of all, 
applications for positions will be invited by public notice. The 
Speaker of the House will have to consult several people before 
proceeding with an appointment, notice of which is to be tabled 
here in the House.
<P>
	If members of this House do not agree with the Speaker's 
decision regarding these appointments and if 20 members have 
signed a notice of motion, a member may present a motion 
requesting a vote in the House on one of the appointments. The 
vote will be crucial, because if the majority considers the 
appointment is unacceptable, the Speaker must submit another 
name.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	One of the problems with the way redistribution is done is that 
after 10 years-redistributions occur after each decennial 
census, one occurred in 1991 with another occurring in 
2001-population growth and shifts are often very significant, 
resulting in large and disruptive changes to electoral districts, 
which started out at a reasonable size and have grown into 
something either very large or very small.
<P>
	The committee was of the view that if there were more 
frequent redistributions, this problem could be ameliorated 
considerably. Accordingly the committee has recommended 
that after a quinquennial census, that is the short and more 
simple census that occurs every five years in between the 
decennial ones, a redistribution would take place within a 
province. There would be no reallocation of seats among 
provinces as happens after a decennial census, but there would 
be within a province a redistribution where figures warrant. We 
put a minimum on that.
<P>
	Constituencies would have to be significantly beyond the 
provincial quotient before such a quinquennial redistribution 
would take place. By doing this we are optimistic that we will 
avoid these massive shifts every 10 years. It would happen in 
certain provinces, probably not very many, after five years. Of 
course the question of whether or not one occurs depends on the 
population shifts within the province.
<P>
	The committee proposes that redistribution will only take 
place in principle where it is necessary to ensure effective and 
equal representation.
<P>
	The second matter is public input and the commissions. One 
of the major difficulties with the current act is the process for 
public consultation. Our draft bill proposes a number of 
improvements that strengthen the role of the public in providing 
advice to the boundaries commissions. The first is a requirement 
for the publishing of a public notice at the very beginning of the 
process. The notice must include the following information: 
first, the population figures for each electoral district currently 
on the map; second, the percentage of deviation for each riding 
from the provincial quotient; and, third, a statement of how the 
commission plans to proceed.
<P>
<B>(1035) </B>
<P>
	Each commission, therefore, must issue its own policy 
statement announcing the principles on which it intends to act in 
performing its redistribution work.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The second change consists in asking the commissions to 
produce three maps and include their reasons for selecting these 
boundaries. In this way, the public will be informed of the 
options available. The public may take part in the commission 
hearings and suggest alternatives. It can indicate its preference 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9383"> 9383 </A></B>
<P>
for one map or another, without going to the trouble of preparing 
its own maps.  Currently members and the public have a problem 
because they lack the resources to prepare alternative maps for 
submission to the commission.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The third change is with respect to the public hearings. The 
committee was of the view that there should be an additional 
round of public hearings if the commission makes dramatic 
changes to the electoral map after soliciting public input.
<P>
	The final change relates to the process that currently exists 
whereby there is parliamentary review of the drafts of the 
commissions.
<P>
	As members know, following the completion of the 
commission's second draft, the matter may be referred to a 
parliamentary committee which may then pass along to the 
commissions its recommendations. The commissions may 
accept or reject the recommendations but the process is 
available only to members of Parliament who make their 
representations to a parliamentary committee.
<P>
	This special procedure is being abolished in the new act. All 
proceedings before the commissions will be in public and there 
will be no particular special parliamentary input opportunity 
provided. We think this will make the process more open. We 
believe it will allow the public to participate in the process and 
see that there are no back door deals being made between 
members of the House who may have been considered to be 
placed in a privileged position vis-à-vis the commissions.
<P>
	Clearly members of Parliament have an important say in what 
riding boundaries should be. There are few Canadians more 
interested in electoral boundaries than the members of the 
House. However their opportunities to participate in this 
process should be played out in public in front of the members of 
the public. We believe that will be the result of this legislation.
<P>
	The draft bill contains a number of changes to the current 
provisions that govern how the commissions decide to draw 
boundaries. We have adopted the principle of the least amount of 
change. Many members complained that commissions 
recommended changes for the sake of change rather than 
because change was necessary.
<P>
	The hon. member for Bonavista-Trinity-Conception made 
a presentation-it was sent to the committee and I thank him for 
it-to the commission in Newfoundland where there had been 
very minor shifts in population and yet boundaries had been 
altered in several of the ridings in that province when there was 
really no need to do so on the basis of population change. In his 
submission to the commission he suggested that the commission 
should have left the boundaries entirely alone.
<P>
	We have dealt with that. In a province where there has not 
been significant change, where there is no increase or decrease 
in the number of seats and where there is no particular deviation 
from the provincial quotient there will not be a commission 
appointed.
<P>
	Many people expressed concern about the open-ended way 
that community of interest is defined in the current act. 
Commissions really have a carte blanche to interpret the act the 
way they see fit. Therefore, we have changed the definition of 
community of interest in an attempt to narrow it and focus it so 
that it will be a better standard against which to measure the 
work of commissions.
<P>
	The committee also heard evidence from members in growing 
urban areas that commissions did not take into account the fact 
that their riding was experiencing or was about to experience 
tremendous growth. Often this is measurable. Plans of 
subdivisions are registered; the construction is ready to proceed; 
and it is obvious in some ridings, particularly in the large urban 
centres, that within a year or two there will be another 10,000 or 
15,000 people living in a particular riding.
<P>
	Commissions will now be able to consider evidence about 
future growth when they deliberate on the drawing of electoral 
boundaries and adjust the boundaries accordingly.
<P>
<B>(1040 ) </B>
<P>
	The proposed bill would also remove the ability of 
commissions to draw electoral boundaries beyond the 25 per 
cent allowed variance from a provincial quotient. The current 
law allows a commission to draw boundaries so that a riding 
exceeds or is less than the provincial quotient. For example, if 
the provincial quotient is 100,000 people per riding, the 
boundaries under the current law could allow for a riding to 
contain less than 75,000 people or it could allow the 
constituency to contain more than 125,000.
<P>
	This will be eliminated in the bill. We will require that if there 
is to be a riding created that is beyond the quotient I mentioned, 
the riding must be specified in the schedule to the act. In other 
words, the House will fix which ridings will be allowed to 
deviate beyond the parameters set out in the legislation. Those 
ridings will be named in a schedule and then the boundaries of 
that riding will not be touched by the commissions.
<P>
	The committee was of the view that this was the fair way to 
deal with this issue rather than leave an extended discretion in 
the commissions.
<P>
	There was an argument put before the committee and one on 
which the parties in the committee disagreed, that the 25 per 
cent deviation was too large. The Royal Commission on 
Electoral Reform and Party Financing and some of the witnesses 
who appeared before the committee favoured reducing the 
variance to 15 per cent. The Reform Party has indicated its 
desire to limit the variance to 15 per cent.
<P>
	There is considerable merit in the suggestion from the pointof view of equity and fairness in the electoral system. I will 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9384"> 9384 </A></B>
<P>
concede that point, I respect members who have taken the view 
that it is the right way to go because they have strong arguments 
on their side. Nevertheless for large parts of rural Canada 
particularly a change to reduce the degree of variance from 25 to 
15 per cent  would result in a significant shift of seats from rural 
Canada to urban centres.
<P>
	There is an argument made, and a very forceful argument by 
rural members, that the difficulties of representation in a large 
geographic riding with many communities that involve 
extensive travel between the parts of the community is more 
difficult than representation of a few blocks in a city core. Urban 
members sometimes dispute that.
<P>
	I would not want to pass judgment on one side or the other. I 
represent a riding which is largely urban but which has a modest 
rural component, in the islands in particular.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Sitting on the fence, no slivers?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> No slivers, absolutely no slivers, to satisfy the 
hon. member for Kindersley-Lloydminster. I do think that 
there are difficulties in rural representation but there are 
challenges to urban representation too, of which the hon. 
member for Kindersley-Lloydminster is unaware. I think his 
riding is far more rural than many, but perhaps not all.
<P>
	However I know that he will argue the other side. I want to 
point out that he is arguing from a position of particular strength 
because in the province of Saskatchewan the commissions have 
ignored the 25 per cent variance and have gone to a variance of 
something like 5 per cent. The 15 per cent would make no 
difference whatever in his province.
<P>
	I commend the commission for Saskatchewan for having 
drawn boundaries this way. I remember in the last Parliament 
hearing a lot of complaints about the boundaries that were 
drawn. Those have dissipated this time because we have a new 
bunch of members from Saskatchewan. We got rid of the 
complainers and got in a new group that complain about 
different things. I recognize that some of them are on this side. 
They are not complaining at all. They are simply delighted. 
They are pleased with this draft bill and are going to support it. I 
hope that the hon. member for Kindersley-Lloydminster will 
share his views with them in due course.
<P>
	We have decided on the 25 per cent. It is what has been in the 
law for some time. I submit that it is a reasonable test and 
standard by which we could operate. To avoid difficulties, 
particularly a difficulty that would be felt very keenly by rural 
members and by rural populations in Ontario and Quebec in 
particular, there is no reason at this stage to advance a change. 
The committee has left this at 25 and recommends it to the 
House.
<P>
<B>(1045 ) </B>
<P>
	In addition to the substantial changes I have outlined, the 
committee made a number of other changes that will make the 
system more efficient, including the suspension of the process 
should an election be called.
<P>
	In the dissenting opinion of the Reform Party, members of 
that party argued that the changes in the act proposed by the 
committee did not justify the suspension of the process. That of 
course has already taken place and that will be complete if the 
bill is passed. New commissions will be appointed to operate 
under the new act. They will be appointed in the manner 
proposed in the act. They will make their proposals public in the 
manner proposed in the act and they will be present three maps 
to the public instead of one.
<P>
	I do not agree with their position. The changes we have made 
here are substantive. They are valuable. They are a dramatic 
improvement of the current electoral system for the reasons I 
have outlined in my speech. Accordingly I disagree quite 
strongly with the rather negative view, in my opinion, expressed 
by members of the Reform Party in the dissenting report.
<P>
	When they read the report in its entirety, as I know they 
already have and I am sure they will again, and as they hear the 
very reasonable remarks I am making today in encouraging 
them to support this matter, I know the member for Calgary West 
will recant his heresy and support this excellent proposal from 
the committee.
<P>
	I am optimistic that the bill will be dealt with expeditiously. I 
am optimistic that we can have it in place before June 22, which 
is the day the old system kicks back in if we do not get a new law 
passed. This new law represents a good deal for Canadians. It 
represents a significant improvement over the existing 
requirements in respect of redistribution. I invite all hon. 
members to support it.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I will not take the same amount of time as the member for 
Kingston and the Islands, since, in general, he summarized quite 
objectively the work of the Standing Committee on Procedure 
and House Affairs.
<P>
	Apart from the final part of his speech, which was more of an 
exchange with the Reform Party than a direct statement on the 
report tabled, the member for Kingston and the Islands provided 
a very accurate description of the situation and the proposed 
amendments.
<P>
	I would point out that the official opposition participated fully 
in developing the proposal, which will eventually be submitted 
to the House, once the report is adopted, so that we will end up 
with the best possible legislation. We have demonstrated the 
seriousness of the parliamentary work that all members of this 
House are called on to perform, even though the aim of our 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9385"> 9385 </A></B>
<P>
political party is to ensure this act does not apply in Quebec and 
that we will not be covered by it in the next  federal election. 
However, we took part in the committee's work and we took our 
job seriously.
<P>
	I will come back in a few minutes, in order to complete the 
picture, to one or two items the member for Kingston and the 
Islands did not mention in his statement.
<P>
	I too, of course, would like to thank the member for Kingston 
and the Islands, the member for Kindersley-Lloydminster and 
the member for Calgary West, who contributed in a generally 
non-partisan way to the work that, while not without its flaws, 
produced excellent results.
<P>
	I would also like to thank those who helped us, particularly 
people from the office of the chief electoral officer, namely 
Jean-Pierre Kingsley, himself, as well as Jacques Girard and 
Carol Lesage, who provided incredible and ongoing assistance 
whenever we sought their help and cooperation. I would also 
thank colleagues who came to Ottawa in June and July, in the 
height of summer, to make representations before the Standing 
Committee on Procedure and House Affairs.
<P>
	Where I have more of a problem with the bill that will 
eventually be tabled, the draft prepared by the committee, is that 
absolutely no discussion of miminum representation for Quebec 
was permitted. We ran headlong into the great wall of China in 
trying to discuss the question of a guarantee of 25 per cent of 
seats, raised by Senator Rivest when he appeared in June. The 
idea was that Quebec could never have fewer than 25 per cent of 
the seats in the House of Commons, because it would lose its 
power of influence over decisions being made.
<P>
<B>(1050) </B>
<P>
	Needless to say Senator Rivest is not known as a sovereignist, 
at least not from the old guard. His point of view was to a large 
extent taken up by my colleague, the hon. member for 
Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead, when he appeared before the 
Committee on Procedure and House Affairs in July, stating that 
a constitutional guarantee was required to ensure that Quebec's 
current 25 per cent of seats be retained regardless of possible 
fluctuations in its population.
<P>
	We would of course like to resolve the issue of Quebec's 
representation in this House in an altogether different manner. 
But, should Quebec continue to require representation in this 
House, this critical mass must be recognized, and it is in this 
sense that all of our colleagues in the House must recognize it, as 
must Quebec's population in general. While commissions are 
currently examining Quebec's future, we have not been able to 
convince our colleagues to subscribe to a proposal guaranteeing 
25 per cent of seats to Quebec.
<P>
	We have a better understanding of the situation in which we 
find ourselves, that is to say, we are at a juncture where a 
decision must be made in Quebec between attaining 
sovereignty, controlling our own laws, creating our own 
legislation, collecting taxes and signing our own treaties or, on 
the other hand, becoming a  member like any other in the 
Canadian federation. This will be the true test in the next 
referendum in Quebec. And Quebecers must know what system 
will govern them if the outcome of the referendum in Quebec is 
negative. We can see it already, the slightest request such as this 
has been denied. The need to guarantee a minimum level of 
representation for Quebec in the House was not acknowledged. 
This had to be said at this stage.
<P>
	Another point made in the report tabled by the member for 
Kingston and the Islands pertains to so-called special ridings. 
Under present legislation, provincial commissions may 
consider special circumstances and allow for greater 
fluctuations in a riding's population than provincially allowed. 
Thus if we take the classic example of a riding with 100,000 
voters, the number of voters could currently vary from 75,000 to 
125,000, given the 25 per cent deviation allowed. But, as it 
stands, the current legislation grants provincial commissions 
the discretion to take special circumstances into consideration, 
for example, the riding of Labrador, which does not meet the 
electoral quotient, and Îles-de-la-Madeleine, which, as it was 
mentioned several times in committee, may not meet it.
<P>
	This will no longer be possible in the future, since a provision 
stipulates that special cases will have to be listed in a schedule to 
the bill. For reasons which are debatable, the committee chose to 
adopt such a schedule blindly, that is to say ridings to be listed in 
the schedule were not debated in committee. This could be a 
valid way of doing things; we will see as we go on.
<P>
	However, what the Standing Committee on Procedure and 
House Affairs should be doing, in my opinion, is undertaking 
far-reaching consultations, not just reserved for 
parliamentarians. It is all well and good that the hon. member 
for Labrador make representations, for example, that his riding 
be included in the schedule or that the hon. member for 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine make representations that 
Îles-de-la-Madeleine recover the independent riding status it 
enjoyed before 1968.
<P>
<B>(1055) </B>
<P>
	But in my opinion, the committee should open its consultation 
process up to the community and allow the local population and 
others to state their opinions. It seems obvious that the ridings of 
Labrador and Îles-de-la-Madeleine should be allowed to elect a 
member although their populations are lower than what the act 
stipulates, and it may well be that, for very special reasons, 
people elsewhere in Canada may reasonably argue that their 
ridings should be listed in the schedule. For the schedule to truly 
reflect the wishes of the people and for the members of this 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9386"> 9386 </A></B>
<P>
House to truly understand those wishes, the consultation process 
must be opened up.
<P>
	If it turns out that it is impossible to hold open hearings for all 
members of the public to air their views-and then we would 
have to find some other suitable means-I suggest that we revert 
to the current procedure whereby provincial commissions are 
granted the discretion to take special circumstances into 
consideration. And in cases like Labrador, 
Îles-de-la-Madeleine, maybe Manicouagan and the Gaspé 
Peninsula, they should be able to allow a deviation of more than 
the proposed 25 per cent which has been the generally accepted 
criterion since 1964, when the independent commissions were 
created and the House stopped drawing up the electoral maps.
<P>
	At any rate, we will have the opportunity to discuss this issue 
again before the Standing Committee on Procedure and House 
Affairs, and to find the best possible solution.
<P>
	It was mentioned earlier that the population would be 
consulted more. Yes, there will be more public consultation, and 
that is normal because the electoral map is designed first and 
foremost for the people and not for the elected members of 
Parliament. Everyone agrees with this principle, including 
myself. Just as electoral laws are designed for the voters and not 
for the elected parliamentarians. We are the ones who must meet 
these criteria.
<P>
	The process for designating provincial commission members 
was greatly improved. The process now taking place behind 
closed doors will be replaced with a much more open process in 
which the members will be appointed jointly by the Speaker of 
the House and the province's chief justice. There may even be a 
parliamentary debate if at least 20 members of this House 
request it. We think that opening up the process is an excellent 
thing.
<P>
	The Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs 
discussed for several months the issue of limiting or reducing 
the number of members in this House. This proposal was 
particularly favoured by our colleagues from the Reform Party.
<P>
	Basically, we agree with the proposal to reduce the number of 
members in this House. However, we do not look at the issue in 
the same way. Of course, we in the Bloc Quebecois want to cut 
the number of members in this House from 295 to 220, simply by 
removing the 75 members from Quebec who will leave this 
House after the referendum.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Langlois:</B> As you can see, this will free a number of seats 
amounting to about half of those reserved for the opposition 
from all parties.
<P>
	There is no need to renovate the House, tear down walls or 
push back everything to my left or in front of you, Madam 
Speaker. The House will see a major change after the Quebec 
referendum, since half our side of the House can be used to make 
room for bigger desks for the other members, as they see fit. The 
right to self-determination also applies to Canada. Our 
Canadian friends will be free to refurbish this House as they see 
fit.
<P>
<B>(1100) </B>
<P>
	Quinquennial censuses will, of course, produce data allowing 
us to make timely changes to the electoral map much more 
quickly and avoid the major changes required after decennial 
censuses, which confuse the population. This is also a desirable 
improvement which was brought by the Committee on 
Procedure and House Affairs.
<P>
	Someone said earlier that members would no longer have a 
say in this. I entirely agree with the fact that members-contrary 
to what has been the case for the past 30 years-should no longer 
have the last word on electoral boundaries redistribution, but 
until now they did have some input-and they still do since the 
legislation has not been amended-so that commissions were 
able to consider problems that might be raised by members.
<P>
	I am not sure whether it is such a good idea to eliminate the 
right of members to comment, since they may want to make 
recommendations, which the commissions may or may not 
consider. I agree that members should not have the last say on 
electoral boundaries, but I would question the wisdom of not 
letting them intervene at all.
<P>
	Of course, members can go before the provincial 
commissions. But would it not be a good idea to let members 
intervene specifically as a group, as parliamentarians, either 
directly or through a committee like the one on procedure and 
House affairs?
<P>
	That being said, I simply want to remind the House that the 
non- partisan approach that was apparent throughout the 
proceedings of the Committee on Procedure and House Affairs 
is an indication that working through a committee like the one 
that tabled its report this morning can be very effective. As far as 
the other committees are concerned, we will have to wait and 
see. However, I hope we will soon see other standing 
committees take the same non partisan approach we have seen in 
the Committee on Procedure and House Affairs.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak to Motion No. 20.
<P>
	On April 19 of last year this House gave a mandate to the 
procedure and House affairs committee to investigate the 
process of adjusting boundaries of electoral districts and to 
bring forward a bill for this House to consider. The committee 
was specifically mandated to formulate a cap or to reduce the 
number of seats in the House of  Commons, to look at the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9387"> 9387 </A></B>
<P>
adequacy of the present method of selecting the members of the 
electoral boundaries commissions, to look at the rules and 
criteria used by the commissions to alter the boundary lines, and 
to review the involvement of the public and the House of 
Commons in the work of the boundary commissions.
<P>
	Bill C-18 which received royal assent on June 15, 1994 was a 
serious interruption of the non-partisan electoral process. It 
suspended the existing Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Act. 
Such a move on the part of the government could only be 
justified, and I stress this, if it makes significant improvements 
or modifications to the boundary readjustment process.
<P>
	There are no significant modifications proposed in this bill. 
That is not to say there are no improvements being proposed. 
Many of the smaller issues were dealt with in a very satisfactory 
manner. Where the government proposal falls short is on the 
larger issues. There are three: the size of the House, the size of 
population variance of the individual ridings, and the rules 
governing the adjustment of boundaries.
<P>
<B>(1105 ) </B>
<P>
	The positive aspects of the bill are easier to deal with in 
smaller numbers so I will mention them first.
<P>
	First, the process of instructing a standing committee to 
prepare the bill has been a positive and productive exercise. 
Unfortunately there is a majority of Liberal members on the 
committee. In the final outcome they have their say. Some very 
good proposals were set aside because the majority was not 
willing to listen to other members and participants on the 
committee.
<P>
	Particularly I would like to commend the staff of Elections 
Canada, Mr. Jean-Pierre Kingsley in particular, whose 
assistance in drafting the bill was invaluable. I would encourage 
this House to continue using the committee procedure that we 
used in the future.
<P>
	It was also a pleasure to work specifically with the chair of the 
committee that was very fair in hearing all sides of the 
presentations with regard to this matter. We appreciated the 
involvement of the Official Opposition, although it seemed to be 
a bit of an academic exercise when, as my colleague for 
Bellechasse mentioned, its motive is to extricate itself entirely 
from this House. I was rather surprised to see a member of the 
government, the Liberal side, applauding it. I think it was the 
member for Etobicoke-Lakeshore applauding that. Perhaps 
there is a separatist on the Liberal side as well. I am not sure.
<P>
	There was invaluable input by the member for Calgary West 
who is a constitutional expert and is very knowledgeable about 
the Elections Act. I appreciated his input on the committee. It 
was a pleasure to serve with him.
<P>
	Another improvement is the redistribution of ridings within 
each province to occur following each quinquennial census. 
These mini adjustments every five years will lessen the dramatic 
and highly disruptive changes that have occurred in the past. 
The Canadian population can change drastically over 10 years. 
Smaller changes brought about more often are preferable to the 
current practice.
<P>
	The government's refusal to accept the last redistribution is 
evidence that smaller changes are easier for people to accept. An 
additional bonus of a five-year distribution is a much shorter 
time frame for the redistribution process.
<P>
	The boundary commissions will be encouraged to make the 
public better informed of their work and to provide alternatives 
to each distribution proposed. While the role and involvement of 
the public is increased, the influence of members of Parliament 
is reduced. I applaud that. If MPs have an intervention they wish 
to make, they are encouraged to take part in the existing public 
meetings. I see this change as a positive step in ensuring the 
boundary and readjustment process remains as politically 
neutral as possible.
<P>
	I do not believe boundaries should be changed and preserved 
solely for the ease of the campaigning of the sitting member. 
Granted all members would like to run in an area where they 
have already won an election because they have developed many 
contacts and made many friendships during the years they 
represented that area. However, deliberately altering the 
redistribution procedure to give an incumbent MP an advantage 
would be a very serious breach of political ethics.
<P>
	The irony of the suspension of the redistribution process is the 
process that was already in existence worked when MPs or 
members of the public were dissatisfied with the boundary 
commission proposal. There was already a procedure in place to 
have changes made to electoral maps. If the members took the 
time to make presentations at boundary commission hearings, 
they could do so.
<P>
	The member for Prince George-Peace River and a number of 
his constituents made a presentation to the British Columbia 
boundaries commission. The commission considered their 
proposal and made alterations to the proposed constituency 
lines. Some of the Liberals of Ontario have done the same thing. 
There may not have been the need for the undemocratic Bill 
C-18. The Liberals panicked. That was unfortunate.
<P>
	As for the process of selecting and reviewing the appointment 
of boundary commissioners, minor but sensible changes were 
made to the role and authority of the chief electoral officer, and 
the manner of redistribution has been clarified.
<P>
	These aspects of the bill are positive. That being said, all 
those improvements and changes could have been made without 
interrupting the redistribution process and  without throwing out 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9388"> 9388 </A></B>
<P>
the $5 million worth of reports produced by the boundary 
commissions.
<P>
	The report of the procedure and House affairs committee fails 
on every major issue on which it was mandated to act, namely 
the number of seats in the House of Commons, the population 
variance of the electoral districts and the priority of criteria used 
to determine new boundary lines.
<P>
	Most Canadians want less government. Most Canadians 
believe there are already too many MPs. Even when presented 
with a workable solution that reduced the number of seats in the 
House, the Liberals refused to take any action as to its size. They 
refused to reduce the number of seats, to cap the number of seats 
both at the current membership of 295 and 301, as is proposed.
<P>
<B>(1110 ) </B>
<P>
	They even refused to reduce the growth of the House in the 
future. It seems like the Liberals were willing to put 
self-interest ahead of the national interest. That is truly 
regrettable. Their reasons for refusing to act are pretty flimsy. 
They claim that such a cap or reduction in the size of the House 
of Commons is not feasible at this time. They lack the political 
courage to act because they say the number of seats that would 
be taken away would be insignificant and could be regarded as 
highly disruptive.
<P>
	The Liberals also quote constitutional problems in limiting 
the size of the House of Commons. These problems arise 
because of the way Senate seats are allocated. Using the House 
of Commons to make up for the inadequacies of the other place 
is unacceptable.
<P>
	It is the refusal of this government like the Tories before it to 
reform the upper chamber so that it actually represents the 
provinces and regions of this country effectively that is creating 
the problem of uneven representation in this House. The House 
of Commons is supposed to be the chamber where all Canadians 
are represented equally.
<P>
	Representation by population is the principle upon which this 
House is built. The upper chamber is completely ineffective in 
representing provincial and regional interests as a result of 
being unelected and unequal.
<P>
	Just because the modern Senate is increasingly incompatible 
with the confederation of today, that is no reason to prevent this 
House from representing Canadians as well is it could. It would 
seem that the government's resistance to an improved Senate is 
hampering the effectiveness of this House.
<P>
	It is in the best interests of all Canadians to have the House of 
Commons organized as efficiently as possible. If this 
arrangement has the additional benefit of creating pressure for a 
reformed Senate, that would be a bonus. We should not weaken the 
House of Commons by binding it to its present form, nor should we 
allow it to  grow out of control for the sole purpose of avoiding 
making changes to an out of date Senate.
<P>
	There is no excuse for refusing to establish a smaller House of 
Commons. In my own province of Saskatchewan, people would 
be willing to accept having fewer MPs as long as the reductions 
were equitable with reductions to other provinces as well.
<P>
	As a matter of fact, in the province of Saskatchewan the 
number of provincial seats has been reduced and the public has 
accepted it and embraced it. Perhaps it is something that the 
federal government should have a look at.
<P>
	If as a result of the reduction of MPs Canadians got a triple-E 
Senate, elected by them, accountable to them and working in 
their best interests instead of being partisan rubber stamps, it 
would make the opportunity to save taxpayers money by 
electing fewer MPs even more attracted to them.
<P>
	I have heard that many Liberals from rural ridings in Ontario 
complain about the problems associated with geographically 
large ridings. However, I have a riding that stretches more than a 
four and a half hour car ride in some directions. I can say that if 
members are resourceful and committed to serving their 
constituents it is more than possible to adequately serve the 
needs of a large riding.
<P>
	For instance, I have set up a mobile constituency office that 
travels around the riding to get to people who cannot get to me. 
We already allow extra travel allowances to members with large 
ridings. If as a result of a reduced House some ridings become 
bigger, the cost of the extra travel will hardly make a dent in the 
savings from having fewer members.
<P>
	Modern communications technology makes more constituent 
contact possible. Increased use of available technology makes 
this possible without extended travel. I want to tell members of 
the House who represent urban ridings that no matter how 
concentrated and compact their riding is, I can fax across mine 
faster than they can drive across theirs.
<P>
	Fewer ridings will mean that each MP will serve more 
constituents. Again I would argue that the modest increases in 
resources of a member's office either in staff or equipment is a 
more cost effective way of dealing with the needs of Canadians 
than having more members. Not only do Canadians want fewer 
federal politicians,but it makes good fiscal sense as well.
<P>
	The Liberals are refusing to do anything about the size of the 
House. They took the political easy way out. They 
recommended that somebody else, possibly a future Parliament, 
do something about the growth of the House.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9389"> 9389 </A></B>
<P>
	The time to take action is now because the problem is now. 
This bill is an excellent opportunity to deal with the issue. No 
time in the future will be any better than the opportunity we 
have right now. I would imagine that the Liberals in the future, 
if there are any, will be no more willing to deal with the problem 
than those in this government are now. They are simply 
unwilling to entertain any solution which varies from status quo 
thinking. Liberals simply never want to take action on anything.
<P>
	Another major flaw in this legislation is that it does nothing to 
solve the problem of some ridings, even the ones in the same 
province, with varied levels of population.
<P>
<B>(1115) </B>
<P>
	A plus or minus 25 per cent variance means that even within 
the same province one constituency can have a population 
approximately twice as large as another. This is an unacceptable 
variance in voting power. I urge all members to remember that 
this variance is not between ridings which have suffered recent 
population changes that are about to be corrected. Rather, this is 
a starting point. This is how the commissions are allowed to set 
things up in the first place.
<P>
	Ridings may start off with this large variance and then go 
through five years of population change before anything is done 
about it. As unequal as that may seem, this large variance will be 
exceeded by those ridings that will be placed into a special 
schedule.
<P>
	The schedule ridings are exempt from the allowable quotient. 
If there is already a huge allowable variance available to the 
commissions, surely there is no need for a special schedule. 
Conversely, if a schedule of special cases is to be created, such a 
large variance is not required.
<P>
	One member of Parliament can represent anywhere from 
fewer than 20,000 constituents to over 120,000 constituents. 
That is incredible and that is the starting point, if we include a 
schedule plus a huge variance of 25 per cent.
<P>
	The reasoning behind including both is beyond the wildest 
dreams of the gerrymanders. If the House determines which seat 
should go on a schedule, it provides tremendous opportunity for 
biases along party lines, for biases among rural versus urban 
members, for the opportunity for infighting and horrible 
conduct on the part of MPs. The encouragement of horrible 
conduct on the part of members and parties is not something that 
I would want to see. It did not have to be there. They could have 
corrected this problem.
<P>
	I urge all members of the House to vote against the report until 
this gross inequity is resolved. Having these two flaws in the bill 
at the same time makes a mockery of the principle of equality of 
voting power even within the same province. The situation is 
further exacerbated by the constitutional requirement to start 
out with unequal provincial representation.
<P>
	As it is plain to see, the legislation the report recommends 
does nothing to guarantee or even encourage the electoral 
equality of Canadians. This alone is reason enough to warrant 
the defeat of the bill unless corrected by amendment.
<P>
	The third area of weakness in the bill is the primacy it gives to 
community of interest over voter equity. While not stated as 
such, boundary commissioners are instructed to consider 
sociological considerations ahead of making constituencies 
reasonably numerically equal. That is an automatic consequence 
of having such a high population variant quotient.
<P>
	This is a social engineer's dream. These considerations 
combined with overly generous variances will result in a system 
that represents Canadians by characteristic rather than as 
citizens of a specific geographic area. It is this manifestation of 
special interest politics that we wish to avoid.
<P>
	Some of the considerations found within the definition of 
community of interest can and should be used to break the tie 
between alternative proposals with comparable voter equity. 
They should not be used as a primary factor in determining 
electoral boundaries.
<P>
	As I stated in the beginning of my remarks, the minor 
improvements made to the redistribution process do not save the 
bill from its vast omissions, flaws and missed opportunities. The 
legislation proposed by the report in no way justifies the action 
taken by the government to interrupt the pre-existing process.
<P>
	The actions of government members in producing the report 
confirm that the original motive behind Bill C-18 was crass 
partisan manipulation of the electoral process. Ontario Liberal 
backbenchers and a few from Atlantic Canada were not happy 
that their ridings were changed. They appeared before 
committee and told us that was the problem. When a party wins 
almost all the ridings in a province, why would it not try every 
trick in the book to play again on the same field?
<P>
	The government motive here was to redo the last 
redistribution simply because the new lines were not put on the 
map where it wanted them to be. Some of them went down Sixth 
Avenue rather then Tenth Avenue.
<P>
	Bill C-18 was brought in as an attempt to cover the whole 
operation in the guise of opening the process to improve and 
modernize it. This report and the lack of meaningful change it 
contains prove there never was a sincere intention of significant 
improvement or modernization.
<P>
<B>(1120 ) </B>
<P>
	Let us talk about the real crux of the matter. The problem is 
that the country needs reform in many areas. One of the lesser 
priorities is electoral reform. It is an important area, I agree, and 
I know my colleagues would accept that. However we need 
social program reform. We need reforms to the way we expend 
funds from this place. We need reform of our justice system. The 
Liberal tradition is to talk about reform but in the end to do 
nothing about reform. It is becoming very clear that the only 
<P>

<B><A NAME="9390"> 9390 </A></B>
<P>
people who will really reform the country are those who bear the 
name Reform in their party title.
<P>
	Canada has a very proud democratic tradition. Canadians 
deserve the best electoral system that can be provided. I assure 
the House that I will work for positive and constructive electoral 
reform. I will work for reform of the Senate. I will continue to 
work for a capping and a reduction of the seats in the House of 
Commons, not because it helps me out but because it is what 
Canadians want. They want action. They want real reform.
<P>
	The motion the government has presented to enact the bill, a 
new boundary readjustment act, is not real reform. It is a matter 
of tinkering around the edges, a bit of cosmetics to try to cover 
up the fact that it did not approve of where the boundaries were 
drawn in the last readjustment process.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I 
regret to interrupt, but I wonder if I could seek unanimous 
consent of the House to revert to tabling of documents. A 
document that should have been tabled this morning was not and 
I am seeking unanimous consent to do so.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Does the hon. member 
have unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Jean Augustine (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime 
Minister, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to ask a question 
of the hon. member who just spoke. I begin by saying that one 
thing Reformers do not have is a sense of humour. Oftentimes in 
discussion we need a sense of humour.
<P>
	I thought the hon. member across the way was alluding to the 
fact that they were making way for 75 Liberals on the other side 
of the room. That was really what my applause was: the fact that 
we would have 75 Liberals across the room looking directly to 
the rest of us on this side of the House. They would be replacing 
the ones who are presently there.
<P>
	Somehow I seem to be confused by the convoluted 
discussions around what is, what is not, and what Reformers are 
and are not for. What are the positive aspects of the bill that he 
supports? They seem to have been lost in the argument.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Madam Speaker, I assure the hon. member 
that the Reform caucus has a wonderful sense of humour. We are 
very amused at the Liberal polka represented in this bill and in 
many others: one step forward, two steps backward and 
side-step the issue.
<P>
	There are some positives in the bill or the motion that may 
become a bill if the government so chooses. One of the more 
positive aspects to which I am sure other colleagues will also 
refer is the selection of commissioners. There are some minor 
improvements in the selection of boundary commissioners. 
There is more consultation with members of the House. It could 
become less the sole jurisdiction of the Speaker to choose the 
two commissioners selected from the federal level. Of course 
the provincial selection remains unchanged.
<P>
	Another positive aspect is the alternatives that will be 
presented to constituents. Rather than presenting one map, there 
is the potential of three: one preferred and two alternative maps. 
These are minor improvements that certainly did not justify a 
suspension of the process.
<P>
	Other than those minor details there are more flaws and 
omissions. What really concerns me is the omissions and the 
lack of change in the bill. Had we wanted to make these minor 
improvements we could have done that in the form of an 
amendment to the bill that could have taken place while the 
existing process was under way.
<P>
<B>(1125 ) </B>
<P>
	What has happened is that the initial adjustment process 
started some time ago was interrupted by elections. In fact we 
have some terrible discrepancies. We now have members 
representing huge populations while others are representing 
very few Canadians. The bill does not correct that problem. It 
just tinkers around the edges and makes a few cosmetic changes 
and few minor improvements.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9391"> 9391 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harold Culbert (Carleton-Charlotte, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I have a couple of points to make and perhaps a 
question I would like to address to the hon. member across the 
way.
<P>
	I listened very carefully to the comments he made. They were 
somewhat in depth. Being from the province of New Brunswick, 
one thing we found with the presentation to us shortly after 
coming to the House was that there was a unilateral change. 
There were no additional seats. There was no need for additional 
seats. There would still be 10 seats in the province of New 
Brunswick, the same as before. Yet every riding in the province 
of New Brunswick, according to the new proposed mapping, was 
to be changed.
<P>
	From my perspective politically the changes in my riding 
would have been great. I represent my constituents. The 
message they brought forward to me was about why we were 
making changes and spending millions of dollars for the sake of 
change. I had to admit that in that light it made absolutely no 
sense to me.
<P>
	I particularly wanted constituents with concerns to appear 
before the committee to make comments. I intentionally did not 
appear at that committee hearing because of the exact reasons 
the hon. member suggested. I did not want it to be perceived in 
any way that there was a political reason for making those 
suggestions.
<P>
	The comment to me was why change for the sake of change. 
Because a couple of urban areas slightly increased in 
population, they were going to change 10 ridings in the province 
of New Brunswick and spend millions of dollars. This makes 
absolutely no sense.
<P>
	I would like to address this type of issue. It occurred not only 
in New Brunswick but in several other provinces as well. 
Addressed in the bill is the criterion that we can look at it and 
make some sense of it from the perspective of the Canadian 
taxpayers who ultimately will be paying for the changes in 
redistributions or riding maps.
<P>
	I would ask the hon. member to comment, relative to the 
concerns he had previously made.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Madam Speaker, the member for 
Carleton-Charlotte makes a very good point. It was raised by 
many MPs who appeared before the committee. If any 
readjustment is required in a province it creates a domino effect.
<P>
	Certainly my province of Saskatchewan is very similar to 
New Brunswick. Many constituencies have not seen significant 
population change. However the fact that one or two areas have 
seen population change-and it is usually an urban area that 
grows-it means the boundaries somewhere in that province 
have to be redrawn. As soon as boundaries are redrawn they 
affect neighbouring constituencies that would have less people 
as a result of boundaries around the city being tightened. It 
affects the next one and the next one.
<P>
	Once we pass our accepted variance limits and begin to draw 
the first boundary, in most instances the boundaries within the 
entire province are redrawn. It is an unavoidable problem even 
though maybe three-quarters of the land mass is not 
significantly affected by the population change. The new 
process will not significantly change that.
<P>
	In response to the member from Etobicoke, another 
improvement is that readjustment will take place every five 
years, which may mean that changes will be a little smaller; they 
will not be as massive as they were in the past.
<P>
<B>(1130 ) </B>
<P>
	As soon as we begin to draw a boundary, for example if we 
draw a boundary around Carleton-Charlotte, it will affect 
neighbouring ridings and there is no avoiding that. No matter if 
it is every five years or every ten years we have to redraw all the 
boundaries in the entire province. The key then is to make those 
boundaries in the best possible places. That is the job of the 
commissioners with public input which they had in the previous 
legislation and which they will have in this legislation.
<P>
	Again, there are some minor improvements in this legislation 
which allows for a little more public input and some 
alternatives.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I cannot resist asking a question of the hon. member for 
Kindersley-Lloydminster who I thought really scraped the 
bottom of the barrel to find complaints about the committee 
report.
<P>
	However, I congratulate him on his speech where at least he 
vigorously defended the Reform Party position in respect of the 
two principal issues on which we disagree. I think he is picking 
up and harping on a subject that I know the hon. member for 
Calgary West will harp on when he gets on his feet. That is the 
bill to suspend the current redistribution system which in his 
heart of hearts he knows is flawed.
<P>
	He realizes that many of his own members found the 
proposals of the commission quite unacceptable when they 
came out. It just so happens that he did not in his case. He knows 
that some of his colleagues did. I know the hon. member for 
Calgary West was not very happy with the proposals when they 
first appeared. I know that the members from British Columbia 
were quite unhappy with the proposals when they appeared. That 
was true across this House in every party where there were 
members from British Columbia.
<P>
	I think the hon. member realizes that while he can denounce to 
his heart's content and look for difficulties, really he knows that 
the previous process was flawed and needed some repair. He 
must acknowledge, and I invite him to do so, that the proposals 
put forward in this bill are not tiddly-winks as he suggests. In 
fact they are significant improvements on what was there 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9392"> 9392 </A></B>
<P>
before,  particularly the appointment process for members of the 
commissions and particularly the requirement on the part of the 
commissions that they publish their proposed way of doing 
things in advance before they embark on map drawing. Then 
when they have done their map drawing they present three maps 
instead of one.
<P>
	Surely that is a very significant improvement which cannot be 
ignored. It is not some minor adjustment as the hon. member is 
trying to suggest in his speech which I think unfairly represents 
the very diligent work the committee has done.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Madam Speaker, I suggest to the member 
for Kingston and the Islands that the improvement is certainly 
valid but certainly is not worth the $5 million of taxpayers 
money that was spent to suspend the process and start over 
again.
<P>
	I would indicate to the member that I might be willing to bet 
my MPs trading card that his members will probably not be 
entirely pleased with the new boundaries as they will be drawn 
up next time. We will never please all the members of this House 
when we redraw the boundaries. It is absolutely impossible.
<P>
	In closing, with regard to the other point the hon. member 
made, yes, members of our party were unhappy with the way the 
boundaries were readjusted. However we respect and are 
prepared to play by the rules, including the member for Calgary 
West.
<P>
	The people from the city of Calgary who appeared before the 
commission and made their representations in fact saw some 
amendments to the electoral map that made some 
improvements. They used the system, made it work. It was an 
impartial commission that heard it. They corrected the problem. 
They played by the rules. The Liberals were not prepared to play 
by the rules. They wanted to make their own.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Carolyn Parrish (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am rising today to speak in favour of the government 
motion for concurrence in the 51st report of the Standing 
Committee on Procedure and House Affairs regarding the 
electoral boundaries adjustment process.
<P>
	The issue of governance is one that affects every member. As 
the member for Mississauga West with the second largest and 
possibly the most diverse riding in the country I have a keen 
interest in the bill before the House today which can affect my 
riding profoundly. It is definitely not tiddly-winks in this one.
<P>
	Canada has a long tradition of fairness and compromise in 
dealing with the allocation of ridings in our nation. Since 
Confederation this House has taken extraordinary steps to 
ensure that such diverse areas of Canada as Prince Edward 
Island, Quebec and the Northwest Territories each receive 
special consideration. While Canada is a federation of many 
different cultures, ways of life and ethnic backgrounds, the ties 
that bind this country have from time to time been rather 
tenuous.
<P>
	One of the most important ties we do have is a strong federal 
government represented by members of Parliament who are 
seated in this House. In order to build harmony and foster a 
sense of balance and fairness, we must occasionally examine 
and adjust the way we are governed and the method by which we 
choose those representatives who are seated here today. Our 
prime concern should be one of fairness and equity.
<P>
<B>(1135) </B>
<P>
	In 1900 over 80 per cent of Canada was rural and largely 
English or French background but we have changed rather 
dramatically. In 1995 we are largely urban with a huge influx of 
new Canadians, each with different points of view and a strong 
desire to participate in the new land they now call home. Yet 
representing this diverse population in a fair and equitable way 
through the redistribution of ridings remains a highly 
controversial issue.
<P>
	In the riding of Mississauga West over 250,000 residents 
struggle each day to pay bills, become familiar with new 
customs and pursue their piece of the Canadian dream. This 
riding is at least the size of three average Ontario constituencies 
and double the entire population of Prince Edward Island, which 
by the way sends four excellent members to this House.
<P>
	Clearly the time has come to address the challenges presented 
by a rapidly growing, highly urbanized area such as Mississauga 
West. Over 40 per cent of this riding speaks neither official 
language. With many of the 131 languages spoken, schools have 
fewer than 10 per cent English or French speaking students. This 
is an amazing transition in only 10 years.
<P>
	As background I point to the growth patterns of the city of 
Mississauga in the region of Peel. Since its incorporation in 
1974 Mississauga has tripled in size. Growth projections 
provided by city staff show a steady, planned, accurate and 
predictable growth pattern.
<P>
	In 1974 the population was 165,000. It currently is just over 
500,000. Only the recessions of 1982-83 and 1993-94 slowed a 
very steady and dramatic pattern of growth. This year 
Mississauga is Canada's ninth largest and again fastest growing 
city. I represent half of it.
<P>
	With more than $850 million in new development we have 
exceeded the predictions for this year by more than $250 
million, a figure which matches the pre-recession levels of 
growth for 1988-89. Industrial growth in 1994 was also 30 per 
cent ahead of the previous year.
<P>
	I remind the House that these growth rates are equally 
common throughout the entire greater Toronto area. In the areas 
like Markham, Brampton and Oakville the story is very similar. 
New urban areas attract thousands of people annually along with 
new businesses and an appetite for government services, not to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9393"> 9393 </A></B>
<P>
mention a vocal and persistent desire for direct access to their 
member of Parliament.
<P>
	We all know how much work it is to build new cities. Each of 
us knows of the struggles to fund schools, roads, parks and other 
aspects of infrastructure. These are the urgent and visible needs 
of all new communities. What are the less visible needs? Many 
new Canadians require a great deal of help from their federal 
member and his or her riding office. There is no longer a 
tradition of volunteer community help to fall back on, as is more 
common in rural areas. Urban areas tend to be more threatening, 
less welcoming and frankly, tougher places to fit into.
<P>
	My own riding office routinely deals with over 100 phone 
calls per day. The majority of those involve relatively 
complicated questions dealing with immigration and 
unemployment, not to mention pertinent advice and instant 
solutions to all our budgetary problems.
<P>
	The cultural and language problems are immense. Imagine 
trying to deal with at least 40 different major ethnic groups, each 
with special needs and problems. By now members of my staff 
have learned bits of language from all around the world as they 
try to offer friendly and efficient assistance to the best of their 
abilities. I actually have one staff member who is in hospital.
<P>
	These are just some of the problems with monster ridings like 
Mississauga West. I know that as I speak each of us is thinking 
about our own home riding, its problems, its challenges and its 
special situations. In that respect we are all alike in this House, 
men and women trying to do the best we can in the situations we 
are faced with each day.
<P>
	However rapidly growing areas such as York North, Ontario 
riding, Scarborough and Mississauga West need special 
consideration in dealing with redistribution. This report goes an 
immense distance toward meeting the needs of such high growth 
communities.
<P>
	I draw attention to the size variable of plus or minus 25 per 
cent which has been discussed in this House. This provision will 
allow high growth areas more flexibility in establishing realistic 
long term boundaries. Such growth predictions and subsequent 
planning efforts are relatively accurate. Growth areas can be 
easily identified and subsequent adjustments made. There is 
very little risk of error, judging from past predictions and actual 
growth patterns.
<P>
	The new electoral boundaries process will include the 
direction that a commission be established following each 
five-year mini census if more than 10 per cent of the province's 
constituencies vary by more than 25 per cent from the provincial 
average.
<P>
<B>(1140) </B>
<P>
	These five-year mini census adjustments further serve as a 
method to ensure fairness in riding sizes without changing the 
actual number of seats for each province. Thus an area like 
Mississauga West or Mississauga generally could be divided 
into four or five ridings, each with 25 per cent room for growth.
<P>
	In effect for the first time ever we would be exhibiting good 
planning and a recognition of the special circumstances in which 
cities like Mississauga find themselves. After all, politicians 
serve people, not geography. Politicians work for people, not 
hills, mountains and fields.
<P>
	In the past, growth has overwhelmed ridings such as 
Mississauga West which expanded from 140,000 to 250,000 
people in 10 years and from 80,000 to 163,000 eligible 
registered voters. Ten-year adjustments are inadequate. We 
need to recognize that the urban residents in new communities 
create tremendous work while their area is expanding and 
establishing its roots.
<P>
	Federal services do not keep pace, further adding to the 
burden on an MP's office. Unemployment insurance offices, 
Canada Post, passport centres and district tax offices cannot 
keep up. The flight of city dwellers to suburban areas is much 
quicker than the corresponding addition of new federal services 
to meet their demands. We know that many immigrants who 
currently land at Pearson airport will settle in the outskirts of 
urban centres where taxes, rents and services are less expensive.
<P>
	The 51st report of the Standing Committee on Procedure and 
House Affairs regarding electoral boundaries also recognizes an 
often overlooked aspect to riding boundaries: communities of 
interest and existing municipal boundaries. In the past the 
gremlins of redistribution often cobbled together some fairly 
innovative, if convoluted, riding boundaries. Many were more 
representative of a pretzel than a riding. I can only speculate on 
the motive behind the more innovative electoral creations.
<P>
	Suffice it to say the best interest of communities and of people 
will only be served if the riding boundaries are sensitive to 
communities of interest. They must recognize the cohesiveness 
and shared concerns of certain geographic or municipal areas.
<P>
	Some proposals in the recent past had Brampton and part of 
Mississauga in the same riding. This may not be troubling to 
some people, since we know Mississauga is the gateway to 
Brampton, possibly the centre of the new universe as I know it, 
but it does create problems of a practical nature.
<P>
	Think of the extra unnecessary work created in a riding that is 
geographically split or extremely diverse in interests, 
economics or lifestyle. It becomes a delicate and largely futile 
effort to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9394"> 9394 </A></B>
<P>
keep many very different areas in balance. My colleague for 
Bramalea-Gore-Malton knows exactly of what I speak.
<P>
	The report we are debating today addresses these sensitive 
situations. The new guidelines also provide a greater 
opportunity to enhance our relationships with area 
municipalities, not unlike the very co-operative process under 
which the government's infrastructure program was developed 
and implemented.
<P>
	Local planning staff, area residents and municipal leaders 
will have a far greater role and responsibility in ensuring the 
needs of their communities are taken into consideration long 
before final boundaries are decided on. MPs will not be required 
to make the decisions of King Solomon, with very diverse 
interests forcing a member to choose between one community of 
interest and another quite opposite one.
<P>
	There is another innovation. This report specifies, as has been 
mentioned, that three different alternatives for each riding 
redistribution be presented by the electoral commission with a 
detailed rationale for the one they have chosen. The commission 
will collect and justify its preferred option, but the alternatives 
will be available to those who wish to raise objections for the 
first time ever.
<P>
	This new procedure alone adds immeasurably to the 
empowerment of local citizens and civic officials. The hearings 
will then allow citizens to select another option with equal 
population distribution based on alternative communities of 
interest or geographic characteristics.
<P>
	Until now the boundary setting process has been at very best 
something of a mystical, partisan federal rite occurring once 
within each decade. Now the process will be viewed as clear cut, 
straightforward and inclusive. The five-year review is a further 
refinement, reflecting the belief that expanding areas change 
dramatically in a short period of time and therefore need more 
than the current ten-year review.
<P>
	Last, the report attempts to bring fairness and balance into 
riding redistribution. We must be fair to Canadians regardless of 
where they live. Each Canadian is equal in voting power to the 
next. Each vote should, as close as is constitutionally possible, 
carry the same weight as the next.
<P>
	While the urban areas are growing rapidly, it is a matter of 
political fairness that new ridings continue to be established 
where the people live. This shift seems inevitable and needs to 
be recognized. My 250,000 constituents deserve full 
representation, full enfranchisement and full democratic 
powers.
<P>
<B>(1145 ) </B>
<P>
	The population of Mississauga West will soon reach 300,000 
people yet we have only one voice in Parliament, as strong as it 
is. We need to approach this challenge with an open mind and a 
commitment to equity. It is not likely that we will ever please all 
Canadians regardless of our best efforts.
<P>
	Some will always cling to old notions in a process that is long 
out of date. I understand how difficult it is to serve areas that are 
losing population with vast geographic areas between pockets of 
small populations.
<P>
	The report also addresses the concerns of low population 
areas and rural establishments. Some ridings have tremendous 
historical roots dating back to Confederation. They find the idea 
of redistribution or expansion suspect. I am also keenly aware of 
the arguments in favour of certain special status cases such as 
Prince Edward Island. My favourite line, to the member who sits 
in front of me from P.E.I., is it takes eight of him to make one of 
me.
<P>
	These exceptions to the general rule of representation by 
population have long served Canada's best interests. I 
understand that certain compromises may be necessary to 
ensure harmony and equity.
<P>
	The time has come for all MPs to recognize that rapid growth 
also creates special circumstances of equal importance. The 
government motion for the very first time comes to grips with 
the growing problems in urban Canada. For the first time, it 
introduces five-year census adjustment rather than ten. It allows 
rapidly growing ridings to be set at limits 25 per cent below the 
provincial average to allow for expansion which will probably 
occur within those five years.
<P>
	It stresses communities of interest as a prime criteria for 
drawing riding boundaries. It requires the presentation of three 
different options for intelligent community input on riding 
redistribution.
<P>
	I invite all hon. members of the House, regardless of political 
persuasion, to consider these proposals carefully and to 
wholeheartedly endorse the government motion.
<P>
	In conclusion, I would like to very humbly thank the 
committee for allowing me to join it halfway through its 
deliberations. I feel as though I rode in on a white charger just in 
time to save the large ridings from once again being subjected to 
the very cavalier attitude that has been prominent in the past.
<P>
	The chairman has been a marvellous chairman and I really 
consider it a great privilege to have served on this committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
would like to make a comment on this bill on electoral changes. 
It centres more around the size of the House of Commons.
<P>
	I cannot believe that the chairman of the committee in his 
speech said that to introduce a cap or to reduce the size of the 
House is not feasible because of constitutional problems. The 
logic that the member for Kingston and the Islands uses is that 
we should not address the size of the House of Commons and its 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9395"> 9395 </A></B>
<P>
growth. He is defending the status quo and it is just an excuse for 
lack of leadership.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am sorry to interrupt. 
Your questions and comments should be directed to the previous 
speaker from Mississauga West.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Madam Speaker, the member for Mississauga West 
also defends this bill. One of the criteria that I cannot understand 
as a member of the committee she defends is the size of the 
House of Commons growing to 301 members.
<P>
	The greatest classical liberal of all, Thomas Jefferson, said 
that government governs best that governs least. That principle 
has been lost.
<P>
	Let us compare the state of California to Canada. The 
population in California is 29 million. It has 52 congressmen 
and two senators. It has one president and a governor. Fifty-six 
people run 29 million people.
<P>
	Canada has 27 million people. With the Senate and the House 
of Commons, we have 399 people. Perhaps the member could 
address this. We are worried here about representing 30,000 
people or 85,000 people when in the States, one congressman 
represent s 571,000 people. Perhaps a few more staff to help 
with the immigration and unemployment problems would be the 
solution and not to increase the size of this House.
<P>
	This House should be reduced to 265 members at a max. The 
city of Calgary does not need six or seven MPs in the next 
federal election. It needs only four. More members should think 
like that in order to represent the city.
<P>
<B>(1150) </B>
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> They might need eight Liberals but only 
four Reformers.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Yes, four Reformers could do the job of seven 
Liberals, that is right.
<P>
	If we use the same proportion of representation in the United 
States of 85,000 to 90,000 on average, it would have 2,900 
congressmen. That is how disproportionate we are. We are 10 
times worse off than that country because we will not stick to the 
principle that a government governs best that governs least.
<P>
	The Liberal Party pretends to be fiscally conscious but the 
very first opportunity it has-the very first bill that came up was 
this electoral boundaries item-to show leadership, an 
opportunity to lower the overhead and the cost of running 
government and running the country, it chooses to increase 
government and to cop out on constitutional reform.
<P>
	I would like to know if the member could address why she 
favours increasing the size of the House of Commons when I 
know from a personal point of view, working with her on other 
committees, that she believes in fiscal restraint?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Parrish:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the member for the 
compliment. He noted that I was the only Liberal he ever met 
who has tried to save money. Of course that is not true but it 
shows he has a certain bias and that is why he likes to get into 
exchanges with me on subjects like this one.
<P>
	In the United States there is quite a difference in 
concentration of population. If we look at the numbers in the 
United States and the way its population is concentrated, its 
congressmen tend to be able to serve people in a more compact 
area. Canada, by nature, is very spread out and very diverse 
except for areas like Mississauga West. Generally it becomes a 
logistical problem.
<P>
	The other thing, in my opinion, that happens in the United 
States is that it requires millions of dollars to get elected so only 
the wealthy run. Therefore, I do not know if the member would 
be here but I for sure would not. To suggest that many people 
require a prolonged campaign and require enormous election 
expenses ensures that only the very wealthy become elected to 
its representative houses.
<P>
	Obviously I would like to see a cap at some point on this 
House. The member and I have both agree on this. However, in 
the democratic process that went on in the committee we talked 
about it, looked at it and decided it required much more study 
than we were able to give it at this time. I hope I have 
sufficiently answered the member's question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I enjoyed listening to the hon. member's 
speech. I know she was fairly instrumental in one clause being 
included in the act and that was clause 19(2)(b)(iii). I think the 
member knows which one it is. It reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-the probability that there will be a substantial increase in the population of 
an electoral district in the province in the next five years.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It is the anticipation clause which describes fast growth in a 
particular constituency, shrinking the boundaries around that 
riding to allow for growth so that we do not get these inequities 
in the population between ridings. It is probably a fairly good 
principle but it is in conflict with the principle of a number of the 
rural MPs who want to see their ridings remain smaller and who 
argue against that principle.
<P>
	I wonder which principle the hon. member thinks should have 
precedence. Should it be the principle that we shrink the urban 
ridings so that there is room for growth, or should it be the 
principle of the urban members who would like to see the 
population kept closer to a variant or perhaps even see a smaller 
population in a rural riding so that they do not become so large 
geographically? These principles are in direct conflict with one 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9396"> 9396 </A></B>
<P>
another. One or the other has to have precedence. Which one 
does the hon. member think should have precedence?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Parrish:</B> Madam Speaker, I must thank the member for 
pointing out something I had hoped would sneak by the rural 
members. He knows I was hoping it would sneak by.
<P>
	I have to represent the area I live in. I also believe in 
representation by population wherever possible. I would be 
absolutely adamant in hoping, as is the Liberal way, we will 
come up with some sort of amicable solution wherever those 
boundaries touch each other. My first principle has always been 
representation by population, wherever it is possible. I will be 
defending my little clause in the bill to the death.
<P>
<B>(1155) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I rise today also to discuss the motion of the government 
concerning electoral redistribution and to oppose that motion. In 
so doing I would like to make some complimentary comments 
with respect to what has transpired.
<P>
	First of all, as was mentioned earlier, we had excellent 
support in committee and out in the field from Elections Canada. 
Mr. Kingsley, Mr. Girard and Mr. Lesage were very helpful to 
the committee. It is also necessary to mention that the electoral 
redistribution commissions have transacted their work quite 
faithfully under quite difficult circumstances during all of this 
and should be complimented.
<P>
	I would also like to compliment the work of the chairman of 
the procedure and House affairs committee. This is the first time 
that a committee has successfully drafted a bill that we 
anticipate will be tabled. In spite of the fact that there were 
significant differences on major issues of principle, we 
nevertheless were able to work fairly and efficiently in the 
drafting of a bill and in resolution of those issues on which we 
were able to reach consensus.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We do not support this motion by the Committee on Procedure 
and House Affairs for a new electoral redistribution system, and 
I would like to explain why. There are several improvements in 
the committee's report, but there are also two major problems. 
First of all, the five million dollars it will cost to redo the 
electoral redistribution process for this census, the 1991 census, 
and second, the fact that the government, supported by the BQ, 
failed to reduce the number of members and thus the cost of 
maintaining the current number of seats in the House.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The principal reason for my opposition to this report is its 
failure to address correctly the issue of reducing or capping the 
number of seats in the House of Commons. All attempts by the 
Reform Party to make this an issue and to effect some change 
now, rather than some mythical change that supposedly will be 
made some time in the next century were turned down by the 
committee.
<P>
	In addressing the question of the capping or reduction of the 
seats of the House of Commons, let me spend a bit of time 
outlining exactly what the history has been of this issue. We are 
all told that the House of Commons has grown from the time of 
Confederation. Let me review how that has occurred, the 
reasons for it and why it has become somewhat of a critical 
issue.
<P>
	In 1867 there were 181 members of Parliament. Even from the 
beginning there were elements which encouraged growth and 
protected smaller provinces, either in the number of seats they 
had or in cases where they would lose those seats. The original 
formula that was in the Constitution for distribution of seats in 
the House of Commons was based on Quebec having a number 
fixed at 65 and other provinces going up or down, depending on 
their relationship to that number.
<P>
	In addition there were changes made to that formula in 1915 
to protect the seats of the very small provinces, which is 
senatorial clause 51(a) that we have heard some mention of 
earlier today.
<P>
<B>(1200 ) </B>
<P>
	Later on the formula was shifted. Quebec no longer was fixed 
at 65 and instead there were a fixed number of seats in the 
Chamber and the numbers would fluctuate depending on the 
relationship to the total number, although once again there were 
protections against loss of seats. Those amending formulae were 
introduced in 1943 and 1952.
<P>
	All through that period, from 1867 through the various 
changes in 1915, 1943 and 1952 there was really only marginal 
growth in the House of Commons. It was a 30 per cent growth in 
total over that period. The primary reason for that growth was 
the addition of new provinces and the populating of western 
Canada.
<P>
	Beyond that the growth of the House of Commons was 
actually quite marginal. Finally in 1949 there was the addition 
of Newfoundland.
<P>
	It was really only with the formulae that came in under the 
Trudeau government that we began to have excessive growth in 
the number of seats in the House of Commons. In 1974 the 
Trudeau government enacted a formula which was 
unprecedented and which would have gone back to making 
Quebec a base for fixing the number of seats in the House of 
Commons. Instead at this time of fixing a number of seats for 
Quebec, Quebec was fixed at an ever increasing rate around 
which everything else would grow. Quebec is a province that has 
tended to have a stable or even a somewhat falling share of the 
seats. Thisled very quickly to a situation in which the House of Commons 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9397"> 9397 </A></B>
<P>
would have expanded by hundreds of members within a period 
of only a few decades.
<P>
	We grew from 264 seats in 1979 to the 295 we have today. 
There were additional amendments brought in, in 1985, to 
control this situation. Once again they still contain substantial 
growth elements. In particular no province is now allowed to fall 
below the number of seats it had in the 1970s. The only way to 
preserve the principle of representation by population is for the 
representation of large provinces to continually grow.
<P>
	To review what I have said, if we look at the history we had 
both here and in the Senate of the growth of the number of seats 
over the first almost 100 years of Confederation, about 30 per 
cent were determined almost entirely by the growth of the 
country. After that period the Senate has ceased to grow and the 
House of Commons has expanded by 30 or 40 seats. It will 
expand by six in this redistribution and it will expand at that rate 
into the future.
<P>
	What do we propose to do about this? Obviously we propose 
some kind of formula which would cap or reduce the number of 
seats in the House of Commons. The particular formula we 
introduced or we proposed as the Reform caucus was as follows. 
This was a proposal that had originally been made by the 
member for Kindersley-Lloydminster and was supported by 
the member for Calgary Centre and me.
<P>
	We proposed that we establish a permanent number of seats in 
the House at 265. This was the number of seats that had been the 
case here for a long period of time, through most of the fifties, 
the sixties and the seventies. On top of that we proposed that 
there be some provision for small growth in representation.
<P>
	The reason for that was very simple. The senatorial clause, 
section 51(a) of the Constitution, requires that no province can 
have fewer seats than its number of senators. That clause is 
distortive. It is distortive at any level of representation, whether 
small or large. Obviously at the number 265 it is not highly 
distortive and allowing for slight growth minimizes that 
distortion. I am talking about very slight growth.
<P>
	We would have had a House under our formula of 273 seats for 
the next Parliament, growing at perhaps two or three seats every 
10 years. We were talking about a very minimal objective.
<P>
	This was opposed by the other parties for a number of reasons. 
I will quote a couple of them. One mentioned in the report is a 
reduction or freeze in the number of seats in the House of 
Commons would perpetuate and in some cases exacerbate 
inequities in representation between provinces and would 
further erode the principle of representation by population. 
Then it goes on to talk about the effect it would have on 
provinces losing seats.
<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
	Our formula would have caused virtually every province to 
lose seats, which was one of the reasons it was equitable. Also 
the statement as contained in the report is factually simply false. 
The formula we proposed that would give us 273 seats, a modest 
reduction of 10 per cent for the next Parliament, would have 
provided an approximation closer to representation by 
population than under the current formula. The reason is we 
removed the distortion of the grandfather clause which is far 
more distortive than the senatorial clause, which this House has 
imposed and which this House is in a position to remove.
<P>
	The position that this would distort representation by 
population is not true. Our proposal would have improved the 
percentage share of seats that Ontario and British Columbia now 
have, the two provinces most unfairly affected by the current 
formula.
<P>
	There were a number of other reasons given by government 
and Bloc members for opposing this particular formula but they 
were really of an entirely different nature. They were not really 
concerned about the mechanics of the formula or the growth of 
the House. They were the self-interest issues: ``Canadians will 
miss me as their member of Parliament if I lose my seat''; these 
kinds of rationales.
<P>
	Interestingly, very few of these rationales appeared when this 
motion was introduced. The principal reason we were told 
publicly by the government that we were suspending the 
commission and that we were undertaking this committee study 
was the concern of members of the House about the size of the 
House and the terrible cost that would entail.
<P>
	I want to refresh the memory of the House. I could spend a 
good part of the time I have to refresh the memory of the House 
about some of the interventions that were made by various 
members in emphasizing that this report should cap or reduce 
the size of the House of Commons. I want to remind these 
members because we expect that when there is a vote they will 
have an opportunity to get up to oppose this particular motion 
and to stick to their principles.
<P>
	The hon. member for Parry Sound-Muskoka had mentioned 
when we had the debate on Bill C-18 that it is not something he 
has heard from his constituents, that they want to expand 
government and have more government spending. I agree. That 
is why we must oppose this motion.
<P>
	The hon. member for Halton-Peel said if one looks at 
Australia there are twice as many voters per member in that 
country. We are at the point where we have to make some 
changes. Either that or we are going to have to knock out one of

<P>
these walls. I agree. I would be interested to hear from the hon. 
member for Halton-Peel.
<P>
	The hon. member for Nepean said: ``They are talking about 
increasing by six the numbers of representation in the House of 
Commons. We know it costs at least a million dollars a year for 
every member of the House. I have great difficulty with how 
they rationalize that''. I agree with that. This is once again why 
this report should not go through unless there are changes to cap 
or reduce the number of seats in the House of Commons, 
precisely so that we can keep those costs down.
<P>
	All these problems about representation, as the hon. member 
for Nepean well understood, can be addressed through use of 
modern technology, through more efficient use of staff 
resources. It does not require a House of Commons that will 
grow to 350 seats over the next 20 or 30 years.
<P>
	The hon. member for Ontario said: ``Why do we need new 
seats? It seems that the addition of new seats flies in the face of 
the hard earned tax money that Canadians tell us is so hard to 
come by''.
<P>
	The Liberal member for Victoria-Haliburton proclaimed: 
``The cost of adding six members of Parliament is something I 
think the Reform Party and myself included should look very 
hard at. Why would we want to add that kind of money? Why 
would we even think in these tough economic times of adding 
millions of dollars to taxpayers' expenses?''
<P>
<B>(1210 ) </B>
<P>
	The Reform Party has looked at this issue, has proposed the 
alternative. We are looking forward to seeing what the hon. 
member for Victoria-Haliburton has done as he studied this 
issue.
<P>
	The hon. member for La Prairie: ``One principle is 
particularly important. We should not increase the number of 
electoral districts in Canada. Two hundred and ninety-five 
electoral districts for 27 million people is already too much''. I 
agree.
<P>
	The hon. member for St. Boniface, the parliamentary 
secretary to the minister of public works said: ``Would this not 
be a wonderful opportunity to see whether we could do with 
one-quarter or perhaps one-third fewer MPs? I think Canadians 
would applaud such a move. It would mean significant 
savings''. I agree with that also.
<P>
	Our Reform proposal to reduce the number of seats in the 
House of Commons is comparatively modest. We are talking 
about a reduction of about 10 per cent. We could go further. If we 
go further there are some significant problems with the 
senatorial clause. It begins to become fairly distortive. That 
does not mean we should not do it. We should be looking at 
Senate reform. We should be reforming that institution. That 
would allow us to change the senatorial clause.
<P>
	I understand the government is not prepared to do that and I 
understand why. It is very difficult to reduce to the kind of 
number the hon. member for St. Boniface proposed, but a 
reduction of 10 per cent is certainly achievable.
<P>
	The Solicitor General said: ``Since Confederation the number 
of seats in the House of Commons has increased steadily'' as I 
mentioned, the number of members by now would have shot up 
already to more than some 340. That is something we should be 
considering.
<P>
	The hon. member for Scarborough-Rouge River spoke quite 
eloquently in the committee when he said: ``Three hundred and 
one members is not what Canadians want. They want a 
Parliament that works. They want to see it work with 295 
members, not 301 or 310 or 320 as time goes on''.
<P>
	The hon. member for Waterloo said: ``If we continue with the 
process in the longer term we are going to keep adding members 
to the House of Commons. Therefore time is of the essence. We 
have to deal with this issue very quickly. However, I will be 
fighting very strongly to maintain the number of members of 
Parliament at 295, not of course the 301 it is scheduled to go up 
to''.
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary to the minister of citizenship, the 
hon. Liberal member for Halifax said: ``In these days when 
restraint is being urged on us by all fronts, should we really be 
considering increasing the number of members of Parliament?'' 
I think the question indicates its own answer.
<P>
	The hon. Liberal member for Hillsborough said: ``All kinds of 
institutions are looking at holding the line, reducing numbers or 
not going ahead with other plans. I notice new electoral reform 
has just come forward in my own province. It is not the best time 
for us to go forward and increase seats in the House with the 
added costs''.
<P>
	The hon. Liberal member for Perth-Wellington-Waterloo 
said: ``If we approach the population of our neighbours to the 
south, we will need 3,000 seats in the House of Commons''.
<P>
	This is another reason, as the hon. member for Calgary Centre 
mentioned, that we should tackle this capping issue. We do not 
need those numbers. We do not need to have a number of 
politicians which by an exponential factor exceeds the number 
of politicians in a state like California.
<P>
	The hon. member for Algoma said: ``We cannot cap the 
number of seats here forever, but we want to consider how 
quickly the number of seats rises''.
<P>
	Even that suggestion was not solved by the committee. Even 
reducing the future growth was not solved by the committee's 
report. It said it is an issue that should be addressed and studied, 
that Parliament should be seized with the issue. That was the 
purpose of the committee and it failed to do that.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="9399"> 9399 </A></B>
<P>
	The hon. member for Bramalea-Gore-Malton said: 
``Perhaps this House would operate more efficiently and 
effectively if there were dramatically fewer members of 
Parliament than at present and there were a fixed number''.
<P>
	The hon. Liberal member, the secretary of state for 
parliamentary affairs, stated his own view: ``Finally, based on 
the existing formula, the number of seats in the House of 
Commons will increase from 295 to 301 as a result of the 1991 
census, and that concerns me in light of current fiscal 
restraints''.
<P>
<B>(1215) </B>
<P>
	I have a couple more I could mention. The hon. member for 
Carleton-Gloucester, a Liberal member, said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>At this rate there will come a point in 2050 or 2090 where the Chamber will no 
longer be large enough to hold all the new members. It will have to be torn down 
and rebuilt further to make room for the extra seats that will have to be made. If 
you look south, they have only 100 senators for a total population of about 250 
million people.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Literally dozens of Liberal members spoke in favour of what 
the Reform Party is proposing. We look forward to their support 
when the vote on this issue comes about.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I congratulate the hon. member on his speech. I have 
never heard such a good speech from a Reform member in this 
Parliament. The principal reason was that he kept quoting 
Liberal members. If he keeps doing that, he will soon replace his 
leader who does not quote Liberal members often enough. If he 
did I am sure he would go up in the polls instead of down.
<P>
	I want to ask the hon. member a serious question. He went on 
at some length in his speech about the benefits of a smaller 
House and suggested the figure of 265. He also suggested that 
the way we could get away with it was by getting rid of the 
grandfather clause that protects certain provinces.
<P>
	I wonder if he and the hon. member for 
Kindersley-Lloydminster, in the course of their considerations 
of this matter, consulted with the people of Saskatchewan. I 
wonder if they levelled with them and told them that if the 
grandfather clause were taken away that province would lose 
four seats and in the event of a redistribution based on 
population once it was done Saskatchewan would lose five seats.
<P>
	Did he in his consideration of this matter advise the people of 
Saskatchewan through householders, other materials or public 
announcements that if the Reform policy were adopted that 
province would lose five seats? Did he advise the people of 
Manitoba how many seats they would lose? Did he advise the 
people of Newfoundland and of Nova Scotia how many seats 
they would lose? Did he review with members opposite in the 
Bloc and with other members how many seats in Quebec would 
be lost?
<P>
	Those are the issues that have to be faced. If we are to cut the 
number of seats to 265, we have to face the fact that over half the 
provinces will lose representation in the House. Frankly I do not 
think the provinces are prepared to accept that, particularly the 
province of Saskatchewan whose numbers would be decimated 
in this place.
<P>
	I know the member for Kindersley-Lloydminster wishes he 
could answer, but the hon. member for Calgary West says that 
Calgary does not need more MPs. I agree it does not need any 
more Reform MPs; it has more than enough. However 
Calgarians would be well served if it got some Liberal 
representation. Getting extra seats increases the possibility of 
that and he knows it.
<P>
	Alberta is not getting extra seats, but I remember the outcry 
from British Columbia when there was talk of delaying the work 
of redistribution commissions. The Minister of National 
Revenue is from that province. There was a strong outcry 
against not getting the two additional seats to which it was 
entitled under the current arrangement to go to 301 seats.
<P>
	There was an outcry from the minister. The hon. member 
knows that. There was an outcry from the population. There 
were editorials. There were telephone call-ins. There was a 
huge hue and cry at the thought of losing two seats.
<P>
	If that is the case in British Columbia, how is it possible that 
the citizens of Saskatchewan would clamour for a reduction in 
their representation in the House by five seats? That is what 
members of the Reform Party are proposing in the House. If that 
happened and there were an election called on the basis of that 
kind of redistribution, I submit every Reform member in 
Saskatchewan would be out the window, including the very 
capable member for Kindersley-Lloydminster.
<P>
	Can the member comment on that?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Calgary West):</B> Madam Speaker, the whole 
purpose of my speech was to illustrate what citizens across the 
country are saying about representation in Parliament. They do 
not need more MPs. They do not need, in particular, as we will 
probably see in the bill, more MPs who say one thing when it 
does not matter and vote another way when the party tells them 
to do so.
<P>
	Whether there are 14 seats in Saskatchewan or 20 or 28 is not 
going to make any difference if they do not represent their 
constituents in the House of Commons when it matters at voting 
time.
<P>
<B>(1220 ) </B>
<P>
	The other point is that they play little word games. People are 
not as stupid as some of these comments imply. People 
understand that under our Constitution-and some people have 
diffi-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9400"> 9400 </A></B>
<P>
culty with this-we have representation by population in the 
House of Commons and that the voice of Saskatchewan, whether 
it has 14 seats out of 301 or 12 seats out of 280  or 10 seats out of 
250, is in fact the same voice. The only issue is whether it is 
going to cost more or cost less to have exactly the same voice.
<P>
	The fact of the matter is that people realize that if no province 
can ever lose seats and we have rep by pop, the only way to 
sustain rep by pop is with a House of Commons that will expand 
forever. The people understand that. I do not think the 
histrionics in this debate will change people's understanding of 
that. It is unfortunate we have not tackled that issue.
<P>
	If the Liberal government adopted our suggestion it would get 
considerable credit from the electorate in making this kind of 
move. We hear that from Saskatchewan, I am assured by the hon. 
member for Kindersley-Lloydminster, as we hear it in Alberta 
and as we read it in the mail we receive from across the country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andy Mitchell (Parry Sound-Muskoka, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to talk about the issue of 
redistribution and specifically the motion that was tabled today.
<P>
	I would like to begin by congratulating the procedures and 
House affairs committee for the work it has done. It has done an 
excellent job. I am also very pleased to see the first use of a new 
procedure where the committee is coming forth and 
recommending the bill. It is a good system. It worked well in 
this particular case. We should see more of it in the future.
<P>
	I am rising today because the issue of redistribution has a very 
important impact on my riding. It has a very important impact 
on all of northern Ontario and a very important impact on all of 
rural Canada. Rural Canada has challenges in terms of 
representation and distribution that are not necessarily faced in 
the same way as they are in urban Canada.
<P>
	We face the issue of declining populations. We have the 
difficulty of large geographic areas we have to try to represent. 
We have the issue of how we communicate with our 
constituents. If we are in very small urban areas it is not 
difficult, but if it takes four or five hours to travel from one part 
of a riding to another part of a riding the issue of communication 
becomes very important.
<P>
	We have the issue of diversity within our large northern 
ridings. We have the diversity of the people who live there, the 
diversity of the industries that exist there and the diversity of the 
geography, as I have mentioned. These are special challenges 
that people in rural Canada, people in northern Ontario, people 
in my riding have to face on the issue of redistribution.
<P>
	There are three specific areas I would like to address. The first 
is the issue of capping the number of members in the House of 
Commons and the 25 per cent variance rule. The second is the 
whole idea of the public consultation process that is being 
introduced with this proposal. The final and very important area 
is the issue regarding the definition of community of interest. 
That is a very important concept about which I would like to talk 
very briefly.
<P>
	On the idea of capping and the variance of 25 per cent, I 
believe the committee's report offers a good balance between 
what essentially used to exist, which was unrestricted growth of 
the number of seats here, and a plan that is going to allow for 
moderate growth.
<P>
	I have been encouraged by the committee report because we 
have avoided a whole constitutional wrangle that could occur if 
we proceeded with recommendations such as those presented by 
the party opposite. It is not a time to be arguing about 
constitutional niceties; it is a time to be dealing with our 
economic problems. I am glad the committee has seen fit to 
ensure we do not have to go down that road.
<P>
	When we study the ideas in this plan we should remember it is 
important for individual MPs to able to provide effective 
representation to their constituents. All of us in the House work 
very closely with a large number of constituents. In my case we 
receive around 900 phone calls a month. We get almost 100 
letters a day. We have a large number of town hall meetings and 
have to travel over large areas.
<P>
<B>(1225) </B>
<P>
	All members of the House face the challenges of representing 
large numbers of people. An important part of what we do is to 
listen to our constituents, to hear their points of view and to 
bring them forward to the House. If we go down a road where 
few of us are representing an ever increasing population the 
basis of being able to represent constituents will be placed in 
jeopardy.
<P>
	I am glad the report has found the balance between keeping 
the numbers down, which we have to do in terms of economics, 
and ensuring there are sufficient members to provide proper 
representation to individual constituents. I believe this proposal 
will do that.
<P>
	I was also pleased to see the 25 per cent rule maintained. That 
is absolutely necessary for a number of reasons, the first one 
being geographic. There must be a geographic limit to how large 
a riding can get. If as members we have to travel six, eight or ten 
hours to go from one end of our ridings to another-and there are 
some ridings like that in the north-it becomes very difficult to 
provide proper representation. The maintenance of the 25 per 
cent rule will give the flexibility to take that particular issue into 
account.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9401"> 9401 </A></B>
<P>
	I also believe there is an issue of needing to provide 
representation a bit differently in rural Canada than it is 
provided in urban Canada. Those challenges I pointed out 
previously that exist in rural Canada need to be addressed. I 
believe the flexibility the 25 per cent rule provides will allow 
that to happen.
<P>
	Most important, at least as far as I am concerned, is that the 25 
per cent rule and the flexibility it will allow will give us the 
opportunity to adhere to the community of interest guidelines in 
the legislation. I will talk about them in a couple of minutes.
<P>
	I want to congratulate very heartily the committee on the 
public consultation process it has recommended in the proposed 
legislation. When it is implemented we will find that we have a 
far more effective public consultation process, certainly a far 
more transparent process and a more efficient process. I will 
touch on those three points just briefly.
<P>
	First I will deal with the effective aspect. The idea that we are 
to have the ability to go into individual ridings or individual 
provinces and adjust ridings where they have gone beyond the 
25 per cent rule at five-year intervals will mean we can be much 
more effective and much more efficient in ensuring that we have 
proportional representation.
<P>
	It is also important the committee suggested that when the 
commissions go out to consult with Canadians and come back 
with a recommendation they are not just going to come back 
with an all or leave it plan. They will come forward with three 
specific options. The individuals who are to examine them and 
provide input will have a number of options before them and 
some basis upon which to provide their input, to have discussion 
and to have debate about what would be the best route to go. 
They are certainly recommending a transparent process.
<P>
	Under this plan the positions of the two members of the 
commission appointed by the Speaker will have to be 
advertised. The Speaker will go about obtaining staff for these 
commissions in a very public process. Additionally Parliament 
will have the opportunity to examine who is chosen for those 
commissions and if seen fit a motion can be brought before the 
House to reject those individuals. We see a very transparent 
process being put in place.
<P>
	Also in terms of transparency, under the legislation the 
commissions will have to tell Canadians up front the exact 
parameters they are to use in examining redistribution. One 
difficulty we found with the previous process was that the only 
time individual constituents became involved was after the work 
had all been done and it was plopped on the table.
<P>
	The fact that the guidelines will be set out before the 
procedure is important. It will allow Canadians to have the 
necessary input. It is very important that the process for MPs to 
examine the legislation will be the same as that for the general 
public.
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
	When there are public consultation meetings individual 
members of Parliament who feel a need to give representation 
will do so as part of the public process, not as some separate 
process that takes place only in this House. I am happy to see 
that the MPs will be participating in the same way that all other 
constituents will be.
<P>
	I believe we are going to see some efficiencies put in place 
with this process. One of the most important is the fact that it 
says if the parameters have not been breached, if there has not 
been sufficient changes in population, if the variance has not 
gone beyond the 25 per cent rule, a commission will not be 
struck nor will it have to examine it.
<P>
	That is a major and significant change from the way it is done 
right now where it is necessary to review it even if a change has 
not occurred. This is going to save substantial dollars for the 
federal government and it is going to save substantial dollars for 
the Canadian taxpayer. I very much support that.
<P>
	I believe as well that Canadians will be very pleased with the 
fact that government in this instance is going to stop doing 
something it does not need to do. I very much support that.
<P>
	The third area has to do with the issue of community interest 
and the fact that it is being defined very clearly in the 
legislation. It is absolutely critical that it be done. In Ontario, 
the area I am familiar with and in particular in my riding of Parry 
Sound-Muskoka, the lack of attention to community interest 
concept created a lot of difficulties with the recommendations 
that had been brought forward.
<P>
	I would like to cite a couple of examples of how that has 
happened, using my own riding as a basis. One stipulation on 
community of interest is the local economy. My particular 
riding is made up of the Parry Sound district and the Muskoka 
district. They share in common the industry of tourism with a 
common market. Under the proposal that was originally tabled 
those two areas were going to be completely divided and the fact 
that they had a common industry, a common tourism market, 
was going to be totally ignored.
<P>
	Also in terms of tradition, under community of interest it is 
defined that we must take into account traditional 
representation. In the case of my riding at the time of the next 
election it will have existed for half a century. That was totally 
disregarded in the process when the maps were struck the first 
time and the riding was going to be totally ripped apart and 
divided into three different parts. It was not in keeping with the 
traditions. This bill states very clearly under the community of 
interest clause that tradition is an important ingredient.
<P>
	It also talks about the need to delineate between rural and 
urban Canada. In my riding of Parry Sound-Muskoka they 
were going to take an essentially rural area and add into it about 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9402"> 9402 </A></B>
<P>
20,000 individuals from a  metropolitan centre. We would have 
a riding that was no longer uniquely rural and would no longer 
be uniquely urban, but would be a mismatch of the two and 
would make things very difficult in terms of representation.
<P>
	As well under community of interest they talk about natural 
boundaries. That is important. In northern Ontario we have 
many natural boundaries that need to be adhered to when we are 
trying to draw up a reasonable constituency, a reasonable riding.
<P>
	Again in the case of Parry Sound-Muskoka it is bounded by a 
river on the south, a river on the north, Georgian Bay on the west 
and Algonquin Park on the east. Those were natural boundaries 
that established my riding. They did the redistribution and did 
not pay attention to the issue of community of interest and it was 
all put asunder.
<P>
	I am very encouraged about the fact that we do have a very 
much strengthened community of interest clause in this 
legislation and I support that.
<P>
	In conclusion, I do support this legislation because I think it 
finds the correct balance between trying to keep the numbers in 
this House down, but ensuring that there are sufficient members 
to provide effective representation. I support it because it 
provides a better public consultation process that is going to 
allow Canadians to have a meaningful input into the process.
<P>
	Finally, I support this because the community of interest 
clause has been strengthened and will lead to the creation of 
better ridings.
<P>
<B>(1235) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Daphne Jennings (Mission-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, in listening to the member from Parry Sound, I 
am sure he spoke with great sincerity. He seems to be very 
sincere. However, I am concerned about perhaps tossing off 
Reform comments as constitutional niceties. He recognizes the 
economic need for the changes that are happening.
<P>
	I am concerned that he does not appear to be recognizing the 
financial needs. Our country is in the worst situation it has been 
in ever and we have to recognize that this is one way, as Reform 
suggests, to reduce the number of members in this House.
<P>
	We all know it costs approximately $1 million per member. I 
have just returned from Washington. I have met with American 
parliamentarians in the last week and constituents. We did speak 
about this. They feel that they are very adequately represented. 
As members know, they have over 400 representatives and 270 
million people. We are looking at 10 per cent that we have.
<P>
	Maybe the hon. member can perhaps explain why we would 
not be very concerned about the financial counterpart of this 
problem.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the member for her 
comments. The economic concerns that the country faces are 
ones that we have to consider when we are taking a look at this 
package.
<P>
	I believe that the package does that for a number of reasons. 
First of all, the process that it has developed is going to be a far 
more efficient process. It is going to save money. By simply 
saying that if a change has not occurred in a province, if the 
population has not changed or there are not the variances that are 
occurring in individual ridings, we will not go through the 
process.
<P>
	That is going to save substantial dollars. That 
recommendation is in this bill and that is one of the reasons I 
support it. Second, I support it because I would be very 
concerned. One of the suggestions in 265. Why not go to 220? 
Why not go to 210? Why not go to 150?
<P>
	There is an important concept here. As parliamentarians one 
of our roles is to represent our constituencies. If we lessen the 
number of members in this House to a point at which we are not 
able to do that, this government will become captured by the 
bureaucracy.
<P>
	We need government controlled from this House, not from all 
the office buildings that surround this city. In order for this 
House to control this government, to control the process of 
government, we need sufficient members in here to be able to do 
that.
<P>
	That is why the balance struck with this bill between keeping 
very minimal growth but ensuring that there are enough 
representatives to control government is important and in the 
long run will save some dollars.
<P>
	Finally, if we entertain a proposal that is going to require 
constitutional change, that is going to require unanimous 
approval from all 10 provinces, that is going to be a cost that we 
certainly do not want to have to incur.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Brent St. Denis (Algoma, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
listened with great interest to my hon. colleague's speech today. 
As usual he clearly and succinctly put forth excellent arguments 
in support of not only this legislation but of the needs of rural 
Canada, particularly rural northern Ontario.
<P>
	I want to ask him to speak for a moment or two more about the 
25 per cent variance rule. I believe he recognizes along with me 
that at the best of times it is difficult to balance the needs of rural 
and urban Canada. We see that debate raging on the issue of gun 
control, the balance between urban and rural Canada.
<P>
	In a perfect world rural rural residents would not pay more for 
gasoline. In a perfect world rural residents would have equal 
access to our city neighbours to health care and so on.
<P>
	To take a strict definition that all Canadians regardless of 
where they live have one vote and only one vote in relation to 
their member of Parliament does not make sense when one 
considers that we need to balance rural  and urban Canada. It has 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9403"> 9403 </A></B>
<P>
worked very well so far, even though there are some problems. I 
would ask my hon. colleague, in his support for northern Ontario 
and other parts of rural Canada, to speak a bit more to emphasize 
and clarify the importance of that variance rule.
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to thank the hon. 
member for Algoma for bringing up those particular points and 
to emphasize the 25 per cent rule.
<P>
	Like I do, the hon. member represents a riding that is in 
northern Ontario. We share many of the concerns that come from 
representing a rural part of the country and that come from 
representing a large geographic area.
<P>
	He is absolutely right. We need the flexibility of the 25 per 
cent rule. It is particularly important in rural Canada. We need 
the flexibility that it gives. We need it in terms of geography. 
There are suggestions in the proposal that came forward which 
would make his riding-and the hon. member can correct me if I 
am wrong-stretch from Hudson Bay to Lake Huron with a big 
strip right in between. We can all picture a map of Ontario and 
picture what that riding would be like.
<P>
	That kind of thing cannot be allowed to happen. It becomes 
impossible to represent a riding that would have that kind of 
breadth of geography. If you know the terrain and if you know 
how far the communities are dispersed in that area, you can see 
the importance of that 25 per cent rule.
<P>
	One of the things that this report has considered, which the 
hon. member alluded to, is the whole issue of balance. We have 
to balance the needs of rural and urban Canada. It is not an all or 
nothing situation in which we do it strictly by the book and 
strictly by numbers and we draw lines on the map. That is not the 
way to do it. We have to take into account some of the special 
challenges which we have in rural Canada. We have to take into 
account some of the special needs of geography, diversity of 
industry and many of those things I talked about.
<P>
	The hon. member is quite right in pointing out the importance 
of that 25 per cent variance to those of us who represent northern 
Ontario and for those who represent all of rural Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I listened with interest to my rural colleague 
give his speech. I am also from a rural riding.
<P>
	The motion that has been drafted by the procedures and House 
affairs committee in clause 19(2) says that the criteria for 
selecting boundaries should consider a manageable geographic 
size. That is what the hon. member has just argued. The very 
next clause talks of the probability that there will be substantial 
increase in the population of an electoral district in the province 
in the next five years. In other words, in the province of Ontario, 
I believe the hon. member would argue because of the size of his 
riding that his riding should be quite a  bit less, maybe close to 
25 per cent less. The problem is that his colleague from 
Mississauga will also suggest that her riding should be about 25 
per cent less in population because she is going to experience 
strong growth.
<P>
	They cannot have it either way. One has to take precedence 
over the other. I would like to know whether the hon. member 
thinks geographic size is the important criterion and the rural 
riding should be kept smaller or whether he should bow to his 
urban colleagues who suggest that their ridings should be shrunk 
to allow for expanding growth and that they should be on the low 
side of the variable quotient.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> Madam Speaker, I would simply say that we in 
the Liberal Party balance our approach. It is not an either/or 
proposition. The urban member has a particular need and that 
will be taken into account. The rural member will have a 
particular need and that will be taken into account. Between 
those two needs we will find a balance. We will come to a 
solution that has components which help the one member from 
urban Canada and the one member from rural Canada. It is not an 
either/or situation.
<P>
	One of the problems with members of the party opposite, and I 
will say this quite clearly, is they never realize that things are 
not black and white. There are greys out there. You can 
compromise. You can find a balance.
<P>
<B>(1245 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I hope I will 
not be ruled out of order if I begin my speech by discussing 
principles. We do not hear much about them in this place. 
Sometimes we seem to forget that they are important. They are a 
road map for us. As Yogi Berra once said, if you do not know 
where you are going, you may end up someplace else.
<P>
	As the Auditor General recently said somewhat less famously 
but no less accurately, if you do not have a clear idea what a 
program, law or policy is for and a clear set of criteria for 
evaluating it, you will not know if it has worked. Of course the 
Auditor General had in mind primarily the bonfire of the 
taxpayers, known as the federal budget. I see no less reason to 
apply his thoughts to the subject before us, Bill C-18.
<P>
	Electoral boundaries, boy, there is a riveting topic. Bill C-18, 
electoral boundary reform, clause 19(2)(b)(i), there is a topic to 
put the manufacturers of sleeping pills into a panic. It may also 
seem like a topic that leaves no room for principle. It may seem 
like a topic to be settled in a smokefree backroom.
<P>
	I take Mr. Berra's observations very seriously. I think that 
someone who claims not to have a political philosophy to be a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9404"> 9404 </A></B>
<P>
pragmatist is either a socialist trying to cover his tracks or is 
simply unaware of the ideas that motivate him or her.
<P>
	Let us consider if electoral boundaries and in particular the 
provision of this act which says that in drawing those boundaries 
the various electoral boundary commissions shall consider ``a 
community of interest''. That is clause 19(2)(b)(i) as noted 
above.
<P>
	Why is it in here? It is in here because of the implicit or 
explicit assumptions of my colleagues on the opposite bench 
about government. It is in here because of their assumptions 
about democracy. It is in here because of their assumptions 
about politics. It all comes down to the idea that the purpose of 
electoral politics is precisely to hold H.L. Mencken's famous 
advance auction on stolen property.
<P>
	The purpose of creating ridings with a community of interest 
is to put people together who would have a natural tendency to 
combine together, to take from their fellow citizens through the 
political process. It is to create so to speak a level playing field 
for political plunder.
<P>
	While this bill was being prepared I know that the members on 
this side of the House fought hard to get the government to 
change its formal definition of a community of interest. If we 
look at clause 19(4), we will find that the enumerated list of the 
elements of a community of interest is reasonably harmless by 
contemporary standards. Gone are the references to race and 
ethnicity.
<P>
	By the way I certainly hope that the idea of gender segregated 
Senate elections is dead and buried for all time. I am not as sure 
as I would like to be that these ideas are gone. They may have 
taken out the words about ethnically or racially segregated 
ridings without abandoning the idea. It certainly concerns me 
that what we find in clause 19(4) is not exhaustive list. The 
commissions will consider these but they may also consider 
others.
<P>
	There is a real danger that commissions will in practice try to 
create districts that are for instance overwhelmingly 
Indo-Canadian or overwhelmingly Chinese Canadian or 
whatever. I really hope they will not. I am really horrified by the 
idea that people can only be represented by people who look like 
them. I hope that no one believes that any of my colleagues are 
either more or less suited to represent their constituents because 
of the ancestry either of the members or of the constituents.
<P>
	The idea that Sikhs, Indians, Chinese or Anglo-Saxons should 
all be segregated into one riding so as better to seize property for 
Sikhs, Indians, Chinese or Anglo-Saxons perhaps by electing a 
Sikh, Indian, Chinese or Anglo-Saxon as a member of 
Parliament is the most offensive particular manifestation of the 
notion that parliamentary ridings in principle ought to be united 
by people with a common interest so that they can elect someone 
like themselves. This suggests that people should be united in 
groups with people like themselves so that they can act to elect 
someone like themselves and really dive into the pork barrel. 
That is not what I think  democracy is all about. That is not what 
I think politics is all about. And it is not how I think electoral 
boundaries should be drawn.
<P>
<B>(1250) </B>
<P>
	In my view the purpose of government is to protect the lives, 
liberties and property of its citizens. If we do not have a 
government that can fend off Atilla, we have nothing. The 
problem is, any government strong enough to protect our life, 
liberty and property from others is also strong enough to 
threaten them itself. This is the paradox of government and it is 
the solution of that paradox that has preoccupied serious 
political philosophers throughout time.
<P>
	One of the devices that has evolved in British practice and in 
the Anglo-American political philosophy is voting for public 
officers. This is the vital point. Voting is a device for preventing 
government from getting too big, not a way of legitimizing what 
it does. The reason this is its purpose is that all citizens have the 
same fundamental interest: a government that respects their 
rights.
<P>
	Canadians do not, or at least they should not step into the 
ballot box to commit an act of larceny against their fellow 
citizens. They step into the ballot box to render judgment on 
how well the government has protected their rights.
<P>
	Back in 1964 in an apparently quixotic campaign for the U.S. 
presidency, Senator Barry Goldwater spoke to this issue. He 
would not, he said, engage in the politics of plunder. ``If I am 
attacked for neglecting the interests of my constituents'' he said, 
``I will reply that I understood their interests to be liberty, and in 
that cause I am doing all that I can''.
<P>
	I regard the interest of my constituents, whoever they are, as 
being fundamentally the same as the interests of all Canadians: a 
government that protects them from force and fraud and 
otherwise leaves them free to conduct their business as they see 
fit. For that, we need not communities of interest but ridings that 
treat all citizens as equals. That is why on behalf of my 
constituents and liberty I will be voting against this bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, in opening my own intervention I would like to record 
my own appreciation and those of my colleagues of the 
collegiality in the committee whose report is being studied here 
today. I value the exchange of views with the Bloc members and 
the Reform Party members in the committee. It was a good 
dialectical process and an excellent interchange of ideas. It is in 
that spirit that I now speak in the debate.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9405"> 9405 </A></B>
<P>
	I was impressed by the comments by the member for 
Kindersley-Lloydminster and the member for Calgary West 
and their suggestions that the bill had failed to address what 
they considered the key problem, the size of the House. You 
will find many on this side of the House in agreement that this 
whole principle needs radical re-examination and change.
<P>
	However we must consider the amount of constitutional 
amendment that may be necessary to restructure the size of the 
House to correspond to present sociological realities in Canada. 
When you consider the amount of effort involved in that and the 
fact that some years would be exhausted in the process, I would 
question whether it is right to consider this as an omnibus bill 
that must solve every problem of the contemporary legislature 
in one fell swoop. I view it rather as a single problem oriented 
bill addressed with a very specific purpose. In the light of 
present realities it has to go to another House for approval 
before it can be adopted.
<P>
	I think it is in this sense correct to say that the matter of the 
size of the House is better left for another day and perhaps 
another committee. I see no reason why this could not be 
addressed within the lifetime of the present Parliament. But on 
this particular issue, it seems to me we have a full house of 
problems in terms of electoral representation.
<P>
<B>(1255) </B>
<P>
	I noticed in particular in the member for 
Kindersley-Lloydminster's address not merely reference to 
the size of the House but also to other principles, the issue of 
population variance between ridings and also what he referred to 
as the necessity for establishing priority of criteria in riding 
boundaries.
<P>
	He used a term that I will return to a little later. He spoke of 
social engineering and this is an interesting concept. It is a 
Pandora's box of problems but I will return to it in a moment 
because it is the key of the present problem that many of us have 
had with the existing reports of the electoral boundaries 
commissions.
<P>
	What troubled me when I read this latest series of 11 reports 
was a certain element of intellectual anarchy in those reports. 
There were in essence 11 different reports but there were no 
common criteria available.
<P>
	In fact we discussed this matter with the chief electoral 
commissioner, an extraordinarily capable man who paid us the 
tribute of being very direct and forthright in his response to our 
questions. It was established that the commissions had not 
consulted with the chief electoral commissioner in terms of 
guidance as to past practice or as to criteria that should govern 
the exercise of the discretionary role conferred upon them by the 
existing law.
<P>
	This is, in a certain sense, rather strange. It illustrates the wide 
variance, if not dissidence, in what we might call the operational 
philosophy governing the members of these individual 
commissions. When I look at the  commissions I see a certain 
limited functional efficacy in the members of the commissions in 
terms of their training.
<P>
	I would hate to say this in terms of a profession that I have 
also shared in, but there are too many people from one 
profession. There are far too many professors. It may be argued 
that the professors already have an honourable role in our 
society. They are the source of the ideas, but should they be 
making the choices? Would it not have been better to have had 
the professors retained as advisors on technical points but the 
actual decision making role conferred on commissions 
representing a broader spectrum of society?
<P>
	This is one of the issues discussed in the present bill reported 
by the committee. The present bill attempts to address this 
problem by establishing a new process of appointment that 
should ensure wider representation of the larger community, a 
wider spread if you wish of experience among them.
<P>
	The second thing that troubled me when I looked at these 11 
reports was the lack of reasons. Here we have officials not 
elected in any way, non-elected officials appointed by 
prerogative power but exercising enormous discretionary 
powers.
<P>
	That, as very well known to students of administrative law, is 
the real problem in modern government. It is the use or abuse of 
discretionary power by non-elected officials. There are ways of 
tethering discretion and making it operationally useful.
<P>
	One of these is to require bodies when they exercise a power 
to spell out the reasons for doing it. When I look at these reports 
I find absence of reasons. Why did they do this? Why did they do 
that? One has to guess and that is where one comes back to the 
point that the member for Kindersley-Lloydminster made, 
social engineering.
<P>
	It is very easy to go on an ego trip of one's own in exercising 
discretionary power of this sort. It is also very easy for the 
wrong reasons to attribute illicit motives and to say that is a 
politically colourable choice that has been made.
<P>
	The correction of this is to state the reasons. The extra 
advantage in that is where the criteria are spelled out in the 
individual reports. They are then subject very easily to judicial 
review and judicial correction.
<P>
<B>(1300 ) </B>
<P>
	One of the problems in Canada is that we do not entrust to our 
Constitution the spelling out of the basic principles of what is 
constituent power. Constituent power is prior to constitutional 
power. It is the fundamental starting point of a democratic 
society; constituent power, how the government is created, how 
its members are elected.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9406"> 9406 </A></B>
<P>
	Modern constitutions, ours is a 19th century constitution, 
write these elements directly into the constitutional charter. 
More than that, they spell out the principles and more than that 
they have actively functioning courts, constitutional courts of 
a specialized nature or general supreme courts with a massive 
jurisprudence in which these principles are ensured not only in 
their respect in the letter but also in their creative adaptation 
to problems of modern society.
<P>
	The transformation of the United States from a privileged 
society in which the franchise was severely restricted, not 
simply on racial grounds but on social grounds, has been 
massively assisted by the role of the United States Supreme 
Court and judicial interpretation. This is something basically 
absent in Canadian society. It is something that we must have 
established in the future.
<P>
	Therefore, I think it is a legitimate objection. One of the 
things that concerned me most in reading these reports was that 
there were discretionary powers but no clear criteria spelled out 
as to how the discretion was exercised. There was obviously an 
enormous variation when one studied the empirical material 
from one provincial commission to another. It recalls what was 
said of Lord Chancellor Eldon in another context, that equity, 
which he was charged with administering, was as long as the 
chancellor's foot. It is this element that the present bill, as 
reported by the committee to the House, aims to correct.
<P>
	I could be more specific in terms of referring particularly to 
the report of the commission as it affects my home province of 
British Columbia. It troubles me, with the obvious population 
increases in the Fraser River Valley, that there is no extra seat 
there. It is obtained by rearranging crowded inner city 
boundaries where there is very little population change. They 
are simply accumulating them and producing an extra seat. 
What is the reason for this?
<P>
	This is what leads to interesting speculation. I think the 
answer is that it is probably somebody's particular concept of 
social engineering which they have not spelled out, which I 
could guess at, but which I think properly in the constitutional 
processes courts should be able to examine and to correct.
<P>
	I come back to some of these issues because the hon. member 
for Kindersley-Lloydminster very correctly in his address to 
the House this morning spoke of the need to establish priority of 
criteria. We would have to say that the criteria themselves have 
to be spelled out. It is difficult to establish them in any 
hierarchical order. Most countries with statutes or constitutional 
principles touching this area recognize that there is a certain 
element of antinomy or contradiction between some of the 
principles. There is a creative choice that commissioners or a 
judge exercising judicial review must make. The key element 
we demand of the person exercising the discretion is to say 
which criteria they prefer to others and why that criteria. Is it a 
rational  choice or is it something, as I have said, as long as the 
chancellor's foot?
<P>
	We have not gone as far as the United States Supreme Court. 
One would wonder if we have reached the stage where Mr. 
Justice Brennan referred with approval to a concept of benign 
discrimination when asked if the notion of benign 
discrimination permissible because it is cast in a remedial 
context with respect to a disadvantaged class rather than in a 
setting that aims to demean or insult any racial group.
<P>
<B>(1305 ) </B>
<P>
	It is an interesting concept. It is certainly part of American 
social history and in the context of the United States Supreme 
Court no doubt a justifiable decision.
<P>
	In terms of what we are doing one of the things we would have 
to stress in a country that stresses the parliamentary system as 
distinct from the American congressional system and the 
division of powers is the special relationship of a member of 
Parliament to his or her constituents.
<P>
	There is a relationship of confidence that is built up in going 
door to door in an election campaign, a very moving experience, 
but a relationship of continuing trust in handling the problems of 
constituents as they arise over a period of time. What struck me 
again in the reports of these commissions was a certain cavalier 
disregard for the principle of continuity of representation. It is a 
constitutional value. It is closest of all to that philosopher whom 
the opposition parties are fond of quoting, Edmund Burke. I do 
not want to go into Edmund Burke's special features but at least 
the notion of the closeness, the responsibility of a member to the 
electorate.
<P>
	The starting point of any electoral commission in Canada 
under the parliamentary system must be respect for the principle 
of continuity. Where we displace that it must be for reasons that 
we are prepared to spell out, population shifts to be sure. The 
criteria that the committee has offered in its report give us 
guidelines that were not there before in any adequate measure. I 
would have wished them to go further and I will note simply that 
I have made suggestions in the committee for further tightening 
up this area, rendering the criteria more precise.
<P>
	I was supported I believe by the Reform Party and the Bloc but 
I was not able to persuade a majority. I go along happily with a 
majority decision. In this area the criteria must be spelled out.
<P>
	One of the things we have tried to do is recognize this concept 
of community of interest. Canada is the society of the 21st 
century, as somebody said quite recently. I think it is true. We 
have established a special notion of Canadian culture, a 
community of communities in a phrase which a former Prime 
Minister of another political party used without citing its 
original source. This happens quite a good deal. The phrase was 
used by Martin Buber, an Austro-Hungarian by birth but who  
became a philosopher in the new state of Israel and developed 
the theory to explain and put forward a special relationship 
between the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9407"> 9407 </A></B>
<P>
Jewish majority and Arab citizens, the concept of the 
community of communities.
<P>
	What strikes me in the urban seats in this country when I look 
at them across the electoral map is that we have historically 
come to it perhaps by accident in many cases, but the history is 
there. We have recognized this notion of community of 
communities. I embrace with pleasure the fact that my own 
constituency has 22 different communities within it and that to 
win a nomination and to win a majority in an election one must 
put together a platform, an approach consistent with one's party 
position that can build a consensus that extends to all groups or a 
sufficiency of groups.
<P>
	One of the things that troubles me in the reports of the 11 
boundary commissions I am referring to is that they again in a 
somewhat cavalier position have tended to put this aside. They 
seem to be looking back more to a 19th century concept of 
constituencies based on single communities.
<P>
	I think this is interesting but it is back to the future and not a 
good way. I cite this simply to say that we were dealing with as a 
committee highly contentious and arguable reports made by 
boundary commissions. To give the ladies and gentlemen on 
these commissions full credit and honour they were the victims 
of the laws that did not adequately spell out what they should do.
<P>
<B>(1310 ) </B>
<P>
	The chief electoral commissioner correctly, because he is a 
man of high intelligence and high integrity and respect for the 
constitutional proprieties, concluded that it was not his function 
to spell out criteria that Parliament had not spelled out.
<P>
	This is the reason we have attempted in a comprehensive law 
limited to this one problem getting the electoral boundaries 
issue dealt with adequately and to concentrate on that problem.
<P>
	I would have liked to address also the issue of capping the size 
of the House. It seems to me that is for another statute. I would 
simply add as a member from British Columbia that the bill 
guarantees a point very dear to my province, our constitutional 
right to two extra seats in the House of Commons with the next 
federal election. There is an iron clad guarantee there.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I listened with great interest to the hon. 
member for Vancouver-Quadra who not only served on the 
committee of procedure and House affairs but was very active in 
the discussion relating to the whole process we are currently 
discussing and have spent some time on.
<P>
	Being an academic who has been involved in looking at this 
process historically and currently he speaks with some authority 
I am going to ask him to take off his academic hat because I also 
know he has practical experience, having served on a 
commission. He also knows very well the contents of the motion 
that has been presented by the procedure and House affairs 
committee for the consideration of the House.
<P>
	He served on a commission in British Columbia in the past 
and who knows, he may in the future if he continues to follow 
various careers. There was a strong feeling in the interior and 
northern part of British Columbia that the ridings should be at 
the low end of the variable quotient, say minus 20 rather than 
zero. That was a strong representation both from members and 
from the population. In the lower mainland he heard the 
opposite hue and cry. The population is growing very quickly, as 
the member would agree. They asked to have their growth taken 
into consideration and put them down around 20 per cent on the 
negative side of the variable quotient.
<P>
	I know the hon. member is not biased; he is a very fair minded 
man. However, if he and his fellow commissioners were biased 
and perhaps all lived in the lower mainland and wanted to 
represent the concerns of the lower mainland ahead of the 
concerns of the interior and northern British Columbia, would 
this legislation prevent him from carrying out that bias?
<P>
	<B>Mr. McWhinney:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for a 
very thoughtful question. I have never accepted the concept that 
equality requires an absolute equality of rule application under 
all circumstances. As the United Supreme Court and Justice 
Douglas have said, you treat equal things equally but there is an 
element of discretion.
<P>
	I recognize as part of the principle of equality of 
representation that we are entitled to and in all decency must 
make variations that take into account extreme geographic 
conditions such as we find in the north and the interior of British 
Columbia.
<P>
	In exercising discretion as an electoral boundary 
commissioner in the past in British Columbia we did take that 
into account and gave it weight against the clamant demands in 
the city for mathematical equality of representation of all 
constituencies. I would think a commissioner, within the 
parameters established by the act, would properly exercise 
similar discretion.
<P>
	I wonder, and I believe this is the private view of the hon. 
member opposite, whether the 25 per cent offset is not too high 
and whether 15 per cent might not be more realistic under 
present conditions.
<P>
<B>(1315 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Duncan (North Island-Powell River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise on Bill C-18. Eleven months ago 
I rose to participate in the debate on this bill suspending the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9408"> 9408 </A></B>
<P>
operations of the Electoral Boundaries Commission. At that 
time I questioned the political  interference, the waste of 
millions of dollars and the fact that as politicians we were 
involved in that messy process at all.
<P>
	I consider this whole thing to be unfair to the public. We are 
wasting taxpayers' dollars again, in the order of $5 million, and 
once again we will be soliciting their input. I have had 
discussions with many members of the public and they have lost 
the thread on this whole redistribution exercise, as have I from 
time to time. It is beginning to read like a bad novel.
<P>
	Some of the debate that has gone on today reminds me very 
strongly of why politicians should not be involved in drawing 
lines on a map. Some of the objections are tantamount to that.
<P>
	Eleven months ago I also expressed regret and concern for 
overturning a process which had been in effect every decade 
since 1867. I could not determine precedent for this action and 
nothing has changed my mind in the intervening time.
<P>
	It remains a shame why we have gone through this process at 
all, and having gone through it, we have achieved so little. What 
we have before us today, in my view, confirms that fact. This is 
an exercise which retroactively thwarts a longstanding, 
non-partisan method of redistribution.
<P>
	The Constitution sets out the formula for representative 
government based on the concept of equality of voting power, 
that all Canadians should have an equal voice in governing 
themselves. This concept has been modified over time to ensure 
equality and continuity. Today's report does very little, in my 
view, to solidify this notion. We had hopes for a workable report. 
This attempt does not meet our standards and that is why we 
submitted a minority report.
<P>
	First, the total number of seats in the House is not reduced. 
They have increased from 295 to 301, which was the original 
situation with the Electoral Boundaries Commission reports that 
were previously made. We have gone through this whole 
exercise and we are right back at the same place we started.
<P>
	We argue that it is time to reduce the cost of the precincts and 
reducing the number of seats is an important first step. There 
seems to be a notion that the more members of Parliament we 
have the more will be accomplished. We should not confuse 
more and motion with real progress.
<P>
	The hon. member for Calgary West described the capping of 
the number of seats very well so I will not pursue that in my 
speech today. However, we have had a consistent message 
throughout this piece. I am a member of Parliament from British 
Columbia where we have the somewhat unique situation of 
getting additional seats. We receive two of the six additional 
seats in this proposal. Our message has been consistent. It is 
consistent whether we reduce the number of seats to 265 or 
whether the number goes to 301. The message is that B.C. 
should get its fair share, as should the other provinces and  
territories. We started this exercise on the basis that the Liberal 
government wanted to freeze the number of seats at the 1993 
levels. That is not where we are now.
<P>
<B>(1320) </B>
<P>
	The recommendations on the quotient factor contained in the 
report do not deal effectively with the 25 per cent quotient factor 
or the what is called the population variance factor by some.
<P>
	The Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Act specifies that a 
commission is to draw constituency boundaries in such a way 
that the population of each constituency is as close as possible to 
the quotient obtained by dividing the provincial population of 
eligible voters by the number of seats in each province. No 
constituency is permitted to have a population smaller than 75 
per cent of this figure or greater than 125 per cent under this 
proposal.
<P>
	Elections Canada reports that 51 of the 295 existing ridings 
exceed the current permissible population variances. By 
suspending the operation of the Electoral Boundaries 
Readjustment Act we have perpetuated present inequities. What 
we are being offered today as a consequence of Bill C-18 and 
suspending the work of the commission, is 25 per cent. Surely 
we should expect an improved situation as a consequence of this 
delay and study. That is not the case. In fact, the 
recommendation is worse and ultimately the situation will be 
too.
<P>
	We are very concerned that the commission will continue to 
be allowed to draw maps that from the very outset vary up to 25 
per cent from the electoral quotient. This will compound the 
quotient factor in light of population shifts between 
redistributions.
<P>
	The Reform minority report advocates an allowable 
maximum variance of 15 per cent to ensure the primacy of 
equality of voting power over sociological considerations.
<P>
	The report states that there may be some ridings that should be 
more or less than 25 per cent of the provincial quotient and that 
these ridings should be set out in a schedule to the act. What a 
contradiction. We are allowing a plus or minus variance from 
the 25 per cent. With a variance of 25 per cent there should be no 
exceptions, no need for a schedule, I might add a schedule 
without guidelines.
<P>
	Can we really say there has been any substantive changes to 
the bill? When one considers the lack of reduction in the size of 
the House of Commons, one has to consider the conviction and 
the motives of the legislation. It is very difficult to justify 
discarding the work at great public expense of the existing 
Electoral Boundaries Commissions for these so-called changes.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough-Rouge River, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, from my point of view today is a very important day 
for Parliament. We are here to recognize for the first time a new 
way of doing business in Parliament. We are today debating-I 
hope the House will adopt it-the motion whereby the 
government will introduce into the House legislation that was 
drafted, not by the Department of Justice, not by some unknown 
bureaucrat for whom I have the greatest of respect most of the 
time, but by parliamentarians at committee.
<P>
<B>(1325 ) </B>
<P>
	This has occurred using the new rules of procedure that were 
introduced into Parliament by the government very early in its 
mandate. It is a very refreshing step to take. For the first time 
Canadians will have before them legislation that their MPs 
drafted.
<P>
	I am not saying that this is how all the laws should be drafted 
all the time. This time we are showing Canadians that the system 
will work, that their Parliament will work and that we can do a 
job that is terribly fundamental in the way we are perceived by 
the rest of Canadians.
<P>
	We are debating a motion for concurrence in the work that a 
number of MPs in all parties participated in and worked on quite 
hard at committee. I was there. I was one of the many. We look 
forward to it being adopted at concurrence and then becoming a 
bill.
<P>
	I hope we will have a chance to do this in Parliament many 
more times. I hope that the bureaucracy, the public service, the 
executive branch of government, all the lawyers whose job it is 
to draft legislation, will begin to understand and support the 
growing role of parliamentarians in actually putting the words 
and concepts to paper.
<P>
	Aside from the importance of the steps we have taken and the 
way we produced this legislation, the legislation itself is 
actually kind of good. We have done the best we can within the 
political context that exists at this time to reform and draft a bill 
that provides a better electoral boundary redistribution process. 
We are just dealing with the process. No one should think that 
the legislation we are working on now actually permits MPs to 
redraw the riding boundaries. That is not what it is.
<P>
	We have reformed the process whereby electoral boundary 
commissions redraw those boundaries. We have done a number 
of things that have reformed and improved the process.
<P>
	One of the issues that was submitted to the committee for 
consideration and which really does not end up being reflected 
in the draft legislation is the issue of capping the size of the 
House of Commons. The committee was asked to consider that 
issue in dealing with this statute although the statute itself does 
not designate the number of MPs in the House. The 
redistribution of boundaries legislation does not itself set out a 
formula as to how many MPs should sit in the House of 
Commons.
<P>
	Those formulae are actually contained in the Constitution. 
What the committee was asked to do was to reflect on the 
constitutional provisions that dictated how many MPs should sit 
in the House of Commons. More than one section deals with 
those formulae. They prescribe that based on the current 
population of Canada the House of Commons for the next 
general election some time in 1997 or 1998 would have 301 
ridings. At the current time there are 295. That would mean a 
growth of six.
<P>
	It is not a big number but for many of us on the committee 
there was a principle. I was one of those who felt that there was a 
principle that maybe the House of Commons did not have to 
grow forever and ever into the future, that maybe it could be 
capped. Maybe we could say 295 was really enough to represent 
all the various parts of the country. We did not need 350, 400 or 
500 as time went on.
<P>
<B>(1330) </B>
<P>
	That is how I felt. I still feel that way, that we have an 
open-ended formula. As the population of the country grows the 
number of MPs will grow. That is going to be slow and marginal 
over time. It is not something I have to lie awake at night to 
worry about now. The number is going to go up by six. The 
House can physically accommodate six more bodies but it is 
getting a little tight in here.
<P>
	The real issue is whether we want to end the continuing 
growth. I am one of those who would like to do it in some way 
that would, as my hon. friend from North Island-Powell River 
stated, be fair to all provinces. Therein is the problem. How do 
we be fair to all provinces?
<P>
	We have two constitutional provisions now that define the 
growth. One of them is called the senatorial floor, which means 
that no province will have a number of MPs less than the number 
of senators which it currently has in the Senate. The other 
formula is in section 51 of the Constitution Act. It says that 
provinces with declining populations will not be prejudiced by 
the decline in their population. In other words, the province will 
not lose MPs as its population declines, even relative to the 
population of the rest of the country.
<P>
	Those are constitutional provisions and I think everyone 
knows in this Parliament that this is not the time to be tinkering 
with the Constitution. While I want Parliament to deal with the 
issue of how much it will grow in the future, this is not the time 
to start dealing with any particular provision in our 
Constitution. Canadians are suffering from overload in dealing 
with constitutional reform.
<P>
	It simply was not going to be within our ability as a committee 
to deal with this particular issue effectively. I have accepted that 
a future committee, maybe even the same committee, or maybe 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9410"> 9410 </A></B>
<P>
another committee in the same or the next Parliament should be 
dealing with this issue of capping.
<P>
	What have we done in the current bill to remodel the way we 
set the electoral boundaries? This is aside from the number of 
MPs and the number of ridings. We have accepted that there can 
be a population deviation in any one riding above or below the 
average population in a riding, plus or minus 25 per cent. This is 
the one that has been used for a while.
<P>
	There are some deviations out there. The last hon. member 
who spoke indicated that there are 50 out of the 295. They are 
there for a reason. The electoral boundaries commissions 
accepted that there were reasons for the deviations. I accept that 
there simply are reasons for which deviations should or could 
continue to exist over time.
<P>
	I think of the example in my province of Ontario where there 
is a stable or decreasing population in the north with a quickly 
growing population in the south. If we did not allow some 
deviation, we would end up redrawing boundaries in northern 
Ontario which would radically diminish the current 
representation of those people in northern Ontario in this House 
of Commons.
<P>
	I was not prepared to say to all of those people: ``We are going 
to pull one or two MPs. I am sorry, but the mathematics say you 
have to go with fewer MPs''. Those ridings are huge and the 
federal issues that those MPs deal with are no less important 
than the issues urban MPs deal with. I did not want to be the one 
to say that they had to give up their representation in this House. 
Relatively speaking we have the status quo in terms of the 
deviation.
<P>
<B>(1335 ) </B>
<P>
	One thing we did recommend which is included in this bill is 
we took away the ability of the electoral boundary commissions 
to go beyond the 25 per cent deviation. That is no longer there. 
At the present time I think there are only one, two or maybe three 
ridings that go beyond the 25 per cent deviation. That should be 
seen as being distinct from the current circumstance because 
certainly there are ridings now that go beyond the 25 per cent 
simply because since the last redistribution populations have 
grown.
<P>
	Going back to the last time a decision was made about 
boundary sizes, there are only one or two ridings that went 
beyond the 25 per cent. We are of the view, and I hope the House 
agrees, that the boundary commissions themselves should no 
longer have the discretion to permit a deviation beyond the 25 
per cent.
<P>
	We have made other changes which we believe are helpful, 
cost effective and useful in the current process of redesigning 
riding boundaries. We adopted the mechanism of a five-year 
redistribution, a quinquennial redistribution. Rather than going 
into the mathematics of it, it simply means that where there is a 
rapidly growing riding in terms of population we get a chance to 
adjust it in relation to other surrounding ridings at a five-year 
period rather than at a ten year period. Therefore we will not 
have people underrepresented or overrepresented  and we will 
not have these huge populace ridings as have developed in this 
Parliament.
<P>
	It is somewhat unfair to the population of those huge ridings 
with a quarter of a million people. There are one or two out 
there. My riding has 150,000 people. The average in Ontario is 
about 100,000. It means that servicing these ridings is a bit more 
difficult. Therefore, if we have a five-year redistribution for 
some targeted ridings that have grown quickly we put the 
problem to bed earlier and we do not have these huge, huge 
ridings developing over a ten year period.
<P>
	We have put in place a more transparent method of appointing 
the commissioners of the electoral boundaries commissions. We 
think the process is better. We think we are more in control. The 
quality of those appointments will be improved. We have 
involved the Speaker of the House of Commons more directly. 
We have linked that to the floor of the House of Commons at the 
very beginning so that we will be more certain-one cannot ever 
be 100 per cent certain-that we will have quality and 
non-partisan representation on the boundary commissions.
<P>
	I would point out that the chief of each of the commissions has 
been and will continue to be a judge of the Supreme Court of 
each of the provinces, or a judge designated by the chief justice 
there. That has always been helpful in providing 
non-partisanship in the drawing of the boundaries.
<P>
	The new process will provide an initial notice that has more 
detail in it. It is not just going to read: Be aware that we are going 
to redistribute ridings and we are going to redraw the 
boundaries, so get ready. It is going to have more information.
<P>
	In addition, the boundary commissions are going to have to 
publish more than just their map of proposals. They are going to 
have to provide two alternatives so that average Canadians who 
want to be involved in the process are going to see some of the 
trade-offs, some of the different ways of looking at boundary 
redistribution.
<P>
	Canadians will come to the realization early that when we 
change the boundary of riding <I>a</I> we are also therefore by 
definition changing the boundary of riding <I>b</I> next door and 
riding <I>c</I> and on down the road in a domino effect which occurs in 
many cases. The additional maps will be very helpful not to the 
members of Parliament but to the average Canadians who want 
to be involved and understand the process.
<P>
	We are also, as I have said, changing the way the 
appointments to commissions occur. We have reduced the time 
that will elapse between the triggering of it and the presentation 
of the final decision. Time saved is money saved in my view. I 
am sure Canadians want to save some money. We have found 
some ways 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9411"> 9411 </A></B>
<P>
to save money in the process in the way the maps are printed and 
distributed.
<P>
<B>(1340 ) </B>
<P>
	Last but not least, under the current legislation there is a way 
that MPs at the end of the day could deal with the redistribution 
on the floor of the House of Commons after the boundary 
commissions had reported. That sometimes happened as I 
understand it. Keep in mind this only happened once very 10, 11 
or 12 years. However, there was a potential for what some 
people would call gerrymandering. At the end of the process in 
the old days after the boundary commissions had done their 
work, the matter could come to the floor of the House of 
Commons.
<P>
	That is not going to happen any more. Parliament will simply 
accept that the commissions will make their decisions and they 
will be accepted by the House as being the best decisions.
<P>
	I would like to close by commending members from all sides 
of the House who have participated in the process of redesigning 
the bill. The new bill was not accepted 100 per cent by every 
member. There certainly were some trade-offs and compromise. 
There may still be bells and whistles some members would like 
to see in the draft bill which are not there now. However I think 
we have designed and produced a bill that meets the needs of the 
1990s and will serve members and their constituents well for 
many years to come.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I listened with interest to the hon. member's 
praise of this proposed legislation.
<P>
	As my colleague the member for Calgary West mentioned in 
his speech earlier when he quoted the hon. member, he very 
clearly indicated he was opposed to an increase in the number of 
members in this House. When serving with him on the procedure 
and House affairs committee I distinctly remember him saying 
that even an increase to the number of 301 was totally 
unacceptable. I think he used such illustrative language as we 
may have to knock out walls and destroy the beauty of this 
House of Commons if we do not come to grips with the rapidly 
expanding House of Commons.
<P>
	We have a growth of population coming both from outside our 
borders and from within our borders. This legislation is set up in 
a way that the number of seats are determined by population. 
People are coming into Canada, about 200,000 or more a year, so 
that represents two seats per year. Then there is the growth 
within the country. I am not sure of the latest figures but it may 
be a similar amount. Even if it were half that much that would be 
three seats per year. Therefore by the year 2001 the increase of 
six seats from 295 to 301 may seem small by comparison.
<P>
	This legislation does absolutely nothing to counteract that 
problem. In fact it just says that we cannot do anything about the 
problem. We will leave that for some future body, some future 
commission, some future committee of members to deal with.
<P>
	How could the member change his position on this matter?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee:</B> Madam Speaker, I do not think the hon. member is 
correct in saying that I have changed my position. I have already 
articulated my position that I would not want to see an increase 
in the number of members of the House of Commons. That was 
in my remarks when I began.
<P>
	The hon. member obviously has never had the responsibility 
of piloting a constitutional amendment through this House. 
Neither have I. He probably never will have. If the member 
thinks that we can simply pass a statute in this House that says 
that the House of Commons is capped at 295 seats, he is 
mistaken. It is much more than that.
<P>
	First, even if we were to say that we want it to be 295, we have 
to find a new formula to address the needs of all provinces, just 
as this member prefaced his remarks by saying that we have to 
be fair to his province of B.C. We have to be fair to all the 
provinces including those with declining populations that are 
going to say: ``We want a floor; you can add more seats 
somewhere else but you are not going to take any more away 
from us''.
<P>
<B>(1345) </B>
<P>
	The government has to find a new formula. It has to pass a 
constitutional amendment and get it approved by all provinces 
or by two-thirds in a process that will take a number of years. 
While I am willing to embark on the process, it certainly is not 
going to happen this month, this year, in this Parliament.
<P>
	I support the principle and the objective.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joseph Volpe (Eglinton-Lawrence, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I compliment my colleague from Scarborough-Rouge 
River who gave us an opportunity to witness a very complex and 
complicated issue in three very simple and very easy to 
understand formulae.
<P>
	First he addressed the process that involves the House of 
Commons and something to which every member of the 
Chamber ought to adhere and applaud. The committee has given 
Parliament, the House, an opportunity to appreciate what 
members can do and ought to do.
<P>
	On the basis of process, not only the way the committee works 
but the way it arrived at a decision, I compliment him and the 
other committee members who put the proposal forward. I urge 
all members to support it. I also compliment him on the way he 
outlined the basics of the content.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9412"> 9412 </A></B>
<P>
	The content addresses a very important principle in the 
House, that is how we work for our constituents and how 
Canada will be reflected in the Chamber. We cannot do that 
simply by cutting the number of seats or by increasing the 
number of seats willy-nilly, in a very whimsical fashion.
<P>
	By pointing out the process for establishing the kinds of 
representations we would like to see evolve for the House he has 
done us a great credit. Most important, the member has done 
something that all other speakers and interveners have 
unfortunately neglected, that is he gave an indication of the 
reasons or the philosophy behind this proposal.
<P>
	That basic philosophy recognizes that the House always has a 
very difficult time getting a singular view. There is a very 
important reason for this, that the country as diverse and as large 
as it is cannot possibly have a single homogeneous view on the 
basis of a partisan perspective.
<P>
	I compliment the committee for recognizing that very integral 
difficulty in governing a country like ours and in making 
provision in the rationale and the motivations for redistribution 
so that members can bring forth many important views that 
differ not only in content but in motivation.
<P>
	I compliment the member for Scarborough-Rouge River. He 
has given members of the House an opportunity to take a look at 
the issue in a very dispassionate, non-partisan and yet forward 
looking fashion.
<P>
	I encourage all members on both sides of the House not only 
to agree with his position but to applaud the efforts of the 
committee and vote in unison on the issue.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
remarks.
<P>
	On the suggestion of the member opposite that we really 
should have tried to do something to cap the number of MPs, or 
even reduce the number of MPs in the House, I would say that if 
there were a motion on the floor of the House of Commons to 
cap, reduce or deal with unending growth of the House of 
Commons I would vote for it. He should get a motion introduced 
and I will vote for it.
<P>
	However the member must be aware that after the motion 
passes, after he articulates his good wishes, he still has to go 
through all the constitutional reform procedures and deliver a 
formula that will be accepted from coast to coast to coast. That 
is the challenge.
<P>
<B>(1350 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I appreciate the hon. member's remarks but I 
would point out to him that my colleague from Calgary West 
suggested constitutional changes that can be determined within 
this body and without agreement of the provinces because it did 
not affect the senatorial floors and so on.
<P>
	He did not appear to support these moves, even though he had 
the opportunity. In fact he changed his mind.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee:</B> Madam Speaker, I would ask the hon. member 
whether his home province of Saskatchewan would be willing to 
give up seats to accommodate the proposed cap that his 
colleague put forward.
<P>
	I hear otherwise. It might be worth a look and when it comes 
up I will be on side and in favour of ending the unending growth 
of the House of Commons.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réginald Bélair (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, of course I have considerable interest in speaking 
today, because my riding of Cochrane-Superior is in northern 
Ontario, and its survival is at stake.
<P>
	I would first like to pay tribute to the committee chairman and 
to all of my colleagues who helped draft this report, which I 
would call apolitical. I attended a few meetings, and I must say 
in all sincerity that they have done a tremendous job. It was, 
however, a job that had to be done; it was inevitable, given the 
situation. First, the act dates from 1964; it bears no resemblance 
to the way Canada's current electoral map looks today.
<P>
	On issues of representation, the report focuses significantly 
on the quotient, the variance of 25 per cent. This remains 
something that is very important for me, for the simple reason 
that, because of this quotient, large rural ridings in Canada will 
never be safe and will never have equal representation here in 
the House. I need only point out how far we have to travel to 
serve our constituents. This is our prime function, to serve 
people.
<P>
	For example, if a riding like mine were abolished, according 
to the recommendation of the September report, the four 
surrounding ridings would simply become bigger. It would 
therefore simply increase the already excessive demands on 
each of these members, or rather on their resources, energy and 
ability to reach remote communities.
<P>
	If I may be permitted to speak specifically about remote 
communities, my riding of Cochrane-Superior includes 21 
Indian communities, 16 of which are north of the 49th parallel. 
For the most part, there are no roads leading to these 
communities, which means that when I want to go there, make 
myself available to them, I must charter a flight, which is 
extremely expensive but must be done. This then contradicts the 
Reform Party's argument that it is too expensive to have a great 
number of members in the House. This argument verges on 
being absurd. 
<P>

<B><A NAME="9413"> 9413 </A></B>
<P>
What good will it do to increase, to double the population of 
such a riding while retaining the same member without giving 
him the resources, both human and financial, to carry out his 
work?
<P>
<B>(1355) </B>
<P>
	And what purpose will it serve to do away with many rural 
ridings only to increase the size of so-called urban ridings and 
thereby, as stated, make demands exceeding the members' 
resources and energy. More importantly, should this come 
about, it would be a direct attack on democracy, here in Canada, 
because all Canadians, wherever they live, have the right to be 
equally represented in the House of Commons.
<P>
	I would of course like to reserve my main comments for the 
third reading of the bill once it is tabled.
<P>
	These are the points I wanted to make at this time. I have not 
addressed the true substance of the report. I will wait for the bill 
to be tabled. At that time, I will be able to provide the statistics 
to back up what I have just said.
<P>
	This report is not acceptable for northern Ontario, not at all. It 
is not acceptable at this time. I will therefore certainly table an 
amendment in the House, first and foremost to restore the 
schedule of ridings called ``special'' because of their geography. 
That has been removed from the report. I definitely intend to 
attempt to have it included again. I hope my colleagues will 
appreciate my purpose and will support me in this matter.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
commend the member for identifying a very real problem in our 
Constitution. We have a real anomaly. If we were to be honest 
we would have to say a constitutional change is in order.
<P>
	If Canada's population remains constant but Quebec's 
population goes down, we need more members in the House of 
Commons for that reason, by our present rules. That does not 
make sense in anybody's thinking. Therefore we do need to have 
a change in this regard. There ought to be a formula that 
recognizes geography, the area of a constituency, because it is a 
very real factor in any area away from the more densely 
populated areas.
<P>
	The member who just spoke was right on the button when he 
said that we need to change the rules so it is possible for an MP 
to do his work. As far as the numbers are concerned, I think 
Canadians would have no trouble at all with supporting their 
members of Parliament.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> It being 2 p.m., pursuant to Standing Order 
30(5) the House will now proceed to Statements by Members, 
pursuant to Standing Order 31.

	<B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Waterloo, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
constituents of my riding have given me a clear message to pass 
on to the Minister of Finance for the budget.
<P>
	Eliminate waste in government. In particular, stop the rip-off 
of taxpayers' dollars by the military, by their inefficient 
management of government moves, and implement the 
government's own reports and contract out move management.
<P>
	Stop double dipping by MPs and civil servants. Reform MPs' 
pensions. Deal effectively with the deficit to get Canada's fiscal 
house in order.
<P>
	We must also reaffirm our commitment to our internationally 
renowned system of higher education, maintaining accessibility 
through an income contingent loan repayment scheme and 
support for our federal granting councils to sustain university 
research efforts in Canada. We need strategic long run 
investment in wealth creation through university research 
funding.
<P>
	The University of Waterloo, Wilfrid Laurier University and

	<B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval-Centre, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, in several cities in Quebec, the province's student 
associations have indignantly protested social program reform, 
especially changes to the funding of post-secondary education.
<P>
	They have all said that the proposals are unacceptable and that 
they will have the negative effect of causing an unprecedented 
increase in tuition fees, which in turn will bring student debt to 
dizzying heights.
<P>
	Lucienne Robillard, the Liberal Party's candidate in the 
riding of Saint-Henri-Westmount, surely agrees with the 
students' criticisms. In fact, on May 29, 1991, she said in the 
Quebec National Assembly that she had to insist that the federal 
government was completely out of touch with today's world of 
education.

congratulate a Liberal MP backbencher today. I was at a meeting 
in a constituency not so long ago. With the press in attendance 
this powerful MP made an amazing promise. He promised that 
he would not vote with the government on the budget if the 
budget raised more taxes than a gasoline tax and a lottery tax.
<P>
	Reformers say that no taxes should be raised, but this 
powerful MP made that promise. Everyone was there to hear 
him. Think of it. No more cattle herding by cabinet solidarity; 
free MPs to vote their constituents' wishes.

	<B>Ms. Hedy Fry (Vancouver Centre, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
want to remind members of the House and Canadians that 
February 6 to 12 is Eating Disorder Awareness Week.
<P>
	The theme is: ``Breaking free: Celebrating our natural sizes''. 
The goal is to increase awareness of the social factors which 
contribute to the development of anorexia, bulimia and weight 
preoccupation, and to prevent them.
<P>
	Anorexia and bulimia are more common among women 
between the ages of 13 and 25 and is increasing rapidly in a 
society that glorifies thinness.
<P>
	During this week, the National Eating Disorder Information 
Centre will provide messages consistent with Health Canada's 
vitality program, promoting healthy weights. The vitality 
program pinpoints our society's preoccupation with weight and 
unrealistic body size and responds by building self-esteem and a 
positive body image.
<P>
	Healthy bodies come in a variety of shapes and sizes. A good 
weight is a healthy weight, not just a low weight. Dispelling the 
myth about weight and directing Canadians to appropriate 
resources is only the start in correcting this insidious disease 
that devastates our young women.

of the Canadian international development programs that 
support  sustainable development and alleviate poverty in

<P>
	With assistance programs, more than 80 per cent of the 
world's children have been immunized, sanitation and water 
quality have improved, more people are living longer and 
healthier lives, food production has tripled, and there is greater 
literacy in the world.

	<B>Mr. Paul DeVillers (Simcoe North, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
lately there has been much speculation about the imminent 
federal budget. The previous government raised taxes 39 times 
under the guise of deficit reduction, but the deficit continued to 
swell uncontrollably.
<P>
	I frequently said during the election campaign and again in 
the House that we need more people paying taxes, not people 
paying more taxes. I believe Canadians are generally 
fair-minded about taxes, but I am certain they will accept only 
changes that make the system more equitable.
<P>
<B>(1405 ) </B>
<P>
	During recent weeks the leader of the Reform Party and others 
in his party have been talking a lot about a taxpayers' revolt. 
This negative rhetoric is not constructive and does not reflect 
the new way of doing politics which the Reform Party so 
frequently espoused before coming to Ottawa.
<P>
	It is also unnecessary. The government and indeed very 
member of Parliament knows that middle class Canadians 
cannot bear a greater tax burden. In fact, the Liberal members 
addressed this problem head on during the last election 
campaign.

verifies what many Canadians have known for years: family 
budgets do not balance. Why? StatsCan reports that family 
income has actually declined by 6.7 per cent since its peak in 
1989. The report calls it the longest and steepest decline in the 
last four decades. In fact, the average family income in 1993 was 
slightly lower than the level recorded in 1980.
<P>
	As if that is not enough, personal per capita income and take 
home pay has also declined. The culprits? The PST, GST and UI 
premiums. We are income taxed to death.

	It seems easy for the government to dismiss the grassroots tax 
rallies springing up across Canada. In doing so it blithely 
dismisses the growing economic nightmare of those individuals 
and families that hold our future as a nation.

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday when the Minister of National Defence answered one 
of our questions in the House, he said he had absolutely no 
knowledge of the existence of a third videotape concerning the 
Airborne Regiment in Petawawa.
<P>
	How could the Minister of National Defence say he had no 
knowledge of the existence of a third videotape, when General 
de Chastelain specifically informed him of the existence of this 
third tape in a memo he sent to him personally on January 23?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Michael Collenette (Minister of National 
Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday the hon. member for Charlesbourg asked me the 
following question:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Can the minister promise that this new tape will not be destroyed like some of 
the evidence-</BLOCKQUOTE>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Also he went on to talk about the tape as being of ``similar 
quality and horrendous nature as the one to which was referred 
earlier about the hazing incident''. I replied that I had no such 
evidence of the existence of that particular tape. However I went 
back to the report and we sent out a clarifying release last night 
so that there is no misunderstanding.
<P>
	In the report that came to me there was an acknowledgement 
of a videotape of something that was described as welcoming 
party, the activities at which were mostly beer drinking and 
other things that people do from time to time in a social context, 
but one where there was masticating of bread which of course we 
find totally abhorrent. It was described in the report to me as 
something that was not of a serious nature, that it was something 
that was not in comparison with the earlier tapes.
<P>
	The interesting thing is that I have just been informed-and I 
want to get to the bottom of it after question period; I am sorry 
that question period will not wait for me-that the description of 
the events in the  report that was given to me by the chief of 
defence staff two weeks ago does not corroborate with what I 
was given five minutes before two o'clock today.
<P>
	Because I would like to get to the bottom of this I want to ask 
for the indulgence of hon. members so that I can come back 
certainly tomorrow and give some clarification of the matter.

<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, by all 
means, by all means. Considering the controversy around the 
regiment in Petawawa and the fact that this controversy has even 
led to the immediate disbanding of the regiment, how can the 
minister seriously say, two weeks after reading the report from 
the chief of defence staff, no less, how can he seriously say that 
yesterday he had no knowledge of the existence of a videotape 
and today, that he is not sure that the report from his chief of 
defence staff gives an accurate description of the content of the 
tape?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we have to 
understand the context of the question of the hon. member for 
Charlevoix yesterday.
<P>
	He referred to the existence of a tape that was worse than the 
ones that were made public and which led to the dismantling of 
the regiment. I said yesterday and I say today that I have no 
evidence of that kind of tape being in existence.
<P>
	However what I am saying is that in the report I got two weeks 
ago there was no reference to an initiation ceremony, nothing of 
that nature. There was reference to a welcoming party where the 
description I gave was applied.
<P>
	What I am saying is that the description that I got two weeks 
ago did not add up to what I have just been told was actually in 
that video. It still does not go any way along the lines of the 
earlier video in terms of the abhorrent nature of the contents of 
that video to Canadians.
<P>
	What I am saying is that since I have just been informed of 
this I would like to get to the bottom of it to clarify it.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
minister says he has no proof of the existence of this tape. It 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9418"> 9418 </A></B>
<P>
seems to me that if the chief of defence staff mentions it in his 
report, that should be sufficient proof for the minister.
<P>
	Are we to conclude that the minister was so prompt to disband 
the Airborne Regiment in Petawawa without, as he himself 
admitted, being aware of all the facts and all the available 
evidence, because he was probably trying to put a lid on it? Was 
he trying to cover up reprehensible acts engaged in by senior 
officers of the Canadian Forces, acts that would tarnish the 
army's reputation?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the decision 
to disband the regiment was made on good grounds. We made 
that public two weeks ago and it was made notwithstanding the 
recommendations of senior officials in the armed forces.
<P>
	One of the reasons that I believe disbanding the regiment was 
right at that time is that I did not know as minister what else may 
be out there.
<P>
	When the hon. member spoke to me yesterday it seemed to me 
he was referring-I have heard lots of rumours about other video 
tapes-to the existence of other evidence that may come to light.
<P>
	What we did two weeks ago is that we took the sequence of 
events, the deployment last year to Rwanda where some of the 
airborne got in trouble, the two video tapes, and we said that 
there was something radically wrong with this regiment, that 
there was a systemic problem, and on those grounds we ordered 
the disbanding of the regiment.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I know the seriousness of this issue. I would 
ask that the questions and the answers be to the point.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Marc Jacob (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
before I begin, I would like to say to the minister that if this tape 
does not contain anything of serious concern, it should be made 
public and we will see for ourselves. It is being held by military 
police and no one can deny that.
<P>
	Last December, the minister of defence announced that a 
commission of inquiry was being established to investigate the 
events in Somalia involving soldiers of the Airborne Regiment 
of Petawawa. In spite of additional events which further 
exacerbate the situation, the minister did not deem it necessary 
to take immediate measures.
<P>
	How can the minister of defence justify not yet having 
established a commission of inquiry into the actions of the 
Airborne Regiment although section 45 of the National Defence 
Act gives him full authority to do so?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we are going 
over some ground that was covered a couple of weeks ago.
<P>
	After the juxtaposition of events of the report based on 
infractions in Rwanda, the second video tape with racist 
behaviour involving some people now before courts martial, and 
the third involving the hazing, we felt that was enough. Enough 
was enough. We believe the problem was of such systemic 
origins that it had to be dealt with by disbanding the regiment, 
and I think there has been widespread public support for this.
<P>
<B>(1425) </B>
<P>
	In a perfect world I would have waited to take any action with 
respect to this regiment until after an inquiry had reported. I 
have to underscore the fact that the government inherited this 
particular dossier and what we will be judged on is how we 
handle the matter now, not how it got to one place right at the 
beginning months ago.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Marc Jacob (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
may I remind the minister that we must distinguish between the 
events in Somalia and the events in Petawawa. Section 45 of the 
National Defence Act authorizes him to establish a commission 
of inquiry immediately, rather than disband the regiment and 
wash his hands of the affair and punish no one except enlisted 
men.
<P>
	How can the minister claim to deserve the confidence of this 
House and of the public when, on the very day he set about 
disbanding the Airborne Regiment, he concealed from the 
public the existence of a third tape?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not want 
to make light of the hon. member's intention, but the fact is that 
when we are talking about the existence of other tapes I do not 
know how many tapes are out there. I do not know how many 
copies there are. I do not know how many camera people there 
are. What is obviously happening is that as modern technology 
is catching up with everyone, including the armed forces, people 
are taking tapes of certain activities and I do not know exactly 
what is out there.
<P>
	With respect to the question of why, sure we have the 
authority to set up an inquiry right now. There is a court decision 
now before the Supreme Court, the Westray Mine decision, that 
calls into question the fact that we could have an inquiry, a 
coroner's inquest or judicial proceedings all at the same time.
<P>
	Once judicial proceedings were initiated, and they were 
initiated before we were elected, there was no choice but to 
adjourn the original inquiry. What we are saying is once due 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9419"> 9419 </A></B>
<P>
process is followed with the existing  courts martial, and that 
would be the middle of March, there will be an inquiry. It will be 
public. It will be headed by a civilian. All these questions on 
how the regiment was fit for deployment to Somalia will be 
answered.

	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Canadians across the country are angry and we witnessed this 
last night at the huge anti-tax rally in Toronto. They cannot 
believe the government is considering tax increases.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> They were all Reformers.
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> I do not think it was just Reformers at the tax 
rally.
<P>
	In the 1993 election we heard the present Prime Minister 
challenge then Prime Minister Kim Campbell to recall the 
House of Commons in the middle of August so that pension 
reform could be dealt with. He promised and told the press that 
the Liberals would change that plan in a day. Over 600 days have 
passed since then and Canadians are still waiting.
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister. What changed since 
the 1993 election campaign? Why is the minister backtracking 
right now on his election promise? Will he introduce legislation 
now to reform MPs' pensions?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, first I thank the hon. member for Beaver River and 
other members of the Reform Party who attended the 
installation ceremony of the Governor General yesterday.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I would also like to thank the member for 
Laurier-Sainte-Marie and the other members of the Bloc 
Quebecois who attended this ceremony.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It was a sign of respect for the institution. They did what is 
expected of all members of Parliament; they displayed good 
manners.
<P>
	As far as the bill is concerned, there will be legislation very 
soon in the House of Commons. It will be announced either 
before or at the same time as the budget.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
heard something to that effect this morning on ``Canada AM''. 
What surprises me is that we have heard cabinet ministers, 
especially the Prime Minister, say that they cannot reveal 
anything that is going to be in the budget. How things change. 
He has just revealed, quite likely, that it would be revealed in the 
budget.
<P>
<B>(1430 ) </B>
<P>
	The Prime Minister said: ``MP pension reform is in the red 
book and I am committed to everything that is in the red book''. 
This vacuous document unfortunately has become the Liberal's 
book of excuses. It is like the fine print on a legal contract, just 
like the Deputy Prime Minister's promise to resign if the GST 
were not scrapped in a year. We are waiting for that to come true.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister go beyond the bare minimum 
outlined in the red book which does not address the problem of 
only six years for people qualifying for pension and paying in, 
and a contribution ratio of employer to employee of eight to 
one?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in order to be courteous to the hon. member, I would 
would not like to see the bill passed before March 13. That will 
be the day she will qualify for the pension.
<P>
	The bill will be dealt with. We made promises in the red book 
which will be kept. There are some people who want us to move 
further. We are discussing that at this time.
<P>
	However, there is one thing I would like to say to all members 
of Parliament and to the public. The salaries of members have 
been frozen for years. Members of Parliament work very hard 
and are not very well paid. Many school directors and chiefs of 
police and so on are making much more money than members of 
Parliament.
<P>
	I am not one to try and score political points at the expense of 
people who try to serve their citizens well as members of 
Parliament.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would agree that Canadians are not unreasonable. Nobody is 
suggesting that MPs do not work hard or that they do not deserve 
fair compensation for their years of public service. They simply 
want the MP pension plan brought into line with the realities 
faced by the private sector and do not violate the Income Tax 
Act.
<P>
	If the Liberals are not willing to reform their gold pension 
plan, then start with mine which does kick in on March 13.
<P>
	How can he justify a pension plan that is eight times as rich as 
the people who are paying for it, the taxpayers of Canada?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, there was a commission that looked into this problem 
not long ago and reported. It said members are really underpaid 
for the work they have to do. I agree with the commission.
<P>
	This pension plan was established a long time ago. I have been 
a member of Parliament for 32 years this April and I have seen 
members of Parliament who had a very difficult time adjusting 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9420"> 9420 </A></B>
<P>
to life afterward. I am informed that there are a lot of former 
members of Parliament who were in this House two years ago 
who are having a difficult time, some of them 58, 59 or 60 years 
of age, finding another job because they were in Parliament 15  
years and cannot make the transition to private life very easily.
<P>
	I am not about to play politics with it. We will be fair to 
members of Parliament. I ran on a program and it was written 
there that it will be at least the minimum we will announce 
before the end of this month.

	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is 
for the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	According to the Liberal member for Gander-Grand Falls, 
senior finance officials have already presented the measures that 
the Minister of Finance plans to take in the next budget to 
influential business people and bankers.
<P>
	Will the Minister of Finance confirm that he is considering 
the following measures, among others: a $4 billion reduction in 
transfer payments, a one per cent increase in the GST rate and a 
one per cent tax on the capital held in pension funds and RRSPs?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member 
knows very well that I have no intention of making any comment 
on specifics concerning the budget. Having said this, I can 
confirm that no meeting such as the one described in the hon. 
member's letter ever took place.
<P>
<B>(1435) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Minister 
of Finance could perhaps explain to us in what context the 
meeting occurred, if it did not occur in the way I described. 
Also, given the disastrous impact that a one per cent tax on 
capital accrued in RRSPs and pension funds would have, will the 
Minister of Finance commit to immediately and unequivocally 
ruling out this tax which would cost taxpayers, mostly from the 
middle class, some $5 billion?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we have obviously 
just seen the drawback of writing the supplementary question

	<B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is 
for the minister of Indian affairs.
<P>
	According to a story in today's Winnipeg <I>Free Press</I>, an 
aboriginal band in northern Manitoba is sending 53 band 
members to a conference in the Dominican Republic at 
taxpayers' expense.
<P>
	Does the minister approve of this waste of taxpayers' money? 
Does he simply not know what is going on in his own 
department?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this is a story that came 
today. This is not my department. This is an aboriginal decision.
<P>
	This is something I will look into and I will get back to the 
hon. member with the information. Unlike members of the 
Reform Party, I want to hear both sides of the issue before I 
respond.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Prime 
Minister said a few minutes ago that people find it difficult to 
find jobs when they leave this place and it is because they have 
made such a mess of the economy.
<P>
	I can understand the minister having a difficult time 
understanding why things like this offend the taxpayers because 
members of his own caucus like to go on these kinds of junkets.
<P>
	Can the minister tell this House what the goal of this trip is, 
how he justifies it? Is it just the case of the government looking 
for expensive new ways of appearing ridiculous, in which case it 
has succeeded admirably?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as I have indicated to the 
hon. member, I will discuss it with the First Nations of 
Manitoba.
<P>
	If it is inappropriate in my opinion I will so state. I will at least 
talk to them unlike the hon. member who, when he talks about 
fairness and has a meeting in his own riding, sends out notices at 
our expense and advises everybody except the aboriginal people 
in his own riding.

question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	At the start of the week, the Minister of Human Resources 
Development stated that the government would proceed with its 
reform of social programs and that it would be consulting the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9421"> 9421 </A></B>
<P>
provinces. The last federal-provincial ministers conference on 
income security was cancelled on April 18 due to the strong 
opposition of a number of provinces to its reform.
<P>
	Does the Minister of Human Resources Development plan to 
call a federal-provincial conference on social program reform 
before the upcoming federal budget?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for her question. I can answer very briefly that just before the 
Christmas break my deputy met with his counterparts in the 
provincial governments to talk about the process they would like 
to initiate. A meeting was also held in the third week of January 
with the social service deputies to raise that question.
<P>
	The response we received back from the provinces is that they 
would like to wait before they start a formal process until after 
the budget to be sure on the fiscal parameters.
<P>
	I would like to indicate to the hon. member that I had a 
meeting last week with all the social service labour market 
ministers from the Atlantic provinces.
<P>
<B>(1440 ) </B>
<P>
	We had a very good discussion about how we can approach 
ongoing consultations with the provinces. I will be meeting with 
other provincial ministers individually over the next couple of 
weeks. I can confirm for the member that several provinces are 
quite ready to look seriously at how we can work together for the 
development of a new social reform package.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, are we 
to understand that the government intends to present the 
provinces with a fait accompli by failing to call a 
federal-provincial conference on the proposed reform prior to 
the budget? Is it the government's intention, despite the 
discussions that have taken place and despite the additional cuts 
planned in the budget, which the number of rumours about 
would appear to  confirm, to simply announce to the provinces, 
without prior consultation, what the cuts will mean for them?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I explained to the hon. 
member that in the meetings we held in both December and 
January at the senior official level in which we raised the issue 
of how we should proceed with a useful process of discussion, it 
was the wishes of the provincial representatives that any further 
meetings of ministers await the tabling of the federal budget.

of view of the provinces and therefore abide by their wishes.

the interest of saving hundreds of millions of taxpayers' dollars 
I ask the minister of immigration if he would consider the 
following Reform proposals: eliminating the Immigration and 
Refugee Board; selecting more refugees from abroad and 
reforming visas to end abuse; creating a safe third country list; 
negotiating a cut to legal aid for court appeals for illegal 
residents; not issuing any more amnesties for failed claimants.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Colleagues, usually in Question Period we 
might get a question and maybe tack a little one on behind. 
When we get up to five that is a little much. Perhaps the hon. 
minister could answer the first two.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I could not agree with you 
more.
<P>
	This government has already taken measures to improve not 
only the immigration but also the refugee determination system.
<P>
	We passed the other night Bill C-44, intended to improve the 
system and cut down on the very abuses that are part of that. We 
said at the end of last year as part of the program and agency 
review that additional reforms will be brought before the House 
of Commons in the very near future.
<P>
	I ask the member to also judge us on that record.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, if 
the minister will not agree to those proposals, how about a 
pledge not to repeat expenditures like these next year: furniture 
for his friend Michael Schelew, $100,000; a $100,000 
handshake when Schelew had to leave; $25,000 for a trip for 
senior bureaucrats to Vancouver Island; $2,000 for bookmarks

<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> These multiple questions are difficult for the 
Chair to control in question period. As long as the questions deal 
with the administration of a minister's department, of course I 
will consider them. When  questions are so specific that perhaps 
they should be best put on the Order Paper, hon. members should

himself to the first two questions.

<P>
<B>(1445) </B>
<P>
	The Minister of Health has obviously been overtaken by the 
events and stubbornly refuses to assume her responsibilities 
with respect to AIDS. This minister shows her staggering 
incompetence by displaying her inability to understand what 
those afflicted with this terrible disease must go through.
<P>
	How does the Minister of Health explain that, two weeks 
before the federal budget is tabled, an amount of $1.1 million 
earmarked for the fight against AIDS is still unused and that, 
after waiting for 10 months, the minister still refuses to allocate 
this amount so that people with AIDS and community field 
workers can get help?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, I am sorry but if someone has been overtaken, it is the 
hon. member, because I have explained several times how we 
handle the money set aside to fight AIDS. We have, in phase II, 
$40.7 million a year, which is spent directly on assistance and 
research programs to prevent AIDS.
<P>
	In addition, the Medical Research Council spends $2 million 
each year on research programs. At the international level, 
CIDA also spends money.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr.

fact that seven community projects are waiting on her desk,

authorize these projects, which have been waiting for her 
signature since October?

his strong concern for the health and welfare of the Canadian

complaining that they are experiencing effects which are

these complaints for the future well-being of the Canadian 
forces members?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we have been 
concerned about this problem for some time.
<P>
	No definitive link has been made with respect to some of the 
symptoms people are experiencing and the participation in the 
Gulf war. A registry has been established at veterans affairs. A 
special clinic here in Ottawa at the National Defence Medical 
Centre has been established to deal with it. A protocol has been 
put forward for all medical personnel in the armed forces to deal 
with these complaints as they come forward. The Surgeon 
General of the armed forces has written to every member 
serving in the Gulf to ascertain whether or not the kind of 
complaints which have surfaced in some cases are prevalent.
<P>
	We have no definitive link yet. Neither do similar authorities 
in the U.S. and Great Britain which also served in the gulf. It is 
something we want to get to the bottom of and we are at least 
putting these steps in place to address this very serious problem.

Speaker, I have in my hand a report that was produced over a 
year ago by the department that answers to the Minister of 
Human Resources Development. This report shows that the 
unemployment insurance program is so poorly designed that the 
unemployment rate could be .5 to 1.5 per cent lower than it 
currently is.
<P>
	The minister's own department admits that unemployment 
insurance needs reform. He has had over a year to do something 
and has done nothing. When will we get some real action?

be glad to take a look at it.
<P>
	As the hon. member knows, but I hope this does not come as a 
great surprise to him, we have just spent four months on a major 
public consultation by a committee looking at the 
unemployment insurance program. Members of Parliament, 
including his colleagues, have made a number of 
recommendations. In fact, I think he was on the committee. It 
strikes me that if he had all of this information, why did he not 
use it then?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Mr.

that uses consultation as an excuse for inaction. That is what is 
happening. This report is available.
<P>

props. If that is indeed the report, I would just ask him to put it 
down so he can put his question. No props.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Canadian taxpayers are sick of people who abuse our social 
programs, but they are even more sick of politicians who do not 
do anything. The minister is bent on making his programs 
bigger; he seems incapable of making them better.
<P>
	Will the minister finally admit that big government programs 
are actually the root of the problem?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, to go back to the hon. 
member's somewhat fiery declamations, after yesterday's 
question period I made a special point of going back and looking 
very carefully at the recommendations tabled by the Reform 
Party as part of its committee report.

agree fully with the comments made by the hon. member's 
colleague, the member for Calgary North. She said: ``They were 
not thought through very well; they were rushed into print'' and 
no one should take them too seriously. That certainly speaks to

question is directed to the Minister of Transport.
<P>
	The Minister of Transport recently announced his policy on 
assigning new international routes to air carriers. This policy 
will give Canadian International an advantage by granting it a 
quasi-monopoly on Pacific routes and excluding Air Canada 
from this lucrative market.
<P>
	Would the Minister of Transport agree that by denying Air 
Canada access to the Hong Kong and Chinese market, he is also 
depriving Canadians of the substantial benefit they would enjoy 
as a result of competition between the two carriers?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, Air Canada is of course interested in the Hong Kong 
route. However, as you very well know, in 1994 we gave Air 
Canada access to Japan with a route to Osaka via the new Kansai 
airport. I can assure the hon. member that the outlook is pretty 
good. Air Canada will hire more than 350 flight attendants and 
recall about 100 pilots. That is not bad.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Guimond 
(Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
could the Minister of Transport explain why, after the Gemini 
affair and the guaranteed loan of $50 million to Canadian 
International, the federal government has once again decided to 
give Canadian International an edge over Air Canada? Does he 
have an explanation?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I know the hon. member is trying, but I want to point 
out that with respect to international routes we need to be very 
careful on exactly what was done and when. This government 
certainly did not contribute any $50 million guarantee to 
Canadian Airlines International.
<P>

	In spite of what the hon. member is trying to produce in front

Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of National 
Defence.
<P>
	The minister has promised to begin an inquiry into the 
incident surrounding the airborne regiment in Somalia after the 
appeals are completed. It seems as though much of the airborne 
regiment's trouble has to do with the breakdown of the 
command structure.
<P>
	Would the minister at least commence the inquiry procedure 
by naming the members of the inquiry so that there will be no 
delays after the appeals?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Collenette (Minister of National Defence and

<P>
<HR>

<P>
before in this House. The inquiry will begin not after the appeals 
but after the initial proceedings, the courts martial. That will be 
sometime in mid-March.
<P>
	Once the judicial proceedings are finished, the hon. member 
will know the people involved in the inquiry and the terms of 
reference. I am sure that once he sees them, which will be soon 
after the judicial proceedings are completed, he will be quite 
satisfied.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, </B><B>Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I was merely suggesting in order to make sure there 
were no further delays after the inquiries take place that we 
move quickly to at least name the people on the inquiry board.
<P>
	The morale of the Canadian Armed Forces is in serious 
jeopardy and I am sure the minister realizes that. There are such 
events as those of the airborne regiment, sailors on welfare, 
subsidized housing, golf trips for generals, and now cuts to the 
medical support for Canadian peacekeepers in Croatia which 
was reported today.
<P>
	How can the troops be expected to have confidence in their 
commanders while these devastating morale problems remain 
unresolved?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Collenette (Minister of National Defence and

a loaded question that was one. Everything the hon. member has 
ever learned about the armed forces, anything negative in the 
last little while has been rolled up into one question. I really 
cannot give a detailed answer to everything because I would be

	With respect to the inquiry, it will begin once the courts 
martial are over. With respect to the other questions he raised, I 
have responded to those questions in public and I can give 
detailed answers to the hon. member.
<P>
	I will say one thing. We all have a responsibility as politicians 
to ensure that there is adequate, informed and reasoned debate 
about any institution so that we do not undermine the morale of 
institutions like the armed forces.

<P>
	The system we already have is one of the most rigorous in the 
world today. However we are going to improve that even further 
so that the availability of products to our horticultural 
producers, our foresters and all Canadians will be provided in a 
more efficient, more cost effective, environmentally safe and

	<B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Transport.
<P>
	I have been informed that the new plan for the Trans-Canada 
Highway through New Brunswick is on the desk of the premier 
of the province of New Brunswick and he is negotiating with the 
federal government for funding for same.
<P>
<B>(1500) </B>
<P>
	The proposal cuts off the largest industrial base in the 
province of New Brunswick, the city of Saint John. I am 
informed that it costs over $1 billion to go through the base.
<P>
	There is another route and that is the existing route-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The hon. member's question, please.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Wayne:</B> Will the Minister of Transport confirm to this 
House that his government will not be part of a cost sharing 
agreement for the TCH in New Brunswick that will cost the 
taxpayers $1 billion when the present route can be built for $200 
million which ensures that all the three major cities, Saint John, 
Fredericton and Moncton, are treated equally and are connected 
to the U.S. border with a four-lane highway from St. Stephen?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I want to thank the hon. member for her question 
because I know it may be one of the last questions she raises in 
the House. I understand she is looking forward to replacing 
Dennis Cochrane in New Brunswick as leader of the 
Conservative Party and thereby reducing the Conservative 
caucus in this House by 50 per cent in one crack.
<P>
	With respect to highway construction in New Brunswick, as is 
the case everywhere else in the country, the hon. member would 
be aware that it is a provincial jurisdiction. If the Government of 
Canada is able to participate, we certainly will try.
<P>
	As far as the routing of the highway is concerned, because of 
the nature of the provincial jurisdiction she would have to 
negotiate that in her new incarnation in the legislature of New 
Brunswick with Premier McKenna.

	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern

	I would like to correct the geographic error I made. I have 
three, sometimes two, critics in the Reform Party sitting in the 
same area, the hon. member for Prince George-Bulkley Valley

for Prince George-Bulkley has 11 First Nations and the hon. 
member for Skeena has 23, 30 per cent of his population.
<P>
	There was a meeting called `let the people speak'. There was a 
panel set up and notices were sent out. The notices did not go to 
any aboriginal people in the riding and no aboriginal people 
were asked to sit on the panel.

	It was the riding of Prince George-Bulkley Valley and not 
the riding of Skeena. I apologize on a geographic error but 
certainly not for the sentiment expressed.

was an error in geography. This is what the hon. member was 
referring to.

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="ORDERPAPERQUESTIONS-SPEAKER'SRULING">ORDER PAPER QUESTIONS-SPEAKER'S RULING</A></H4>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I am now prepared to rule on the matter raised 
by the hon. member for Delta, on December 13 and December 
15, 1994 regarding the response and supplementary response of 
the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans to Order Paper Question 
No. 82. I would also like to thank the hon. member for his very 
detailed written submission dated February 1, 1995 which 
served to clarify his remarks in the House.
<P>
	I wish to state at the outset that having reviewed all that was 
said in the House as well as the answers to the question printed 
in the debate, I remain of the view and must reiterate that this is 
not a prima facie case of privilege.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Before explaining my decision, I would like to draw 
members' attention to citations 31(1) and 31(2) in Beauchesne's 
Sixth Edition, which state:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(1) A dispute arising between two members, as to allegations of facts, does 
not fulfil the conditions of parliamentary privilege; and</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(2) The failure of a minister to answer a question may not be raised as a 
question of privilege.</BLOCKQUOTE>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Although I have not found a prima facie case of privilege, I 
want to comment on this matter for the benefit of the hon. 
member and of the House. Beauchesne's sixth edition, citation 
403 states in part:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9426"> 9426 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The House recognizes two broad categories of questions-the oral question, which 
the Standing Orders recognize as dealing with matters of urgency, and the written 
question, which is designed to seek detailed information from the Ministry.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I emphasize the last phrase because the purpose of the written 
question should be to seek and receive precise, detailed answers 
to carefully worded questions.
<P>
	In his representation the hon. member for Delta stated that 
members expect the responses to Order Paper questions to be 
accurate and well reasoned. He noted that the question he 
submitted was one requiring detailed study by the government 
and was one for which he wanted a detailed answer. He also 
argued that it is incumbent upon the government to provide not 
only the questioner but the House with accurate information. In 
this the hon. member is absolutely correct.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The wording of Standing Order 39 itself gives us further 
information about the nature of this type of question. It reads, in 
part, that members may put questions to the ministry ``-but in 
putting any such question or in replying to the same no argument 
or opinion is to be offered, nor any facts stated, except so far as 
may be necessary to explain the same; and in answering any 
such question the matter to which the same refers shall not be 
debated.'' Because questions on the <I>Order Paper</I> are not meant 
as a vehicle for debate, the rule expressly prohibits the inclusion 
of opinion or argument, the very things which lead to debate.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The Clerk of the House, acting on behalf of the Speaker, has 
the full authority to ensure that questions placed on the Notice 
Paper are coherent and concise, in accordance with practices of 
the House.
<P>
<B>(1510 ) </B>
<P>
	As Speaker Fraser noted in a ruling on October 2, 1991 at page 
3147 of the <I>Debates</I>, questions are scrutinized as to the 
correctness of their form and content before they are placed on 
the Notice Paper. To aid members as well as the Clerk and his 
staff in ensuring that questions for the Order Paper are properly 
formulated, citation 428 of Beauchesne's sixth edition lays 
down an extensive list of restrictions applicable to written 
questions. It is, however, incumbent upon the members 
submitting a question for the Notice Paper to ensure that it is 
formulated carefully enough to elicit the precise information 
sought. There are, however, no similar provisions in the 
Standing Orders for the Speaker to review government 
responses to questions posed.
<P>
	In the present case we are dealing with a matter of the 
interpretation of the wording of a question placed on the Order 
Paper. The hon. member for Delta anticipated a particular reply 
which was not the reply tabled in the name of the hon. minister. 
The member contends that the written response provides 
erroneous information. He argues that he has found 
discrepancies between the minister's response and information 
contained in  documents he has obtained through the Access to 
Information Act. For his part the hon. minister maintains that 
every effort has been made to answer the question posed by the 
hon. member for Delta.
<P>
	I remind all hon. members that we have a tradition that what is 
said in the House or placed on record in the House is accepted as 
true. My predecessor, Speaker Jeanne Sauvé, phrased it aptly 
when on February 28, 1983 at page 23278 of the <I>Debates</I> she 
stated that it is not the role of the Chair ``to determine whether or 
not the contents of documents tabled in the House are accurate''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Joseph Maingot in his book <I>Parliamentary Privilege in 
Canada</I>, at page 199, summarizes well the situation faced by the 
Speaker in such circumstances. He writes that before the 
Speaker can find a prima facie case of privilege in a situation 
where there is a dispute about facts, there must be ``-an 
admission by someone in authority, such as a minister of the 
crown or an officer of a department, an instrument of 
government policy, or a government agency, either that a 
member of the House of Commons was intentionally misled or 
an admission of facts that lead naturally to the conclusion that a 
member was intentionally misled, and a direct relationship 
between the misleading information and a proceeding in 
Parliament.''
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This is not the first time there have been disputes over replies 
to Order Paper questions or over the content of documents 
tabled by the ministry. For example, I refer hon. members to 
three rulings, the first on February 28, 1983 at pages 23278-9 of 
the <I>Debates</I>; the second on February 21, 1990 at page 8618; the 
third on May 15, 1991 at page 100. I must point out, however, 
that in none of these cases was the matter found to be prima 
facie. As Speaker Fraser noted in the May 15, 1991 ruling:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The hon. member has raised an issue which is not an unusual kind of issue to 
raise. The hon. member is not satisfied with the response given. The difficulty 
that is always with the Chair in these cases is that there are often very great 
differences of interpretation on answers given. It is not a question of privilege, it 
is a question of disagreement over certain facts and answers that were given.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This precedent holds true in the case now before us.
<P>
	Questions on the Order Paper are a very important tool in the 
hands of members. As I stated earlier, their purpose should be to 
seek through a precise, detailed formulation precise, detailed 
information that will enable members to carry on their work. It 
is incumbent upon all those involved on both sides of the 
process-the members formulating the questions, House 
officials reviewing those formulations, the individuals drafting 
the replies and the ministers of the crown tabling those replies in 
the 
<P>

<B><A NAME="9427"> 9427 </A></B>
<P>
House-to ensure that every care is taken so that these 
exchanges remain as fruitful and as useful as possible.
<P>
	I want to thank the hon. members who intervened in this 
matter.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it gives 
me great pleasure to rise in my place today to discuss the report 
of the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs 
regarding redistribution.
<P>
	I would like to congratulate the committee for its very 
thoughtful report. The conclusion of this report as far as I 
understand it is basically the result that we are going to create 
six new electoral ridings in Canada.
<P>
	I had the honour to appear before this committee on June 24, 
1994. The substance of my submission to the committee at that 
time was very similar to my thought process today. The bottom 
line is that the people of my riding and indeed the people of 
Canada do not want to see any further increase in representatives 
in Canada's federal House.
<P>
	As we look out at industry today the buzzword is downsizing. 
Everyone is becoming more efficient, more effective. We are 
analysing the civil service, finding ways it could be more 
effective with the labour force it has. We have a freeze going on 
in the civil service to make it smaller and more effective. Today 
bigger is not necessarily better.
<P>
	I refer to an old bad joke that Canadians often quip on the 
hustings: It is fortunate that Canadians do not get all the 
government they pay for. It is a bad joke, but it is a bad joke on 
the people of Canada, the taxpayers of Canada.
<P>
	Today we have telecommunications and all kinds of 
communication media to access our ridings and the people of 
Canada. I have become a great user of the information highway, 
the Internet. I can go to my office this afternoon and broadcast a 
message across Canada. These are the kinds of efficiencies we 
have to bring to government and to the House of Commons.
<P>
	I spend roughly 80 per cent of my staff's time in the riding 
dealing with roughly 10 per cent of the population base. 
Obviously members can increase their constituency size, the 
number of members and constituents they deal with, without an 
effective increase in the cost of operations.
<P>
	I look at my own particular riding of Durham which takes in a 
number of other political jurisdictions. Along with myself, there 
is one senator. We have five MPPs in Queen's Park. We have a 
regional government of 32 members. We have 66 mayors and 
councillors. The question of course is: Is this type of governance 
giving us better representative democracy in Canada? What do 
other jurisdictions do?
<P>
	As I mentioned in my submissions to the committee in June, a 
fair comparison would be that of our southern neighbour, the 
United States. In 1911, 84 years ago, almost 100 years ago, the 
United States capped its system of representative democracy 
with 435 representatives in Congress and 100 senators.
<P>
	In Canada, we have one federal representative for every 
75,000 people. In the United States, it is one for every 465,000 
people. The U.S. manages its system much the way we manage 
ours. Every 10 years it has a census and it redistributes within 
the existing system. Some states get more representatives and 
some less, depending on their population growth.
<P>
<B>(1520) </B>
<P>
	If we continue our current arithmetical formula, obviously 
this House is going to extend out on to the Ottawa River. We 
have over half as many representatives as the United States, yet 
it has 10 times our population.
<P>
	I read in the report on page four comments regarding a cap or 
reduction as not feasible at this time. On page five I read that to 
change the electoral process significantly would be highly 
disruptive at this time.
<P>
	I thought that as members of Parliament we came here to 
make decisions and that was what we were being paid for. 
Maybe we are saying we cannot make decisions and we need 
more members to make them for us. I do not know if that is what 
we are trying to put across here. I do not believe the people of 
Canada want any further increase in representatives.
<P>
	There are basically two issues of concern here. One has been 
represented by some of my Reform colleagues which is to 
reduce the actual numbers of federal members of Parliament. 
The second one is a proposal by the committee that is basically 
to increase the representation by six members.
<P>
	I have a better solution that is somewhere in between. This is 
Canada's constant striving for compromise. I also recognize 
there is a problem as was mentioned in the committee report 
itself. A grandfather clause signed back in 1986 with a number 
of the provinces stated that reductions in the seats by provinces 
would not change beyond the 1986 level. It is clear that 
agreement has to be revisited and renegotiated. I am suggesting 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9428"> 9428 </A></B>
<P>
that has to be renegotiated and revisited now, not some time in the 
future.
<P>
	Six more members of Parliament, people have suggested to 
me, might cost as much as $6 million. That does not mean that 
members of Parliament get $1 million a piece, but when we start 
adding up the duplication in services, duplication in staff, et 
cetera, we find there is a tremendous increase in cost. My 
constituents and I are very supportive of reducing the cost of 
governance.
<P>
	The problem basically has to do with mathematics. 
Unfortunately in this House we seem to have a lot of problems 
dealing with mathematics. In my office this morning I took the 
existing level of seats and the popular vote and reduced both the 
seats and the population base taking into account the senatorial 
floors of the existing provinces that are already at their 
senatorial floors. From that figure I also subtracted the 75 seats 
that are now represented by the province of Quebec. After this 
mathematical formula takes place, the 75 seats roughly equal 
the 25 per cent of the population base of Quebec as related to the 
total population of Canada.
<P>
	The bottom line is a result like this: It would add one seat to 
the province of Alberta, two to the province of British 
Columbia, but would reduce by three for the province of 
Manitoba, increase by six to Ontario, and reduce by four to 
Saskatchewan. New Brunswick would have no change. 
Newfoundland would lose one seat. The Northwest Territories 
would remain unchanged, as it is already at its senatorial floor. 
Nova Scotia would lose one seat. Prince Edward Island would be 
unchanged. Quebec would be unchanged. Yukon would be 
unchanged. The sum total is 295 seats, what we have here today.
<P>
	Looking at population statistics there is no deviation. 
Looking at the 1991 census there is no deviation in those 
provinces greater than 1 per cent of the total population of our 
country. In other words, it is representation by population which 
is basically what we are trying to achieve.
<P>
<B>(1525) </B>
<P>
	I have not dealt with the aspect of distribution within 
provincial boundaries, the differences between rural and urban 
areas. Presumably we can follow the guidelines of the report, 
using an electoral boundaries commission in concert with the 
provinces.
<P>
	In conclusion, it is clear to me that the people of Canada do 
not want an increase in the number of members of Parliament at 
this time. It seems to me that we should possibly rethink this and 
go back to see whether we cannot renegotiate that grandfather 
clause.
<P>
	I have found there are too many decision makers and not 
enough decisions being made. Let us refocus our attention to 
making this a reality today and not pass the decisions off on 
some future Parliament.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to ask the hon. member to clarify what he just said about 
renegotiating grandfather clauses in the Constitution of 1867. 
Perhaps he could explain what he had in mind.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Shepherd:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
question.
<P>
	I was not actually referring to the Constitution Act. I was 
referring to a separate agreement which I believe dates to 1987. 
It is a fairly recent agreement with some of the provinces and 
basically said that from 1987 onward there would be no 
reduction in their seats. It is not actually in the Constitution Act; 
it seems to be a separate agreement with some provinces that 
they simply would not be reduced from what they were in 1987. 
It is not a constitutional amendment.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lebel: </B>Mr. Speaker, could the hon. member perhaps 
explain what he was referring to, if it was not the British North 
America Act of 1867? I would like to know under what 
legislation these provisions were made. I ask this with all due 
respect for the hon. member from the Liberal Party. I was 
unaware until now that such legislation existed.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Shepherd:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am simply reading the 
committee report. On page 7 it reads: ``Issues such as senatorial 
floor and the grandfather clause whereby no province can lose 
seats from the number it had in 1986''. The report is available 
from the committee. That is basically what it says. Obviously it 
is referring to a specific grandfather clause which existed and 
dated from 1986 onward.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to have the opportunity to speak in favour of the 
government's motion for concurrence in the 51st report of the 
Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs.
<P>
	It should be noted that the bill included in the report before us 
is the result of the first use of the new procedure under the 
Standing Orders of the House of Commons whereby a 
committee can be instructed to prepare and bring in a bill. 
Standing Order 68(4) to (8) which was approved by the House on 
February 7, 1994 sets out a process for committees to draft 
legislation.
<P>
	On April 19, 1994 the House of Commons adopted the 
following motion:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs be instructed 
to prepare and bring in a bill, in accordance with Standing Order 68(5), 
respecting the system of readjusting the boundaries of electoral districts for the 
House of Commons by electoral boundaries commissions, and, in preparing the 
said bill, the  committee be instructed to consider, among other related matters, 
the general operation over the past 30 years of the Electoral Boundaries 
Readjustment act, including:</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>That the committee have the power to travel within Canada and to hear

<BLOCKQUOTE>That the committee report no later than December 16, 1994.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1530) </B>
<P>
	The committee reported to the House earlier than that, on 
November 25, 1994 when the chair presented the 51st report of 
that committee to the House. As a new member of the House I 
am delighted that committees now have this power to develop 
and bring forward legislation of this and other types.
<P>
	I would also like to thank the Chief Electoral Officer of 
Canada, Mr. Jean-Pierre Kingsley, his staff and the staff of the 
committee and all the witnesses who appeared before the 
committee, including fellow members of this House, for their 
expertise and advice which were invaluable in assisting the 
committee in its consideration of the various complex and 
sensitive issues with which that committee had to deal.
<P>
	Turning to some of those issues, the report says: ``Many 
members of the committee reluctantly came to the conclusion 
that a cap or reduction in the size of the House of Commons is 
not feasible at this time''. Significant among the reasons given 
for that conclusion which appear to be counter to the 
instructions that the committee was given by the House-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I am 
sorry to interrupt, but I believe the hon. member who is speaking 
is wearing a campaign pin for the Liberal candidate in 
Ottawa-Vanier. I know that maybe the Reform Party candidate 
is giving him a hard time but I would prefer he follow the 
instructions in the orders of the House.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Forgive my questionable 
eyesight if in fact the hon. member for Peterborough is wearing 
such a label or tag. I see he has removed whatever that pin was. 
We thank him for his co-operation and we return the floor to the 
hon. member for Peterborough.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Adams:</B> Mr. Speaker, I apologize to the member and the 
members opposite. I was canvassing this morning and I forgot to 
change before I came in. I apologize.
<P>
	It is not possible at this time to cap or reduce. Hon. members 
concluded that the establishment of such a cap or reduction 
would require all provinces to agree to the amendment of section 
51 of the Constitution Act of 1867, in order to eliminate the 
requirement of proportional representation among the 
provinces, and the amendment of section 51A of that same act to 
eliminate the so-called Senate floor provision which ensures 
that no province shall have fewer members of Parliament than it 
has senators.
<P>
	Any cap or reduction would unfairly penalize provinces with 
growing populations unless constitutional guarantees of 
disproportionate over-representation for provinces with smaller 
or declining populations were abolished. The abolishing of such 
guarantees could result in a sudden and drastic loss of 
representation by provinces with smaller or declining 
populations and by large, sparsely populated rural areas 
anywhere in Canada, including in the north.
<P>
	The committee's decision means that the current compromise 
system of calculating the number of seats in the House of 
Commons will apply to the redistribution of seats based on the 
results of the 1991 census. The small increase in the number of 
seats from the current 295 to 301 would appear to be reasonable, 
given the overall increase in the population of Canada. Two of 
the six new seats will go to the fast growing province of British 
Columbia and four more to populous Ontario.
<P>
<B>(1535 ) </B>
<P>
	The committee does not recommend any changes in the 
structure of the federal boundary commissions. The chair of 
each commission would be appointed by the chief justice of the 
province and the other two members would be appointed by the 
Speaker of the House of Commons as has been the case in the 
past.
<P>
	However, the bill which has been prepared by the committee 
provides for the Speaker to publicize the upcoming 
appointments and solicit applications. The Speaker would be 
expected to hold a wide range of consultations before making 
any appointments. The Speaker would then table his or her 
appointments in the House of Commons where a procedure 
would exist for 20 or more members to request a vote on any 
individual appointment. In the absence of a negative resolution, 
the appointments would be final after 10 sitting days. I am in full 
agreement with this opening up of the appointments process 
which has been recommended by the committee.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9430"> 9430 </A></B>
<P>
	With respect to the powers, processes and proceedings of the 
federal electoral boundaries commission, it should be 
emphasized that a major reason for the suspension of the 
redistribution process last year and the approval of the order 
of reference of the Standing Committee on Procedure and 
House Affairs was the perception by many Canadians, and I 
include many of my constituents among them, that they had 
been excluded from the process.
<P>
	Many people felt they were suddenly surprised by extensive 
proposals for major changes in electoral boundaries without 
having had any opportunity to influence the content of those 
proposals. That was certainly the case in the riding of 
Peterborough.
<P>
	The recommendations contained in the report now being 
debated are designed to ensure that Canadians have a better 
opportunity for fuller participation in an improved 
redistribution process based on the 1991 census. Among those 
recommendations are the following.
<P>
	In order to ensure that the public is better informed about the 
redistribution process from the outset, electoral boundary 
commissions ``should provide general information about the 
redistribution process and statistical information on the 
province and census results as well as a general statement 
describing the manner in which it intends to proceed with the 
readjustment of electoral boundaries. Interested parties would 
then have 30 days in which to submit comments on the general 
parameters of the process''.
<P>
	Electoral boundaries commissions would be required to 
prepare three plans and maps showing alternate ways in which 
boundaries could be drawn rather than a single map that was 
proposed in the past.
<P>
	There is also a provision for a second round of public hearings 
on the proposed boundaries recommended by a commission if 
the changes which result from the first round of public hearings 
are significant. The second set of hearings could be held if the 
commission or the Chief Electoral Officer so decided.
<P>
	Members here will be interested to know that they will in 
future be on equal footing with other residents of Canada with 
respect to the proposals of commissions when the requirement 
that the commissions' proposals be tabled in the House of 
Commons for debate and study by a committee is eliminated.
<P>
	The time period between the proclamation of a representation 
order based on the final report of the commissions and its 
coming into force will be reduced from 12 months to 7 months. 
This delay is provided in order to give Elections Canada, 
returning officers and political organizations time to reorganize 
their operations on the basis of the new electoral boundaries.
<P>
	On the subject of the actual drawing of electoral district 
boundaries during the course of redistribution, I am especially 
interested in and support the committee's recommendation with 
respect to the factors which must be considered by electoral 
boundary commissions. I refer  here to community of interest, 
manageable geographic size for districts in sparsely populated 
rural and northern regions of the province, and the probability 
that there will be a substantial increase of population within 
those areas over the next five years.
<P>
	They would also be directed to recommend changes to 
existing boundaries only where these factors are sufficiently 
significant to warrant them.
<P>
	Community of interest is more clearly spelled out in the bill 
prepared by this committee.
<P>
<B>(1540 ) </B>
<P>
	Clause 19(4) provides that ``community of interest includes 
such factors as the economy, existing or traditional boundaries 
of electoral districts, the rural or urban characteristics of the 
territory, the boundaries of municipalities or Indian reserves, 
natural boundaries and access to means of communication and 
transport''.
<P>
	In my riding, the township of Ennismore and the First Nation 
of Curve Lake were specifically put at a disadvantage because 
community of interest was not defined in this way in the 
previous attempt to reallocate those boundaries.
<P>
	These provisions should ensure that future electoral 
boundaries commissions will be obligated to consider the 
factors specified which should result in the drafting of more 
reasonable and acceptable boundaries.
<P>
	In an effort to minimize the possible effects on electoral 
boundaries of changes in population recorded as a result of the 
major 10-year census which is conducted in the years ending 
with a one, 1991, 2001 and so on, the committee recommends 
that there should be redistribution of electoral districts within 
provinces on the basis of the five-year census. Those are the 
census which take place in the years ending in six, 1996 and 
2006. In those years, although there might redistribution within 
a province there would be no change in the number of electoral 
districts in that province.
<P>
	In a further effort to minimize the possible effect of 
population changes recorded as a result of the major 10-year 
census, the committee also recommends that no electoral 
boundary commissions should be established where no 
significant changes in population have occurred. If the number 
of electoral districts to which a province is entitled remains 
unchanged as a result of the 10-year census and none of the 
existing districts is above or below the 25 per cent provincial 
quotient, no commission would be established.
<P>
	In the case of the five-year census a commission would only 
be established if more than 10 per cent of a provinces electoral 
districts vary by more than 25 per cent from the provincial 
quotient.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9431"> 9431 </A></B>
<P>
	I know this is very clear to you, Mr. Speaker, but I would 
like to explain a little bit further. While the committee has not 
recommended any change to the maximum possible population 
deviation at 25 per cent above or below the provincial quotient 
established as the ideal average population for electoral district 
as a result of the 10-year census, the committee does 
recommend the elimination of the provision which permits an 
even greater deviation in exceptional circumstances.
<P>
	However, the committee does recognize that there may be 
exceptional circumstances by recommending that electoral 
districts whose population deviation is greater than the 
permissible 25 per cent should be specifically set out in a 
schedule to the legislation which can only be amended by an act 
of Parliament. The exceptional ridings will be listed separately 
and can only be changed by an act of Parliament.
<P>
	It is essential that the process of readjustment of electoral 
boundaries be completed so that the next federal general 
election, which is expected to take place in 1997 or 1998, be 
contested on the basis of electoral districts whose boundaries 
fairly reflect their populations as established by the 10-year 
census that was conducted in 1991.
<P>
	It would be grossly unfair to residents in areas where they 
have been major changes in population if that election was 
contested on the basis of the present electoral district 
boundaries which were established on the basis of the census of 
1981.
<P>
	I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak in this debate 
and I would be glad to attempt to answer questions or engage in 
discussion with members.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I was interested in the member's presentation 
which of course was excellent.
<P>
	As the member knows, the population of Canada in our 
centennial year of 1967 was approximately 20 million people. 
We were quite proud of the 20 million that we accomplished at 
our centennial. Approximately 30 years later our population is 
about 30 million.
<P>
<B>(1545) </B>
<P>
	We have increased by 10 million people in 30 years. Looking 
forward from the 1991 dicennial census to the 2001 dicennial 
census our population could very well increase by 3 million 
people. We are in the guessing game but it is a fair guess.
<P>
	At the current time we have about one member of Parliament 
for every 100,000 residents of the country. That means by the 
year 2001 perhaps we will need one dozen, two dozen or as many 
as 30 more members of Parliament if we do not restrain the 
growth of the House of Commons.
<P>
	Can the member condone this piece of legislation which does 
not deal with that pressing problem?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Adams:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the comment. I think 
the member knows that one of the reasons this matter of 
electoral boundaries is so debated in this country compared with 
some others is the one that he has put his finger on, the fact that 
this is a growing country, that it is going to continue to grow.
<P>
	There will always be debate on the appropriate size of ridings 
in a country like this. We have the additional problem that we 
have huge areas as the member knows from his own province 
that many people in the cities think are empty but which are fully 
occupied by aboriginal people and other Canadians, yet in very 
small numbers.
<P>
	We constantly have to ask how those people should be 
represented in comparison with people in the very large cities 
like Vancouver, Toronto, Montreal and so on. It will always be a 
matter of debate.
<P>
	The suggestion here is a reasonable compromise. It is going to 
involve an adjustment for the next 10 or 15 years of a few seats 
in the House of Commons to recognize the enormous growth in 
British Columbia and the continued growth in the province of 
Ontario.
<P>
	There is one more thing I would like to say. He mentioned 18 
to 67. Another variable in this has to do with communications 
and the way in which we, the member included, represent our 
ridings.
<P>
	There was a time as the member knows when the people in the 
west all came here and spent their winter in Ottawa. They did the 
best they could even without telephones to represent the people 
of the west.
<P>
	The hon. member flies. I drive three and a half hours to my 
riding once or twice every week. I am on the phone every day. I 
have a fax machine. I am on the E-mail. The member is 
speculating but in 20 years it may well be that members of this 
House can represent more people even more effectively than we 
can because of the change in communications.
<P>
	I am sure members of the House then will deal with that 
matter and like us will change the legislation to adapt to those 
new modern times.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I certainly agree with the comments that the 
member for Peterborough made. I would welcome him out west 
to the province of Saskatchewan to see how well we are able to 
serve our constituents considering the technology we have.
<P>
	We have this immediate problem of an expanding House of 
Commons. I want to ask the member where we are going to put 
the extra seats. Are we going to put them in the middle here? Are 
we going to put them in the gallery, behind the curtains? We 
have some constitutional issues to deal with.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9432"> 9432 </A></B>
<P>
	Some of these we can deal with as the House of Commons. 
Some do not need provincial ratification. This is an immediate 
problem.
<P>
	If we wait 10 years we exacerbate the problem and suddenly 
we are trying to find place for 30 or 40 more seats in this House. 
Are we going to renovate? What is his solution?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Adams:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not see this matter of 
representation in terms of seats and in terms of furniture. If I felt 
that it was necessary to take over the Senate, for example, which 
might not be a bad idea, I would take it over and there are plenty 
of seats there.
<P>
	The suggestion here is for six more seats. I am absolutely sure 
that we can find space for six more seats in this Chamber. I 
would think we could find more. The problem is not seats. It is 
whether, for modern times, an adjustment of six is worthwhile 
so that we can better serve the people of Canada.
<P>
<B>(1550 ) </B>
<P>
	The member is right. I expect this to be a phenomenally 
growing country in the next several decades and I expect 
Parliament of that day to deal with the conditions of that day. At 
the moment we are trying to deal with growth over a 10, 15 or 20 
year period. I think six more seats in the two provinces I 
mentioned is a reasonable compromise to that.
<P>
	The proposals come from a standing committee of this House. 
It is not something that has been brought forward to the 
government as has been the case in the past. We should respect 
our colleagues on the standing committees who struggled with 
this matter for a number of weeks and months.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to be able to say a few 
words today on procedure and House affairs committee report 
and the government's request for concurrence in that report 
dealing with a study of the electoral boundaries readjustment 
system.
<P>
	I have a number of things that I want to say about the report 
and about the process. I also want to say in advance of those 
comments that I find it interesting that the government members 
in particular are so anxious to debate this issue at a time when 
unemployment is running rampant in our country, when 
globalization is threatening to take away the economic 
sovereignty of governments and when poverty is creating illness 
and lack of education in our country.
<P>
	There are many issues, including those of international 
governance, that this House should be applying the majority of 
its time to, to ensure that the people of this country are able to 
secure employment, to build a quality of life, to educate 
themselves and their children, to relieve the nation of poverty 
and the stress of poverty and unemployment which creates, to a 
certain extent, crime in our streets and insecurity among many 
in our society.
<P>
	The issue before us has some importance in and of itself, but if 
I were sitting on the other side of the House today I would be 
ensuring that the priority for debate was on those issues that 
directly affected the quality of life of the people of our country.
<P>
	However, the bill is before us and as a result of that we 
certainly cannot ignore the opportunity to address the issues in 
front of us. In response to that I want to say that I sense a bit of a 
dilemma facing me as a member of this House because on the 
one hand I agree with those in this Chamber who today have 
argued in opposition to concurrence on this motion because I 
believe that the process that the government has undertaken here 
significantly disturbs a process that was working in this country 
and a process that could have been changed not by disrupting it 
but in addition to that existing process.
<P>
	I also find myself in agreement with a number of the 
provisions of the committee's report; a number of provisions 
which I think will improve the adjustment process in the future. 
Let me take that in a bit of order and indicate that my preference 
today as I rise to speak and as I realize I will be called upon to 
vote shortly is to withhold concurrence on the committee report 
simply on the basis that the government's interruption of the 
process was uncalled for and seems to be, in the words of a 
member who spoke previously, the result of a panic that 
occurred as a result of Liberal members seeing the results of a 
boundary redistribution that they were unhappy with.
<P>
<B>(1555 ) </B>
<P>
	Granted I have a number of reasons to be concerned about the 
new boundaries that were created in my own province. Perhaps I 
will address that briefly before I sit down today.
<P>
	However, I do not believe that arguments made in reaction to a 
map that was drawn or arbitrary lines that were drawn on a map 
is any reason to shut down the process and ignore the work and 
the regulations that had been established previously.
<P>
	A number of things have been said today as well. I have 
listened to the debate reasonably carefully. I recognize a number 
of things have been said about the numbers of seats in the House 
of Commons. While that is not a part of this report, I do believe 
it is worth commenting on.
<P>
	The mandate of the committee did include a responsibility to 
have a look at the possibility of restricting the numbers of seats 
and perhaps even reducing the number of seats in this place. I 
understand from the comments of the committee chairperson 
and from reading the report that the committee, not in its 
entirety but the majority, believes it was not feasible to discuss 
the cap at this time.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9433"> 9433 </A></B>
<P>
	I come from the province of Saskatchewan and so I believe 
it is sometimes necessary to reduce the numbers of people who 
represent the population. However, since we are sitting in the 
federal House and there are more practical matters at work than 
simply the capping of the number of seats, we owe it to 
ourselves to look even beyond that particular issue.
<P>
	When I mentioned coming from Saskatchewan I said that 
because I am very proud of the Saskatchewan government, the 
New Democratic Party government, which after it became 
elected set in motion a process which did reduce the number of 
seats in the Saskatchewan legislature. A colleague of mine from 
Saskatchewan earlier today alluded to the fact that 
Saskatchewan had done this.
<P>
	The people of Saskatchewan have reacted positively to the 
move to reduce the number of seats in the provincial legislature. 
I have found in my own travel through my own constituency and 
elsewhere throughout Saskatchewan that it is not the numbers 
the people are concerned about, it is the representation. 
Listening and responding to the needs of the people are major 
concerns.
<P>
	Certainly some have raised the issue of cost. In my own 
estimation the cost of running government is actually small 
compared with the cost of providing services and delivering on 
decisions that governments make. As a result, if we are able to 
listen and respond well the people of our province and of Canada 
will respond positively to a government or a political party that 
is prepared to do that.
<P>
	In Saskatchewan the people and the government felt that a 
reduction in the number of seats was possible. They have 
embraced that concept. I believe, contrary to arguments made by 
the government side today, the people of Saskatchewan would 
also understand that if the number of seats in this Chamber were 
restricted in the future, our province would have a smaller 
number of members of Parliament and fewer individuals to 
represent their views in Ottawa.
<P>
	I said earlier this has to be taken into a broader context. 
Representation by population in this country does mean that 
some regions, some provinces, some territories will receive less 
attention as a result of the number of people who can vote on 
issues. Therefore it is necessary for the whole concept of reform 
or the rebuilding of Parliament, not just the House of Commons, 
to be done as a unit at the same time.
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
	If the House of Commons is to be reformed, if it is to be 
rebuilt under representation by population, I say without 
condition that I want to see that done in conjunction with and 
parallel to the reform or the rebuilding of the second chamber of 
Parliament. An elected and accountable Senate that would 
represent the regional or territorial interests of the country must 
occur  at exactly the same as a redistribution of seats in 
Parliament.
<P>
	While I believe the Chamber can debate and should be looking 
at the possibility of reducing its number of seats, in the future 
the committee must also take into account that it cannot be done 
in isolation. It cannot be done on its own, or the people of 
Saskatchewan and other provinces that may lose seats as a result 
of redistribution would have a grievance against a government 
which is not listening to the long term grievances of western 
Canadians about the lack of concern of the House of Commons 
wherein the majority of members voting on bills come from the 
more populated parts of the country.
<P>
	A number of things I want to discuss in relation to the report 
have some positive aspects to them and are in direct relation to 
my feelings about how the redistribution process should occur. 
When speaking to the bill earlier today in his opening remarks 
the chairperson of the committee, the member for Kingston and 
the Islands, said that there were a number of problems with the 
system the committee was trying to correct.
<P>
	He spoke about the proposed maps that come with no 
forewarning or opportunity for input from the public. He talked 
about commissions currently not being required to justify the 
rationale for their decisions. He talked about the lack of 
standard application of rationale across the country, that we had 
different decisions made by different commissions in different 
provinces across the country and therefore a patchwork of 
reasons for commission maps being produced in different parts 
of the country.
<P>
	He talked about commissions making seemingly unnecessary 
changes to boundary maps when there were very few reasons for 
change. He talked about the size of the House and the growth of 
the numbers of seats. These were problems the committee 
wanted to address.
<P>
	In this regard I want to talk about the beginning of the process. 
The chairperson of the committee was absolutely correct when 
he said that the public first comes upon the report of the 
commission when most of its work has been done. The public 
sees a single map, a redistribution based upon the 
commissioner's feelings about how that map should be drawn.
<P>
	The proposed map is put before the electorate as a fait 
accomplis. It takes a considerable amount of work on behalf of 
the public, often in conjunction with members of Parliament, to 
come up with a good rationale for changing the maps presented 
by the commissions.
<P>
<B>(1605 ) </B>
<P>
	The committee has done a fine job of responding by calling 
for an initial public notice of the beginning of the process and a 
twofold requirement that the commissions produce three maps 
with justifications for their decisions in each case. This will go a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9434"> 9434 </A></B>
<P>
long way to correcting one of the serious problems that affects 
the process as it exists today.
<P>
	In Saskatchewan, The Battlefords-Meadow Lake 
constituency that I currently represent virtually disappears 
under the new map drawn by the commissioners in our province. 
If I agreed with the initial premise or the rationale of the 
commissioners, I would have no difficulty with the 
disappearance of my constituency. There would be an obvious 
determination on my part as to whether or not I would seek 
renomination and re-election in another constituency.
<P>
	However, it is impossible to disagree under the current set of 
circumstances with the commissioners' original rationale for 
starting where they started to draw their maps. In 
Saskatchewan's case the commissioners decided, given that 
there were no new seats to be allocated, they would redraw the 
Saskatchewan map by giving the two urban centres, Saskatoon 
and Regina, an extra seat. Each of them currently have three 
seats. That meant that each of those major centres in 
Saskatchewan would be given, the commissioners argued, a 
fourth seat. Saskatoon and Regina would each have an urban and 
a rural part. All rural seats surrounding Regina and Saskatoon 
had to be pushed out a bit, pushed north and south a bit, and two 
of them squeezed out entirely. As a result The 
Battlefords-Meadow Lake and the constituency of Mackenzie 
virtually disappeared.
<P>
	In order to argue the boundaries we have to argue the entire 
map of the province of Saskatchewan and the original rationale 
of the commissioners. If we have the opportunity to discuss that 
in advance we may feel that we have a lot more opportunity in 
the process. In fact we might indeed have a lot more input into 
the process.
<P>
	While the current map exists and people in Saskatchewan are 
generally expecting the constituency boundaries to change, I 
want to stress the recommendations contained in the report in 
front of us. Perhaps someone can correct me if I am wrong, but if 
by June a new bill has not been passed the boundaries 
established by the current commission would stand. However, if 
the new bill were to pass by June, new commissions would 
perhaps be established based on the new rules set out in front of 
us. Therefore I believe the people of Saskatchewan will have to 
wait until the end of June to know whether there will be new 
boundaries for federal ridings within our province.
<P>
	I do not believe the changes in the bill justify the suspension 
of the current process. I am quite prepared to work with the new 
boundaries that exist in our province.
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	I want to make a further comment before sitting down. I 
commend the Saskatchewan Boundaries Commission that 
currently sits on one count. It has created a northern seat that is 
separate and apart from an urban centre. I have criticized the 
commission and will criticize it in concluding my remarks today 
by indicating that it created that northern seat by pushing the 
boundaries surrounding the city of Prince Albert farther south. It  
had to do that using the available quotient to remove the urban 
centre of Prince Albert from that seat.
<P>
	That created a northern seat with a fairly large agricultural 
and rural municipality component to it that has absolutely 
nothing in common with northern villages, the Metis and 
aboriginal communities in the north.
<P>
	I applaud some of the changes made by the committee. I 
deplore the process the government has used here. I certainly 
look forward to what will occur over the next few months as the 
process continues.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I listened with great interest to my fellow member 
from Saskatchewan, the hon. member for The 
Battlefords-Meadow Lake. I agreed with the majority of the 
hon. member's comments.
<P>
	He began by saying that he felt in Canadians' eyes that this 
was perhaps a low priority issue given the state of our economy 
and concerns over employment. I would add to that concerns 
over high deficits and high taxes. However, because of the 
self-interests of politicians, he and I both recognize the issue 
has come to the floor of the House of Commons.
<P>
	I also heard him say he would oppose the proposal based on 
the principle that it was a matter of interference where 
interference was not required. I concur with his observation in 
that regard.
<P>
	The hon. member talked about the fact that if we capped or 
reduced the number of seats in the House of Commons, 
Saskatchewan would have fewer seats than its current 14. I think 
the hon. member and I are approximately the same age; I am not 
sure who is older. However, when I was young the province had 
about 21 seats if I remember accurately. Now we are down to 14 
seats and I expect, unless there are some constitutional changes, 
that floor will remain.
<P>
	I am not sure what the number of seats in Ontario was at the 
time when we had 21 seats, but I know it was less than the 99 it 
now enjoys and we know it is now going up to 103 under the new 
proposal.
<P>
	If we do nothing Saskatchewan will remain at 14. Ontario may 
increase its seats to 115 or 120 if we look far enough down the 
road. Saskatchewan is losing clout no matter which way we look 
at it as far as the number of seats in the House of Commons is 
concerned.
<P>
	The member correctly reflected on the solution, which was 
Senate reform. I was pleased to hear the hon. member say that, 
because I thought members of the federal New Democratic Party 
were supportive of abolition of the Senate. I know that provin-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9435"> 9435 </A></B>
<P>
cial members, particularly western spokespersons for his party, 
have supported the triple E concept.
<P>
	I wonder if the hon. member is supporting the triple E concept 
of Senate reform, one that is not abolished but rather is reformed 
so that it is elected, has equal representation from every 
province, and maintains the effective powers that would give 
clout to provinces such as Saskatchewan which, no matter what 
way we look at it, is going to lose clout in the House under the 
current scenario or under the past scenario whether we are 
looking at new legislation or the status quo.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity the 
member for Kindersley-Lloydminster has given me to explain 
the position of New Democrats with regard to the Senate. 
Certainly we are asked about this frequently because there 
appears to be a contradiction when no contradiction exists.
<P>
	New Democrats, myself included, have always called for and 
continue to call for the abolition of the unelected, unaccountable 
Senate. The fact that the Senate has failed to live up to all its 
obligations over its entire history with one or two exceptions 
gives us many reasons to believe that the Senate as it exists 
today must be abolished.
<P>
<B>(1615 ) </B>
<P>
	However, abolition of the existing Senate does not preclude 
the establishment of a new second chamber, a second chamber 
that has a new mandate, that is elected by the people of Canada, 
that provides representation to provinces, territories or regions, 
however it gets defined across the country, one that does have 
effective powers.
<P>
	The key to all of this is the ability of the Senate to respond to 
these issues. The effectiveness of the Senate is a very important 
part of this whole package.
<P>
	In response to the member for Kindersley-Lloydminster and 
to all others who have questions about this position, we believe 
very strongly in the rebuilding of the Senate to be elected and 
accountable to the people of Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am not trying to monopolize 
the time. I do have a following brief question. I would encourage 
the hon. member to make sure his colleagues, particularly those 
in Ontario at the federal level, make it very clear to Canadians 
that they are not ambiguous in suggesting that in certain parts of 
the country they would abolish the existing Senate and replace it 
with a reformed Senate, and in other parts of the country 
indicating they would abolish it and not replace it. I would like 
to hear those kinds of responses from the premier of Ontario and 
federal representatives of the party in Ontario.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would be happy to encourage my 
colleagues in the party across the country. I cannot help but 
think I would be very grateful if the premier of Ontario were to 
listen to all of the things I might have to say to him.

	<B>Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (for the Minister of National 
Defence, Lib.)</B> moved that Bill C-67, an act to establish the 
Veterans Review and Appeal Board, to amend the Pension Act, 
to make consequential amendments to other acts and to repeal 
the Veterans Appeal Board Act, be read the second time and 
referred to a committee.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to begin 
second reading on Bill C-67, an act to establish the Veterans 
Review and Appeal Board, to amend the Pension Act, to make 
consequential amendments to other acts and to repeal the 
Veterans Appeal Board Act.
<P>
	The legislation is straightforward and its objectives are 
simple. We want to streamline the veterans pension application 
and make the decision making process an improved service to 
Canadian veterans.
<P>
	The bill before us does not change benefits that veterans now 
enjoy, nor does it reduce the right Canadian veterans have to a 
complete and thorough appeal process with free legal 
assistance.
<P>
	Veterans have been faced with long delays when they apply 
for pensions, sometimes very long delays. We know that those 
delays are usually caused by the elaborate process we have put 
in place. We want to simplify that process to provide veterans 
with their benefit as quickly as possible.
<P>
	As most hon. members will be aware, veterans pensions 
provide compensation for service related injuries, wounds and 
disabilities. Civilians who served in close support of the armed 
forces during wartime may also be entitled to pension benefits.
<P>
	Additional pension benefits can be paid to a pensioner's 
spouse or dependent children. Survivor pensions are payable to 
the spouse of a deceased pensioner.
<P>
	This legislation will affect a wide range of people, veterans, 
their spouses, their dependents and others. More than half a 
million Canadian veterans are alive today and at this moment 
there are about 150,000 veterans or their survivors who are 
getting disability pension benefits. We get about 13,000 claims a 
year. That is a lot of applications. Canadian veterans are still 
applying for benefits in large numbers.
<P>
<B>(1625 ) </B>
<P>
	Some members of this House may be asking why we are 
getting so many applications almost 50 years after the end of the 
second world war. It is simply because many of the wounds and 
injuries received in the line of duty half a century ago are 
beginning to have a real effect on the lives of our veterans. The 
effects of those old wartime injuries have become more obvious, 
more painful and more difficult to live with, and now many 
finally have decided that maybe it is time to get some help.
<P>
	These veterans have reached a time in their lives when the 
benefits available for the disabilities they received serving 
Canada so many years ago can make a real difference in their 
lives. They really need the benefits now. That is why we are 
processing so many applications.
<P>
	We have also found that many of the applications are taking 
longer to process. Many are going through the appeal process 
because in the years immediately following their service in the 
armed forces it was easier in the average case to make the 
connection between the veteran's service and the resulting 
disability. As the years have passed it has become more and 
more difficult to find the link between service and disability.
<P>
	I want to emphasize that the first benefit to which our veterans 
are entitled is the benefit of doubt. If there is a real doubt about 
whether a claim is justified, that doubt goes to our veteran. Our 
system is designed to help veterans by providing assistance in 
preparation of first applications, and that will continue to be the 
case.
<P>
	The disability pension process was designed to be fair but the 
process was not designed to be fast. Now with the average age of 
our veterans at 73, these Canadians can no longer afford lengthy 
delays.
<P>
	Under our current system successful disability pension 
applicants will wait on average 18 months for their first pension 
cheque, a year and a half. Clearly that is not good enough. If the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9437"> 9437 </A></B>
<P>
application is turned down and its appeal is successful it can 
now take up to three years. Clearly that is not good enough.
<P>
	These delays are not the fault of the people who work with the 
current process. It is the fault of the process itself. We know that 
the only way we are going to catch up is to make the overall 
system more efficient.
<P>
	There have been a number of attempts over the years by 
governments to make changes in the pension process. There has 
been some tinkering, or some small process has been changed. 
In some cases this has assisted the veteran but in some cases it 
has only added to the bureaucracy. Add to those problems the 
number of first applications we have and we have a situation 
which is simply no longer acceptable and must be changed.
<P>
	Most veterans have reached the time in their lives when they 
want to enjoy their pension benefits. Surely they deserve that. 
Some will use the disability pension cheque as an added source 
of income in their retired years. Surely they deserve that. Others 
need the veterans benefits to obtain the medical services they 
need. Surely our veterans deserve that.
<P>
	Over the past year we have commemorated many important 
events leading to the end of the second world war. I am very 
pleased and proud to be part of the `Canada Remembers' 
program. This program makes Canadians and people around the 
world aware of the dedication and sacrifice our veterans made 
for us and for democracy around the world.
<P>
	Canadians want our veterans to be treated fairly. They want us 
to do the right thing and they want us to do the thing right. Our 
veterans deserve that. Therefore, we will improve the process 
with the bill before us today.
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	At present a veteran applies directly to the Canadian Pension 
Commission or contacts the department or one of several 
organizations which will act on his or her behalf. Some veterans 
go to such organizations as the Royal Canadian Legion or the 
War Amps of Canada. Others go to the Bureau of Pension 
Advocates which is now involved in most of the applications for 
pensions. However immediate involvement of legal assistance 
at the point of first application almost assumes legal dispute.
<P>
	It was certainly never the intention, however, just by 
providing legal advice at that point, to make it look as though we 
were going to contest the application. That is not what we want, 
that is not what Canadians want, and that is certainly not what 
our veterans want.
<P>
	Canadian veterans should not need legal help to apply for 
pensions. With the passage of this bill they will not need such 
help. The need for legal advice and assistance will come in the 
appeal process.
<P>
	Our lawyers in the Bureau of Pension Advocates are highly 
trained people. They will continue to work hard for Canada's 
veterans where their expertise is needed. Why have legal experts 
using their time in the detailed preparation of a case that is not 
going to be contested anyhow?
<P>
	At present, the department receives the application on behalf 
of the Canadian Pension Commission and prepares a medical 
summary and opinion. It examines the degree of the disability 
and recommends the amount of assessment. In many cases it is 
obvious the applicant will be approved but the department 
cannot approve it. It sends the application to the Canadian 
Pension Commission. The CPC has to decide on two things, the 
first one being entitlement. Does the applicant have the 
qualifying service? Is the injury or condition likely to be a result 
of that service? Then, assessment. That is based on the degree of 
disability and it is a decision on how much pension to pay.
<P>
	The Canadian Pension Commission makes its decision on 
those two issues: entitlement and assessment. It then passes the 
decision on to the department which informs the veteran and 
delivers any cheque or payment.
<P>
	If the Canadian Pension Commission decides that the 
applicant is not entitled, the applicant can go before something 
called the Entitlement Board. If the commission had agreed that 
the applicant is entitled but the applicant does not agree with the 
assessment, there can be what is called an assessment hearing.
<P>
	Both the board and the hearing are made up of members of the 
Canadian Pension Commission. If the applicant does not like 
either decision at this level he or she can appeal again. At this 
time it goes before the Veterans Appeal Board.
<P>
	After all of that, we arrive at a final decision on whether a 
disability pension will be awarded and, if so, how much. The 
information goes to the department and then begins the process 
of having the first cheque delivered to our veteran.
<P>
	In a nutshell, that is the system as it currently exists. It relies 
on the work of four different government bodies: the Bureau of 
Pension Advocates which provides free legal assistance when 
veterans apply; Veterans Affairs Canada which completes 
medical examinations, summaries and opinions, and does the 
administrative work, including preparing and researching files, 
communicating with clients and calculating and making 
payments; the Canadian Pension Commission which decides on 
first applications and then hears initial appeals; and finally, the 
Veterans Appeal Board which hears final appeals.
<P>
<B>(1635 ) </B>
<P>
	The system is thorough. The system is fair but the system is 
not fast. It can take up to three years from the time the veteran 
first applies until the first cheque is delivered. Our Canadian 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9438"> 9438 </A></B>
<P>
veterans deserve better than  that. We have been looking for 
ways of speeding up the process for a period of time.
<P>
	In 1992 Veterans Affairs Canada completed an evaluation of 
the process. The following spring it consulted with major 
veterans' organizations, employee unions, staff and other 
stakeholders. The evaluation made 55 recommendations on 
ways to improve the pension process and we have implemented 
those that we could.
<P>
	Now has come the time to act on those recommendations that 
need legislation, the long term recommendations that streamline 
the process.
<P>
	The legislation before us acts in three broad ways. First of all, 
Veterans Affairs Canada, the department, makes the first 
decision. In many cases veterans affairs employees will be able 
to counsel and assist veterans with pension applications in their 
own homes and communities.
<P>
	Second, the Bureau of Pensions Advocates becomes part of 
the Department of Veterans Affairs. The bureau will no longer 
be involved in first applications, therefore the bureau's lawyers 
would concentrate on helping veterans in the appeal process.
<P>
	The third broad area concerns the appeal bodies. As I have 
said, the Canadian Pension Commission hears first applications. 
If first applications are now to be heard by the department, then 
the Canadian Pension Commission in handling only appeals 
would have the same mandate as the Veterans Appeal Board. 
This legislation merges the two agencies into one body. The 
Canadian Pension Commission and the Veterans Appeal Board 
will be combined into the Veterans Review and Appeal Board to 
hear appeals at the first and if necessary the second level.
<P>
	I want to emphasize that we maintain two levels of appeal. 
However, we do it with much more flexibility built into the 
system. We will have board members who are not locked into 
just one level of appeal, meaning that we can utilize the board 
members' time with maximum efficiency.
<P>
	Some members of the new board will be deployed across the 
country to hear initial appeals. If the applicant wants to continue 
the appeal process, final appeals will be heard by different 
members of the same board. We will again speed up the appeals 
process by combining the expertise of both former agencies and 
having them concentrate only on appeals, not on first 
applications.
<P>
	One overall theme is important to all these measures. We will 
maintain all veterans' benefits and appeal rights. Decisions will 
still be based on the principle that veterans receive the benefit of 
the doubt. Two appeal levels will continue to be available.
<P>
	The Government of Canada spends about $1.1 billion on 
disability pensions. Nothing in these proposed changes will 
affect the amount of money veterans receive through the 
process.
<P>
	Our only objective is to make sure that the veterans get their 
applications dealt with faster. I am sure the House will agree that 
our veterans deserve this. I know we all recognize the debt that 
Canadians owe to our veterans. Veterans deserve their disability 
pensions and this is the time when many veterans need them the 
most.
<P>
	I hope all members of this House will join me in supporting 
this bill because this is an occasion where we, together, can 
further help those who have served our country so well. Surely 
our veterans deserve that.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Godin (Châteauguay, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased and honoured to speak today on behalf of the Bloc 
Quebecois during the debate on second reading of Bill C-67. 
This bill is of paramount interest to veterans. I have just listened 
to the secretary of state and I share his desire for continued 
recognition of all those who kept war away, maintained peace 
and continue to enrich our society through their community 
involvement.
<P>
	We owe a lot to the veterans and that is why all of us, 
regardless of party, want to improve their living conditions. 
Canada has not failed in its duty. From the very start, it 
established and maintained resources for veterans.
<P>
	These resources became more structured after the first world 
war. A system of pensions was born. Pensions were awarded 
according to disability criteria established by an independent 
body. It was not long, however, before criticisms were raised.
<P>
	The main criticism, still heard today, concerns the delays in 
the pension process. This issue was given a hard look in the 
1980s. In chapter 13 of his 1986 annual report, the Auditor 
General of Canada established that the disability pension 
process took an average of 13.2 months. The delay was 
criticized at the time. The Auditor General proposed 
improvements in efficiency, including automating the process 
and computerizing files. It was felt these measures could 
increase productivity by 25 per cent.
<P>
	In 1987, legislative reform to do with the Veterans Appeal 
Board brought a flood of optimism. The Minister of Veterans 
Affairs at the time took the opportunity to affirm his confidence 
in the processing of pension applications. He said, on June 26, 
1987, in the House, and I quote: ``Hon. members will be aware 
of the substantial progress that has been made in reducing delays 
in the disability pension process. In the last two and one-half 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9439"> 9439 </A></B>
<P>
years the time required to process pension applications has been 
cut by well over half. At the same time, a far greater percentage 
of decisions are going in  favour of the veteran today than was 
the case previously''.
<P>
	The Conservative minister, the Hon. George Hees, went 
further, and I quote: ``These very satisfactory results have been 
achieved in the face of an almost 100 per cent increase in case 
load. It is quite a remarkable feat for any operation to double its 
work-load while slashing its turnaround time by over half''.
<P>
	After an exclamation like that, all opposition members 
applauded. Even the Auditor General of Canada in his 1988 
report estimated that the follow-up to his 1986 audit 
examination was adequate. He indicated, and I quote, ``The 
department took positive action after making a decision on the 
best way to handle each case''.
<P>
	Yet we are sceptical now of this great optimism. Consider for 
instance that, according to the most recent studies, in 1992 the 
process took on average 18 months from the time of the initial 
application until the first decision. We believed things were 
better but that was not the case. To an ageing veteran, such a 
delay is incredible and unacceptable.
<P>
	The longer waiting periods can be attributed to several 
factors. Numerous studies cited the department's move to 
Charlottetown in 1984 as a major one. The most recent of these 
studies, conducted at the department's request in 1993, also 
indicates very clearly the context of such delays and the 
accumulated backlog.
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	At this point, I would like to quote an excerpt from volume 4 
of that study. ``The move to Charlottetown gave rise to a 
significant loss in the organization's memory and technical 
skill. Partially in response to this loss, additional quality control 
procedures and steps were added to prevent serious errors on the 
part of employees not sufficiently familiar with the process or 
lacking full training. In time, some of these additional control 
measures and procedures took root, with the result that 
applications are now to a great extent processed sequentially 
and manually, which takes an unnecessarily long time''.
<P>
	Another important factor merits consideration. From 1982 to 
1990, that is for nine consecutive years, the number of first 
applications increased continuously and regularly. For each of 
those eight years, the number of first applications increased on 
the average by close to one thousand. The number of first 
applications has gradually increased from 5,300 in 1982 to 
14,100 in 1990.
<P>
	Everyone will agree that a pension allocation system, 
regardless of how efficient it is, cannot do any better than its 
original capacity permits when it has to process 14,100 first 
applications in 1990, as opposed to 5,300 in 1982. Because of 
these factors, processing takes longer, and veterans, who do not 
have the time to wait, have to wait longer.
<P>
	Therefore, we are in favour of the government's fundamental 
objective of reducing processing times and accelerating the 
process. This objective must take precedence over all other 
concerns.
<P>
	However the official opposition wonders about the way with 
which the government proposes to attain this necessary 
objective. The bill proposes to merge the Canadian Pension 
Commission by transferring to the minister all jurisdiction over 
first applications on the one hand, and on the other, by 
transferring to the appeal board all staff and jurisdiction over the 
review process.
<P>
	In the same breath, the government is bringing the Bureau of 
Pension Advocates back under the department's jurisdiction and 
has taken away from first-time applicants for veteran's benefits 
the right to approach the bureau for recourse.
<P>
	Allow me to review the basic elements of the bill, starting 
with how it deals with the Canadian Pension Commission. The 
department proposes to eliminate, so to speak, the Canadian 
Pension Commission. The department justifies this measure by 
saying that the Canadian Pension Commission's favourable trial 
decisions were found to be consistent with favourable 
recommendations by the medical advisory services.
<P>
	The department then questioned the existence of an 
independent commission which merely rubber-stamps the 
departmental services' recommendations. It then thought of 
replacing this commission with an initial decision at the 
departmental level and allocating commission resources to the 
review and appeal board in order to speed up the process.
<P>
	We are concerned about this. For the first time since the 
pension allocation system is in place, initial decisions are 
subject to departmental authority. We understand that this 
measure is aimed at bringing the decision-making process 
closer to those directly affected. However, this measure to be 
implemented under departmental authority must respect the 
principle of impartiality at this stage. To process initial 
applications faster, we need to open up the decision-making 
process to those who do the work.
<P>
	Another important element of this bill is the conversion of the 
Bureau of Pensions Advocates from an independent agency to 
just another organization within the Department of Veterans 
Affairs. This proposed conversion challenges government 
policy since 1971, when the bureau was set up outside the 
department in the name of openness.
<P>
	We hope that this openness will be maintained for seniors 
applying for the first time who served many years ago. Of 
course, many things have happened and many laws have 
changed since then. We sincerely hope that removing this step 
will help veterans cut through departmental red tape. The report 
of the Senate sub-committee chaired by the hon. Jack Marshall, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9440"> 9440 </A></B>
<P>
which was released last autumn, reflects the scepticism this 
measure elicits.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	The department intends to refer only cases heard after initial 
decisions to the Bureau of Pensions Advocates. In a way, this is 
like saying a veteran only needs legal assistance when he has to 
apply for review or appeal and when a decision, although 
favourable, is not satisfactory. This is an interesting 
assumption.
<P>
	One wonders why it is necessary to merge the Bureau of 
Pensions Advocates with the department. Of course, if this 
speeds up the processing of veterans' claims, we are all for it. 
However, we must make sure that the integrity of the process is 
maintained.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois earnestly hopes that veterans will see 
their claims processed more expeditiously, within structures 
that are fair, transparent and just. For years, many suggestions 
have been made at various levels for improving the pension 
allocation system. I would like to recall some of these 
suggestions which were included, for instance, in the 
assessment study of disability pensions conducted at the request 
of the department and released in 1993.
<P>
	This study involved the organizational services branch and 
two consulting firms: Coopers &amp; Lybrand and Deloitte &amp; 
Touche. The latter firm dealt with issues relating to the pensions 
process.
<P>
	Upon examining the firm's report in volume 4 of the study, 
one is struck first of all by the extent of control measures and 
additional procedures that cause undue delay. In 1992, these 
measures and procedures were applied within the department at 
the Veterans Services Branch, the Benefits Division, the 
Medical Advisory Branch, the district offices, decision-making 
support and non-medical benefits, the program planning and 
pension services, the pensions distribution service, the Medical 
Claims Research Section, standards and operations, 
supplementary benefits section and administration section.
<P>
	This is just to illustrate how complex the system is. Imagine: 
every pension claim with its own specific file has to go through 
all these levels, each of which has several file check points. That 
is a major cause of undue delay, and that is why the study's 
recommendations included a substantial reduction in the 
number of check points within the department.
<P>
	The department's study gives the distinct impression that the 
proliferation of these check points may be exacerbated by a 
climate of suspicion that prevails within each section and in 
relations between the sections. One feeds upon the other. I do 
not know whether this view of the pensions allocation system is 
held by the parties concerned, but this climate of suspicion may 
have helped to compartmentalize the various sectors and their 
activities. The answer would be to break down the walls and 
make the process more flexible. The bill seems to reflect the 
study's recommendations.
<P>
	It is unfortunate to note, as the study does, that many 
suggestions for improving the system had fallen on infertile 
ground. The firm of Deloitte and Touche noted that, during its 
stay in Charlottetown, it was literally flooded with useful 
suggestions for improvement, which had been made internally, 
with no response. Here were first line employees making all 
sorts of suggestions, employees really hoping to improve the 
quality and the performance of the service. For people living in 
an atmosphere of mistrust, this is a rather odd sort of behaviour.
<P>
<B>(1655) </B>
<P>
	These suggestions, many of which were similar to other 
approaches contemplated over the years in various reports, 
proposed amalgamation of pension entitlement and evaluation 
processes; a single document on service for all needs; more 
involvement of regional advisors in the application review 
process; requirement that applications be accompanied by a 
diagnostic report and physician's medical report. These 
suggestions would certainly help cut delays.
<P>
	Finally, seven main recommendations emerged from the 
study evaluating veterans' disability pensions. The only one that 
seems relevant to the bill is the third one, which provides that 
the department and the Canadian Pension Commission should 
streamline the decision-making process by combining pension 
entitlement and evaluation, by cutting the number of quality and 
process controls and by transferring responsibility for primary 
decisions to the group of pension medical advisors.
<P>
	Do all these measures aimed at improving the process of 
pension allocation jeopardize the principle of arm's length 
relationship with the department? The study on pensions carried 
out for the department in 1992 would seem to have not gone 
unnoticed. During fiscal years 1992-1993 and 1993-1994, a 
number of changes were made to the pension process. The 
Estimates suggest that these changes would streamline 
operations and improve processing times.
<P>
	A good number of the proposed improvements have already 
been implemented. To quote the Estimates for 1994-1995, ``One 
of the most significant implementations resulted in a change in 
internal procedures which enabled the CPC to adjudicate on 
entitlement and assessment simultaneously. It is expected that 
this new procedure, implemented in May 1993, will reduce 
turnaround times in the first application process by four 
months''.
<P>
	So the minister has done his homework. It is 1995 now and we 
can no longer say that the average turnaround time for first 
applications is 18 months. Substantial improvements are 
presumably being implemented at this time. The system for 
recording medical benefits claims was apparently reorganized 
in 1993. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9441"> 9441 </A></B>
<P>
A new computerized system for pensions and the status of 
pensions was to have been implemented in March 1994, thus 
finally  allowing computers to meet veterans' needs. If I may 
quote once again from the 1994-1995 Estimates: ``Changes in 
procedures that have improved client service include sending 
favourable special awards and assessment hearing decisions 
directly for simultaneous pay and promulgation. Approximate 
turnaround time savings for favourable assessment hearings and 
special awards average 40 days and 45 days respectively''.
<P>
	Work on reducing turnaround times and the backlog is 
therefore underway at this time. This all augurs well, although 
there is always room for improvement. Let us hope that the bill 
proves to be helpful in this sense in bringing about further 
improvements in the system. Any delay for veterans is 
unwarranted. It is with this outlook in mind that the former Hon. 
Senator Marshall carried out his work in early fall of last year.
<P>
	In the report of the Senate sub-committee he chaired, there is 
a very interesting section, called: ``What is ``the'' system and 
how can it be improved now?'' This section contains 10 very 
practical recommendations, numbered 32 to 41. They are very 
down-to-earth recommendations on how the system could be 
improved, by reducing delays and the backlog. The committee 
recommends the following: ``That requests for service 
documents be forwarded electronically to Outside 
Documentation Section and that the documents be provided at 
no cost for veterans' organizations which operate a service 
bureau''.
<P>
<B>(1700) </B>
<P>
	If we can believe how hard the department has been trying 
over the past two years to reduce delays, this recommendation 
should be implemented without a problem. And, furthermore, 
we are in the era of the information highway.
<P>
	I continue to quote recommendations 32 to 41. ``That the 
pages of the copy of the service documents be numbered to 
facilitate the work of the Précis Writers who will add their own 
extracts of the service documents, without typing, to the 
submission of the application for pension, and forward the 
package to the Medical Advisory for comment. That this 
documentation to which a copy of the Commission's decision 
would be attached serve as the ``statement of case'' in the next 
stage of the process, the hearing''.
<P>
	Can you imagine doing it any differently? Such sample 
solutions show that the kind of structure in place contributes 
little to the causes behind the delays and backlog. It seems that, 
to a much greater extent, the delays and backlog are due to 
entrenched ways of doing things that have resisted change.
<P>
	The Canadian Pension Commission's persistent reluctance to 
give veterans the benefit of the doubt led to the following 
recommendation in the Marshall report: ``That serious efforts be 
made by the Canadian Pension Commission to apply the 
provision of the `benefit of the doubt' at the first decisions level, 
in accordance with the Pension Act''.
<P>
	We feel like giving the benefit of the doubt to new services, 
new organizations better able to give veterans the benefit of the 
doubt.
<P>
	The Senate subcommittee's report also contained the 
following recommendation aimed at speeding up assessments: 
``That the senior district medical officers rule upon assessments 
at the district level; that assessments for claimed conditions be 
determined by senior district medical officers in the early stages 
of the preparation of pension claims; that senior district medical 
officers rely on reports prepared by medical specialists qualified 
in the field relevant to the veteran's pensionable condition in 
order to raise the assessment of their patients who are veterans''.
<P>
	These recommendations are consistent with the desirable, 
contemporary objectives of process devolution and 
decentralization and with the department's intentions.
<P>
	To conclude with my examples of concrete measures, the 
Senate sub-committee ruled on the decision-making process for 
awarding disability pensions by making this recommendation: 
``That all fully favourable decisions rendered by the Canadian 
Pension Commission and the Veterans Appeal Board -be 
ideally less than a page in length, and that unfavourable or partly 
favourable decisions strictly deal with the reasons why the 
application or appeal is being turned down''.
<P>
	These measures are likely to speed up the process and reduce 
the backlog of cases. We must check how such measures will be 
implemented, if we have not done so already. The Bloc 
Quebecois is committed to pursuing the changes designed to 
make the system even more effective.
<P>
	Speeding up the process and reducing the backlog is mostly an 
administrative matter involving program structure, the 
department, the organizations, regulations, procedures and 
control measures. All these elements are involved in the exact 
way a public service is provided.
<P>
	Administrative order must be based on principles. In the case 
of the veterans pension awarding process, some principles were 
established and applied. These principles are: equity, 
impartiality, uniformity and vested rights.
<P>
	The government's bill can be neatly summed up by listing three 
recommendations contained in the briefing paper on pension 
reform, namely delegating the first-level decision-making process 
to the department; concentrating the appeal preparation work done 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9442"> 9442 </A></B>
<P>
by the Bureau of Pensions Advocates; and merging the Canadian 
Pension Commission with the Veterans Appeal Board.
<P>
<B>(1705) </B>
<P>
	Does this bill challenge the basic principles behind the 
pension system? That is what we are concerned about and what 
we want to look into.
<P>
	We agree with the worthwhile goal of speeding up the process 
and reducing the backlog in the veterans disability pension 
awarding process.
<P>
	However, before making a final decision on this bill, we will 
pay attention to what veterans, veterans' organizations and 
public entities affected by the proposed reform have to say about 
Bill C-67. Our first priority will be to listen to their positions 
with attention and respect and, to the extent possible, support 
their wishes for the future.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> It is my duty, pursuant to 
Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the question to be 
raised tonight at the time of adjournment is as follows: the hon. 
member for Louis-Hébert-U.S. president's visit.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak on Bill C-67 on behalf of the 
Reform Party. After initially reading Bill C-67, reviewing it, 
reading it one more time and reviewing it again, I thought it was 
necessary to put a face to the word veterans. I did not have to go 
very far to put a face to that particular group of people.
<P>
	As a matter of fact, even in the Chamber we see constables 
walking around doing their duties. Often we see medals on their 
chests from campaigns of yesteryear. It is good to know that 
these people have served our country in that way.
<P>
	In my community of Summerland in the Okanagan I looked 
around to see if I could find some examples of veterans. Again I 
did not have to go very far. Steve Dudson comes to mind, the 
gentleman who served as dominion president of the Royal 
Canadian Legion in Ottawa. He is still very active in the local 
legion in Summerland.
<P>
	Other names also came to mind such as Mr. Ed Lanfdale who 
served in World War II. He is very active with the Kiwanis Club 
in Summerland and is involved in all kinds of fund raising 
activities for worthwhile groups and organizations in the 
Okanagan. Also there is Don Bowen. I cannot forget about him 
because he served under me at the cadet squadron in 
Summerland. He was a Korean war veteran. He is still wearing a 
uniform today and serving his community by helping out the 
cadet program in Summerland.
<P>
	Then I looked to my own family and I did not have to look 
very far to find veterans. I go back to my grandfathers who both 
served in World War II, my uncle who served in Korea, and 
several other family members. Some were distant but had names 
like Donnan, Killipf and McFadzen. All these are names of 
people in my family who served for their country and are 
veterans.
<P>
	It made me very proud that one thing these people seemed to 
have in common even today, although we are far away from war 
in this country, is that they are still serving their country. This 
made me very proud as a Canadian to know that our veterans 
who once served for their country still continue to serve our 
great nation in one form or another today.
<P>
	The current situation with respect to veterans and their 
families is nothing short of appalling. Tens of thousands of men 
and women have risked their lives for this nation. Yet, in their 
later years when they turned to the Department of Veterans 
Affairs for disability pensions, they ran up against a 
bureaucratic nightmare. Before many make it through this 
quagmire they have passed on without being fairly 
compensated. Veterans must wonder why the country they 
served so valiantly now serves them with such contempt.
<P>
	I want all my colleagues in the House to consider the 
following figures. The average turnaround time for veterans 
who apply for benefits is 18 to 20 months. That is at the first 
level. Due to the fact that the benefit of the doubt clause has not 
been appropriately applied only 30 per cent of cases are 
accepted. That is almost two years for veterans who are 
currently at the average age of 73 years old.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	On the advice of their independent advocates many appeal 
their cases, and this can take up to three years. Of those who 
appeal, 70 per cent end up receiving benefits and many may only 
receive a portion of the expected entitlements. This situation is 
unacceptable.
<P>
	We are making thousands of veterans in their advanced years 
wait almost five years to receive benefits. Currently there is a 
backlog of 12,500 cases and 10,000 more veterans are expected 
to apply for benefits this year.
<P>
	After being chastised by the subcommittee on veterans affairs 
the government promised to act on behalf of veterans to correct 
this shameful situation. Bill C-67 is the government's answer.
<P>
	I have been told the main intent of this piece of legislation is 
to cut the existing turnaround time for veterans' disability 
pensions by up to half without affecting veterans' benefits or 
their appeal rights. I have been assured by the minister and the 
deputy minister that the department will achieve their stated 
goal within two years.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9443"> 9443 </A></B>
<P>
	My main concern, however, has been to determine whether 
such an objective is feasible without adversely affecting the 
rights and benefits of veterans.
<P>
	For well over one month now I have been deliberating over 
this piece of legislation. During this time I have consulted with a 
number of veterans and veterans' organizations. After careful 
consideration and in the best interests of all Canadian veterans I 
must come out in opposition to Bill C-67. The bill adversely 
affects the rights and the benefits of veterans.
<P>
	Even though the Liberal government claims to have the best 
interest of veterans in mind, this piece of legislation was drafted 
and approved by cabinet without consulting veterans' groups. 
This lack of consultation with the grassroots was particularly 
ominous given the fact that after cabinet approval the 
government informed groups that were more favourable to the 
proposals first.
<P>
	The National Council of Veterans was informed of the 
department's proposals in March 1994, while the Royal 
Canadian Legion, the army, navy and air force veterans were not 
consulted until the summer of 1994. Why this unacceptable 
disparity?
<P>
	It is also disturbing to note that Bill C-67 was not based on the 
advice of veterans but on the advice of two management 
consulting firms. This lack of consultation with grassroots 
veterans is evident throughout this piece of legislation.
<P>
	One of my prime concerns is that Bill C-67 removes the right 
of the veterans to have their first level application prepared by 
the Bureau of Pensions Advocates. Under the current system 
each veteran has the application prepared by a trained, 
independent lawyer. In addition each veteran enjoys 
solicitor-client privilege. There will be reference to 
solicitor-client privilege throughout this speech because I find 
it very important.
<P>
	However, the government claims that the use of the bureau by 
the veterans at the first level is too time consuming and is 
largely responsible for the 18 to 20 month turnaround. Yet if we 
turn to page 50 of the report ``Keeping the Faith into the Future'' 
we find the breakdown of the time. The report from the Senate 
committee states that the time required to process a claim at the 
first level in the department, the Department of Veterans 
Affairs, was 11 to 13 months and only 5 months with the bureau.
<P>
	In my own investigations I found that most of the time it was 
two months with the bureau. One must also ask: if the bureau 
overprepares its cases, why are 70 per cent of them turned down 
at the first level?
<P>
<B>(1715 ) </B>
<P>
	The removal of the Bureau of Pensions Advocates from the 
first level process is ominous for a number of reasons. First, the 
veteran is now reliant upon the department to prepare and 
adjudicate his or her first level decision. This is not only a 
conflict of interest but it  removes the veteran's right of that 
solicitor-client privilege. The importance of the solicitor-client 
privilege cannot be understated.
<P>
	In the subcommittee report on veterans affairs, ``Keeping the 
Faith&quot;, Mrs. F. L. Crummer, a witness who has been battling for 
six years with the department, most eloquently states the need 
for solicitor-client privilege. She states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>An important consideration which must not be forgotten is the average age and 
education level of the clients serviced by the bureau and the fact that most of them 
know little or nothing about how the system operates. Their link with the system 
is their advocate, the person in whom they place their trust.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The solicitor-client privilege enshrined in the statute is one of the inherent 
strengths of the bureau and of the pension act. It forms the basis for the trust 
clients place in their advocate.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	She goes on to say:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Changes could place clients in jeopardy and destroy their trust not only in their 
advocate but ultimately in the system itself-. No changes should even be 
contemplated to section 19 of the act which establishes the independence of the 
Bureau of Pensions Advocates. I feel it must remain independent of the 
department in order to properly service veterans and dependants.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I would like to remind this House that my primary concern is 
to speed up the process without taking anything away from our 
veterans.
<P>
	Another concern I have with respect to removing the bureau 
from the first level decision making process is that veterans will 
be dealing directly with the department whose employees have 
been known to not have the best attitude. Mr. Cliff Chadderton, 
chairman of the National Council of Veterans Associations, 
recently stated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The problems which occurred in regard to the old legislation were, in our 
view, largely ones which might be attributed to either attitude, lack of 
knowledge or possibly incompetence. In other words, regardless of the 
framework of the new legislation the results will depend upon the manner in 
which the administration thereof is carried out-. The ability to reduce delays in 
adjudication will depend upon the will of the administrators to make the system 
work.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Knowing that an attitude problem exists within the 
department, I find it incomprehensible that the department 
believes it can offer veterans a better service than the Bureau of 
Pensions Advocates. What veterans face at the first level could 
be an indifferent or incompetent pension officer who lacked the 
will or the knowledge to inform veterans to pursue benefits to 
which they are entitled.
<P>
	I am also concerned that veterans may not be informed they 
are able to apply for an appeal of the department's decision. 
Even if the pension officer has the best intentions, I am not 
confident that applications they fill out will be as good as that of 
the Bureau of Pensions Advocates.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9444"> 9444 </A></B>
<P>
	Let us examine once again the people we are dealing with 
here. A 73-year old man or woman entering the Department 
of Veterans Affairs used to go to the bureau and now they will 
approach a counter-I am told that one of the biggest disability 
claims is for hearing loss-and be instructed that they must fill 
out the draft of the application form, a 10-page complicated 
application form for their disability pension. Most elderly 
veterans who find dealing with bureaucracy extremely stressful 
would also find it too complicated to fill out.
<P>
	Considering the fact that the veteran will be assisted by a 
departmental pension officer without the solicitor-client 
privilege, I am concerned that the application may also form an 
entrapment whereby the veteran may mistakenly commit 
incorrect information that is official on his record. The end 
result would be a fast rate of first level rejections.
<P>
<B>(1720 ) </B>
<P>
	I foresee another difficulty with the bureau being removed 
from the first level. Under Bill C-67 the size of the bureaucracy 
will increase and the minister will get more power to influence 
the department's internal affairs. Under these proposals the 
minister may have undue influence over the whole decision 
making process and the quality of service or the rate of 
acceptance.
<P>
	Departmental employees will be vulnerable to receiving 
direction which could deter them from encouraging veterans to 
pursue benefits and services to which they are entitled. They 
will also be under pressure to take part in fiscal restraint. Even 
an offhanded remark by the minister could affect the way his 
staff deals with veterans.
<P>
	I would like to remind this House that my primary concern is 
to ensure that the process is speeded up without taking anything 
away from veterans. With the current rejection rate of 70 per 
cent and an 18 to 20 month waiting period, I have no confidence 
that the removal of the bureau from the first level will speed up 
the process and improve the acceptance ratio. In fact advocacy 
will suffer from the lack of continuity.
<P>
	Currently an advocate from the bureau will deal with a 
veteran from the first level to the review, to the appeal stages, 
ensuring that the advocate is familiar with the merits of the 
client's case. Under the proposed system the pension officer, 
after the first level, will have no mandate to be involved in the 
case whatsoever.
<P>
	The case will be turned over to the bureau lawyer, who will be 
unfamiliar with the case at that point in time. It will be passed on 
to him and in my opinion that will cause further delay. He will be 
unable to properly advise the veteran on the merits of his appeal 
until after some time considering his application. At this point I 
must ask a number of important questions.
<P>
	First, how can veterans believe that the counsellor is acting on 
their behalf and that the information they give, which is in 
confidence, will not be used against them when the department 
is also adjudicating the decision?
<P>
	Second, who exactly will adjudicate decisions at the first 
level and how will they be trained?
<P>
	Third, how will the removal of the Bureau of Pensions 
Advocates from the first level decision speed up the decision 
making process when currently the initial application at the 
bureau level is such a small part of the delay? The delay is in the 
department, not with the bureau.
<P>
	Fourth, will a fast rejection rate at the first level lead to even 
more congestion at the appeal level?
<P>
	Fifth, given the fact that the government promises to halve the 
backlog within two years, where exactly will the promised 
savings in time be made?
<P>
	A second aspect of this piece of legislation that concerns me is 
the proposal to join the BPA, the Bureau of Pensions Advocates, 
to the department. Again, I am concerned about the chances of 
conflict of interest arising and the lack of solicitor-client 
privilege.
<P>
	With the bureau restricted to hearing appeals and as a part of 
the department, I feel that the bureau may no longer provide the 
objective, expert, independent advice which it currently offers. 
As departmental employees they may become party to any cost 
cutting or ratios alluded to by the minister because they will now 
be answerable to superiors within the department. I fail to see 
how this will serve the best interests of the veterans.
<P>
	A third aspect of this legislation which concerns me is the 
merging of the Canadian Pension Commission with the Veterans 
Appeal Board. From my research I have determined that 
currently the pension commission has a much more restrictive 
view of what constitutes a disability than does the Veterans 
Appeal Board. However, when working independently they 
provide a system of checks and balances.
<P>
	The proposed amalgamation of the boards could see the more 
liberal policy of the Veterans Appeal Board watered down, 
which would adversely affect veterans rights and benefits. This 
would not be acceptable to me or to the Reform Party.
<P>
	In addition, I am concerned that the proposed veterans review 
and appeal board will not examine base their examination of 
each review and appeal on the merits of each case. Rather it 
would decide whether the department followed its own stated 
policy and procedure. This would be a further erosion of 
veterans rights and benefits.
<P>
<B>(1725) </B>
<P>
	A fourth aspect of concern is the proposal that the review 
panel in clause 23, the appeal panel in clause 32, the minister in 
clause 82, be given the right on their own motion to reconsider a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9445"> 9445 </A></B>
<P>
decision they have made and amend or rescind that decision if it 
determines that an  error was made with respect to any finding or 
fact or interpretation of any law.
<P>
	This power is unprecedented. In court one cannot be tried for 
the same crime twice after sentencing. This is not due process. 
In fact I wonder if this is even constitutional.
<P>
	When I met with the deputy minister to discuss this bill, he 
assured me there was no need to worry about apparent conflict of 
interest, lack of client-solicitor privilege or attitude among the 
department employees. He argued that veterans will be given the 
benefit of the doubt at all levels of decision making.
<P>
	How can I possibly be confident that the department will 
apply the benefit of the doubt when it has not been used liberally 
in the past? The benefit of the doubt was given to adjudicators 
under the Pension Act and the Veterans Appeal Board Act to 
improve the odds of veterans receiving early acceptance.
<P>
	The commissioners and members of the Veterans Appeal 
Board were, as stated in the act, to bend in favour of the 
applicant. Yet in practice this does not happen. As pointed out in 
the subcommittee on veterans affairs report, the commission did 
not apply the benefit of the doubt but rather rubber stamped the 
advice of the pensions medical advisory.
<P>
	Why now should the department be trusted to apply the 
benefit of the doubt? No wonder the Bureau of Pensions 
Advocates over prepares cases.
<P>
	I would like to sum up my remarks by stating that Canada and 
Canadians have a legal obligation under the Pension Act to pay 
compensation for death and disability relating to military 
service. In addition to the legal obligation I feel that we also 
have a moral obligation to support veterans in a reliable and 
timely manner.
<P>
	I understand the government is trying to rush this bill through 
the House. I have numerous reservations about the effect of this 
bill.
<P>
	The Royal Canadian Legion which represents 240,000 
veterans also has numerous concerns. I just received a letter 
from the dominion president the other day in which he lays out 
many of the concerns. He states: ``In light of these concerns, the 
Royal Canadian Legion considers it to be most important for the 
parliamentary committee to deal with and resolve the concerns 
before endorsing the legislation. At the same time, it is 
recognized that there is a need to move quickly. The Royal 
Canadian Legion stands ready to contribute to the process''.
<P>
	In conclusion, I would like to read once again from ``Keeping 
the Faith: Into the Future''. I would like to commend the people 
who sat on that committee, particularly the Hon. Jack Marshall 
who has recently retired. It is a superb piece of work.
<P>
	On page 85, Prime Minister Sir Robert Borden articulated 
Canada's obligation to veterans when he addressed the soldiers 
about to depart for the Battle of Vimy Ridge in 1917.
<P>
	He said: ``You can go into action assured of this and as the 
head of government I give you this assurance, that you need to 
have no fear that the government and the country will fail to 
show you just appreciation for your service to the country in 
what you are about to do and what you have already done. The 
government and the country will consider it their duty to provide 
to the returned men its just and due appreciation of the 
inestimable value of the services rendered to the country and 
empire and that no man, whether he goes back or whether he 
remains in Flanders, will have just cause to reproach the 
government for having broken faith with the men who won and 
the men who died''.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Is the House ready for the 
question?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Question.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Is it the pleasure of the 
House to adopt the motion?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.

please say nay.
<P>

Order 45, the division on the question now before the House

adjournment, at which time the bells to call in the members will 
be sounded for not more than 15 minutes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I think 
you would find unanimous consent to further defer the vote from 
Monday at the time of adjournment until Tuesday at 5.30 p.m.

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="INTERESTACT">INTEREST ACT</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ)</B> moved that Bill C-273, 
an act to amend the Interest Act, be read the second time and 
referred to a committee.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I am both disappointed and appalled as I 
rise in the House to speak to Bill C-273, an act to amend the 
Interest Act. You will understand my frustration when I explain 
how I became aware of the fact that the Interest Act is totally 
ineffective.
<P>
	I am a notary by profession. Over the years, I have finalized at 
least 5,000 real estate transactions involving either sales or 
financing. In 1981 and 1982, a steep rise in interest rates forced 
mortgage holders to renew their mortgages at 18, 19 or 20 per 
cent, and I even saw a second mortgage renegotiated at 24.41 per 
cent.
<P>
	When rates settled to more civilized levels, the same 
taxpayers-of every political stripe, by the way-tried to 
renegotiate their mortgages to take advantage of the sudden drop 
in interest rates. Mortgage lenders argued, not unreasonably, 
that they themselves had borrowed on term deposits at very high 
rates.
<P>
	They found a sympathetic ear in the Minister of Finance at the 
time, a Liberal, and I am referring to Marc Lalonde who was 
Minister of Finance in 1983 and who told us at the time that the 
banks had initially borrowed the money at high rates and that 
changing the rules of the game at this point might put them in a 
rather difficult situation. I could see that, and I think the 
members of the House of Commons at the time understood the 
situation.
<P>
	Could I perhaps ask the Speaker to urge our Reform Party 
friends to be silent?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. I wonder if we 
could ask for the co-operation of the House while the member 
has the floor. If there are discussions that have to take place, 
they might be held outside the Chamber behind the curtains or in 
our respective lobbies.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lebel:</B> Soaring interest rates in 1981 and 1982 were very 
damaging for small owners of rental buildings and owners of 
apartment buildings.
<P>
<B>(1735) </B>
<P>
	Some had to borrow, also at high rates, against other assets 
they had, the money they needed to fill the gap imposed by this 
sudden hike in the interest rates. I remember a real estate 
transaction involving two rental properties with 12 apartments 
in which the vendor, already choked by his mortgage lender, a 
bank, one of the big six, had to pay out $56,000 in dollars of the 
time in interest penalty for breaking his mortgage. In the United 
States, the federal law on housing provides that no penalty may 
be charged for breaking a mortgage, and yet the American 
economy seems to be in good shape.
<P>
	In the face of the outcry against such abuses, the Minister of 
Finance had asked bankers to take themselves in hand and show 
a human face to their mortgage borrowers. How pure of the 
minister. Taxpayers were nevertheless understanding and, as 
always, reacted calmly to the problem. Because of a lack of 
political will on the part of the Liberals of the time, they as usual 
bore the entire cost of the mess.
<P>
	Since then, interest rates have been civilized, although 
recently, because of the collapse of the Mexican currency, we 
are told, they have tended to rise. When interest rates dropped 
recently to 5.25 and 5.5 per cent per annum, this was the time for 
the party in power to act. The situation that existed in 1982-83 
had evaporated. There was therefore no way the banks could be 
taken by surprise now. Last summer, the banks paid 2, 2.5 and 3 
per cent on term deposits and charged 5, 5.25 5.5 per cent on 
loans.
<P>
	You know, Mr. Speaker, 2,500,000 people are having to deal 
with a mortgage in Canada at the moment. They are held hostage 
by financial institutions and the market, not just by the financial 
institutions, but by fluctuations in the market. This is becoming 
distressing, and it affects our economy, not always predictably, 
but certainly noticeably.
<P>
	Outraged, Mr. Speaker? Yes indeed, and here is why. Private 
members' bills are first drawn at random. The bill before us, Bill 
C-273, has passed that stage. A private member's bill is next 
referred to a sub-committee on private members' business, 
comprising a majority of Liberals and Reform Party members 
and a single member from my party.
<P>
	This committee decides whether the bill will receive a simple 
one hour debate, as in the present case, or whether it is to be 
voted on. If it is decided that it will only get an hour's debate, the 
whole matter is dropped at the end of that hour, it is is history, 
over and done with. If, however, this committee decides that it 
will be put to a vote, then the parties can express their opinions, 
debate it and, after three hours of discussion, the member's bill 
is put to the vote.
<P>
	There is no doubt that if a majority of members in the 
committee is afraid that a member's bill may be passed into law, 
they assess the impact on their constituents, their supporters 
and, indeed, on their financial backers.  In that case, it is either 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9447"> 9447 </A></B>
<P>
debated for three hours or referred for an hour's debate like this 
one.
<P>
	There is no need to spell it out. If it were passed, the bill 
before us would cause the banks to lose huge sums which they 
now collect in penalties.
<P>
<B>(1740) </B>
<P>
	Last November, these poor banks declared overall profits of 
$4.3 billion at the end of their fiscal period, no doubt after 
having made provisions for bad debts and withheld taxes owing; 
$4.3 billion, imagine that.
<P>
	Why did the Sub-Committee on Private Members' Business, 
in which our friends opposite and beside us call the shots, 
oppose putting the bill before us to a vote? Could it possibly be 
because the six big chartered banks each contributed an average 
of $250,000 to the Liberal Party of Canada during the last 
election campaign? One might think so.
<P>
	This obscure committee did not include the interests of the 
Canadian taxpayer in its decision, but only those of its financial 
backers. There you have the results of politicking, an art the 
Liberals have mastered.
<P>
	Reform Party members are learning quickly too now that they 
are aiming to form the next government. God forbid! For 
Canadian taxpayers, the lesson to be learned in all of this is that, 
if a vote is sure to be won, you are the last ones to be considered.
<P>
	I would like to warn the members who are in the majority in 
this committee about their attitude in this case. I plan to send to 
all regional and national newspapers in their ridings a copy of 
<I>Hansard</I> including this debate, so each and every one of them 
will have to explain why they refused to put the bill before us to 
a vote.
<P>
	Coming back to the bill, I can see right away from the reaction 
of my colleagues opposite that they will claim such a measure 
might harm certain investments. I rather doubt that and I shall 
tell you why.
<P>
	At present, a loan granted for more than five years can be 
repaid in advance provided that a sum equal to three months' 
interest is added to the capital and interest due. For a few years 
now, however, the Bank of Montreal has given out loans for 
seven years or even more.
<P>
	Nor is there any validity to the argument that such a procedure 
would mean that individuals who invest their savings for the 
long term in banks would lose money. If people want to get a 
relatively high return for their investment dollar, a return that is 
competitive with bank rates, they can always buy Canada, 
Quebec, Ontario or other savings bonds, or municipal bonds. 
Municipalities are not known for the bad habit of reimbursing 
their debts before the end of the term. Therefore, these people 
will nevertheless be paid the interest that they are entitled to 
receive.
<P>
	Section 93 of the consumer protection act that took effect in 
Quebec in 1976-77, I believe, prohibits any creditor from 
demanding from a consumer any payment in addition to that 
which is due on the day of payment-the act makes no mention 
of mortgages, because the Interest Act falls under the 
jurisdiction of the federal government.
<P>
	Therefore, as long as you are not a business person, because 
the Consumer Protection Act only applies to individuals, no 
penalty will apply if you pay off your television or car early. 
This did not prevent finance companies, business people in 
Quebec from doing business. What may have slowed them down 
more was the negative impact that a provision of the Interest Act 
had on Canada's economy in general.
<P>
	When people who could get other financing elsewhere are 
compelled to go to the end of their mortgage terms or pay 
astronomical amounts, that could hurt the province's and the 
country's economy, in my opinion.
<P>
<B>(1745) </B>
<P>
	In 1976, the Hon. Anthony Abbott of the Liberal Party, the 
predecessors of the people on the other side of the House, 
introduced Bill C-16. This bill was a ``providing for'' bill. It 
provided for the protection of borrowers and depositors, for the 
regulation of interest rates on judgment debts and was to repeal 
the Interest Act. Since 1867, the Interest Act had not been 
substantially amended and had only been changed to include the 
Northwest Territories and the Yukon. The bill, which probably 
was killed through pressure from lobbyists, big banks or some 
other source, proposed to cancel or repeal the Interest Act.
<P>
	Clause 15 of that bill provided that any borrower who pays off 
early all or part of the principal of a mortgage under the 
preceding subclause is not obliged to pay, on the early payment, 
the greater of the penalties stipulated in the loan 
agreement-i.e. in the contract-the penalty payable being the 
lesser of the interest payable for a period of three months or the 
interest which would have been payable if the loan had run to its 
term.
<P>
	In other words, the lesser amount of the two; a maximum of 
three months' interest or less than that amount, if in fact a 
shorter period was left on the term. And that penalty was to be 
calculated on the amount of the early payment at the interest 
rates applicable to the loan.
<P>
	When I introduced my bill, I was not aware that this bill had 
been introduced in 1976. I discovered it when I was doing my 
research. This bill does not come from the Social Credit Party of 
Canada, the party of infinite love or the transcendental 
meditation party; it comes from the Liberal Party, from the 
people sitting opposite us. Why did they renounce their 
principles? 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9448"> 9448 </A></B>
<P>
What has happened to that party since then? Did they get 
contaminated by the Reform Party? I know that they are against.
<P>
	If a group in Canada has been penalized by the measures in the 
Interest Act, it is the western farmers. As we know, western 
farmers are expecting large payments. Do they get paid when 
they sell their crops or do they rely on their various insurance 
policies or on income stabilization plans? I do not know. But the 
fact is that they sometimes have to wait a while before they 
receive their money. In the meantime, they have to secure their 
loans by taking out a mortgage. Since they need money to tide 
them over for a certain time, they borrow from the banks.
<P>
	They are perhaps among those hardest-hit in Canada because 
of the large amounts they borrow on a regular basis, almost 
annually, while waiting to receive the amounts owed them.
<P>
	I am disappointed because I sincerely believed that, political 
games aside, this bill was aimed at protecting for once-it is not 
much, just once-ordinary people who have trouble paying their 
mortgage. I thought that all members of this House, whatever 
their party, would automatically look after the interests of 
ordinary people, of those who allowed them to sit opposite us. 
But they were fooled once again by powerful lobbies and 
monopolies putting pressure on them and saying, ``Listen, I do 
not want to lose my $4.3 billion''.
<P>
	According to press reports, it will probably be worse next year 
because of the economic recovery. Their net profits may exceed 
$4.3 billion. Of course, together they can give $1 million, $1.5 
million or $2 million to the party that can promise them not to 
touch the Interest Act, so they do not lose astronomical amounts 
in penalties like those they lost, I gather, unfairly.
<P>
	I also wanted to table this bill for my constituents in the riding 
of Chambly for whom I worked for 15 years as a notary, 
handling transactions and mortgages. I saw some of them leave 
my office with tears in their eyes. I saw people who could no 
longer make their payments put the key on my desk and tell me, 
``Please give it to the bank manager; I am going to rent an 
apartment in Montreal because I can no longer make my 
payments''. I saw that in 1982 and 1983. It was heartrending.
<P>
<B>(1750) </B>
<P>
	When I decided to go into politics, one of the promises I made 
to the people of Chambly was to try to persuade the government 
to amend this act, which struck me as inhuman, as Mr. Lalonde, 
the finance minister at the time said, but then he asked the banks 
to implement their own controls. It is a bit like asking a fox, who 
has already made it into the henhouse, to eat only a few. It is like 
turning the blood bank over to Dracula. It amounts to almost the 
same thing.
<P>
	I say to the people of Chambly, at least I have tried. Those of 
you who are watching can see that I have tried to change things. I 
am disappointed that it did not pass. And it was because of 
ignorance, the wish to do nothing of certain of my colleagues, 
most of them, unfortunately, from the party in power. I say to 
them that we will not  give up, and that we will try again, perhaps 
at a time when they are less worried about their corporate 
constituents, the banks, and come back to the charge with a 
similar bill.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Hamilton West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
regrettably the hon. member for Chambly significantly weakens 
his debate for his private member's bill when he makes the far 
reaching and one might say ridiculous argument that his bill did 
not win three hours of a debate in this place because Liberals 
would be embarrassed by his act to amend the Interest Act.
<P>
	I remind the hon. member opposite that there have been a 
number of private member's bills introduced by thinking, 
backbench government Liberal members which run counter to 
the suggestions of a minister; but still received three hours of 
debate and a vote. The most recent that I can recall was the 
private member's Bill C-226, an act to rescind section 745 of 
the Criminal Code which received three hours of full debate in 
this place and carried on a vote by the members of this place.
<P>
	On the matter at hand, I consider it a privilege to speak to Bill 
C-273, an act to amend the Interest Act. Let me begin by 
commending the hon. member for Chambly for his well 
intentioned effort on behalf of Canadian mortgage borrowers.
<P>
	The bill before us calls for changes to section 10 of the 
Interest Act. It only calls for the words ``12 months'' to be 
substituted for the words ``five years'' in two places in that 
section.
<P>
	At first sight this appears to be a small change but I am 
concerned that what may seem like a small change could have 
far reaching consequences. I am worried that what on the surface 
appears like a consumer friendly improvement may in practice 
be quite the reverse. If this legislation were to pass mortgage 
financing for Canadians could become less available and 
mortgages could be higher and the range of financial 
instruments available to Canadian borrowers and savers could 
be reduced.
<P>
	I want to demonstrate to my parliamentary colleague opposite 
why such a simple change would have negative consequences. 
The difficulty is that this bill could inadvertently hamper the 
flow of funds into the mortgage market by increasing the risks 
associated with mortgage lending. Hon. members may recall 
that section 10 of the Interest Act provides for a penalty 
equivalent to three months interest in the prepayment of the 
outstanding principal after five years on conventional 
mortgages with terms greater than five years.
<P>
	The bill under consideration, this bill, would extend these 
same provisions; that is, a penalty of three months interest for 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9449"> 9449 </A></B>
<P>
prepayment of outstanding principal after only one year on 
mortgages with terms greater than one year.
<P>
	As hon. members and many Canadians are aware, long term 
mortgages are uncommon in Canada. The vast majority of 
mortgages in this country are issued with terms of five years or 
less.
<P>
<B>(1755 ) </B>
<P>
	One might ask why this lack of long term financing? 
Unfortunately the prepayment penalty provision in section 10 of 
the Interest Act is a real factor. This has been recognized by 
consumer associations, financial institutions, as well as the 
construction and real estate industries.
<P>
	Now we have today's proposed legislation which could 
compound, not improve problems with timely mortgage 
financing because by adopting Bill C-273 we would risk similar 
results in the medium term mortgage market. Prepayment 
penalties for short and medium term mortgages are usually 
based on the present value formula which compensates the 
lender for differences in rates which would apply. This amount 
may be more or less than the three-month penalty proposed by 
the bill.
<P>
	We have to recognize the cascading effects such a problem 
would create. Nervousness about such losses would effect the 
availability of not only mortgages but also medium term GICs. 
In turn, the resulting less efficient, smaller mortgage market 
would have negative implications for the construction and real 
estate industries.
<P>
	Let me reiterate. I understand this bill has been put forward 
with good intentions, that it was tabled with the welfare of 
consumers in mind. However, in deciding whether Bill C-273 
should go forward to committee, hon. members must bear in 
mind the unintended but adverse consequences which could 
flow from this bill.
<P>
	In summary, these consequences include reductions in the 
choices that will be available to Canadian consumers in their 
capacities as mortgage borrowers and as savers, increases in the 
cost of mortgage financing, reductions in the availability of 
medium term mortgage funds, and adverse spill over effects on 
the construction and real estate industries.
<P>
	The hon. member for Chambly does, however, by introducing 
this bill, underline the need for further consideration of how best 
to provide Canadian consumers with the opportunity to prepay 
mortgages in a fair and equitable way.
<P>
	I understand that officials are reviewing this issue so that we 
may very well come back to it in a very short period of time.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lebel:</B> Mr. Speaker, may I reply to his question?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> During the hour reserved 
for private members' business, there is no provision for 
questions and comments. The member presenting the bill in the 
House has 20 minutes, and those who follow have 10 minutes, 
with no questions or comments.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I too wish to compliment the member for Chambly on 
the intent of the bill. There is no question that his heart is in the 
right place.
<P>
	Many people in this House and most Canadians felt the shock 
of the greatly increasing interest rates about 10 years ago. I 
certainly did. Unfortunately while the intent of this bill is noble, 
when we get the past the intent to look at the effects of this bill 
and what would happen in the marketplace, the results may not 
be quite as noble.
<P>
	Before I get into my short comments about this I would like to 
respond to a couple of comments that the mover of the bill from 
Chambly brought into the debate. First was the notion of there 
being some sort of ne'er do well doing in that this bill is not 
votable.
<P>
	I think there are 30 bills brought forward. Of that I believe 
about six or eight are votable. The decision on whether a bill is 
made votable is based on the content of this private member's 
bill as tested against all other private members' bills.
<P>
	Sometimes they are found lacking and sometimes they are 
not. My private member's bill was not votable. I felt badly about 
it but that is the way the cookie crumbles. We have to deal with 
it. Another item was brought into this debate. The banks are 
hugely profitable and therefore we should change this. The 
banks make all kinds of money and therefore nobody likes 
banks. I do not like banks any more than anybody else but banks 
are a part of our life. They are a necessary evil.
<P>
<B>(1800) </B>
<P>
	Banks have had an increase in taxes over the last few years of 
something in the region of 40 per cent. In fact they pay a fairly 
hefty bite of their profits as taxes.
<P>
	As we all know banks have been increasing their service fees 
for everything because they are trying to get out of the cyclical 
nature of recovering all of their cost by interest as well.
<P>
	The whole notion of the profitability of banks in this debate is 
a moot point. It does not have anything to do with what we are 
talking about. Banks make a contract to lend money to a client, 
the client makes a contract with the bank to repay the money.
<P>
	If people wish and are in a position to prepay a loan for 
whatever reason, then it would be nice if the lender would be in a 
position to make it easy for them to do so. However for the 
number of people who would like to renegotiate loans when 
interest rates go down probably does not match the number of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9450"> 9450 </A></B>
<P>
people who would like to renegotiate a loan when interest rates 
go up. I do not  think I have heard of anyone going into a bank 
and saying: ``I understand that interests rates have gone up. 
Therefore I want to renegotiate my loan so I can pay more 
money''.
<P>
	A contract is a contract. When depositors put money on 
deposit and buy interest bearing certificates at a bank, the bank 
generally matches those deposits with lending.
<P>
	Perhaps we should consider letting the marketplace decide. If 
it is in the best interest of the bank, and some do, to ensure that 
their customers are able to have more flexibility in their 
mortgage loans, then they could advertise that they will be 
prepared after one year to allow the customer to collapse the 
loan, prepay three months interest and be out of the contract.
<P>
	Most banks have open mortgages, one-year mortgages, 
six-month mortgages, five-year mortgages and ten-year 
mortgages. The Home Builders' Association would like to see 
much longer term mortgages so that people would be able to 
lock into a mortgage, perhaps even over its life, until it is totally 
amortized. This is done in the United States. Then when 
someone buys a home they know what their payments are going 
to be from the time they make their first payment until the time 
they make their last and the vagaries of interest rates will not 
drive people out of their homes. That again is another debate and 
another story.
<P>
	Some lending institutions will lend money for mortgages in 
this country this very day that consider their mortgages fully 
open and will allow people to prepay without penalty at any 
time.
<P>
	We should allow the natural competitive forces in a healthy 
marketplace make these decisions. We have many fish to fry in 
this Parliament. We should let the private sector do what the 
private sector should do and not further involve the government 
in more details that should be handled by the private sector. We 
should be getting out of business, not getting into business.
<P>
	While the member for Chambly brings to the House a 
well-intentioned motion perhaps it also contains a bit of 
quicksand. I would suggest that if people are looking at this and 
we absolutely must do something about it as a Parliament, we 
might consider this. When a mortgage institution or a bank lends 
money on a mortgage expecting to get a spread of 3 per cent 
between the people who are lending money to the bank and the 
people who are borrowing money from the bank, their profit is 
included in that.
<P>
<B>(1805 ) </B>
<P>
	Perhaps the banks might consider giving up their portion of 
profit. Certainly their expenses should be covered.
<P>
	We are getting very complicated in this debate; at least I am 
getting very complicated. It is not really our decision and our 
job to decide what banks should do and how they should do it. 
That is a job for a free, competitive and open marketplace.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to support my colleague in this respect, and I think the hon. 
member of the Reform Party should realize this is a bill to 
protect the individual consumer who borrows money, not 
companies. If I understood correctly, the bill is not concerned 
with companies but individuals.
<P>
	We all know that financial institutions, with their expertise, 
can easily predict the vagaries of interest rates and are in a better 
position to take advantage of that expertise than the average 
citizen who has to make a living and does not have the resources 
to be able to judge when he should pay up his mortgage or take 
out a mortgage and for what period of time, and so forth.
<P>
	That is why I think the flexibility the hon. member for 
Chambly is seeking, to allow people to pay back their mortgages 
and renegotiate them at a lower rate, would give the average 
citizen, for whom a mortgage on his home is the only equity he 
has, a chance to borrow a certain amount using the mortgage as 
collateral, in order to save some money for later on when he 
retires.
<P>
	As the hon. member for Chambly explained, in the past we 
have often seen people lose huge sums of money, mainly 
because here in Canada we have a major problem. If we look at 
the mid-seventies we had interest rates at fairly reasonable 
levels of 7, 8 or 9 per cent. In 1981, 1982, 1983, interest rates 
rose to 20 per cent and then went down to 7, 8 and 9 per cent, and 
then down to 6 per cent in 1994. Last year, you could get a 
mortgage at 6 per cent, and now we are up to 11 and 12 per cent.
<P>
	Imagine what we have to cope with. I did not do a serious 
analysis of the situation in other countries, but I know that in the 
United States, you can still get a 30-year mortgage at a much 
lower rate than we pay here. This kind of stability means that 
wage earners with fairly stable incomes can budget their money 
better. In this country, however, with these tremendous 
variations in interest rates, people never know where they stand.
<P>
	So if we gave individuals, since we are talking about private 
mortgages, if we gave individuals a chance to at least budget for 
their interest payments, it would help them balance their 
budgets generally, give them greater confidence, and make them 
more inclined to engage in real estate transactions, and in the 
process, this would help the economy. I think that this is what 
the hon. member for Chambly had in mind when he introduced 
this bill, and I think this is important, but unfortunately, it would 
seem this bill is being snubbed.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="9451"> 9451 </A></B>
<P>
	I think we should have had more time to discuss the bill and 
a chance to improve certain guarantees available to individuals.
<P>
	Once again, financial institutions are very well organized. 
They have their own experts who are able to evaluate the trends 
and the way interest rates are going, but the average Joe who has 
to learn a living does not have the resources to do this. That is 
why I support the bill standing in the name of the hon. member 
for Chambly.

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 
deemed to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="U.S.PRESIDENT'SVISIT">U.S. PRESIDENT'S VISIT</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Philippe Paré (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I feel 
compelled to rise in the House to ask the parliamentary secretary 
to clarify an answer to a question I asked the Prime Minister 
Monday.
<P>
	I had asked the Prime Minister which customary or 
parliamentary rule or law dictated that the Right Hon. Leader of 
the Official Opposition could not meet the American President 
during the latter's upcoming visit to Ottawa, at the end of 
February. I also asked whether he considered it normal for a 
Prime Minister to tell the President of the United States what he 
can or cannot do.
<P>
	Instead of answering my question, and being unable to find an 
excuse for his emotional, partisan and inappropriate reaction 
outside the House, the Prime Minister got tangled up in strange 
and confused explanations and talked about the letter the Leader 
of the Opposition had sent to Mr. Clinton requesting a meeting 
with him.
<P>
	Finally, he said that, since the letter was addressed to Mr. 
Clinton, only he could respond to it. What we must understand 
from this part of his answer, Mr. Speaker, is that he could not tell 
the difference between a letter addressed to him and a copy of a 
letter sent to him as a courtesy.
<P>
	The Prime Minister also lapsed into vaudeville and the absurd 
by pointing out to me that a meeting with the Leader of the 
Opposition was not a universal practice and that he, as Leader of 
the Opposition, had not always exercised this prerogative.
<P>
	In fact he reminded me that the President of the United States, 
Mr. Zedillo, had not met with the Leader of the Opposition 
during his visit of last December. The Prime Minister must be 
reminded that Mr. Zedillo is the President of Mexico.
<P>
	Except for his pitiful medical diagnosis of the Leader of the 
Opposition's state of health, which would make Hippocrates 
blush, the Prime Minister in no way answered my question. On 
what grounds did he decide that the hon. member for 
Lac-Saint-Jean could not meet with the American President?
<P>
	After having so clumsily avoided answering my first 
question, the Prime Minister gave no more of an answer to the 
second one I put to him. Let me repeat this question: Now that he 
admits that the leader of the Bloc Quebecois has the right to 
meet with the U.S. president ``will the Prime Minister promise 
he will not use pressure tactics or indulge in any 
behind-the-scenes manoeuvring to try to discourage the U.S. 
president from meeting the Leader of the Official Opposition?''
<P>
	The Prime Minister's answer was short and sweet:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-in the normal course of events, President Clinton's letter should come from 
Washington, not from Ottawa.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	As you can see, this is not a promise not to use pressure 
tactics. On the contrary. What is the meaning of the expression 
``in the normal course of events'' in his answer? Does it not 
clearly indicate that, in fact, the Prime Minister is not ruling out 
a possible attempt to dictate the answer that will come from 
Washington? The Prime Minister has mastered the art of 
dodging questions, as he showed us again in this case.
<P>

<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Jean Augustine (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime 
Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be clear and succinct in my 
answer which will also provide some information.
<P>
	The question posed was answered by the Prime Minister in the 
House on Monday afternoon. The visit of President Clinton to 
Ottawa is an important event in the relationship between Canada 
and the United States. The government is very much looking 
forward to this, the first official visit of President Clinton to 
Canada.
<P>
	He will arrive during the morning of Thursday, February 23. 
He will depart on the afternoon of Friday, February 24. The 
program will involve the participation of our new Governor 
General, a visit to Parliament, meetings with the Prime Minister 
and members of the cabinet.
<P>
	The leader of the Bloc Quebecois has sought an appointment 
directly with the President of the United States for his time in 
Ottawa. As the Prime Minister indicated on Monday in response 
to the question, it is up to the United States to authorize such a 
meeting.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Pursuant to Standing 
Order 38(5), a motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to 
have been adopted.
<P>
	Accordingly, the House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 
a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 6.22 p.m.)
