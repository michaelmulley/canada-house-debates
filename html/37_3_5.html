	Mr. Speaker, I rise today on a question of privilege regarding a matter that was raised in a previous session.  On May 12 and May 16, 2003 the former government House leader raised the issue of parliamentary privilege exempting members from being called as witnesses in any court when the House is in session,  specifically the decision of the British Columbia Court of Appeal on April 23, 2003 in what is known as the Ainsworth case.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue raised in that case was whether the Prime Minister could claim parliamentary privilege to provide legal protection against any action against him from the court for failing to attend an examination for discovery.  He also raised the matter of a decision of the Ontario Superior Court with respect to another member involving Telezone Inc.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter was dealt with on January 6, 2004 when the Ontario Court of Appeal  made a decision with respect to Telezone Inc.  I believe that its decision satisfies the former government House leader, although a number of questions remain.  The Ontario Court of Appeal ruled that the parliamentary privilege of a member of Parliament not to attend as a witness in a civil action applies throughout a session of Parliament and extends 40 days after the prorogation or dissolution of Parliament and 40 days before the commencement of a new session.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The case of the Prime Minister remains unresolved because the two cases are different. In  the case of Attorney General of Canada, et al. v. Ainsworth Lumber Co. Ltd. (B.C.) (29842),  the Supreme Court dismissed the application for leave to appeal.  The Prime Minister still does not have the right to claim this privilege. The issue of whether or not he can claim this privilege remains unresolved. It is not clear whether or not the House agrees with the former government House leader in that the Prime Minister should be able to claim this privilege.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his submission, the former government House leader on May 12, 2003 argued that in the Ainsworth decision, the B.C. court confirmed the existence of parliamentary privilege of members against participating in legal proceedings when Parliament was in session. The court recognized that this applied throughout the parliamentary session including adjournments and other periods when the houses were not sitting.  However, the court ruled that there was no legal support for extending this privilege for 40 days before or after a parliamentary session.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The then government House leader felt the court's ruling raised an important issue.  This is the question of whether it is the role of Parliament or the role of the courts to define what parliamentary privilege is.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On May 26, 2003 the Speaker ruled the matter was a prima facie question of privilege.  He also agreed with some members that there was a need for an even-handed application of privilege with respect to the rights of other Canadians.  He pointed to a suggestion that it might be appropriate for the House to revisit its current interpretation of the immunity that its privileges provide.  He concluded by recognizing the special requirements of the House which make privilege necessary, that  there is need to ensure that other citizens are not adversely affected by those privileges.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In particular, members had expressed concern during the debate on the question of privilege that the blind application of the rights of members, such as the right not to be compelled to appear before a court as a witness, might interfere unduly with the rights of others.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The matter was referred to the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs. The committee's initial research revealed that there were two types of situations that can arise: one where a member is a party  to a civil action, the case involving the Prime Minister; and one where the member is merely being asked to attend as a witness, the case involving the former member for Ottawa South.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The research claimed that while the parliamentary privilege to avoid appearing in court as a witness does not apply to the Prime Minister because he is named as a defendant in a civil action, the privilege can be claimed by Mr. Manley because he was not named as a party in the case and was simply asked to appear as a witness in the court. The recent decision from the Ontario Court of Appeal would confirm that finding.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The research also left many questions to be answered, such as whether the distinction between being a party to a civil action and being a witness is reasonable and should be reviewed.  Should one privilege be extended or the other limited? How should these privileges relate to criminal  matters?  What is the privilege procedure for a member to claim these privileges? Given the privileges belong to the House of Commons, is the 40 day rule an appropriate length of time for the immunity of being a witness and from arrest, especially given that the parliamentary sessions in the Canadian Parliament are typically quite lengthy?  Should the fact that there is a fixed parliamentary calendar for the House make a difference? </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 40 day rule arose at a time when parliamentary sessions were short.  The members could not really leave the capital before, during or after a session.  Should the ease of modern transportation be relevant? Should the 40 day rule be retained or shortened?</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, as a result of prorogation, the terms of reference to the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs has lapsed. Since a committee cannot on its own consider a matter of privilege without a reference from the House, I ask that you rule this to be a prima facie question of privilege to allow me to move the motion referring this matter to the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs.</p>

	I thank the hon. member for raising this matter. As I indicated in the previous session, this was a bona fide question of privilege. Accordingly, in my view, the question remains a question of privilege. The committee did not completely report on the matter which it is entitled to do. Accordingly I give the hon. member leave to move his motion.</p>

	Order, please.  It seems to me that the hon. member for Elk Island is seeking consent of the House to move a motion to strike a committee and he appears to have gone far beyond   anything like    normal membership of committee already, in terms of numbers.  He appears to be putting the whole House on the committee.  He  could move that we go to committee of the whole, but he is not doing that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is more substance to his motion rather than names, I would like to hear it.  Otherwise, I am going to put the question to the House whether there is consent for the motion, because the list seems to be endless and I do not think that is appropriate.  The hon. member will want to put any more substance at the end of the list because I do not think it is necessary to read a list of the names of all the members of the House, which he appears to be doing.</p>


	<A NAME="Int-802948"></A><a HREF="#Int-802949"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-802947"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Ken Epp: </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I would then ask for your clarification.  By what Standing Order am I not permitted to completely give my motion before you put it to the House?</p>


	<A NAME="Int-802949"></A><a HREF="#Int-802951"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-802948"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Speaker: </b>

	It is not a matter of a Standing Order.  When a member is seeking to put a motion, it is normal for the member to put the motion succinctly.  In this case his motion is unusually long because he is listing all the members of the House.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My point is that if we are going to do that, he can say, instead, that the membership of the committee can be agreed on later by the striking committee, which is common or the membership could be agreed on in a separate motion, which is common.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Matters of reference to committee do not normally contain all the members of the committee.  Had he limited it to 15, or 16 or 17 members, which is our normal thing, I think the Chair might have let it go.  However, it appears he has gone far beyond that already, with no end in site, in terms of names, because it appears an alphabetical listing. There comes a time when the Chair has to say we have to say yes or no.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope there is more substance to the hon. member's motion.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I would like to say in my defence that it is not possible, unless one is clairvoyant, to know exactly which words I am going to read.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to also point out that it is a normal practice  when one seeks the unanimous consent of the House to move a motion.  There is no rule that I am aware of against the length of the motion, provided that it--</p>

	Mr. Speaker, on a point of order.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the hon. member opposite cannot take it upon himself to create an exception to one of our standing orders. Second, I think your statement was extremely clear, Mr. Speaker. Third, the hon. member has many other means and mechanisms available to him under our standing orders for presenting such a motion. Therefore, I do not see why we would waste the precious time of this House on such a frivolous matter.</p>

	<A NAME="Int-802959"></A><a HREF="#Int-802961"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-802957"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Speaker: </b>

	The Chair has interrupted the hon. member for Elk Island already on his point of order, and I allowed the interruption from the government House leader because of my concerns about the validity of this point of order.  It appears that the point of order is being used to get the floor to propose a motion that, in my view, is a two step process.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to decide whether the motion can be put because it requires unanimous consent to put it.  The normal practice in these cases is to allow the member to propose the motion, hear  it, ask if there is unanimous consent and then have members say yes or no.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This motion seems, as I have suggested already, unduly lengthy.  It contains a list of names that is being read.  In my view that is far beyond what is going to be agreed to by the House.  It is obvious there is disagreement.  My inclination is to determine whether  there is substance to the motion with which the House wishes to deal.  In my view the list of members is not substantive, and I have indicated that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are going to continue, at some point I am going to interrupt and ask the House if there is consent to put the motion.  If there is no consent, then it is a waste of time to hear it.  The length of motion is of concern to the Chair in that it appears not to be in conformity with our practice of having a brief motion put and then consent given or not.  That is why I asked the hon. member for Elk Island if he would please come to the substance of his motion.  The government House leader has, in effect, made the point and the point is  a valid one in that we ought to hear the substance of the motion, which is the normal thing to hear on these kinds of motions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I make the suggestion again.  If there is more substance to this motion than a list of members,  I am prepared to hear it, but the Chair's patience is running thin on the rest.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I apologize for exercising your patience, but I believe it is my privilege as a member of the House of Commons to put a motion.  I have asked that you  seek unanimous consent. I have asked that it be notwithstanding Standing Order 105.  I believe very sincerely that the Speaker should hear the whole motion, in which I am naming certain members of the House of Commons in a proposal to form a committee.  I believe I should have the right as a member of Parliament to do that.</p>

	I want to say right off that if every member had the right to stand up and ask for consent to move motions and then stood here and read motions all day, no business would be conducted in the House. In my view members do not have such a right. They are asking for consent and if consent is not going to be given, then we cannot have interminable requests for unanimous consent.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view the hon. member has a right to ask for consent for a motion, but a motion that contains a list of names and is not really a motion with substantive material in it is my concern.  If all the substantive material has been put in this motion, then I think we ought to ask for consent.  I am urging the hon. member to try to comply with the wishes of the Chair in this regard.  All of us could stand here and read lists, but that is not the normal procedure on motions where unanimous consent is sought.</p>

	I thank the hon. member for Yorkton—Melville for his assistance, and it  was exactly the customs and practices of the House that I explained a moment ago with which I trust the hon. member for Elk Island will comply.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have never seen a motion in the House that listed members of the House who were not members of a committee.  In my view that is not part of the custom of the House, and it only confirms my suspicion that the hon. member's list and this attempt is a delay tactic rather than an effort to put a motion to the House which the House can accept or reject on consent.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have indicated our practice and our custom and that is to hear a brief motion from a member and then give consent or not.  This motion is not that way.  I have asked for the substance of it.  The hon. member for Elk Island persists in reading a list and my patience is running out.  It had better be short because I cannot have a list of all the members of the House read out once or twice as we go through those who are on and those who are off.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The normal practice is to name 15 members to a special committee.  This list is apparently much, much longer.  It appears to be in alphabetical order and I am not prepared to listen to a list of all the members of the House.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the hon. member wants to refer to a committee of the whole, fine.  I would like to hear the rest of the substance of the motion.</p>

	I did not say that points of order should be brief.  I said motions should be brief. The member has risen on a point of order asking for consent to move a motion.  In my view the motion has gone on already too long.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our normal practice, when consent is requested for a motion, is that the motion be brief.  The hon. member apparently does not have consent for the motion.  We are getting that impression very loudly in the House from time to time and the motion is not brief.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is my point, and I am sure the hon. member for Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke appreciates that.</p>


	<A NAME="Int-802977"></A><a HREF="#Int-802979"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-802976"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Brian Pallister (Portage—Lisgar, CPC): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, with all due respect I would like to make the observation that I believe someone was wanting to time the amount of time that we have spent with the interventions of the government members, with interventions from the Chair, and so on.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we have occupied considerably more time of the House in talking about the motion than we have in listening to the motion be read.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personally, I would prefer to hear the motion, and I would suggest that if we are interested in the use of the House's time effectively, we listen to the member's motion.</p>


	<A NAME="Int-802979"></A><a HREF="#Int-802981"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-802977"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Ken Epp: </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I believe it is my right to place the motion.  The motion, in its entirety, requires that somehow or other I be permitted to indicate the members that I would like to be eligible.  If you were to listen to my whole motion, the very last part of my motion gives clarity to exactly what you are objecting to, but you are not permitting me to get to it, and that is causing me some distress.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With your permission, Mr. Speaker, I would like to continue.  I think it will be confusing to members who read the record and  look to see whether their name is on the list as being eligible for membership on the committee that I am proposing.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said before that I would  shorten it by indicating the members from the total list that I would like to exclude.  However, having begun by reading the actual members who I am proposing, I think that would add a lot of confusion.  Therefore  I would like to  actually revert back to reading the names of the members.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not have here a list of all the members of the House.  I have chosen specific members and   I am just going to carry on with it. The motion continues:</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I believe we are wasting an enormous amount of time when, really, there is a very simple solution to it all.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motion should be considered as a whole. Any one of the names listed in the motion is therefore part of the motion. One of these people has already said there will not be unanimous consent. Therefore, the whole motion is not admissible because his name is part of the motion.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, that  seems to me to be  a very illogical argument because the member has not heard the terms of the motion itself.  All he has heard is his name.  Members   have no  idea what the motion  refers to until the  member is able to put the motion before the House.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore  it seems to me that the House leader is out of order here.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, just as an observation. I think that would be a very dangerous precedent to set, to allow members to rise at any particular point in time when another member is bringing forward a motion and prematurely giving their personal opinion on it as to whether they would or would not give unanimous consent.  It would pre-empt the ability of any member of the House to bring forward such a motion.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course  it would be a tremendously dangerous precedent to set.  I think the government House leader should consider that before he implies that it would be possible for any of us in the House to use such a tactic as a way to block the ability of any other member of the House to bring forward a motion. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. member for Elk Island is trying to move a motion, and I read from page 391 of Marleau and Montpetit.  Under motions and routine proceedings it states:</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It goes  on and on.  I could read the whole list but I will not.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, this kind of motion is normally moved during motions under routine proceedings.  We are not at motions under routine proceedings. We are two hours before that happens.  What the hon. member is seeking to do is get unanimous consent to do something that normally is done under motions  for one thing, but then he is seeking unanimous consent for a motion that we already know will not get unanimous consent. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, I think we have heard enough.  I have invited the hon. member to put the substance, which is our usual practice, so we hear it and accept or reject it.  However, in this case he is persisting in reading a list.  He has offered to read two lists and, in my view, it is an abuse of the practice of the House.  We already have an indication that the answer is no, and, accordingly, I suggest we move on to the next item.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I urge you to hear me out. This issue is one of huge importance. We have had piles of petitions on this question. It is a matter of great urgency to protect our children from further sexual exploitation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My motion at the end will indicate that substitutions on this committee can be made from time to time, but I am specifically stating the members  because I know there are some members who are on the wrong side of this issue. I am not prepared to say that everybody is eligible to be on this committee. That is--</p>

	The hon. member knows that motions to establish committees normally have to be done on 48 hours notice. He is seeking unanimous consent of the House to avoid that notice requirement. It has been denied. It has been  refused.  Accordingly, I am not prepared to entertain further motions on it at this time. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he wants to give notice of a motion and put it on the Order Paper he is free to do that and then he can move it under the rubric  “Motions”  when it is eligible for debate in the House. However, he is seeking the House's permission now to waive the notice requirement, to do it at an unusual time and to propose a motion that I have indicated is highly unusual in its terms.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have heard a clear no from the government House leader in respect of this. There will not be consent for it even if the member finished reading his motion, so I am not prepared to let him continue because, in my view, he is wasting the time of the House and we cannot have that. </p>

	Mr. Speaker, just  on  a point of clarification that you might want to give us. If your ruling is based on the intervention of the member opposite, who rose in his place and said that he would not give unanimous consent, if that is in fact the basis of your ruling, I would like you to clarify that to the House at this point in time.

	I have given my ruling to the House and I gave my reasons. I gave a number of reasons pointing out the practices of the House and actually I have given reasons  about four times.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have indicated that, among other things, there is a refusal. There is no consent. The motion is for unanimous consent to waive a number of practices of the House and there has been an  indication that will not happen. The motion, in my view, is highly irregular and I have said that in argument  with the hon. member for Elk Island already. It was particularly irregular and it contains a list of all the names of the members who are not on the committee. Accordingly, I am saying that we should move on.  </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, I would like you to revisit your decision to not allow me to address the issue on which  you ruled and on which you allowed me to pass my motion. I am asking for you to reconsider that because at this point it seems  that there was a problem with the procedure. I think you know  what I am referring to. I would like to address the motion that I put and I was not allowed. I think people opposite saw me stand on debate, but you, sir, did not. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would simply like to say that this is a very dangerous precedent.  Mr. Speaker, you have ruled that members have to make a decision on a motion before they have been given the opportunity to hear it all.

	Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order with regard to the government motion to reinstate bills from the previous session.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister claims to have formed a new government.  Yet with this motion he is claiming the privileges of being the former government of Mr. Chrétien.  Procedurally speaking, the Prime Minister wants to be seen, as most Canadians see his government, as the old Chrétien government.  While we in opposition would agree with that definition, my argument today will put to the test the Prime Minister's self-proclaimed public definition of being a new government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I accept that it is a well established practice for a government to reintroduce a reinstatement motion in a new session.  However, it is not established that a so-called new government in a new session can reinstate bills from the previous government. I have examined all the precedents and I could not find one example of a new government reinstating bills from a previous session.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From <i>Journals</i> of October 21, 1970, at page 46, it is recorded that the House adopted a reinstatement motion.  The Prime Minister was Pierre Trudeau and the motion reinstated bills of Mr. Trudeau's government from the previous session.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For May 9, 1972, at page 281 of <i>Journals</i> we have another motion adopted with,  once again, Pierre Trudeau being the Prime Minister in that session and the previous session.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On March 8, 1974, at pages 25 and 26, a reinstatement motion was adopted with the same circumstances as those of May 9, 1972.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October 3, 1986, at pages 47 to 48, Mr. Mulroney's government introduced a reinstatement motion reinstating bills of the Mulroney government from the previous session.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On March 4, 1996, at pages 34, 35 and 39 to 41 of <i>Journals</i>, Jean Chrétien's government reinstated government bills of the Chrétien government   from the previous session.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On November 12, 2003, the government of Jean Chrétien once again successfully reinstated bills from a previous session, although he ran into a bit of a problem with his attempt to reinstate other business, resulting in a Speaker's ruling that divided the motion into three parts.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, many arguments have been made against the practice whereby a Prime Minister reinstates his government bills from a previous session.  It goes against the practice, consequences and reasons for a government to prorogue.  It contradicts the notion of beginning a session with fresh ideas and a new direction.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we are talking about here today is far worse and, I would argue, procedurally unacceptable. The current Prime Minister is attempting to reinstate bills of another prime minister  from a previous session and has the moral effrontery to call  his government “new”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When this Prime Minister promised democratic reform and made a commitment to do things differently we thought he meant to improve how Parliament functions.  So far the Prime Minister has behaved less democratically than his predecessor, something most of us thought would be impossible.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, I am asking you to examine the precedents and rule the motion to reinstate government bills out of order.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, on February 4, I gave notice to the House of a government motion to reinstate government bills to the stage they were at in the previous session.</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reinstatement of government bills is a common practice at the beginning of a new session of Parliament after prorogation. The House of Commons has employed this practice for over 30 years.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1972 and in 1986 the House gave indeed unanimous consent to such motions to reinstate bills similar to that which we are proposing today.  In 1991, 1996, 1999 and as recently as 2002, the House passed a motion similar to that which we are proposing today.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A similar procedure is now included in the Standing Orders for reinstatement of private members' bills.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The U.K. House of Commons uses a similar practice.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reinstatement of bills expedites House business at the beginning of a new session.  Bills that have already been studied can be reinstated to the point they had reached in a previous session.  The House, members and committees do not have to waste their time on questions that have already been settled in the best interest of taxpayers.  Thus, witnesses are spared from having to repeat their testimony and are spared the costs that involves. We would be able to move ahead on new issues instead of going back to issues from a previous session.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, I would very much like to hear your statement on this point of order.</p>


	<A NAME="Int-803015"></A><a HREF="#Int-803017"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-803013"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, CPC): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, we have here a substantial dilemma in the sense that the prorogation of a house usually means that the government wants to start over again with a new set of proposed legislation, or it gives them a good way of dropping legislation that apparently, as expressed by members of Parliament, does not have the support of the people of Canada.  That way, instead of the embarrassment of a bill carrying on and actually getting passed even though it does not enjoy public consent, it gives the government the opportunity wipe the slate clean.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government House leader just made a statement which I think is of great significance, and that is that this is based on unanimous consent.  If there is unanimous consent given, then of course we can proceed to reinstate a bill or a motion.  I would like to see that that procedure should follow. We should be able to state each bill separately and individually and if there is not unanimous consent to carry it forward, then indeed it would have to be reintroduced.  That seems to have been the practice, according to the words of the government House leader.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If that were done, then I think probably we would have very little objection, because there are a number of bills that this government is now trying to bring forward from the tired old Chrétien government which we would seriously like to see dropped. If that were done, then probably there could be some agreement reached.  Otherwise, I think we are going to be at a serious impasse.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I call a point of order. Reintroducing bills is worthwhile insofar as all the bills are reinstated at the same stage they had reached.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My fear is that Bill C-53, to change the name of certain electoral districts, a decision of this Parliament, will not be reinstated at the same stage and not passed before the next federal election. That is the harsh reality.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government is trying to say that all the bills are to be reinstated at the same stage they had reached in the previous session. The problem is that we well know that this government does not  intend to reinstate Bill C-53 at the same stage and that the new names of 38 ridings, changed by Bill C-53, will not be adopted and so will not be in force prior to the next federal election.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fully agree with the Conservative Party to the effect that we are discussing a substantial dilemma today. On the one hand, the government is saying it is reinstating all the bills, but one of them, Bill C-53, will not have the same purpose  it had when the House prorogued in November.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I would like to underscore what my Bloc colleague has just said: that in order for the government to reinstate bills and motions they have to be in the same stage.  They have to be identical.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are not.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like you to examine this, Mr. Speaker, because there is no precedent for this.  To have a motion like this passed, it would have to comply with all of the provisions in the Standing Orders, and they do not.  That is why I would like the Speaker to rule that this cannot be brought in at this time.</p>


	<A NAME="Int-803021"></A><a HREF="#Int-803022"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-803019"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Speaker: </b>

	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right">
</td>
<td><small>...if the Speaker is satisfied that the said bill is in the same form as the House of Commons had agreed to at prorogation, notwithstanding Standing Order 71, the said bill shall be deemed in the current session to have been considered and approved at all stages completed at the time of prorogation--</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it has to be in the same form that it was in the previous session in order for this order to apply to the bill.  Otherwise, all bills are introduced, read the first time and ordered for debate at the next sitting of the House.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reinstatement of business from one session to the next is not uncommon in our practice, and indeed in our parliamentary experience there have been a number of occasions where bills and other forms of business, including motions, from one session  have been brought forward to another session, either by unanimous consent or by way of a government motion moved after notice, such as the one we have moved before us today.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question before us is not whether business can be reinstated from one session to another but whether this motion under government business No. 2, which provides a mechanism whereby bills from the second session may be reinstated to this session, is procedurally in order.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me that the ruling rendered on February 19, 1996, is particularly helpful in this instance, so I will borrow freely from that discussion in making the point I want to make.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker Fraser noted in his ruling of May 29, 1991, that he could find nothing in our rules or practices to preclude the reinstatement of bills by way of motion.  He therefore permitted debate to proceed on the government motion that had been moved, and he was concerned that members would be afforded an adequate opportunity to express their assent or dissent on each item to be reinstated. He therefore ruled that separate questions should be put on each bill to be reinstated.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But that motion, I think, was a different one.  Hon. members here today have expressed some concern about their inability to vote on each of the bills, particularly the various ones that could be reinstated under this motion.</p>


	<A NAME="T1055"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1055"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1100"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1050"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1055)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must point out something important.  First of all, if the bill comes back at the stage it was at before, for example report stage or third reading, it will be voted on at that stage.  That is completely normal and that is how it will be done.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If, however, the bill in question was passed during the last session, it will be sent directly to the Senate. There will be no vote on it here in the House.</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But hon. members can move amendments to the government motion to exclude specific bills that might go straight to the Senate under this rubric and then have a vote on the amendment, thereby in effect having a vote on that particular bill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I do feel that there is significant protection for hon. members in terms of being allowed to vote on various bills.  The motion sets up a mechanism for allowing bills to come before the House.  In my view, therefore, it is in order and I think the motion should proceed.</p>


	<A NAME="Int-803022"></A><a HREF="#Int-803023"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-803021"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz: </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I do not hear you addressing the issue of when a new government is formed whether it can introduce bills from an old government. We were told that this is a completely new government, and if we look at the front bench, the cabinet, I guess we would have to conclude some are and some are not.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, I think you have to do some research as to the point I raised on whether a new government can bring forward all of the legislation of an old government.</p>

	It is not a new Parliament; this is the hitch.  We are in the third session of the same Parliament, so even if the hon. member were Prime Minister it seems to me this kind of motion would be one he could put to the House and cherry pick, as they say, bills from the previous session and slip them in under this rubric.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is something that has happened before.  I do not know whether it has happened with a change of government, but it certainly is one that has happened in the same Parliament.  That is why I did not address the matter.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, you and I go way back.  We are a little long in the tooth in this place.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You did make a reference to the ruling of Speaker John Fraser in 1991.  You and I both served in the 1988 Parliament when Brian Mulroney was the Prime Minister. I can remember sitting in the back lobby here with my Liberal colleagues, and Mr. Speaker, you were one of them.  They were thinking up ways that they could cause mischief when the House prorogued.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dead meant dead, it seemed to me back then.  This was a way for the government to get out of it, if it had difficult legislation where its own backbenchers were causing problems.  They were able to kill legislation. That is what prorogation did.  It killed it dead.  That was before 1991 when Speaker Fraser made his ruling.  I do find this a little strange. There are a few of those folks left, and when it seems to suit them now, everything is okay.  They can just resurrect this stuff.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, I know that when you and I started in this place, prorogation meant dead equals dead.  That was before 1991.  I would like your input on that because I remember listening to you in the back lobby here about prorogation and how legislation could be killed and could not be brought back.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A major concern expressed several times throughout the day was that if genetically modified wheat were grown anywhere in Canada, farmers would lose important markets around the world. They also felt very strongly that the Liberal government was not doing enough to get the border opened to live cattle.</p>

They would like to know whether they can fly a flag of convenience, such as the Prime Minister's flag of Barbados, over their farms and avoid taxes they have to pay, taxes that are included in all their input costs.</p>

It is inexcusable that any train car should go in for servicing and come out without a reflector attached to it.

	Mr. Speaker, in the last two oral question periods, the Minister of Social Development has found a way to praise her government for realizing a savings of several billion dollars at a direct cost to low-income seniors, through the guaranteed income supplement. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can she support the strategy of the former finance minister which was never to control his government's spending, but rather to take money from the pockets of the most vulnerable?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can the minister turn up her nose at the Bloc Quebecois proposal that urges retroactive reimbursement of the billions of dollars owed to low-income seniors, and still support the Prime Minister's initiative to exempt his ships from the Income Tax Act when he was Minister of Finance?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This double standard is simply repugnant and shows everyone what a lack of respect the minister, the Prime Minister, and this government have for our senior citizens who have been and continue to be the honoured builders of our communities.</p>

	Mr. Speaker,  I rise today to remember John Cain, a well respected photographer who passed away on January 25, 2004.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Born in Australia, John travelled to St. Catharines in 1957. He decided to stay in Canada when he was introduced to Reba, the young woman who would become his wife.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John worked in sales but his passion was photography. About 30 years ago, started photographing weddings in his spare time and then branched out into sports photography. He attended many sports events covering the Royal Canadian Henley Regatta, Brock University and many high school athletic competitions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This hobby also led to numerous freelance assignments with the <i>St. Catharines Standard</i> and many local photos for my quarterly householder.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John was known to send photographs to many of his celebrity subjects like Ferguson Jenkins and Walter Gretzky. They became his friends. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John Cain's legacy can be found in the wonderful photographs that he took doing what he truly enjoyed. It was my privilege to know John Cain and to call him my friend.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On behalf of the House, I extend heartfelt condolences to John's wife Reba, his children, Randi, John and Michael and his grandchildren.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, is it not ironic that this government, when talking about its so-called new ethics regime, is acting in a most unethical fashion? Describing what it is doing would actually require unparliamentary language. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Liberals keep using the phrase “independent ethics commissioner” and yet the bill explicitly says that when dealing with cabinet ministers, the commissioner will provide private and confidential advice to the Prime Minister. That is the same as the Chrétien plan, and it is rotten to the core. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are hoping that by saying the word “independent” often enough, the people will come to believe it. Sadly, the media is falling for the trap because it has not read the actual wording in the bill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am most displeased. How I wish that this Liberal government would own up to its deception in this matter so that people could judge this plan based on truth rather than on the Liberal spin. To quote the Minister of Finance, “Repeating a falsehood does not make it true”.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I have indicated that tax havens are a threat to the tax base of all industrial countries. There is not a nation in the G-7 and  there is not a nation in the G-20 that is not concerned about tax havens. The finance minister rightfully indicates that this is of concern to Canada. Regretfully, we cannot do this by ourselves.  To have Canada somehow or another live in some splendid isolation is fictional business nonsense.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, if the Minister of Finance is serious this time in his determination to review tax havens, does he intend to apply retroactivity?  If retroactivity was good for allowing the present Prime Minister to avoid paying $100 million in taxes since 1995, it ought to be equally good for recovering what he owes. </p>

	Mr. Speaker, let me repeat for the nth time--and I hope that my English is good enough for my colleague to understand it--that matters  such as budgets, the Speech from the Throne and the bottom line of estimates are matters of confidence and there is no debate about that.  Matters pertaining to each element of the estimates is a purely theoretical question at this time.

	Mr. Speaker, when estimates go to committee, they are examined by parliamentarians from all political parties.  They look at the estimates and they come back with whatever they decide to come back with from these estimates.  Then we have to make a decision as to the final result.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My only point, and I am glad to have the chance again  to say it, is simply once we come to the bottom line of the final estimates, this is a matter of confidence.

	Mr. Speaker, this is indeed a very important file on which we are working hard.  It is a big problem, the trans fats issue.  The new nutrition labelling regulations will indeed require the declaration of trans fats contents on the labels of most prepackaged food by December 12, 2005.  We expect that it will act as a strong incentive to the food industry to reduce or eliminate trans fats from food.  The industry is already moving in that direction.

It rivals tobacco as the most serious public health issue in the country.  A timid and  feckless labelling program will not protect Canadians. It is crazy to put poison in our food and then warn Canadians not to eat it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why will the government not listen to Canadians and ban trans fats?  Could it be that it is afraid of a NAFTA challenge under chapter 11?

We have a great job to do, and the Minister of State for Public Health spends a lot of her time and energy doing a good job at making sure that Canadians remain healthy.  That is the best contribution we can make   through  the health care system, if  Canadians eat better.

Jacques Saada (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons and Minister responsible for Democratic Reform, Lib.): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased today to introduce Motion No. 2, which proposes, and I quote:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right">
</td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>That, during the first thirty sitting days of the present session of Parliament, whenever a minister of the Crown, when proposing a motion for first reading of a public bill, states that the said bill is in the same form as a government bill in the previous session, if the Speaker is satisfied that the said bill is in the same form as the House of Commons had agreed to at prorogation, notwithstanding Standing Order 71, the said bill shall be deemed in the current session to have been considered and approved at all stages completed at the time of the prorogation of the previous session.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are ample precedents for the House of Commons deeming government bills from previous sessions to have been advanced in new sessions to the stages at which they expired at prorogation.</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This approach has been applied for over 30 years in order to avoid wasting parliament's  time and resources. In 1970, 1972 and 1986, the House gave unanimous consent to such motions to reinstate bills. In 1991, 1996, 1999 and as recently as 2002, the House passed a motion similar to that which we are proposing today. Furthermore, it is consistent with practice in the United Kingdom House of Commons.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If our motion is adopted, witnesses will not have to come back to  committees to present their views and briefs all over again. The committees in turn will not have to hear them all over again.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before this procedure was accepted by the House, reintroducing bills that had died on the Order Paper  wasted valuable parliamentary resources and tax dollars since the same debate and the same committee hearings had to be repeated for each bill which needed to be reintroduced. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the financial constraints under which we are operating and for which we should be aware, we feel it is wiser to devote these resources to priority needs in areas such as health care, for instance.</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, this method allowing bills to be reinstated is already part of the House rules governing private members' business. The House Standing Orders stipulate that private members' bills be automatically reinstated after prorogation of the session.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motion we have put before the House does not deal with any one specific bill. It may well be that some ministers have reasons for not reinstating proceedings on their bills that were terminated by prorogation. The motion will apply solely to bills that have been introduced and at least referred to committee, either before or after second reading.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for bills that had only been introduced, but not yet studied in committee during the previous session, they can be reintroduced during the present session. In that case, it could not be said that reintroducing these bills would constitute needless duplication of work and, naturally, a waste of parliamentary resources.</p>


	<A NAME="T1215"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1215"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1220"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1210"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1215)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The procedure will work as follows.  During the first 30 sitting days of the new session, any minister who introduces a bill identical to a bill in the old session,  and which at least had been referred to a committee, will have the right to request that the new bill be reinstated to the stage at which it had progressed at the time of prorogation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The procedure does not oblige a minister to reintroduce a bill.  It merely gives them a new right to do so during a limited period at the beginning of the session.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are important bills from the last session that respond to the needs and interests of Canadians.  For example, there is a need to reinstate Bill C-49, which provides for the electoral boundaries readjustment based on the 2001 national census, to take effect April 1, 2004.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given their growing population, British Columbia and Alberta are each entitled to two additional seats and Ontario to an additional three seats.</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of the action plan on democratic Reform, which I have the honour of leading in this House, the government has promised to reinstate Bill C-34, the legislation to create the office of an Independent Ethics Commissioner and a Senate Ethics Officer, who will report to the House and Senate respectively. We hope that, with the support of our fellow parliamentarians, we can bring this bill into force.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government will reinstate other bills, including Bill C-17, the Public Safety Act, 2002; Bill C-20, an act to amend the Criminal Code (protection of children and other vulnerable persons) and the Canada Evidence Act; Bill C-23, the Sex Offender Information Registration Act; and Bill C-57, Westbank First Nation Self-Government Act.</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As this list shows, the motion serves the interests of the House.  It also serves the interests expressed by the opposition in a number of cases.  For these reasons I do ask for the support of all members.  Perhaps if we can come to a consensus we can adopt this motion today.</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us support this measure, which has been supported many times by all parties of the House. I sincerely hope we can concentrate our efforts and resources on the real issues facing Canadians.</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<A NAME="Int-803327"></A><a HREF="#Int-803337"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-803321"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, CPC): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I want to begin by taking one of the points that was just made at the end of House leader's remarks in introducing this.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said that this motion serves the interests of the House.  There are bills that the government is bringing back that serve the interests of only the Liberal Party.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the bills he talked about had to do with the amendments to the Canada Elections Act and he said  how important it was for Alberta, B.C. and Ontario to get these extra seats. However that bill contains a very undemocratic   provision that does not serve the interests of Canadians, nor does it serve the interests of many members in the House of Commons.  The provision is to  have all the amendments apply on an earlier date.  Rather than comply with the law of Canada and have these amendments take place on August 18, they are trying to bring it back and have the amendment apply on April 1.  They want to ram this bill through the House and  through the Senate in order to call an early election.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The primary purpose of that bill is to undermine and try to derail any ability to organize properly for a federal election; for our political party to get its policy convention and all of its statements in place.  That is why they are trying to do what they are doing today.  That is a very undemocratic measure and we in this place should strongly object to what the government is doing.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister claims to have formed a new government, yet with this motion he is claiming the privileges of being the former government of Jean Chrétien.  He is bringing in everything that the former prime minister failed to get through here.  Procedurally speaking, the Prime Minister wants to be seen, as most Canadians see his government, as the old Chrétien government, and that is exactly what he is doing by his actions today.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we in opposition would agree with that definition, that they are an old government, we will argue that they should come up with their own legislation and portray themselves as new and show Canadians clearly what they stand for.  This will not  happen before April 1 because we will be debating old legislation.  We will not be debating new ideas that the Prime Minister  brings in.  That should be abundantly obvious by what is happening here today.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I accept that there is a well-established practice for government to re-introduce a reinstatement motion in a new session, however it has not been established that a so-called new government in a new session can reinstate bills from the previous government.  If this government claims to be new, what it is  doing would  definitely disprove that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have examined all the precedents and I could not find one example of a new government reinstating bills from a previous session.  From <i>Journals</i> of October 21, 1970, at page 46, it was recorded that the House adopted a reinstatement motion.  The prime minister was Pierre Trudeau and the motion reinstated bills of Mr. Trudeau's government from the previous session.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On May 9, 1972, at page 281 of <i>Journals</i>, we have another motion adopted and, once again, Pierre Trudeau  being the prime minister in that session  and the previous session.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On March 8, 1974, pages 25 and 26, there was a reinstatement motion that was adopted.  It was the same circumstances as May 9, 1972.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October  3, 1986, at pages 47 and 48, Mr. Mulroney's government introduced a reinstatement motion reinstating bills of the Mulroney government from the previous session.  However  it was the same government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On March 4, 1996, at pages 34 and 35, and 39 to 41 of the <i>Journals</i>, Jean Chrétien's government reinstated government bills of the Chrétien government from the previous session.</p>


	<A NAME="T1220"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1220"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1225"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1215"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1220)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we had November 12, 2003 and the government of Jean Chrétien once again successfully reinstating bills from a previous session, although he ran into a bit of a problem with his attempt to reinstate other business resulting in a Speaker's ruling that divided the motion into three parts.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many arguments have been made against the practice whereby a prime minister reinstates his government bills from a previous session. It goes against the practice, consequences and reasons for a government to prorogue. It contradicts the notion of beginning a session with fresh ideas and a new direction. It contradicts the idea that a new government should have new legislation and bring in new ideas that we can debate.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the Prime Minister not do what a new government should do because he does not want Canadians to know what he stands for? Does he want to keep us guessing, making one statement one day and a different statement another day, backtracking on all kinds of things, and not introducing some meaningful legislation for us to debate that would indicate the direction his government is going to go? Is that the reason we do not have new legislation introduced?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we are talking about here today is far worse than what I have been saying, I would argue procedurally unacceptable. The current Prime Minister is attempting to reinstate bills of another prime minister from a previous session and has the audacity to call this a new government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Prime Minister promised democratic reform and made a commitment to do things differently, we thought he meant to improve how Parliament functions. So far the Prime Minister has behaved less democratically than his predecessors, something most of us thought would be impossible but it is happening before our eyes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You know very well, Mr. Speaker,  that I have been dealing with the Firearms Act for nigh on 10 years. Back in 1994 I began tracking a piece of legislation that I thought would long since be gone.  However, now this Prime Minister is using a tactic that the previous prime minister used in keeping that legislation in place. He has stated quite clearly that this is not going to be a free vote in Parliament. He has stated quite clearly that this vote on the gun registry funding will be a vote on confidence in his government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can a new Prime Minister, who says that all his legislation and all his programs will pass seven tests before they will be continued, reintroduce a whole bunch of bills? How can he continue with a Firearms Act that breaks all seven of those tests that he has put forward? They are good tests. Do not get me wrong. I agree with him. I believe all legislation should be put that way.  However, why bring in the tests if at the first opportunity they have to test them and put something before them, say “except for the Firearms Act”, but it will apply to all other legislation and programs before the House? Obviously democracy is not operating the way we have been given the impression it should operate.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On May 12 and May 16, 2003, a former government House leader raised the issue of parliamentary privilege, exempting members from being called as witnesses in any court. I raised this earlier with you, Mr. Speaker. The issue raised in that case was whether the prime minister could claim parliamentary privilege to provide legal protection, and I went through a whole bunch of arguments. Let me read at this point the ruling from the Canadian Court of Appeal.  It stated:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right">
</td>
<td><small>--the parliamentary privilege of a Member of Parliament not to attend as a witness in a civil action applies throughout a session of Parliament, and extends 40 days after the prorogation or dissolution of Parliament and 40 days before the commencement of a new session.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That clearly is just being disregarded in this case.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would just like to go through some of the bills that we would like to exclude from this reinstatement, for example, Bill C-7, an act respecting leadership selection, administration and accountability of Indian bands and to make related amendments to other acts. We would like to see that bill not included.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As well,  we would like to see Bill C-19, an act respecting leadership selection, administration and accountability of Indian bands and to make related amendments to other acts,  excluded.</p>


	<A NAME="T1225"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1225"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1230"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1220"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1225)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would like to see Bill C-20, an act to amend the Criminal Code (protection of children and other vulnerable persons) and the Canada Evidence Act, excluded from this list.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-22, an act to amend the Divorce Act, the Family Orders and Agreements Enforcements Act, the Garnishment, Attachment and Pension Diversion Act and the Judges Act and to amend other acts in consequence, we do not want included.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we have Bill C-26, an act to amend the Canada Transportation Act and the Railway Safety Act, to enact the VIA Rail Canada Act and to make consequential amendments to other acts.  We would like that excluded.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-38, an act to amend the contraventions Act and the controlled drugs and substances act, should be excluded.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we have in the Senate Bill C-13, the human reproductive technologies act.  Canadians have huge concerns with that.  That is something that should not be reinstated clearly.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-34 is an act to amend the Parliament of Canada Act.  That provides for an ethics commissioner, a Senate ethics officer and other acts in consequence. This Prime Minister has made a lot of to-do about that bill.  He talks about the need for an ethics commissioner and then the previous government brings forth legislation that applies to only backbench MPs and does not apply to the cabinet.  The problems that we have observed here in Ottawa do not pertain to backbench MPs.  They pertain to those who have the responsibility in the cabinet.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have Bill C-35, an act to amend the National Defence Act (remuneration of military judges).  It should not be brought back.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-36 is an act to establish the Library and Archives of Canada, to amend the Copyright Act and to amend certain other acts in consequence.  We have huge concerns with all of these.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to these, I would like to propose an amendment.    I move:</p>

	Mr. Speaker, introducing new bills into the House and the Senate after prorogation is a serious issue.  We must look at what was done with some of these pieces of legislation in the last Parliament. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One particular piece of legislation that I am very concerned with is Bill C-13.  We had an unbelievable debate in the House on this.  We sat in the chamber and voted on Bill C-13 dealing with reproductive technology for over two and half to three hours one evening.  The bill was originally brought into the House at the beginning of the 37th Parliament as Bill C-56.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, if we go to the history of where the bill came from, it actually died on the Order Paper   as Bill C-47 in 1997.  The bill was initiated by a royal commission in the early part of the last decade.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not that we should not have this legislation.  In fact there is no question that such legislation is long overdue.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now talk a bit about the history the legislation.  It is very important to understand its history in order to discern whether we should at this time be bringing it back after prorogation and just before an election.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would not argue that we do not need the legislation.  In fact I argued long and hard for the need to have it.  Science is far ahead of the legislation on which we are presently working.   Nevertheless, this legislation is flawed in many serious ways.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In committee we aggressively dealt with it.  There were at least 100 amendments that we wanted to make to the legislation prior to it leaving committee.  There was very tight voting on it.  It pricks the conscience of every Canadian.  All members who listened to the testimony at committee were very much involved in the debate.  There is an emotional level that this subject brings to the conscience of most Canadians, especially committee members.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason I am talking about the legislation is because we worked on it for a long time as a Parliament.  However, at the beginning of the 37th Parliament, the minister of health decided to bring a piece of legislation in and treat it somewhat differently in the House of Commons.  It went directly to committee.  That was the first piece of legislation of its kind that would go directly to committee, instead of going to the House of Commons for first and second reading and then to committee.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a very non-partisan way we brought the best witnesses from across the country and around the world to give us their wisdom and present their testimony before committee.   Then we would be able to discern how we wanted to draft and craft a bill reflecting the views of Canadians.  We wanted this legislation to be the best in the world.  That was the intent of the committee at the time.  It was something on which we worked quite aggressively.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The committee listened to well over 150 witnesses.  We sounded some of the pieces of information that came forward from some of the brightest minds in the world on the subject.  The committee had international witnesses and we reviewed their legislation. The committee reviewed what was in the draft legislation.  We worked very hard, openly and in a non-partisan fashion on the legislation.  It was an exciting opportunity.  As a new member of Parliament, it was my first experience on committee.  I thought this was the way it should be done.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been here three years now and  I realize that is not quite the way most committees work.  My first awakening on that committee was at the very end of the sitting.   For nine months we worked very hard on  legislation that was very sensitive, and in a very non-partisan way.     The most profound piece in the legislation was whether we should be able to destroy the human embryo or embryonic stem cell for research purposes.  The committee was almost unanimously against this because of the witnesses and testimony which had  come forward over the nine months.</p>


	<A NAME="T1235"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1235"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1240"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1230"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1235)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will never forget what happened, because at the last minute, at the eleventh hour, the minister cracked the whip and these individuals I trusted on the other side in committee--because of the witnesses and some of the testimony and some of the things they had said--changed their views 180° on whether to allow embryonic stem cells or not.  I could not believe that on an issue such as this they would change their minds and yet that is what happened at that time. I believe it was the wrong decision in so many ways.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We asked to be shown why stem cells were needed.  We asked why as a nation we should go to the place where human life would be destroyed for the sake of others.  The science is not there.  Scientists said they were needed because stem cells from embryos are more elastic and therefore they might be capable of being triggered to grow into any organ of the body.  I challenged them by asking them to show us in animal embryos where that was a possibility.  If it is a possibility then maybe we should go there even though it would be difficult for many Canadians to destroy human life for the sake of others.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps there would be some scientific validity to it if we want to change the ethic from where we protect human life from beginning to end, which has been a fundamental principle for Canadians for as long as Canada has been a nation.  The legislation would change that ethic to “for the greater good of society”, which would change the ethic from protecting human life regardless of the cost.  We should do the math and see whether we should proceed or not, and if it is for the greater good rather than the negative, then perhaps the math will be the guiding principle. If this becomes just about math, then we are on a very slippery slope in this nation.  Not only will we be destroying human embryos, but as health dollars become precious in the upcoming years, we will be going to the place where we will perhaps be making decisions as to whether or not grandma should have hip surgery or heart surgery, or whether we look after comatose patients or the physically and mentally challenged individuals in our society. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These kinds of decisions will be made if we allow ourselves to be controlled by just the ethic of math rather than the ethic of protecting human life regardless of how fragile it is.  This what I very much fear more than anything else in this piece of legislation: where it  will vault us.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is really amazing to me that when we went through all of this in committee  we had agreement at that stage.   We said we would put out a committee report reflecting our views.  It was a very difficult time at that stage.  The report had to be worded in such a way that it would not be exploited and would not take us down that path, because the legislation we were looking said that research should be done if it was deemed necessary. But necessary was not defined, and if we do not define necessary it means that whatever somebody thinks is necessary is obviously necessary.  We thought we should put in the wording “only if no other biological material could be found” to do that kind of research; we thought perhaps that was the time we should consider it. We agreed on that wording collectively in committee and that wording was put forward   in our recommendations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Committee members said that we should hold off, as my party has said,  for at least three years and put a moratorium on embryonic stem cell research while the science proved to us as a nation that it was the way to go.  We are not there yet.  The science is not there yet. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, science is showing us that we could achieve much more promise in adult stem cells.  In committee, that was our question to the scientists. We asked the scientists why adult stem cells could not be used. They said they could not be triggered into growing into any organ of the body.  That has been proven wrong, actually, in the time that we have been working on this piece of legislation.   A scientist in Minnesota has come forward to say that stem cells can be taken from bone marrow and triggered into growing into any organ of the body and then we can do the same kind of research that we wanted embryonic stem cells for.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem with embryonic stem cells, according to the research and science behind this, is that they are so elastic  they cannot be triggered into growing into the appropriate organ.  That is not the problem with adult stem cells. I am not a scientist, but I have been told by scientists that when adult stem cells are being grown they can be triggered into growing into the organ that scientists want them to grow into. There is much more promise on the adult stem cell side than there is on the embryonic cell side. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should be very cautious of being led down the garden path in the sense of allowing us to do the research that is morally repugnant and goes against the morals that Canada and Canadians have had for generations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. member:</b> To some people, not to everyone.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Rob Merrifield:</b> My colleague says some.  As long as my colleague has been a Canadian, I can say that the ethic in Canada has been to respect human life from beginning to end, regardless of how fragile it is.  That is a Canadian principle and a Canadian value that we had better cherish, because if we do not cherish and protect it we will lose it. We had better be very careful of that. Also, if we can achieve the same thing by doing it through the means of adult stem cells, that is where we should be going. This piece of legislation vaults us into that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to the legislation we are dealing with and what has actually been happening at committee, we have many other problems with a piece of legislation that was flawed, the one that is now in the Senate, if this goes through today. We have a serious problem with it because there were a hundred different amendments that we wanted to tighten up.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other and most important part of this legislation is the agency  that will be struck to determine what science goes forward and what does not. This agency has no accountability.  In fact, there is a clause in the bill which says specifically that the Minister of Health can dictate to that agency what will be approved or not approved. The agency has no recourse but must follow the instruction of the Minister of Health. That is not transparency.  That is not accountability. It is not reflective of  being accountable to this chamber and, by being responsible to this chamber, to the people of Canada. If this agency that is being struck does not garner the support and confidence of Canadians, it will ultimately fail.  We should be very careful to make sure we put parameters around the agency to ensure that accountability is there.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are numbers of other different things in the legislation that we are very concerned about.   Donor anonymity is of great concern to a number of people.   Really the bill was not about embryonic stem cell research necessarily, it was about building families. It was about putting  some parameters around the reproduction part of the fertility clinics that are trying to have young couples conceive children when they are having difficulty doing so.  That is very noble.  In fact, our report reflected that. We said we should change the name of the report from “all about science” and we should say  what it is about.  It is all about building families. We named our report “Building Families”, because that is what it should be.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in building families, who is going to protect the interests of the unborn child if not our committee and if not this legislation?  We have said that the right of the child should supersede the right of those who are donating the egg or the sperm.  I think that is just a principle that should be there. If we do not fight for the right of these children to know where they come from, no one will.   That is something that was debated at committee at length with all kinds of individuals.  I remember very clearly a  beautiful, young, 19 year old lady who came to our committee and said she did not know who her father was.  When she walks down the streets she looks at every man and wonders who is her father.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no parameters in this country about how many times one can even donate sperm. There are no limits on it; it is uncontrolled as it presently is.  There is no   way in this piece of legislation that we either limit the number or determine how the individual who is conceived and born out of this is to  know their biological makeup.  We do not believe there should be any liability that follows this. Just the knowledge of who someone is biologically, I think, is a fundamental of human life and is something that the child should know.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea of surrogacy in this legislation, the idea of renting a womb to be able to conceive a child, is something we find repugnant in the sense that if someone believes they want to help an individual conceive a child, then it should be done from the most altruistic motives, not because someone wants to make a buck.  This piece of legislation can vault us into that  because it allows for the payment for surrogacy. If we allow for the payment for that, even so much as to pay the individual for their lost salary during the time they are away having the child, we are saying that is a problem.  We are strongly against that and see it as something that should not be taking place.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we come to the whole idea of cloning.  It is interesting that when we talk about cloning and we look at this piece of legislation, a lot of times we say that maybe this should be called the cloning bill.  In some ways it should. Because the bill should be split right down the middle.  We said that right from the very beginning.  It has two tracks.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One is to deal with the prohibitions, things that as a nation and in this House we would collectively in a minute say that we should not allow: human and therapeutic cloning,    germ line alteration,   and chimera hybrids, which are animal-human combinations of creating life.  Those we find repugnant.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason that cloning is so repugnant is  that one out of 200 to 300 are actually born alive and healthy.  If  we remember, Dolly the sheep was born out of cloning technology, but it takes 300 Dollys before we get one.  Even Dolly the sheep was found out to be aging prematurely and therefore had faults.  But there were another 300 that never made it, that were born handicapped, mentally retarded or whatever.  I do not mean that sheep are mentally retarded, but I am saying that if  we translate what we know of sheep   to humans  we are going to have a serious problem. It is repugnant to do this.  Most of the nations around the world are saying that we should not go there.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I find astounding on the whole idea of human cloning is that I do not know many nations in the world that say that human cloning should be allowed, but I do know that in the United Nations  this fall there was a debate on this same issue of human cloning and   whether we should we do something internationally to either allow it or not allow it.  There were actually three motions   put forward at the United Nations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One motion coming from Costa Rica, which had garnered the support of 60-plus countries,   would ban human and therapeutic cloning and would reflect our own bill, the one before us.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened at the UN was really interesting. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another motion  came forward out of Belgium, which had garnered the support of about a dozen countries.  It said we should ban just reproductive cloning, but not therapeutic, which would not reflect the bill that is before our committee and the bill that is now in the Senate. It is interesting that Canada originally supported Belgium, which went against its domestic position, if that is in truth what  its position is actually going to be under this bill. That is what would reflect the bill.   They said no, that we should not; they supported the Belgian one.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another motion that came forward was the first motion voted on.  It  was out of some of the Arab countries and said, “Hold it, this is a little bit complex. Why do we not just put it off for two years?” It is interesting  that when  it came to a vote at the United Nations, Canada refused to vote on it.  Canada abstained from the vote.  Because of that, it was a tie vote and we lost it.  It was to put it off for two years.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is unbelievable that we would not stand on the principle of supporting the actual domestic position   on the international stage.    Canada should hang its head  because of what we have done internationally and for the message   we are sending internationally on this issue.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is unbelievable how complex this piece of legislation is. When  one talks to individuals on the street and   says  this is a bill on reproductive technologies and  starts getting into the issues, people's eyes glaze over. It is very complex.  Even those who were on the committee  and listened to all the witnesses were just nicely getting into it and understanding the complexity of the legislation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am trying to boil it down in as close to layman's terms as I possibly can get and explain it as simply as I can so that this House and those who are watching will understand what this legislation would actually do to us as a country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At one stage, I even went to you, Mr. Speaker, and asked for an emergency debate on this.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At another stage, I thought maybe the thing to do was to bring forward a motion at committee to split this piece of legislation, because that is indeed what we should be doing. If we  were to take the two lines I said earlier that we should be working on, one on the prohibitions and the other on the regulatory side of it, and if we brought forward a piece of legislation on just the prohibitions, it would pass in the blink of an eye. In fact, I have said that it would pass faster than the raising of salaries of members of Parliament did in this House, which took 72 hours.  I think that is what we should be doing.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should be splitting this piece of legislation as fast as we possibly can and bring that forward. In light of that, I think the bill that is now coming back after  prorogation and going to the Senate should be stopped. We should not go forward with it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am wondering what to do. I sent a letter to the Senate and I am truly hoping that the Senate will do the right thing by giving this a sober second thought. I talked to Senator Kirby and members of his committee. I am hoping that they will do the right thing and not just rush this bill through before the election, but truly give it  sober second thought. It is extremely important that we do that. It is extremely important that they actually have a free vote on this  in the Senate, not like was done here.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though it was not a free vote, there were many members on the other side who voted against this piece of legislation because of its volatility and what it will do to us as a country. It is very important that we split the bill, that  we stop this one,  and we bring another piece forward to put the limitations on it. </p>

	Mr. Speaker, I listened carefully to the speech made by the hon. member and, indeed, it is very surprising to find ourselves in the current situation. The government is not at the beginning of a mandate. Last fall, it changed leader, but it had known about this change for a year.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people were supposed to be ready to govern and to propose new ideas and approaches. Now, we are caught in a bind. We feel that we are being pressured by the government to pass these bills. Last fall, this legislation was not that urgent, since the House recessed. Now, we are back and we realize that the government wants to reintroduce the same bills. In some cases, this is acceptable, but in other cases it is unacceptable. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to put a question to the hon. member who tabled an amendment to the amendment to Bill C-49, which seeks to move up the effective date of the representation order of 2003.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does this not defeat, to some extent, the purpose of the Canada Elections Act, which should be implemented as objectively as possible and which provides for a one year delay between the time when commissions make a decision on the effective date of the electoral map and the time when an election can be called? </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government introduced a very partisan bill to please the new Prime Minister and allow him to call an election in April 2004 when normally an election should not be called before the fall of 2004. This means that the election will take place six months earlier than it should. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is this not in fact unacceptable? Would it not be best to not  debate the bill introduced by the government in the House and implement the elections act as initially planned?  </p>

	Mr. Speaker, when it comes to the electoral boundaries act, it is really quite interesting.  Every 10 years we have to mandate it.  We   look at whether the population has increased or decreased and boundaries shift significantly. That is what has happened now.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not have a problem with that necessarily.  This is something that is good.  It helps with democracy.  It helps with making sure that some ridings do not get too many individuals  in them, where one member in the House would have  a disproportionate number of people than another. I think that is very appropriate, but  that is all in place.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The population of Canada has increased and this time I think another seven seats  are being proposed under the new piece of  legislation. As the boundaries are shifted around, there will be another seven seats in the House. We do not have a problem with that.  The deadline was set out.  It was there.  We do not see any need whatsoever for the changing of that date to be moved forward to April.   </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why put this legislation in place because of electoral expediency and because of  the government's agenda to rush to the polls? That is playing politics with the will of the population. That is very unacceptable and it is inappropriate that we do so.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The democratic process is set.  We have always said in our party that the day we win an election is the day we should call an election so we are not playing this silly game.  Now we are moving the date up from some time in July or August to April 1.  I am saying that is absolutely ridiculous that we move that date up.  For what?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a government that should govern for a while.  Let us let it govern for a while and then go to the polls. Let us see if Canadians will respect the Liberals' wish and re-elect them  as the governing party of the nation.  To go before it has a chance and to bring forward legislation and to ram it through is  absolutely repugnant. It goes against any kind of democratic deficit rhetoric that we have heard in the last few days by the government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is something the government is going to have to wear as we go into the election and it tries to jam the election down the throats of Canadians.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I am somewhat confused by the member's last answer and the speech by the member for Yorkton--Melville who preceded him. I understood them to say that the legislation which is being reintroduced by us into the House at this time should not be reintroduced, that it is some sort of extraordinary thing that we are bringing back legislation that was on the Order Paper in the fall and which was incomplete.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the hon. member, quite rightly I thought, engaged in a thoughtful presentation of his views about Bill C-49 which is an important piece of legislation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question I have to ask him is, does he agree with his colleague the member for Yorkton--Melville that we should not be proceeding with this legislation, that we should not be reintroducing important bills, that we should not be reintroducing the electoral act?  What does he think we should do, just start over completely and have nothing to do with previous governing issues which the country has to deal with that remained uncompleted in the last session  when we were sitting?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me the government is proceeding in a very important and very logical fashion.  We had much legislation which members of the House had been wrestling with. Bill C-49 is an example and there are others. We naturally reintroduce them into the House to allow members to debate them, to discuss them. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To take the attitude that this is some bizarre position being taken by the government I just do not understand. I leave it with you, Mr. Speaker, and with the hon. member that the elections act which gives to many citizens of our country an opportunity to participate in new electoral boundaries and new constituencies is very important. If in fact it can be reintroduced and enabled to come into effect earlier rather than later, I would have said that it is in the interests of those citizens who have the right to have constituency boundaries and  constituencies that are more representative for them.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, let us be very clear about this.  The interest in  that piece of legislation coming forward early is certainly not for Canadians.  It is only for that party over there.  It is unfortunate it plays that kind of game.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the Liberal Party of Canada playing games.  It says it is different, that it is new and improved.  I would say that it is the same old rhetoric. The Liberals were the ones who prorogued for no reason.  They should have got busy with the governing of the nation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had a Prime Minister who took an extended holiday away from the House and now we will go for a few weeks and have a big break in March and then supposedly go right to the polls.  That is the rumoured agenda.  We should not be doing that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should be governing the country and then let us go to the polls once Canadians have an opportunity to really judge whether the Liberals  are up to the task or not.  There are a number of reasons that  we would say they are not.  Driving some of this legislation forward is certainly a reason that  nothing has changed.  It is not a new and improved party.  It is the same old rhetoric, same old faces. Canadians can expect  the  same old problems from the government.  It is unfortunate because  a golden opportunity has been missed  to really lead the country the way it should be led.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, if we are going to deal with the  democratic deficit, we have to reform the system.  It just seems to be so obvious that one measure that should be in place is that the date of the election should be legislated. That is so basic.  It should not be something left for gerrymandering or for political insiders to time the market and call the election when they think it is best for them.  In a democracy it should be legislated.  Many democracies have that.  We are way behind the eight ball on that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What would my learned friend have to say about legislating the date of elections rather than  leaving it to backroom politicians to pick the most convenient time for an election?</p>


	<A NAME="Int-803373"></A><a HREF="#Int-803375"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-803368"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Rob Merrifield: </b>

	Mr. Speaker,  our system comes  out of the British parliamentary system and we sort of formed a history of the Canadian government under some of the rules from there and  are hybrids of them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other nations have had other rules.  Australia is an example of a British Commonwealth country that has hybrids of the British parliamentary system.  I would say that the Australian  parliamentary system is much more reflective of a democracy.  Some of the changes  there are much better than we have.  We could learn a lot from the Australian model.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The United States has a four year term. Everyone knows exactly when the election is in the United States.  In other democratic countries and free countries around the world, they get around this idea that it is up to the prime minister, or actually a prime minister's wife, to call an election.  That is absolutely ridiculous.  It is nonsense.  This is about governing the country and we should stop the partisan politics of it and try to stop the opportunity for one party to get the upper hand because of the economy, employment rates and manipulation of events as to whether that party thinks it is  going to be a good winter or bad winter as far as the economy goes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is something we should get around.  There is absolutely no question that we should have legislation in place so that everyone in Canada knows the date and time of the election at the beginning of the term of a new government.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, to begin with, since this is my first chance to speak in 2004, I would like to take advantage of this opportunity to wish you, and all the people of Argenteuil—Papineau—Mirabel I have not had a chance to see over the holiday season, as well as all the people of Quebec, and all the people of Canada, a very happy, healthy and fulfilling 2004.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today I am fortunate to be able to discuss the government motion to reinstate bills. I say fortunate, but it is not an easy task, given the situation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am going to try to explain to Quebeckers and Canadians the approach the government is taking to reinstate bills that ought to have been passed in the last session.  It is simple.  Why are we obliged to have such a motion to reinstate bills?  Quite simply because the government, when Mr. Chrétien was in charge, decided in November to prorogue the House and end parliamentary debate.  Why?  Because there was a new leader of the Liberal Party, a new Prime Minister waiting in the wings. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision was made to prorogue because they were thinking that perhaps some outsiders might want to join their group, or who knows what else they had in mind.  All we know is that we MPs have been unable to engage in any debate in this House since November 2003.  We resumed only on Monday of this week. So, for close to three months, members have been unable to debate bills some considered important.  The proof of this is that the government now wants to reinstate them on the Order Paper and in the debates of this House.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, if they were all that important, why did they  prorogue the House, when here we are back today with the same members as before.  Some have played musical chairs, but there have not been any changes.  It is still the same good old group of Liberals  running this government. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They made quite a to-do about it.  Debates adjourned, members were all sent home, then three months later, this week, today,  along they come with a motion aimed at resuming debate on bills we should have debated in the last session, bills that ought surely to  have passed. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that is where we have a problem. The public does not know all that we members of Parliament have to go through. We are here to serve the interests of our constituents, to be present in the House and to debate bills. That is why the people elect us. We are here to represent them and to pass laws to improve the lot of the people of Quebec. That is how the people express themselves; that is democracy. The people send their representatives here to defend  their interests and discuss improvements to legislation, to make it more reasonable.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, we are debating, discussing and dithering about bills that ought to have been passed in November. That is a very important point in this debate. When bills are reinstated on the Order Paper, the government is very careful to say that it does not want all the bills reinstated, even though some have been tabled. Obviously, this is a question of timing. It was necessary to prorogue the House in November, not to have any debate by the members on these bills, and not to resume sitting until February, and to top it off, we have a Prime Minister who had decided, even before he became leader of the Liberal Party, that there would be an election in April.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, he was using the House to introduce his bills in September and October, so he could hold an election in April. Among those bills is C-49, on electoral boundaries readjustment. I dare say there was only one non-partisan process in this House and that was the Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Act. Every 10 years, the electoral boundaries are readjusted. That legislation is drafted in such a way that the new electoral boundaries take effect one year after the  proclamation of the act.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the instance before us, the date was August 26, 2003, in accordance with the act that was passed in previous sessions of Parliament, by other hon. members who sat in this House before me, and whom I respect. That is democracy. Other hon. members in this House passed a non-partisan law that says that the electoral boundaries will change every 10 years because the population changes, for one thing. The act is constructed so that there can be no partisan use made of it by any party, particularly the party in power, which, right now, is the Liberal Party. This law must not be used for political purposes.</p>


	<A NAME="T1310"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1310"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1315"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1305"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1310)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister, former finance minister, decided to do the opposite of everything that had been passed by other parliamentarians before us in this House. He decided to amend the electoral boundaries legislation so that it would come into effect before the intended one year had elapsed. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the hard reality. We end up with Bill C-49 that the government would like reinstated since it is on the list the government leader  submitted and read earlier. This bill is entitled an act respecting the effective date of the representation order of 2003. It is straightforward. Rather than take effect on August 26, 2004, this legislation will take effect on April 1.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will have certain consequences. Legislation was passed and it was non-partisan. In this case, if an election is held in the spring, the application of the new electoral map effective April 1 will penalize Quebec. Before the redistribution, Quebec had 75 ridings out of 301 and now it will have 75 out of 308. That is the cold hard reality.<sup></sup></p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Legislation was passed by other parliamentarians present in this House before us. They had decided that in order to avoid partisanship, the new electoral map would come into effect one year after the order.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government, the Prime Minister and former finance minister, were well aware that if he wanted to use the new electoral map, he would have to wait until after August 26, 2004 to call an election. He did not do that. He decided to use his power, the power of the Liberal members in this House, to pass legislation to move up the effective date of the electoral map. If an election is held between April and August, this would effectively reduce Quebec's political weight in the next Parliament. That is the reality.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister goes around with new candidates whom he introduces to us as proof that Quebec will have increasingly greater influence and a role to play in Canada. Yet, the first bill he passes will reduce the percentage of members from Quebec in this House compared to the rest of Canada, if an election is called in the spring. Our political strength will go from 25% to 24%. That is the simple reality.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will come as no surprise that the Bloc Quebecois opposes the effective date of this legislation. We agree with the legislation adopted. If the government wants to use an amended electoral map, it will have to call an election after August 26, 2004. It is as simple as that. We are prepared to play according to the rules of democracy and the legislation in force in this Parliament when the Bloc Quebecois arrived. It is no more complicated than that. We do not want to change anything, we simply want to play the game. That is why we were elected.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the saying goes, people have to run with the pack. That is what the BQ is doing: we are running with the pack. Unfortunately, some people decide to use things to their own advantage and to tamper with the legislation so as to organize their own election. That is what the Prime Minister, the former finance minister, did. He tried to use the legislation so as to be able to hold an election using a new electoral map, under which he would have greater influence in Ontario and other Canadian provinces. That is his choice; he is the one who made that decision.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it is understandable if we do not agree. It is even more vile when various changes are appended to the legislation and the redistribution of the electoral map. For example, there are changes to the riding names.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This affects me personally. The representatives of the chief electoral officer, who conducted detailed studies and visited the ridings, came to change the name of Argenteuil—Papineau—Mirabel to Trois-Seigneuries, a name all the local stakeholders objected to.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We decided to contest it. It was a simple request: let my riding keep the name Argenteuil—Papineau—Mirabel since the neighbouring riding on the opposite side of the river in Ontario, Glengarry—Prescott—Russell, had retained its name. It was entitled to three names.</p>


	<A NAME="T1315"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1315"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1320"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1310"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1315)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For us on the west side, or the other side of the river, the chief electoral officer had decided there would not be three. There would be only two names for my riding, Argenteuil—Mirabel, and the name Papineau would be dropped.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who know a little about history, whether of Quebec or even Canada, know that Louis-Joseph Papineau held a seat in the federal Parliament and made speeches there. History buffs also know that  Louis-Joseph Papineau was seigneur of the Petite Nation and leader of the Parti Patriote.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the RCMs that is in my riding in its entirety is the Papineau RCM. Indeed there are three full RCMs and a few partial ones. Nevertheless, the RCMs of Mirabel, Argenteuil and Papineau are in my riding in their entirety.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was perfectly normal for the name of the riding to reflect the geopolitical and geographic reality. Since the government had hauled out its steamroller and decided to move up the implementation date for the new electoral map, which also changed the names, we as parliamentarians requested that the name Papineau be reinstated with Argenteuil and Mirabel. This request was granted. It was called Bill C-53.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was not alone. There were other members in this Parliament who found that  the names of the ridings did not reflect the geopolitical reality or did not represent what the public wanted.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some 38 MPs managed to get authorization from this Parliament. A bill to this effect was passed and received approval from this House after being read three times and sent to the Senate. It was tied up along with other bills, including Bill C-49 for which the Conservative Party of Canada put forward an amendment earlier.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But these bills ended up paralyzed by prorogation. Today we are told—and I am most surprised to hear it from the leader—that the list of bills to be reinstated does not include Bill C-53, which changes the names of certain electoral districts. I am totally thunderstruck.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They can change the effective date of the representation order, but not reinstate Bill C-53.  We think they will bring it back, but the name change cannot be done before April 1.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberal government is talking about taking part in star wars, about contributing to a Mars project, yet is incapable, in three months, of changing 38 names on the electoral map and on the files of the chief electoral officer. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is something aberrant and incomprehensible  about this in the eyes of the public.  The reality is that the government chooses what suits it.  It is as simple as that.  What does not suit it will not get through this House. And at the present time, it does not suit the Liberal Party to have the names of 38 ridings changed before the next election. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not want to hear from a delegation headed by   the government House leader that the  chief electoral officer could not have done this before the next election.  If he cannot, let them get a new chief electoral officer.  It is as simple as that.  And let the new chief Electoral officer be mandated to change the 38 names of electoral districts, 38 out of 308.   This is not such a big deal, not such a major upheaval, when we know how things can be done nowadays by computer.  That is the reality.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again, they are going to try to get 38 ridings to swallow that.  Why is this bill not passed?  It is quite simply a matter of time.   Today is February 6, and obviously there is likely to be an election call in early April, as soon as the law allows, because if C-49 is passed as the government wants, the new map will take effect on April 1.  So the Prime Minister cannot call an election before that.   Once that is done, there will be an election call in the early days of April.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A budget will be brought down soon, which means that there will be discussions on the budget. We just had a throne speech which, by the way, was monotonously boring, as redundant as that may sound, so much so that even the media did not pay any attention to it. Therefore, the government must hurry to present its budget to try to have something that people will be interested in.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I read in some newspapers that should the new budget not be well received by the public, the government would consider postponing the date of the election. This is how things work. </p>


	<A NAME="T1320"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1320"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1325"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1315"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1320)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. member:</b> It will be postponed. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Mario Laframboise:</b> That is right. It is ridiculous. The government is using all of its ammunition, one round at a time. That is what it is doing, and it is not working. The throne speech was supposed to make a lot of noise all across Canada, but that has not been the case at all.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, the next round will be the budget. There is fear that it will not be well received by the public, which will most certainly be the case. It is very simple, the government has increasingly less money. It can no longer bleed, if I may use that term, the unemployed. It dipped enough into the employment insurance fund that it does not dare do it again. That is why it is getting poorer and poorer.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must invest in the armed forces because it promised our neighbour, Mr. Bush, that he could count on us. This investment in our armed forces will eat up a good part of the budget. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why it made what was supposed to be a revolutionary announcement to municipalities: it announced a GST rebate. They were already entitled to a 57% rebate, and the government is increasing that rebate to 100%, telling them that there will be a new deal with municipalities. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why not have a deal right now? Why is there not a strategic infrastructure program for all rural and urban equipment? Why is the tax on gas not shared? The answer is simple: it is because there will be no money in the upcoming budget.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us stop dreaming. The mayors and city councillors, who are former colleagues of mine, must stop thinking that they will get money from this government. Municipalities have received whatever money they were going to get this year. The rest will have to wait until after the election. In the meantime, the government will make promises. I have heard a lot of promises. I have not been in federal politics for a long time, but I sure heard a lot of promises during the last election campaign.   </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard promises about highway 50, in the Outaouais region,  and about Mirabel. Earlier, during oral question period, I had the opportunity to explain what is happening with Mirabel. Air Transat will move its operations from Mirabel to Dorval, which means that 500 jobs will be lost.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such is the policy of the Liberal government. It is a simple policy that consists in emptying the regions and putting all the political weight in the cities. Such is the reality. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intent behind the changes made to the new electoral map is simple. The government is transferring the political weight to urban centres. It does not take into account the size of an area, and it does not rely on fairness to ensure the provision of uniform services across Quebec and Canada. Instead, the government takes into account the size of the population. Since there is an increasing number of people living in urban centres, the political weight is being transferred to cities. It is cities, large urban centres, that will control things. Imagine what it will be like if, in addition to its provincial counterparts, the federal government invites to the table the mayors of Canada's large cities. All the political weight will be transferred to the large urban centres, and the rural regions of the country will be left out in the cold.   </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Quebec, the notion of development includes the regions. How can we have head offices of multinational corporations that make money with paper  mills and mines if we do not have jobs created by these paper mill, forestry and mining operations? This is the reality.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The political weight is being drained away. That is why the Bloc Quebecois is opposed to Bill C-49. We are opposed to the political weight of Quebec's  rural regions being transferred to the cities. That is the situation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of having 75 ridings in Quebec, the Bloc Quebecois has proposed to have 77, so that the rural areas could maintain a reasonable weight in comparison to the urban areas, so that all citizens who pay taxes would be entitled to the same services, no matter where they live. It is that simple. Because we pay taxes whether we live in a village, a town, a small city or a large one, we are entitled to the same services. That is fair. That is why we pay our taxes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is not what the government is doing today. The government is trying to ram through a motion to reinstate legislation. Nevertheless, I repeat, it does not include all bills and acts, but only those the government wants to pass for its own electoral purposes, because it is going to call an election as of the first week of April.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us not be fooled. I hope that Quebeckers will not be fooled in the next election and will understand that everything  the Liberals do, they do for the Liberals and not for the people.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I really appreciate the question from the Conservative member as to why the leader of the Liberal Party, the Prime Minister, would  choose to call an election in the spring.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is simply a question of political strategy. As you know, it is a tradition with the Liberals to try to catch their rivals off guard while they are restructuring. Of course, the current target of the Liberal government is the Conservative Party of Canada which is undergoing some restructuring. Again, they will try to get a jump on the other parties.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goal of the new Prime Minister is not to help the people and explain to them what its new agenda is all about. His decision is based purely on electoral reasons. He has absolutely no intention to stand up for Quebecers and Canadians and provide them with better services.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He will call an early election to catch his rivals off guard, because it seems the most politically expedient thing to do. That is why they passed Bill C-49 to move up the effective date for the new electoral map in order to get more votes, as the member put it, in regions getting better representation. They would then be able to say, “Look, we have created seven new ridings. That is seven more ridings voting for us”. It is as simple as that. Anything to suit their partisan purposes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us move on and stop thinking that he is our saviour. He is only trying to save himself, as Prime Minister and as leader of the Liberal Party, something  he has been dreaming about for decades now.  </p>

What I would like to do today is break my comments down into three categories.  First, a little bit of history; second, what  my bill would do; and  third, address some of the criticisms that some portions of the industry have levelled against the bill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I do that I   want to take the opportunity to thank Mr. Bill Jeffery from the Centre for Science in the Public Interest for his hard work in helping me to prepare the  bill and  some of the arguments that I have put forward in support of the bill.    I would also like to thank the Centre for Science in the Public Interest and all the people across Canada who have taken an interest in the bill and have expressed their support for it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now give a little bit of history.  In 1993 I began my interest in this subject matter.  I introduced a private member's  bill to provide for mandatory nutritional labelling on prepackaged foods.  That was about 11 years ago.  We are still talking about that issue as frequently as question period today about what should or should not be in prepackaged foods and various other aspects.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point I want to make is that back in 1993, when I brought in the original bill on prepacked foods, the respective industries were against mandatory nutritional labelling, as indeed was Health Canada.  They were of the view that voluntary nutritional labelling was the way to go and that the industry would voluntarily provide all  the nutritional information necessary for consumers to make an intelligent choice on what they are eating.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it turns out, of course, it is obvious that in business one emphasizes   that which is beneficial to or touting one's product.  Businesses do not say some of the things that are not that good about the product which might affect their sales.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sloughed away with a lot of other people and out of nowhere, in approximately October 2000  the then minister of health reversed the longstanding position of the Department  of Health and announced that there would in fact be mandatory nutritional labelling of prepackaged foods in Canada.  I am glad to say that will be coming into force over the next year or so, allowing of course a period of time for industry to adjust.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course  the very same kinds of arguments that were used for seven years about why we should not have mandatory nutritional labelling on prepackaged foods will be used against Bill C-398, and they have just about as must efficacy. In any event, that was a little  history.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the bill all about?  It is an act to amend the Food and Drugs Act (food labelling).  It contains all of three pages, half English and half French.  We might as well say it is a page and a half.  And it has three main sections. In my view what it is about is the empowerment of consumers.  How do we empower consumers?  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have all heard the phrase “knowledge is power”, and  that is absolutely true.  The more knowledge we provide to consumers  the more opportunity consumers have to make more informed and free choices about what they wish to do.  In this case it is what foods they wish to eat.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as I know, no one who I have spoken to about this issue argues that consumers should not have more and better information about the foods they are eating.  If that is the case, if it is not a bad idea to empower consumers, then it must be a good idea or at least  a neutral idea.  If it is either a good idea or a neutral idea then what is wrong with providing consumers with the information they need to make healthful food choices?</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is this bill not about? In my view the bill is not about harassing the restaurant industry. I love eating in restaurants. I do not want to harass the restaurant industry.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also do not want to over-regulate any industry. I am a long-time member of the scrutiny of regulations committee, Mr. Speaker, as you know since you were a member of that committee, and we know that over-regulation is the bane of many a government. The issue is the balancing of requiring reluctant organizations to provide information with trying to keep that from being over-regulated. I hope I have struck a reasonable balance in my bill to that effect.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me describe the sections of the bill so people listening today understand what it is that I am trying to accomplish. Since we already have mandatory nutritional labelling of most  prepackaged foods, what is this bill about? I can divide it into three sections.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section number one is that some prepackaged foods do not yet have mandatory labelling requirements. One of them is prepackaged meats. The bill contains a section requiring prepacked meats to have a reference amount of serving of the food. For example, it does not matter how much of the prepackaged meat we buy, the label would say “one serving  (400 grams equals whatever)”. The consumer would be required to think about how many servings there are in a package, although with prepackaged foods now, quite often the manufacturer will put the number of servings that are in the container or the package. That is up to them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would also require the number of calories in that serving and the amount of total fat, saturated fat and trans fat, and I emphasize trans fat only because again that subject came up today in question period, cholesterol, sodium, total carbohydrates, dietary fibre, sugars, proteins, iron, calcium and vitamin A and vitamin C per reference amounts expressed as a percentage of recommended daily intake. For example, on a package of medium ground hamburger meat it would say that one serving contains X grams of fat which equals approximately 35% of the recommended daily intake and that it contains two grams of trans fat which is two grams more than we should have, or however they want to phrase it. That is what we would see on prepackaged meat.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It does not affect packagers, for example, whose annual revenues are less than $500,000 from the sale of those types of meats. Why would we do that? Because we do not want to over-regulate. We do not want to affect the mom and pop operations, or the small business operation, or the local Chinese restaurant run by two or three generations of Canadians or  the small pizza store. What we want to do is spread out the cost of requiring this information over the largest number of consumers, and I will get to the figures shortly. We would not be talking about the smaller packagers of meats.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about this information? Is it hard to come by or is it impossible to come by? I suggest everyone takes a look at the websites of some of the beef producers or their associations. We find virtually every cut of meat is described and most of the information I have just set out is already described on the website. Why is it there? Because it is clear that consumers want that information and it is becoming clearer every day. More and more information is being provided by more and more associations and businesses, and I will get to that in a moment as well.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are not fanciful things that I have simply thought up out of the air and am  writing into law to annoy packagers of meats. The information is already available.  It is a question of putting it on the package so  people do not need a computer, or access to a computer or take the time to go to a computer, especially when they are in a market and they want to make a decision about which cut of meat to buy or how much of it.</p>


	<A NAME="T1340"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1340"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1345"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1335"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1340)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second portion of the bill deals with restaurants, not all restaurants, but I will get to that in a moment.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does it want restaurants to do with respect to providing consumers with information? If the restaurant has a menu, then the bill asks that on the menu beside the item that it state the number of calories in a serving of that item offered for sale. In addition, it would state the amount of sodium, the sum of the saturated fats, including the trans fat, expressed as a percentage of the recommended daily input. What do we have? We have calories per serving, sodium and fat on a menu, and that is it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If they are menu boards, as they have in  fast food places where they   do not actually have a menu and people look on a board and order what they want, the only thing the bill requires in that case is the number of calories per serving. If we are ordering a plain hamburger from a menu board, it would say “One hamburger”. If we looked over, halfway between the name of the item and the price, presumably, it would say “460 calories” and then the price. There is lots of space right now between the name of the item and the price of the food. There is plenty of room to put in that information.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though it is just the calories per serving, the sodium and fat at this point, the bill does not apply to restaurants or places that serve food that have less than $10 million in annual revenues per year.  Again, we want to provide this information to the largest number of people. Studies have shown us already that many Canadians are eating outside the home much more frequently than they used to. Studies will also show that most of them eat in what we ultimately would call chain restaurants. It would not affect the local small restaurant, but it would provide consumers with the information they need.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us take a simple scenario. We go to a restaurant with the family. I do not want to single out any particular restaurant chain so I will just call it Tom's. We go to Tom's, which has 450 branches across Canada, and we want to have hamburger, fries and a soft drink. We drive up to the window. There is a beautiful picture of that grouping of food, hamburger, fries and a soft drink. Right below the picture of the hamburger it would say “450 calories$, under the fries, “300 calories” and under the drink, “110” or “150 calories”. It would also say things like “If you supersize the fries, it is an additional 350 calories”. There is lots of room on these little advertisements as we drive up to a fast food order window to provide that information. That is an example.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a restaurant we would look at a menu. It would say “Grilled cheese sandwich” and as we are looking over to see that the price is $3.50, halfway across we would see the sandwich has  250 calories, 10 milligrams of salt and 30 grams of fat, or something along those lines.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final item that the bill covers would be pictures in particular of foods that tend to mislead. I was going to  give an exaggerated example of that but since I only have a minute left  I will be unable to do that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I want to at least have the opportunity to say that there are some criticisms of the bill. That is fine, but it is not a fair criticism to say that the  bill should be killed now. I say it should go to committee and we should have witnesses come to express their pleasure or displeasure. Let us investigate. Let us cross-examine. Let us find out what is or is not hyperbole. Let us see what we can do to educate consumers to the best of our ability.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I do not doubt for a moment the good intentions of the member bringing forward Bill C-398.  He has raised an important issue about health and its relation to restaurant produced food.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is it that the member does not trust consumers to inform themselves?  Why does he not believe that if there is sufficient demand for nutritional information, that restauranteurs, as good business people, will provide that information without being dictated to by the Government of Canada?  Why does he not allow consumers and people who run these businesses and employ more than one million Canadians to solve the problem in a natural and organic market based way?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would these boards be required to be posted in both official languages?  Is he going to require that they be posted in Braille for the visually impaired in both official languages?  Has he made a cost estimate of how much this will be?  Has he considered that when a restaurant reaches close to $10 million in sales, the perverse incentive that Bill C-398 would create for people to split the restaurant or to play legal games to avoid the coverage of the bill?  Has he really thought through the implications of this?</p>


	<A NAME="Int-803399"></A><a HREF="#Int-803402"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-803396"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Tom Wappel: </b>

	Mr. Speaker, to the extent that an individual can do so, my answer is yes, I have thought it through. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member has raised very good questions, questions that should be put at committee where there is ample opportunity to examine the facts, where there is ample opportunity to talk to the experts, to talk to the people from Health Canada, to talk to the restaurant association, to talk to actuaries and ask the very questions he has asked.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course he is using some humour to make his points, perhaps not the funniest humour, but nonetheless he is using it. Why would I suggest that we have bilingual menu boards?  The menu boards are already up in his very riding whether it is Edmonton or Calgary, although I know it is Calgary.  If he goes into a fast food outlet, the menu board is already there.  It already tells him what he can order and the price.  I do not know if any of his menu boards have prices in Braille, but I would think not because people would not have the ability to reach above and check the menu board.  What is he talking about?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reality is that cost estimates have been done and I will give him an example.  Even if the smallest full service restaurant chain subject to Bill C-398 had to do a full chemical analysis for every menu item at $350 each for a particularly large 100 item menu, and that is a gross exaggeration of most businesses, the total would involve a maximum one time cost of $35,000 or about one-sixth of 1% of sales revenues during the two year grace period for compliance with the bill.  That amounts to less than 2¢ for a $10 meal, which is barely noticeable to the consumer.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the spirit of laissez-faire he asked why we would not leave this up  to businesses and let them do what they think is right.  We already know government has to lead in many instances. That is why we had to introduce the mandatory nutritional labelling regulations because after years of consumers demanding it, manufacturers did not want to give it.  That is why we have to put warning labels on tobacco.  That is why we want to get warning labels about what happens to unborn babies when people drink alcohol.  The industry does not want those labels.  Why?  Because that is a false statement?  No, because it will affect their sales.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes government has to take responsibility to help people get the information that they require in order to make a choice.  Once they have the information, it is up to them to make the choice as to what they wish to do.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I am worried about the unintended consequences.   As the saying goes, “the road to Hell is paved with good intentions”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has the member given any thought as to how much government it will take to enforce this thing, to monitor and check businesses to ensure that all ingredients are correct?   Are we talking about 150,000,  or 100,000, or 10,000 or 50  new civil servants?  How much will that cost?</p>

	Mr. Speaker, again that  is a reasonable question to ask at committee.  As I have very little time left, how can I answer questions like that?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will answer the question by asking a question. How many inspectors does it take to inspect the gas at every gas pump?  It is done.  How many inspectors does it take to inspect meat?  It is done.  How many inspectors does it take to make sure prepackaged foods are mandatorily labelled?  It is done. If it is a good idea, it will get done.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, it is important that I begin by answering a bit of the last little rant with regard to this piece of legislation going directly to committee.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am speaking on behalf of the people of Yellowhead but also as the senior health critic.  The committee that would be dealing with this piece of legislation would be the health committee.  I have seen how dysfunctional the health committee can become.  In fact, the last one was. It is something in which I would not have great confidence, having those questions come before that committee because of the partisan nature of that committee.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to talk a little about this piece of legislation.  First, it has noble intent.  There is no question about that.  More people in Canada are overweight and the problem is very serious.  I had a number of different lobby groups in my office over the last number of years all saying--the Heart and Stroke Foundation is one of them that comes to mind--that we have a serious problem.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are individuals in our schools right now who are obese. Over 30% are going to be hitting the health care system about the same time as the baby boomer generation.  We are going to have a serious problem.  They are going to be having heart and stroke problems at a much earlier age, in their thirties and forties instead of their fifties and sixties.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no question that this piece of legislation has the right idea in the sense that we should limit the amount of calories and be conscious of what we eat.  It is very true that never before in the history of mankind has so much food been produced by so few people.  Farmers produce almost over 80% of what we eat and, by the way, for so little.  They are starving to death, especially with what we have seen with the BSE problem.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is more awareness in society.  People are asking what they are eating and what they should be eating.  In fact, it is interesting when I look back on this last year.  We had the Minister of Health just arbitrarily pull out of a hat $15 million and then threw it at CIHR to do some research on why people are obese in this country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come from a farming background and I know a little bit about nutrition from the work I have had with animals.  My discerning nature tells me that it probably has a lot to do with what we eat and how we exercise.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This same government decided to wave the participaction program that mandated physical education in our educational system in the early nineties.  When the government came into power, it decided to scrap that program.  It was perhaps not the best program, but it was a good program that dealt with exercise of our youth in our school system.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government said that it got rid of that program because it was a clerical error.  It did not actually have the red tape done and the applications submitted in time when it did up the budget, and so it just got waved.  I do not believe that for a minute.  Nonetheless, that was the excuse that I was given.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here we have another Liberal member coming up with a private member's bill that is trying to address the problem and missing completely  the seriousness of what is actually happening in our school system across the nation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a twofold thing. Not only should we look after what we eat but also start to exercise more.  If we were true to what we should be doing, we would start with our youth and ensure that they have the exercise needed and then teach them how to eat properly.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In teaching them how to eat properly, I wonder how many of them go into a McDonald's and say--even if the calories were written on the McDonald's billboard--“Golly, I had better not eat that burger or those super size fries”. I honestly believe that they are not there thinking of calories.  They are there thinking, “Boy, this is good to eat”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was more talk today about the amount of trans fats in our foods.  I think we should look at trans fats in our foods.  Is it an appropriate amount or not and is there something there to curb them?  All of those discussions should take place; however, this piece of legislation attacks the restaurant industry, and the fast food industry in particular, because they are the ones that would qualify for the $10 million.  </p>


	<A NAME="T1355"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1355"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1400"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1350"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1355)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legislation is saying that the number of calories for each product should be indicated so that individuals putting orders in would understand what those calories are so that they could discern a little better what they are eating. One would think that is a noble thought, but the mechanics of it have not been worked out.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I found it interesting when I spoke with the restaurant association and other people who are in the industry.  They were telling me that this is totally unworkable.  I wonder whether the member, with his well intentioned bill, really did sit down and speak with the industry to see how it would impact it and see if there was any kind of a  buy-in so that the intent, which is noble, would actually come to fruition, and we would actually see something happen.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, 15 different ingredients in a submarine sandwich  have 40,777 different combinations.  That becomes a very unworkable situation when one realizes that it takes somewhere between $150 and $350 to do the testing to find out what the calorie, salt and carbohydrate content of the different combinations actually are. If we were to bring this into fruition and actually make it law, we would have to do that but it would be false advertising because it would be misleading the population by not giving the accurate amounts.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the restaurant industry is served by individuals who are on a minimum salary.  Maybe the professionalism is good because they are thinking of it in exact calories, but one would dish up a different sized portion than another, which is sort of normal and natural.  One can see that even if the combinations were posted, they would be virtually unworkable when we really look at what it is trying to do.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we need to do in this society is to understand and discern exactly how we eat and what it does to us in proportion to the amount of physical exercise that we are doing.  As a nation we have fallen short of that.  There is no question that North America is killing itself with too much food.  We are killing ourselves with kindness in some people's eyes, which is what they say. We must really look at some solutions to this.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This legislation is not a workable solution.  It is not one that is actually going to do anything to push us in that direction.  We need to raise awareness in what we are actually doing to our bodies.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know the amount of calories we eat.   I have always used the philosophy that people gain weight because their input is over their output.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come from an agricultural background where we work very hard. Most members in the House, I would say, have come from forefathers who had an agricultural background where physical labour was something that was a normal part of ordinary life.  Today, we are in a situation where our children are parked in front of television sets and computers far too long.  As a result, they eat the wrong foods because of perhaps the fast pace of their parents' lives and the ease of being able to order in and so on.  Knowing or not knowing the number of calories is certainly not the answer to the problem that is before our society.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually changing the habits of individuals, making them understand the importance of physical exercise and forcing our youth to do that is where the government has fallen down in the last decade, particularly with the one program.  We had better start reinstating that because the impact on our health care system is absolutely phenomenal.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, that impact alone in our health system is estimated at $6.3 billion a year.  The direct cost to health care would be $1.8 billion a year.  It is not small numbers that we are talking about.  The problem is very significant.  It is very important that we realize that and that we do what we can to address it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To put this thing forward right now and move it directly into committee would not be the answer.  We have a piece of legislation that would come into force in 2006 and would work toward that end in the sense of indicating some of the calories, trans fats, sodium, carbohydrates, et cetera, on packaged foods.  That may be well and good, but a lot of people have said that they need a magnifying glass to read it to begin with, so I would question, how much good is that actually doing?</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to close by saying that this piece of legislation is identical to what has been introduced in at least 19 states in the United States. Most of them have been defeated very quickly as they came up for debate, and I think that is exactly what should happen to this one as well.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak on Bill C-398, introduced by my colleague from Scarborough Southwest. I am speaking for my colleague for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve who, unfortunately, could not be here today. It is a pleasure because I am  personally very concerned about foods. I have a family and children, and I closely monitor what they eat.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That said, the Standing Orders were changed to make all private members'  bills votable. They can then be referred to committee.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must give bills the best possible chance to shine and be considered in committee, so they can be amended and  improved, or the conclusion simply reached that they are no good. In which case, the bill is sent back to the House and defeated.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consequently, we must give each bill a chance. It is quite difficult to learn all the details before a bill is scrutinized in committee,  before witnesses are asked to make suggestions to improve it and before a final decision is made.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Quebecois agrees with the principle of the bill. However, it is clear that if it goes to committee, we will move quite significant amendments. I cannot, perhaps, provide full details, but if I understand correctly, labelling is not a simple matter. We will have to see how to proceed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must have this discussion on foods. When this House decided to ask cigarette companies to change their packaging, the industry was in an uproar. These kinds of things always cause uproars.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, the restaurant and foodservices association will be opposed because its members do not want to spend any money. We will also  need to calculate what kind of savings this will mean to health.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consequently, we need experts to tell the committee how much it will all cost. Then, we will be able to make a final decision. However, if the bill does not have the opportunity to get to that stage, obviously, it will die because a broader discussion will not have taken place.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the labelling of cigarette packages, hon. members may remember the substantive debates and the discussions that took place here in the House. We finally got the message across. Now,  the labelling on cigarette packages is much more detailed, and I am convinced that many people stopped smoking for that reason.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the tobacco industry did not want such labelling, because it is losing money. However, as parliamentarians, we had a responsible decision to make about health and we made that decision. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is pretty well the same thing with the bill before us. We have a duty to act responsibly and to discuss this measure, because this is where we are headed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am told that it will be very difficult because, for example, there are all kinds of ways to make a submarine. We must take a very serious look at this issue. I do not think that we want absolutely each and every product to be labelled. There are specific things for which we want labelling, and these will be discussed in committee when we look at the feasibility of this measure. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are chains of restaurants, such as Subway, that already indicate the fat content of certain ingredients. There are two or three meals on the menu that are really low in calories and fat content. So, this is already being done in some restaurant chains. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, we are primarily targeting such chains, because we are talking about businesses that  have sales of $10 million. The local food outlet is not affected by this legislation, which is really aimed at large chains such as St-Hubert, Subway, McDonald's and others. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion, it is very important that we have this debate. We all know how colourful Americans can be, and I say this in all friendship. Not too long ago, I heard about someone in the United States who did a test. He ate at McDonald's for breakfast, lunch and supper for a month. He became seriously ill, so much so that he even developed a psychiatric disease. It is easy to see that we should have a better idea of what we eat. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I personally do not go to McDonald's very often, it not being my favourite meal choice.   It is true, however, that from time to time  we all go out for a treat like that because we have children, but we do need to know what we are eating, and I think that there has not been enough progress made in this area so far. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to have the possibility of progressing further.  This bill stirs up debate, although it may not be the ideal bill.  Many people will come up with this or that amendment, will want to see indication of fat content, sugar content and so  on.  We will see how it progresses, however.  There will be a discussion in committee, and then decisions will be reached on what we really want to see included in a label.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is reference to the GMOs.   In talking with the public, we come to realize this is a very popular subject.  People do want to know.  They want to know if they are eating something that has been genetically modified.  In my opinion, they are absolutely entitled to know, since they are the ones paying for it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is absolutely normal for questions to be raised about this.  I would like very much to see this bill examined in committee, the standing health committee in particular.  What I want most of all is to see it accorded the  necessary importance to be debated.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if this bill is not the one that eventually gets passed, we must at least be able to continue addressing the issue so that one day people will really know how many calories are in their food, and whether they are eating genetically modified food.  We need to make progress in that direction.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe then the food industry will also be forced to sell us much healthier products. Indeed, food vendors will have no other choice because people will no longer eat just any kind of food; they will want to eat quality products.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That being said, when the time comes to vote, the Bloc Quebecois will support the principle of the bill. I should add that the Association des consommateurs du Québec is also in favour of this bill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I want to mention an article that I read in <i>Le Devoir</i>. It was entitled “Junk food just as harmful as nicotine”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The article says that malnutrition and bad food habits are just as dangerous as cigarettes and nicotine. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that cardiovascular diseases are now affecting people at an increasingly younger age. More and more children suffer from obesity. That must change.  We must pay more attention to our health. We must see to it that obesity stops being a problem in our children. A lot of children are obese because young people these days are less active and also because they are not careful about what they eat. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must create a whole new culture. I believe that looking at this bill and its possibilities will help us go forward. </p>

	Mr. Speaker, I believe that Canadians deserve to know what is in the food they eat.  While I agree that a healthy diet is more a matter of education and individual choice than it is the heavy hand of state regulation and control, the government does have a role to play in ensuring that the food we eat is safe.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, we now know that trans fats, hydrogenated vegetable oils, are really bad for us, yet they are nearly everywhere in the processed foods that we eat. The <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i> states that just one gram a day of trans fats increases the risk of heart disease by 20%. The average Canadian eats over ten grams per day.  The recommended daily intake, by the way, is zero.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when I asked this Minister of Health and the previous minister what steps were being taken to eliminate trans fats from our diet, their replies  suggested that the government is not willing to do anything to eliminate this toxic garbage from our food, and “toxic” is the terminology used by the food scientists with regard to trans fats. The government is not willing  to do anything to remove these toxins from our food as long as the food is properly labelled.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, our Minister of Health is leaving it up to Canadians as to whether or not to feed poison to their children.  Furthermore, our Minister of Health is giving the food companies up to five years to rewrite their labels and, amazingly--get this--baby food is exempt.  I am sure the House will be shocked to learn that baby food will not in fact be labelled at all even though there are high contents of trans fats in baby food.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My problem with labelling as it pertains to the context of this particular private member's bill is that most people do not read the labels on the processed food that they eat.  In fact, studies have shown that 70% of people pay no attention to the labels on the processed food they buy.  Of the remaining 30%, many would not or could not comprehend the technical data that they read in the fine print.  In other words, labels have no editorial content.  Labels simply say that this product contains <i>x</i> amount of trans fats.  They do not say, “And that's too much, so don't eat it”. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is ludicrous, by the way, to think that we should mandate labelling on food to advise people not to eat it because it is poisonous, or in other words, allow the manufacturers to put toxins in our food and then mandate labelling to educate Canadians to not eat this food.  It is simply ludicrous, really, when we think about it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I raise this issue partly because I believe there is a class issue here. I believe that low income people are more vulnerable to this trans fats hazard to our health than anyone else. Frankly, in my opinion, and I represent a low income riding, it takes a fair amount of economic stability and economic security to eat properly and to eat well.  Many of the people in my riding do not have a car to use to drive out to a supermarket where they can buy large amounts of whole foods and unprocessed foods.  They end up spending their low incomes in corner stores and 7-Elevens and buying more pre-packaged and processed foods because their economic instability leads to an unstable household where a balanced diet and regular meals are not the norm.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe for all these reasons that high-flown arguments about informed choice are irrelevant in the context of labelling foods.  Yes, people should be aware of the nutritional value of the foods they eat, but not everyone is able to make an informed choice no matter what kind of labelling is on the side of packages.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other countries have effectively banned trans fats from their food supply. There are healthy alternate choices that do not compromise either quality or taste.  I believe it is the role of government to tell the industry to stop using trans fats.  In fact, I will go further.  It is the role of government to help the industry stop using trans fats. I would fully support the government using research and development grants to assist the food processing industry to find other healthy choices.  I would welcome that.   There would be no criticism from  this sector of the House if some of the technology partnership loans money were used, or research and development grants were used, or if the National Research Council were asked to assist industry in a special project to develop alternative sources of fats and oils for food manufacturers to use.</p>


	<A NAME="T1410"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1410"><!-- Hour: 2--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1415"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1405"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1410)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, that would have been a sensible answer to the question I asked in question period today. I was stonewalled by the current Minister of Health.  He simply said that mandatory labelling would be enough and that we should not be concerned.  I do not accept that.  I think that we now know enough about trans fatty acids: they should not be labelled, they should be eliminated. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Denmark has taken steps to do just that. We cannot ban trans fats outright.  I will be the first to admit that.  There is some naturally occurring trans fat, especially in  dairy products.  What Denmark did, and what I recommend Canada do, is regulate the amount of allowable trans fats in foods to no more than 2% of the total amount of fat in that food product. The scientists agree that this would represent a trace level of trans fats that would likely simply pass through the body and would not represent a real health risk.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that these trans fatty acids are extremely bad for us, especially for our children.  They are forcing up Canada's rate of obesity, which is virtually epidemic in the current generation.  We have record levels of diabetes, traced directly to trans fats, and as I said, heart disease is up exponentially.  The <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i> says   it believes that trans fats are even a contributing factor in Alzheimer's disease as well.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So get rid of them, right? That is the logical thing to do, but again, the frustrating thing in my mind is that when I have approached the government, two successive ministers of health have refused to even contemplate regulating and getting rid of them.   The only thing that my staff and I can think of as a reason why the government would be reluctant to ban them is that it is  worried about a NAFTA challenge.   It is  worried about chapter 11 of NAFTA. The Government of Canada could be sued by a corporation for lost opportunity if we pass regulations that may affect  doing business. I would hate to think that would be the determining factor.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other factor, of course, is our Constitution. Not many people realize that margarine is a constitutional issue, but if they look at the British North America Act, they will see that Canada must be the only country in the world that has two paragraphs dedicated to  oleo margarine in our Constitution, due to John  Crosbie and his family  and the terms of union for Newfoundland joining Confederation, but that is another story.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walter  Willett, the chairman of the Department of Nutrition of Harvard University and the author of some of the most damning studies about trans fats, has said that hydrogenated vegetable oil, the process by which trans fats are created, is the biggest food processing disaster in history.  Harvard University estimates  that 33,000 deaths per year  can be directly attributed to trans fats.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trans fats are the biggest single public health issue since the war on tobacco,  yet we are not taking it seriously and it can be solved with the snap of a finger at no cost. At no cost, the government could protect the well-being of a whole future generation of Canadians by eliminating trans fats.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do have Voortman cookies.  I want to take a minute to compliment the industry on the efforts it is making too, because no one argues the fact these trans fats are silent killers.   Not a single food scientist in North America or  in the world, in fact,    argues that.  Even the industry is not denying that these are silent killers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Voortman Cookies produces 120 product lines.  As of March 2004  every one of the Voortman Cookies product lines will be trans fat free.    Mr. Voortman's daughter is a food scientist and, to her great credit and his great credit, she lobbied him and he agreed that he would eliminate trans fats.  It took him three years to find an alternative that does not affect quality or taste, but he found it and he is implementing it in his product line.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We want all products manufactured in Canada to be trans fat free.  We also want all products imported to Canada for sale to consumers to be trans fat free.  We also want restaurant foods to be trans fat free.  The only way to do that is to regulate it so that no one can sell any product to any consumer that contains more than 2% of total volume of fats as trans fats.  That is the subject here.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I acknowledge that the original intent here is that Canadians deserve to know what is in the food they eat, my view is that labelling is inadequate when we are dealing with a known toxin.  It is not okay to put poison in our food as long it is properly labelled.  That is crazy, frankly.</p>

Eleni Bakopanos (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Human Resources and Skills Development (Social Economy), Lib.): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege today to speak to Bill C-398.  Before I address the bill directly, I would like to commend the hon. member for Scarborough Southwest who has introduced a bill in every Parliament, as he said in his speech, since 1989  that requires the nutritional value of food to be clearly stated on packaged foods. His efforts, by the way, did contribute to new regulations that were published on January 1, 2003.  I congratulate him on that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member is now asking Parliament to take the next step:  consider mandatory labelling of nutritional information for raw meat, poultry, fish and seafood; require anyone selling food for immediate consumption to provide information on nutrients and/or calories;  require percentage declarations of ingredients highlighted in words or pictures on the front panel of the label; and  finally, require that the first three ingredients in the ingredients list be accompanied by a percentage declaration of the amount of the food.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a mother also, as other hon. members said, yes, I do worry about what my kids are eating at McDonald's.  However, I think we all have to go further and beyond that and look at some of the problems with the bill, not that it is not a good bill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the outset, I want the House to know that the government shares the hon. member's concern about fair and informative labelling of foods.  In fact, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency has recently conducted public consultations on a proposal to clarify the labelling and advertising of products with  highlighted  or emphasized  ingredients, flavours or sensory characteristics.</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To begin, I would like to acknowledge the significant amount of work that has already been done in the area of labelling food and the impact of the legislation on current policy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On December 12, 2000, nutritional labelling became mandatory in Canada. The new regulations now require a nutrition facts table to appear on most prepackaged food sold in Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new regulations are the result of four years of work during which we did consumer research, heard from experts, and held broad consultations in the consumer, health, and food industry sectors. An external  advisory committee was created to guide Health Canada throughout the process. It was a big undertaking.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nutrition facts table gives information on calories and 13 key nutrients contained in every serving of food. The comprehensiveness of the information, and the presentation required, makes Canada a leader in nutritional labelling.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nutrition facts table is an excellent way to inform Canadians about the food they eat. As well as being an effective source of information, the nutritional label helps improve the health and well-being of Canadians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The food industry had the opportunity to take part in the process, but only saw the final version of the regulations on January 1, 2003. The industry has  three years to meet the nutritional labelling requirements, and five years if sales are under a million dollars.<sup></sup></p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new regulations represent an enormous challenge for many sectors of the food industry, because certain foods must be tested and new labels must be produced.These sectors need time to adjust. While some can spring into action very quickly to add the nutrition labelling format on their labels, others will need all the time provided under the regulations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the consultation process one the new regulations, consumers and dietitians both told Health Canada that the amounts of nutrients on the labels have to be correct. Ensuring that a nutrition label contains valid information requires the testing of many samples of each food over time to take into account factors related to variability, like the time of year, climatic conditions, soils and the feed given to animals.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The data do not exist for all products at this time. Because of the lack of information on nutritional composition, an exemption has been granted in the bill with respect to some food: raw, single ingredient meats that are not ground, meat by products, poultry meats, poultry meat by-products, and raw, single ingredient marine or freshwater animal products.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The industry is willing to produce precise data for nutritional labelling of poultry and seafood, but it must have the time to carry out the necessary analyses. There are many kinds of cuts of meat, and their fat content varies considerably depending on the grade of beef or the fishing season.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the number of samples is not realistic, it must be examined to obtain uniform and accurate data.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, Bill C-398 introduces an economic perspective that is absent from the legislation and the criminal law on which the legislation is based. It provides for an exemption from certain requirements, as a function of sales. Such a change clearly establishes a precedent and its impact has not been evaluated.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-398 also requires the provision of information on the nutritional value of food served in restaurants and other  outlets. The restaurant chains and franchises with standard menus, such as McDonald's, can easily provide nutritional information about the food they serve, something they already often provide on request, as does Subway, as other hon. members have already mentioned.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other restaurants, however, do not have such strict requirements for food preparation. These restaurants often find it difficult, if not impossible, to give precise information about the nutritional value and calorie content of their meals. In such cases, feasibility studies would be required.</p>


	<A NAME="T1425"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1425"><!-- Hour: 2--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1430"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1420"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1425)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, the bill raises questions of jurisdiction. Restaurants and other service establishments are generally considered to be under provincial jurisdiction. Inspection is a provincial matter and is usually carried out by municipal inspectors. It is impossible to require the disclosure of nutritional information by such establishments without consulting the provinces and territories.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this bill is passed, it would create new inspection requirements for the provinces—if they agree to do this work—and for federal inspectors if they do not.</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My father owned a restaurant in my riding of Ahuntsic for 35 years.     I know for a fact that it was the municipal authorities who    did the food inspection in the case of my father's restaurant. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also would like to say, as  hon. members on the other side have said, that the restaurant association, with which I have had the opportunity to discuss this bill, and other colleagues  have raised certain concerns. I am sure, as the hon. member has said, that maybe those concerns can be discussed in committee, but they are very serious concerns.  I encourage the hon. member to perhaps sit one more time with the restaurant association and have another discussion on his bill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I stated, the CFIA has recently conducted public consultations on a proposal  that would clarify the labelling and advertising of products with highlighted or emphasized ingredients, flavours or sensory characteristics. The object is fair  labelling that provides clear and relevant product information for consumers and is not deceptive or misleading.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government's labelling proposal would be made as regulations in the food and drug regulations, with an interim policy in the guide to food labelling and advertising. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The discussion paper includes a requirement for a percentage declaration for ingredients that have been highlighted on a label, like Bill C-398.  However it does not include the requirement for the percentage declaration of the first three ingredients nor other ingredients. As it stands already,   prepackaged foods in Canada are required to list ingredients in descending order by weight.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CFIA's proposal follows the provisions for quantitative labelling of ingredients in the current general standard for the labelling of prepackaged foods established by Codex Alimentarius Commission, which is the international body responsible for establishing food standards. The proposal is similar to the standards established in the regulations of our trading partners, including the U.S.A., the E.U., Australia and New Zealand. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However there are reasons that Codex does not require the percentage of the first three and some other specific ingredients to be listed. One of the reasons is that the formula for these foods is proprietary information. Companies do not want to provide too much proprietary information on product formulas to the public and to competitors.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because we are running out of time  I will  end by saying, as one other hon. member said, Canada  has to look at the trade barriers that  exist in order to qualify because we may have an unjustified trade barrier.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though I have quite a few reservations about Bill C-398, I applaud the intentions of the member for Scarborough Southwest  to give consumers the information so  they can made informed choices.  His efforts to have Parliament debate this issue have already been applauded by all members of the House.</p>
