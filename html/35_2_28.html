	<B>Mr. Paul Zed (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
pursuant to Standing Order 36(8), I have the honour to table, in

	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (for the Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada) </B>moved for leave to introduce Bill C-27, an act

	<B>Mr. Raymond Bonin (Nickel Belt, Lib.)</B> moved for leave to 
introduce Bill C-266, an act to amend the Competition Act 
(protection of whistle-blowers).
<P>
	He said: Madam Speaker, I stand today to introduce a bill 
entitled an act to amend the Competition Act (protection of 
whistle-blowers). This bill is about consumer protection, the right 
and protection of employees who refuse to partake in illegal 
anti-competitive activities sponsored by their employers which 
hurt the consumer. It is about improving the investigation and 
prosecution of companies that engage in price fixing and price 
gouging.
<P>
	Consumers continue to be victimized by market-wide 
fluctuations in the price of gasoline. Both levels of  government say 
that they sympathize with consumers but add they cannot prove 
price fixing. Consumers know that price fixing exists and demand 
that governments stand up to protect their interests. This bill 
provides us with the evidence gathering tools needed to expose 
how gas prices are really set and put an end to the practice of

DEVELOPMENT ACT</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (for the Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.)</B> moved that Bill C-11, an act to establish the 
Department of Human Resources Development and to amend and 
repeal certain related acts, be read the third time and passed.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Roger Simmons (Burin-St. George's, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to say a few words 
about Bill C-11, an act to establish the Department of Human 
Resources Development.
<P>
	The purpose of this bill is to ask Parliament to formalize the 
existence of the new department, which has already shown itself to 
be a pragmatic, efficient and effective entity. There is no hidden 
agenda here which  will disappoint some of my friends in the 
Reform Party. It is business as usual.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stinson:</B> You can fool some of the people some of the time 
but not all the people all of the time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simmons:</B> The member is standing proof of that.
<P>
	The bill confirms the minister's responsibility to develop the 
human resources that fall under the mandate of the Government of 
Canada. It does nothing to extend or to diminish the minister's 
powers, nor does the legislation introduce any substantive changes 
to government policies or programs.
<P>
	As members will know, the government is committed to an 
effective and efficient operation.
<P>
<B>(1015 )</B>
<P>
	At the time of structuring it was realized that encompassing all 
human resources in one department would better serve the needs of 
Canadians. To that end, Labour Canada is now part of human 
resources. The bill provides for the appointment of a minister of 
labour. However, so there is no confusion, appointment of a 
minister of labour does not in any way mean further reorganization 
of the department.
<P>
	During the current restructuring of the Canadian economy the 
government is placing a high priority on issues such as labour 
relations, occupational safety and health and workplace standards 
as well as other issues that have a profound effect on Canada's 
labour markets.
<P>
	These concerns are in keeping with the Government of Canada's 
responsibility for labour relations in several key areas which are 
under federal jurisdiction, including transportation, banking and 
communications. As well, the government is signatory to a number 
of international labour agreements, hence the need for a role under 
this department.
<P>
	It is the responsibility of the Minister of Labour to ensure these 
issues receive the attention they reserve. With that in mind, 
modernization of the Canadian Labour Code is one of Labour 
Canada's key undertakings.
<P>
	Prior to the reorganization of the government, employment and 
immigration came under the same roof. That is no longer the case 
with this new bill and this new department.
<P>
	The former Canada Employment and Immigration Commission 
will become the Canada Employment Insurance Commission, and 
the commission will continue its mandate with regard to policies 
affecting employment, labour market conditions and revitalization 
of the unemployment insurance program.
<P>
	That brings me to an issue I particularly want to address under 
the aegis of this bill. This is not a bill particularly about employ-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1627"> 1627 </A></B>
<P>
ment insurance. It is a bill about a department that has 
responsibility for the  proposals now making their way through the 
system. Within a few days the Standing Committee on Human 
Resources Development will report to the House on its 
recommendations concerning the proposals tabled on December 1 
by the now Minister of Foreign Affairs.
<P>
	I have said many times publicly that I believe these proposals 
constitute an overall improvement in what we have had in terms of 
employment insurance. However, there have been some concerns 
expressed by my constituents and by people in Atlantic Canada 
generally, including by me.
<P>
	I have expressed concerns and continue to have concerns about 
the so-called intensity rule, punishing people who through no fault 
of their own must have more frequent access to unemployment 
insurance benefits than other people. It is a fact of life. It is a 
characteristic of this country that there are a number of industries 
which by definition are seasonal, resource extractions certainly 
being in that category.
<P>
	Although not exclusively, the Atlantic provinces are very much 
identified with these types of industries; mineral extraction in 
Labrador and parts of the island of Newfoundland and other parts 
of Atlantic Canada, and forestry and fishery. All three of these have 
seasonal implications.
<P>
	What would the country be today without access to the vast 
resources of Atlantic Canada? I submit that the manufacturing 
complex of central Canada would be less vibrant without the 
resource sectors of other parts of the country.
<P>
	For these reasons and for others we have never made any 
apology about the seasonal nature of our work activity. While we 
make no apologies, we wish it were otherwise in terms of the 
individuals concerned. If we gave any people in my riding, and I 
suspect I reflect the views of elsewhere in Atlantic Canada, the 
choice between unemployment insurance benefits and full time, 12 
month work, they would take the latter.
<P>
<B>(1020 )</B>
<P>
	It bears repeating because people who have not lived the 
experience in Atlantic Canada tend to generalize. There is still a 
generalization out there that Newfoundlanders and Atlantic 
Canadians are a bunch of lazy people who work for ten weeks so 
they can get their stamps and sit around drinking beer for the other 
42 weeks.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Get rid of the GST and create jobs.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simmons:</B> Do not change the issue. I want to focus onthis one.
<P>
	That stereotype is thrown at me from time to time. The truth is 
there are more native born Newfoundlanders living outside 
Newfoundland today than living in Newfoundland. There are 
579,000 people in  Newfoundland and there are over 700,000 
Newfoundlanders living outside Newfoundland.
<P>
	They have left Newfoundland, almost without exception, to 
chase jobs. They are good workers. They have good work ethics. 
We find them on the CP tracks in Saskatchewan or on the tar sands 
project in Fort McMurray in great numbers.
<P>
	There are thousands of them working on the Great Lakes. In my 
constituency alone there are more than 8,000 Newfoundlanders 
who sail the Great Lakes six to eight months a year. They go home 
for a week or a month to stay with their families and then they 
return to their work. They work in the forestry industry in Nova 
Scotia. They make up a disproportionately large percentage of the 
Canadian Armed Forces. Newfoundlanders have gone elsewhere 
because that is where the work is. I have digressed to make a point.
<P>
	I was talking about some of the concerns I have with the 
employment insurance legislation. One has to do with the intensity 
rule. Another has to do with the method of determining benefits, 
the so-called divisor method. I have made my views known to the 
appropriate people, including those on the committee.
<P>
	Eligibility rules for new entrants is another concern.
<P>
	Another concern is the clawback after $39,000. I have said to 
both the minister and to members of the committee we have to be 
careful that in applying that clawback we do not unwittingly 
introduce a disincentive. If time allowed I would give the House a 
few examples. However, if members look closely at the proposal 
they will find that the clawback, as laudable as it seems at the 
moment, has a disincentive built into it. There are circumstances 
where it is worth the person's while, in strict financial terms, to sit 
at home rather than to earn too much money because by so doing 
they would adversely affect their level of benefits down the road.
<P>
	I had another concern about the hearings which are concluding 
today. As far as Newfoundland is concerned, it is the province with 
the highest rate of unemployment in all of Canada. Yet when the 
all-party committee decided to call witnesses it called only three 
from Newfoundland. What is more, all three witnesses were 
business people. They were from the St. John's Board of Trade and 
those kinds of groups. They have their point of view, but it is the 
point of view of the employer. If we are to have an equitable 
employment insurance scheme when this is all over we ought to 
have the input of not only the employer but the employee.
<P>
	In the case of Newfoundland, the committee was to hear three 
witnesses from the employer side and not a single witness from the 
worker side. That was changed at the last minute, not completely to 
my satisfaction, but at least we got the Newfoundland and Labrador 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1628"> 1628 </A></B>
<P>
Federation of Labour on the list at the last minute. The decision 
was  made to hear that group this week. There ought to have been 
others to provide more of a balance.
<P>
	In fairness to my colleagues on the committee from all parties, I 
understand that in general if we look at the mix of witnesses who 
have appeared before the committee from across the country there 
has been a balance of both worker and employer representation. As 
far as Newfoundland is concerned, that balance was not reflected. I 
put that on the record.
<P>
	I digressed a bit, but nevertheless I wanted to speak generally on 
the issue of this bill and one of the current active files of the new 
department, the employment insurance proposal.
<P>
<B>(1025)</B>
<P>
	I thought I would give my friend the opportunity to speak.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stinson:</B> No, I was listening to you.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I might be able to provide an 
opportunity for that member to speak at a later time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simmons:</B> Mr. Speaker, I assure my friend from 
Okanagan-Shuswap and all other hon. members there is complete 
harmony between overall government priorities and the priorities 
of the new Department of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	As the government made abundantly clear in the throne speech, 
the policies of the government are aimed at fostering a healthy 
economic climate, and we are beginning to see some signs of that. 
Look at the indicators, interest rates, foreign exchange, the trade 
balance and so on. I think we are on the right road but we are not 
there yet.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stinson:</B> Bankruptcies.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simmons:</B> The member wants to talk about bankruptcies. 
Nobody takes any comfort in the alarmingly high number of 
personal and corporate bankruptcies in the country. He might want 
to look at a correlation between the number of personal 
bankruptcies and the applications of right wing policies. The two 
go hand in hand. We cannot in one breath decry the number of 
bankruptcies and in the next keep saying ``sock it to them, sock it to 
them''. The two are related.
<P>
	I remember from grade seven a delightful poem from the old 
beckoning trail of literature, that blue beckoning trail. It was called 
``The Big Rock Candy Mountains.'' The basic thesis of the poem 
was that everything was free. One of the lines was ``prison walls 
were made of paper and cigarettes grew on trees''. I think for the 
writer cigarettes were supposed to be a kind of morsel to be sought 
after. The context of the poem was that everything was free, you 
did not have to pay for anything at all.
<P>
	My friend from Okanagan-Shuswap said get rid of the tax. 
Theoretically a government could get rid of all taxes. However, 
certain consequences would follow. We would not be able to pay 
the member's salary.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stinson:</B> That would be fine with me. You would not get 
your pension. If we did not need government, that would be a 
beauty.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simmons:</B> Now is he upset. Now is he listening with his 
lips. He suddenly realizes that if we cut out all the taxes it might 
impact on him.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stinson:</B> I would be able to do something useful.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simmons:</B> No party in the House, whatever its stripe and 
however loud its members yell, said if it were elected there would 
be no taxes.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Some said they would eliminate the GST.
<P>
<B>(1030 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simmons:</B> If they want, we can talk about some, including 
the leader of the Reform Party, who said one thing during the 
election and about three or four things since on the GST.
<P>
	I have my other speech here. I wanted to give it the day the 
opposition had the motion on the GST but we ran out of time. I will 
give my GST speech at the right time. I will lay out how consistent 
the leader of the Reform Party has been on the subject of the GST. 
His basic speech goes like this: Get rid of it, keep it, get rid of it, 
keep it, get rid of it, keep it. That is basically what the gentleman 
who is the leader of the third party has said on that issue.
<P>
	If they want to talk about GST, I believe Mr. Johnny Cochrane 
has something he would like to say.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stinson:</B> That is the Liberal two step. We are all used to that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hart:</B> What did John Nunziata say?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> Talk to the Speaker, not to the Reformers. He 
has nothing to say.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Colleagues, with the greatest 
of respect to all members in the Chamber, I would hope that the 
interventions would be made through the Chair. Of course the 
Chair by virtue of our rules can only recognize one speaker at a 
time.
<P>
	In this case, in accordance with Standing Order 74 the first three 
speakers have 40 minutes without questions or comments. By 
unanimous consent, if you choose you can ask questions of the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1629"> 1629 </A></B>
<P>
member speaking. In the meantime if it goes on during the 
discourse of his speech obviously we will all have to question as to 
how much order we might have in this Chamber.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simmons:</B> Mr. Speaker, I might have missed something. I 
understood I had the right to refer to other members of the House. 
Each time I have done so, I have done it in the third person by their 
riding name. If the member for Berthier-Montcalm, our very own 
Johnny Cochrane, has any problems with that he should rise on a 
point of order.
<P>
	If my colleagues from the Reform want to interject, and I am not 
objecting to it, I understand that is within the spirit of debate in this 
House. If I need the protection of the Chair from the member for 
Berthier-Montcalm I should be the first to beg for it, but I did not 
think I was out of order. If I did not refer to the Chair when I should 
have, I apologize, but I thought in all cases I referred to the Chair in 
the third person.
<P>
	If the Chair gets waylaid by Johnny Cochrane, that is the Chair's 
problem, not mine. In any event I will try and do it another way.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> It is obviously not my 
purpose nor my role to engage in debate. I assure you I will defend 
the interests of the Chair if it should ever be required on behalf of 
each and every member of the House. This is not a point that is 
related to any specific member. I am just in a very general way 
asking for the co-operation of all the members in the Chamber to 
make their interventions through the Chair and not directly across 
the floor to one another.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simmons:</B> My comment was not directly aimed at the Chair 
either. It was just to say, Sir, that I thought I was doing exactly that 
and I asked the Chair if I had strayed somewhere to let me know 
where it was.
<P>
	I was trying to assure all the hon. members, the agitated ones and 
otherwise, that the government and the new department are in 
complete harmony, as John Crosbie used to say, cheek to cheek, 
jowl to jowl on this one in terms of the mandate of the government 
as a whole, its overall priority and the priority of the new 
department. The throne speech made that clear. I was then 
digressing in talking about how the economy is in slightly healthier 
shape than it has been and it is moving along. It is not there yet, but 
it is moving along.
<P>
	When I began to talk about how good things were beginning to 
get, that made my friends in the Reform Party a little nervous and 
they decided to throw, as we would say in Newfoundland, a red 
herring into the process and started talking about the GST and that 
kind of thing. At that point I pointed out to the member that if we 
cut out all those taxes we could not pay his salary. That is when he 
had the tantrum and that is where we were when we had the 
procedural interruptions. Now we can go on from there.
<P>
	I have a speech. I am on page eight of the speech. I have not read 
the first seven yet but I am on page eight.
<P>
<B>(1035)</B>
<P>
	I want to tell the Reform member that page eight begins as 
follows: ``That too is HRDC's number one priority''. We have to go 
back to page seven to find out what ``that too'' refers to. Aha, 
``fostering a healthy climate'', where I came in just a minute ago. 
That is clearly HRDC's number one priority. Let him debate that. It 
is that and maintaining a strong social security system for all 
Canadians. These are the two priorities of this new department: the 
healthy economic situation which translates into jobs, jobs, jobs 
and maintaining a strong social security system for Canadians.
<P>
	To fulfil those two objectives, the new department is continually 
developing policies and programs designed to reduce poverty and 
to help unemployed workers return to the labour force as quickly as 
possible.
<P>
	By making the development of all human resources the 
responsibility of one department, it facilitates an integrated, 
co-ordinated approach to help Canadians achieve their full 
potential. It also provides a structure for the Government of Canada 
to work with its provincial and territorial partners, its partners in 
business and labour, its partners in the educational institutions and 
its partners in the community.
<P>
	HRDC is bringing together the very strands of our social 
programs to ensure that they meet the needs of individual 
Canadians and the nation as a whole. Social policy is about 
investing in people, helping people develop their skills, helping 
them enjoy rewarding lives and becoming contributing members of 
their respective communities. Nowhere does HRDC emphasize that 
policy more than with our youth.
<P>
	We all recall that creating hope and opportunity for young 
Canadian men and women was one of the key goals singled out in 
the speech from the throne. Youth unemployment, Canadians under 
25, is around 16 per cent, which is just more than one and one-half 
times the national average.
<P>
	I am sure every member of this House will agree that Canadian 
youth are the nation's greatest resource. They need and deserve our 
assistance to complete their education and attain that crucial first 
job. That reason alone justifies creating the Department of Human 
Resources Development.
<P>
	HRD is responsible for administering youth services Canada, 
youth internship Canada, the student summer job action program 
and the Canada student loans program. I trust that hon. members 
can clearly see the key roles the department plays in the lives of 
young people across the country.
<P>
	By amalgamating all the programs that address human 
resources, by providing a single, coherent mandate, the 
government is clarifying the identity and responsibilities of the 
new department. This is extremely important for the morale of the 
depart-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1630"> 1630 </A></B>
<P>
ment's employees and more  important for the confidence of its 
clients across the country.
<P>
	Through further consolidation of social and labour market 
programs, HRDC will sharpen the government's focus on 
developing Canada's human resources. Part of that can be seen in 
the department's responsibility for the reform of the 
unemployment insurance program. UI is being renewed to address 
1990s realities through both income support and active 
employment measures.
<P>
	As I was saying earlier, that reform is long overdue. I support the 
overall thrust of that reform of unemployment insurance. I have 
said earlier in my speech today that I have certain concerns about 
particular aspects: the claw back, the intensity, the divisor and the 
entrance requirements particularly for new entrants. These are 
matters that have been canvassed pretty fully with the new Minister 
of Human Resources Development, my friend from New 
Brunswick, and also with members of the standing committee 
which will report very soon. We will then have an opportunity to 
see what amendments are going to be made to the proposal.
<P>
<B>(1040 )</B>
<P>
	Based on my conversations with the minister and members of 
the standing committee, I am confident the concerns which I and 
others have raised on this issue have been heard and are being dealt 
with. I think we will see that reflected in the report of the Standing 
Committee on Human Resources Development. The net result is 
we will have a considerably improved employment insurance 
scheme over that which was tabled in December by the former 
minister.
<P>
	Canadians need and deserve the best possible services from their 
government which is the crux of Bill C-11. Canadians will get 
those services through many HRDC initiatives, not the least of 
which will be the department's new service delivery network. At 
the heart of the new network will be about 300 human resources 
centres, now known as Canada Employment Centres, spread 
strategically across the country. The centres will provide a broad 
cross-section of client services.
<P>
	The establishment of Human Resources Development Canada is 
absolutely necessary if the government is to fulfil its mandate of 
generating economic growth, job creation and protecting social 
security programs.
<P>
	I can only repeat what I said at the beginning that Bill C-11 is 
essentially an administrative bill. There is nothing earth shattering 
here. There are no new mandates being asked for, given or taken 
back. The bill does not deal with substantive issues of reform but 
with consequential issues arising from the efficient merger of 
various departments and programs. For that reason I encourage 
members to support passage of the legislation which would enable 
HRDC and the government to get on with the task of better serving 
Canadians.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, despite all 
of the government's denials and its repetitive tune that it is only a 
technical bill to establish a department, Bill C-96 in fact broadens 
the federal government's constitutionally recognized powers.
<P>
	Bill C-96 broadens the powers assumed by the federal 
government through its power to spend. For the first time, what the 
government did in fact do is spelled out on each line of the bill as 
well as between the lines.
<P>
	In fact, by establishing this new Department of Human 
Resources Development, the government eloquently confirms its 
takeover of the responsibilities and powers that originally lay at the 
core of provincial accountability under the Canadian Constitution. 
This core of provincial accountability was undermined only by 
exceptions that should have been enshrined in the Constitution, be 
it pensions or unemployment insurance.
<P>
<B>(1045)</B>
<P>
	Once its foot was in the door, the government threw the door 
wide open and, through its ever growing spending powers, invaded 
the place. That is what Bill C-11 is all about.
<P>
	This bill clearly expresses the centralizing will of a federal 
government that tries to pass itself off as the chief strategist on 
human resources development in Canada. It would take over the 
management, in the broad sense of the word, of the vast area of 
human resources development.
<P>
	In a transformed Canada, we can understand the other provinces 
agreeing to different constitutional arrangements. The problem is 
that, for Quebec, these arrangements are totally unacceptable; we 
cannot in any way agree to the wording of Bill C-11 without going 
against all the constitutional debates that have kept so many 
generations of Quebecers awake at night.
<P>
	We respect the fact that the other provinces and the federal 
government may make different arrangements. Quebec, however, 
cannot in any way agree to let the federal government assume full 
control over the area of human resources development, which, in a 
broad sense, touches on all aspects of social life, including training, 
youth-as my colleague across the way just pointed out-seniors, 
children, women, the unemployed and the people with jobs. The 
fact that it had been made very clear, in an award of the Privy 
Council for instance, that labour relations comes under the 
jurisdiction of the provinces did not stop the government from 
interfering to an extent that considerably exceeded its powers in an 
area which is the very heart of labour relations, addressing issues 
such as the hours of work and work week reduction in a study it 
recently commissioned.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1631"> 1631 </A></B>
<P>
	Again, we have no problem with the other provinces looking 
to make other arrangements, but Quebec, through its deliberating 
bodies and institutions, unanimously rejected this bill.
<P>
	Had Kim Campbell, who was the Prime Minister of Canada for a 
short time, not amalgamated under the same umbrella several 
social-oriented departments, the federal government would not be 
in the situation it is today. Probably preparing to launch the kind of 
reform the Liberal government is carrying out now, former Prime 
Minister Campbell had acted according to her senior officials' 
recommendations. I take it that they are the ones who develop 
policy, because the government has changed but policy has 
remained the same.
<P>
	After the former Prime Minister merged several departments, 
the Liberal government, instead of straightening things out, started 
where the Conservatives had left off when they were voted out of 
office, very shortly after the merger took place. It is important to 
mention this connection.
<P>
<B>(1050)</B>
<P>
	By merging different departments, none of which had originally 
been given the powers set out in this act, which was only supposed 
to make them into one department, the government had the means 
to carry out its proposed social reform, now abandoned I guess, but 
whose few aspects that did get implemented certainly hint at the 
direction the government is taking and will continue to follow.
<P>
	It is a good idea to read over the main clauses, which caused all 
the organizations and institutions concerned in Quebec to object. 
Clause 6 reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>6. The powers, duties and functions of the Minister extend to and include all 
matters over which Parliament has jurisdiction relating to the development of 
the human resources of Canada not by law assigned to any other Minister, 
department, board or agency of the Government of Canada, and are to be 
exercised with the objective of enhancing employment, encouraging equality 
and promoting social security.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It is understandable that a country may have a problem with the 
provinces claiming that they have such powers when the central 
government claims to have the same powers. This is a mess that 
clearly shows how inefficient Canada is in these areas as compared 
to other other countries.
<P>
	This next clause speaks volumes:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>For the purpose of facilitating the formulation, coordination and 
implementation of any program or policy relating to the powers, duties and 
functions referred to in section 6, the Minister may enter into agreements with a 
province-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	But does it stop there? No. Earlier bills did provide that the 
minister could enter into agreements with a province. This makes 
sense.
<P>
	However, it goes on to say ``or a group of provinces''. This too 
makes sense, but again it should be  possible for a province that 
pulls out get compensation for the funds that it would otherwise be 
denied. As you can see, this is the stuff of constitutional debates. 
And I read on: ``agencies of provinces, financial institutions and 
such other persons or bodies as the Minister considers 
appropriate''.
<P>
	This clause is far reaching. It indicates the government's firm 
intention to exercise the power to plan, organize, and control, in 
other words to manage the human resources development in 
Canada.
<P>
	I will read another clause, which complements this one, before 
moving on to the consequences.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Commission shall exercise such powers and perform such duties and 
functions</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(a) in relation to unemployment insurance, employment services and the 
development and utilization of labour market resources, as are required by 
the Minister or by or pursuant to an Act of Parliament;</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Apart from the twisted French, which talks about maximizing 
human means-as opposed to inhuman means, perhaps-there is 
much twisting of the Cconstitution.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(b) in relation to other matters, as are required by order of the Governor in 
Council or by or pursuant to an Act of Parliament.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In short, the unemployment commission can get any power it 
wants besides those included in its original constituent act, because 
it is being changed.
<P>
	With this bill, the federal government will have the means to 
pursue a centralizing policy, in spite of the soothing remarks made, 
among others, by the youngest and newest minister, recently sent to 
the House in a byelection, the member for 
Saint-Laurent-Cartierville.
<P>
<B>(1055)</B>
<P>
	Reading the description of the main elements of this bill, one can 
understand why Quebec institutions, agencies, and bodies are very 
strongly opposed to this measure. It was to be expected.
<P>
	On the union front, for instance, a communiqué issued by Henri 
Massé, the secretary-general of the Quebec federation of labour, 
reads as follows: ``We do not want Ottawa to interfere any longer in 
this issue or to ignore us in setting parallel structures. Quebec has 
set up its own preferred partnership structure in that sector, the 
Société québécoise de développement de la main-d'oeuvre. There 
is a broad consensus to the effect that Quebec must have sole 
responsibility over work force adaptation and vocational training 
policies on its territory, and must consequently patriate the federal 
budgets allocated to these programs. Even the Conseil du patronat 
agrees with the unions''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1632"> 1632 </A></B>
<P>
	A release from the Canadian Institute of Adult Education reads 
as follows: ``With this bill, the federal government shows a blatant 
lack of respect for the  aspirations of the provinces, particularly 
those of Quebec in the fields of education and manpower training 
and development. Indeed, clauses 6 and 20 of the bill-the ones I 
quoted-leave absolutely no doubt as to the centralizing intentions 
of the federal government in these sectors''.
<P>
	The Société québécoise de développement de la main-d'oeuvre, 
which includes all the major partners in Quebec, also strongly 
condemned this bill.
<P>
	This is not the first time that the central government attempts to 
set up a structure in that sector that is similar to the one put in place 
by Quebec. The federalist Liberal government of Robert Bourassa, 
through its manpower minister, Mr. Bourbeau, corresponded with 
Mr. Valcourt who, at the time, wanted to reach various groups and 
organizations through such a network by awarding lucrative 
contracts, in an attempt to invade Quebec's jurisdiction.
<P>
	Mr. Bourbeau who, as I said, is a federalist, strongly opposed 
such an idea. He said, in 1991: ``Quebec does indeed recognize the 
crying need for it to define its own manpower policies, to establish 
its priorities with respect to manpower development in close 
conjunction with its partners in the labour market, and then to set 
up programs tailored to the needs it has set as priorities and to 
manage them through an agency that would call for input from 
those partners''.
<P>
	Mr. Bourbeau continues: ``Already, Mrs. McDougall-who was 
Mr. Valcourt's predecessor-would have liked the Government of 
Quebec to negotiate an agreement with the federal government, in 
line with the Canadian labour force development strategy. 
Personally, I have asked that bilateral negotiations be conducted, in 
the hope that they would lead to an administrative arrangement 
under which the federal government would have transferred to 
Quebec the budgets that it normally allocates to manpower 
programs, including the moneys taken from the unemployment 
insurance fund, which come from the contributions of employers 
and workers''. Mr. Bourbeau is referring to correspondence that 
was exchanged before 1991. What did Mrs. McDougall answer? 
Barbara McDougall indicated that the federal government was 
linking Quebec's claims with what? With the constitutional review 
process.
<P>
<B>(1100)</B>
<P>
	This exchange of correspondence forms the very substance of 
Bill C-11. The current federal government, instead of respecting 
Quebec's will, is proceeding unilaterally like none of the previous 
governments had dared to.
<P>
	They indeed followed in the steps of the Conservatives, but they 
did even worse, like in many areas such as in the reform of social 
programs.
<P>
	Further on, what does Mr. Bourbeau say about the groups, 
organizations or persons with whom the central  government 
wanted to enter into agreements? He says this: ``I understand now 
that the employment and immigration commission has decided not 
to follow up on the agreements I had made with the previous holder 
of the employment and immigration portfolio. Indeed, your 
commission is offering to so-called co-ordination groups grants for 
all kinds of projects directly or indirectly related to manpower 
training. Those co-ordination groups are employer associations, 
community groups, chambers of commerce, economic 
development organizations, educational institutions.''
<P>
	He adds: ``These projects are questionable. These initiatives, 
contrary to the commitments made, contribute to creating new 
groups or to expanding the mandate of existing groups''. And he 
concludes: ``This is doing indirectly what the government had 
made a commitment not to do directly''.
<P>
	He adds further on: ``All objective observers find that Canada 
and Quebec are falling disturbingly behind compared with our 
main competitors''. That was in 1991; we are now in 1996, and the 
Liberal federal government, instead of dealing with the problem 
and solving it, keeps on procrastinating, even after the referendum 
where, short of 52,000 votes only, Quebec did not achieve 
sovereignty.
<P>
	The general outcry in Quebec, far from being surprising, is the 
result of a historical movement that cannot be stopped. However, 
how did the human resources development committee react to 
these pressures from Quebec? Let me give you an example. I asked 
that major institutions, major representatives of Quebec be heard 
on this issue. The committee refused. What groups were these? The 
Société québécoise de développement de la main-d'oeuvre, which 
includes representatives of the business sector, unions, citizens' 
committees, municipalities and government. The Canadian 
Institute of Adult Education was another. The Quebec employment 
development minister also asked to appear before the committee, 
and labour organizations, the Association des manufacturiers du 
Québec, the Fédération des professeurs d'université, the 
Mouvement Desjardins, among others, have made the same 
request. The committee refused.
<P>
	At the second reading stage, I moved an amendment in the 
House which said this: ``That all words following the word 'That' 
be deleted and replaced with the following: 'this House declines to 
give second reading to Bill C-96, an act to establish the Department 
of Human Resources Development and to amend and repeal certain 
related acts, because the principle of the bill includes no provision 
requiring the minister, as part of that person's powers, to award full 
and entire financial compensation to any province wishing to 
exercise, fully and alone, jurisdiction over human resources 
development'''.
<P>
<B></B>

<HR>

<P>
<B>(1105)</B>
<P>
	Had the government been willing to send a positive message in 
the aftermath of the referendum, it was easy to do so. It could have 
recognized in this bill the right to opt out in this matter which is 
constitutional in nature as I have demonstrated.
<P>
	The new throne speech, the one delivered on February 27, does 
not leave any doubt about the intent of the government. What does 
the Prime Minister say in the throne speech? ``The government will 
not use its spending power to create new shared-cost programs in 
areas of exclusive provincial jurisdiction without the consent of a 
majority of the provinces''. Any new program will be designed so 
that non-participating provinces will be compensated, provided 
they establish equivalent or comparable initiatives in a provincial 
area of jurisdiction''. Is that what the so-called spirit of 
decentralization of this central government is all about?
<P>
	Given the way this bill was drafted and designed, it cannot be 
effectively amended, since it deals with constitutional issues, 
except through the amendment that we put forward at second 
reading and that was negatived by a majority in the House.
<P>
	We are dealing here with an area of exclusive provincial 
jurisdiction, but the government flatly refuses to recognize this 
exclusive jurisdiction. It is turning its spending power into a legal 
and legislative power in order to interfere without considering the 
rights of the provinces. Nowhere in the various acts establishing 
the former departments that were consolidated was the right of the 
central government to reach agreements with stakeholders other 
than the provinces recognized. There is something in the vocational 
training legislation, but the government only undertakes to consult 
the provinces, nothing more.
<P>
	That augurs ill. Despite its expressed will to recognize the right 
of the provinces, the federal government is giving itself a lot of 
leeway in the bill concerning unemployment insurance reform, 
except in one very narrow area, that is the vocational training field, 
which is already under Quebec's jurisdiction.
<P>
<B>(1110)</B>
<P>
	Time and time again, we have had some very troubling 
discussions in this House, where the Prime Minister himself, after 
showing some openness where labour training and adjustment are 
concerned, changed his mind. He very clearly stated on several 
occasions that Canada would not eliminate the so-called proactive 
measures, such as the labour adjustment measures.
<P>
	It was only during a scrum, after several days of heated 
exchanges in this House, that, recognizingd the consensus in 
Quebec, the Minister of Human Resources Development asked to 
reopen negotiations. But what he had said before did not leave us 
with much hope.
<P>
	I would add that, as it is, the bill gives the government the power 
to do as it pleases in the provinces' jurisdiction with the money 
collected from workers and businesses and, in some cases, with 
everybody's money. It will be up to the government to decide if 
there is an agreement, as we all deeply wish, but also to decide for 
how long and in what specific area the agreement will apply.
<P>
	In view of all other areas covered by the name of this 
Department of Human Resources Development and of the way the 
clauses are formulated, the central government will be able to 
interfere in these areas on account of its spending power.
<P>
	This has not been often stated in this House, but the spending 
power is not entrenched in the Constitution. I still have to use this 
word. While the efficiency of this program could be ensured in 
Quebec through coordination and management, control and 
planning by our own institutions and maximizing scarce resources, 
the funds are not used in the most efficient way because, at least in 
Quebec, the central government insists on being the one to plan, 
organize, manage and control.
<P>
	Indeed, the government can say that it will sign contracts with 
this group, this organization or that person. The government is the 
one to decide the terms of the contract. This is a most efficient and 
rigorous way of setting national standards. The government will 
decide which needy group will get some money, regardless of the 
strategy, priorities and conditions set by Quebec. This is nonsense.
<P>
	I read earlier a letter from 1991 referring to discussions with 
Mrs. McDougall that go back well before that date. As you can see, 
Quebec is not moving forward but backwards, because, in 1991, 
Mr. Valcourt did not dare to go ahead in spite of Quebec's 
opposition. He did not dare ignore the agreement in place.
<P>
<B>(1115)</B>
<P>
	Unfortunately, we must face the fact that Canadian federalism, 
since its inception, has always developed in the same direction, that 
of centralization. Again, it is quite possible and understandable, 
and we have nothing against it, that the other provinces and the 
central government decide to do things differently. If the other 
provinces do not care about what is in the Constitution, as long as 
they find the agreements adequate, it is fine by us.
<P>
	I often noticed that the other provinces do not feel threatened by 
the central government. For instance, they did not feel threatened 
when the government passed Bill C-28 in 1994. I am sure that this 
legislation can be challenged under the Constitution because it 
enables the central government to designate those who will set out 
the conditions for granting scholarships to students. This has very 
substantial implications on the type of students that will enrol in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1634"> 1634 </A></B>
<P>
colleges and universities, i.e. those who  can afford to study. It is a 
very serious issue for the provinces, but they did not protest.
<P>
	The right of withdrawal became much more stringent, new 
conditions were added to it; the Bloc Quebecois objected to these 
conditions, but the provinces did not protest. That the central 
government or a financial institution can designate those who will 
set out the conditions that the students will have to meet in order to 
get a scholarship, I can respect that, but in Quebec, it cannot work 
this way.
<P>
	In this bill, there was an historical recognition of Quebec's right 
to opt out with compensation. This right is nowhere to be seen in 
the bill. In Bill C-96, the government gives itself the power to 
decide alone how the Department of Human Resources will use the 
money. With the groups, there is no condition, no consultation. The 
government decides.
<P>
	We are even a long way from the situation at the beginning of the 
1960s. I have done so already, but I will read one more time the 
conclusions of a document presented by René Lévesque at the 
January 1966 federal-provincial conference on poverty. I will go 
over it rapidly in conclusion.
<P>
	Here is what it said: ``The establishment of a real economic and 
social development policy is now urgent. This policy must be 
integrated, flexible in its application and provide for a social 
security system centered on the family and based on the right to 
assistance suited to the needs. For efficiency and constitutional 
reasons, the Government of Quebec is the only one which can and 
should, within its territory, conceive and implement such a policy. 
Consequently, Quebec cannot accept that the Government of 
Canada assume this responsibility. Quebec does not, however, 
exclude interprovincial cooperation and mutual consultation''.
<P>
<B>(1120)</B>
<P>
	Mr. Lévesque went on to say: ``The economic and social 
development policy that we are developing will integrate a social 
policy, a regional development policy, a manpower policy, a health 
policy, a housing policy, a job training policy'', and we could say a 
human resources development policy. ``All these policies have not 
been described in this document, but it is important to indicate in 
these conclusions that we intend to use them all as a means of 
meeting our objectives.
<P>
	``This comprehensive policy will not necessarily be in line, in its 
spirit and its application, with one the Government of Canada 
might opt for, but it will not necessarily go against it. However, the 
advantages that the people of Quebec will get from this policy will 
at least be equal, for efficiency and constitutional reasons, to those 
other Canadians might enjoy''.
<P>
	We have gone back a very long way from this statement of 
principle and from this description of a plan by a federalist 
provincial government. We have gone  back a very long way. Bill 
C-11 is totally unacceptable, it cannot be amended, and that is why, 
besides wishing that a new referendum on Quebec sovereignty be 
held soon, I propose this morning an amendment to the motion for 
third reading to have the bill withdrawn and the subject matter 
referred to a committee.
<P>
	I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the motion be amended by deleting all the words after the word ``That'' 
and substituting the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``Bill C-11, An Act to establish the Department of Human Resources 
Development and to amend and repeal certain related Acts, be not now read a

Resources Development.''</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased today to speak to the amended motion. I have looked 
forward to this opportunity for some time because what we are 
looking at is the last piece of enabling legislation for the House to 
consider.
<P>
<B>(1125 )</B>
<P>
	Certainly after two years and some months of being in the 
House, it could not be more timely. Also of interest, it is the last 
piece of legislation to implement what I call the Kim Campbell 
cabinet.
<P>
	I oppose the bill for a number of reasons and I will list them. It 
gives to the federal government powers to circumvent the 
provinces when establishing programs and initiatives through 
HRD.
<P>
	I oppose the cheap partisan reason for the creation of the 
ministry of labour and I oppose the way the government is 
attempting to hide information from Canadians by eliminating the 
provision to create an annual report for the department.
<P>
	I will spend some time speaking to the specifics. As I mentioned, 
my colleagues and I have legitimate and valid concerns about the 
legislation. In particular, there is an area of the bill which we 
believe provides the federal government with new powers to enter 
into agreements with agencies, groups or agents and allows the 
federal government to entertain these co-operative agreements 
without first having approached the provincial governments.
<P>
	We have all heard the Minister of Human Resources 
Development naysay that challenge. We believe that simply put the 
bill gives the government the opportunity  to circumvent the 
provinces 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1635"> 1635 </A></B>
<P>
when delivering social programs or any of the services relevant to 
the Department of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	This kind of federal power grab runs contrary to the 
contemporary federal trend toward decentralization. We have spent 
many hours in the House in debate and in question period 
discussing that very point. Remember that the Liberal government 
promised Canadians during the Quebec referendum campaign that 
among other things it would move to greater decentralization. 
There has been zero movement on this front.
<P>
	In this bill there is a marvellous example of a federal attempt to 
nationalize powers that did not exist before. This is a very old 
approach to government. This is the Trudeau approach. It is an 
approach which began just after the second world war, one which 
does not suit the needs of people in Canada today.
<P>
	First year students in Canadian politics learn that Canada has a 
rigid constitution. It is rigid in the sense that constitutional 
amendments are not easily made. As is well known, it was 
extremely difficult to amend the British North America Act. We 
need not remind anyone that amending the Constitution has not 
been made any easier by the Canadian Constitution Act, as events 
since 1982 have so clearly demonstrated.
<P>
	Amending procedures were not spelled out in the BNA. The 
result is that we had precious few constitutional amendments 
between 1867 and 1982. It will also be recalled that the BNA 
sought to establish a highly centralized union but that various 
judicial interpretations made it a more decentralized union. In 
addition, the Fathers of Confederation felt that in turning over 
responsibility for education, health and social welfare to the 
provinces they were dealing with jurisdictions that were not 
important and local in character. It also explains why Ottawa's 
power of taxation far exceeds its constitutional responsibilities.
<P>
	The Fathers of Confederation gave the federal government 
power to raise moneys by ``any mode or system of taxation''. It is 
important to bear in mind the role of government in 1867 was 
highly limited.
<P>
	The Rowell-Sirois commission pointed out: ``The principal 
functions of the state followed the prescriptions of Adam Smith. 
Government was thought to have met its purpose when it provided 
for adequate defence, the enforcement of the general law for the 
administration of justice and the maintenance of a few essential 
public works''.
<P>
	In addition, Canadian society in 1867 was still largely a pioneer 
in rural society. Accordingly, it had clearly an individualistic 
outlook and a reliance on the family as the unit of mutual welfare.
<P>
	The Great Depression would change all of that. Franklin D. 
Roosevelt's new deal would lead the way for governments in 
western industrialized countries to  intervene to soften the sting of 
economic misfortune. Lord Keynes, a noted Cambridge economist, 
was quick to provide the intellectual underpinnings for government 
intervention in the economy to mitigate the lows in economic 
cycles.
<P>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
	In brief, Keynesian logic provided a basis for counter-cyclical 
budgeting. It also provided a basis for government programs and 
measures to stabilize the economy, to promote economic 
development and full employment. It suggested that with latent 
demand and no limit in factors of production, governments could 
actually create the long sought after prosperous and rational 
societies desired.
<P>
	Keynesian economics also legitimized government deficits and 
in time governments would spend more, tax more and borrow 
more, a great deal more. Does this not sound an awful lot like the 
fiscal policies of today's Liberal government?
<P>
	It is this Keynesianism gone wild that causes the Minister of 
Human Resources Development and his bureaucrats to propose 
clauses like the ones in this bill that instead of allowing the 
provinces to manage their own affairs, allows the federal 
government to grab more power.
<P>
	The Keynesian revolution captured the Department of Finance in 
Canada as it did the treasuries of other western countries. 
Canadians emerged from the second world war determined never to 
permit another depression of the kind witnessed in the 1930s.
<P>
	In addition, by war's end, Canadians held a strong belief in the 
ability of government to intervene and manage the economy. 
Canadians had learned during the war that governments were able 
in moments of crisis and when moved by an all consuming goal to 
lead the country to high levels of economic activity and 
employment.
<P>
	Not only did the allies win the war, but governments had 
managed the war economy well. Unemployment had fallen to zero, 
yet prices had been held down. Given this, no one was surprised 
when the Government of Canada presented a major policy paper to 
Parliament toward the end of the war which was Keynesian in 
outlook. It said: ``The government will be prepared in periods 
where unemployment threatens to incur deficits and increases in 
the national debt resulting from its employment and income policy. 
In periods of buoyant employment and income, budget plans will 
call for surpluses''.
<P>
	However the expected severe post-war economic downturn did 
not materialize and the measure that the federal government had 
prepared proved unnecessary. Still, Ottawa became convinced that 
it possessed a new arsenal of economic policy to achieve high 
unemployment and more generally to manage the national 
economy.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1636"> 1636 </A></B>
<P>
	At the risk of stating the obvious, Keynesian economics looks 
to the national economy and to promoting balance in economic 
cycles when formulating policy prescriptions and to the national 
government as the key economic factor. The important point here 
is that Keynesian economics has a strong centralization bias. It 
looks to national fiscal policies, national industrial strategies and 
to national programs to develop the national economy. In short, 
Roosevelt and Keynesian economics would turn national 
governments loose on national economies.
<P>
	Convinced that it had found the holy grail of economic policy, it 
had only to look to what other more western industrialized 
countries were doing to confirm their findings. Ottawa nevertheless 
recognized that it did not have the necessary jurisdictions to 
manage the national economy and to promote the positive state. 
The findings of the Rowell-Sirois royal commission had told it as 
much when it began to table its findings in 1940.
<P>
	Ottawa also was all too well aware that given the inherent 
rigidity of the written Constitution, it could not count on 
constitutional amendments to give life to the welfare state. In 
addition, in the rare instances when it was able to secure a 
constitutional amendment, it only served to create shared 
jurisdictions.
<P>
	For example, the 1951 amendment to the BNA which gave 
Ottawa authority to establish the old age security program made 
pensions a matter of shared federal-provincial jurisdiction. I will 
not even begin to comment on old age security, which we know as 
OAS, because as we all know the Liberals ostensibly killed it 
despite their campaign promises to the contrary.
<P>
<B>(1135 )</B>
<P>
	This bill allows the government to grab more powers in keeping 
with the Keynesian principles I have already explained within a 
historical context.
<P>
	The rigidity of the Constitution led the federal government to 
find ways to circumvent its provisions and to develop new 
mechanisms to implement a new economic order. The federal 
government would identify for itself a role in many areas of 
provincial responsibility through extensive use of its spending 
power. In time a whole edifice of federal-provincial programs in 
areas of provincial jurisdiction was put in place although such 
programs remain unmentioned in our written Constitution.
<P>
	The clauses in this bill with which we are concerned will provide 
the federal government the opportunity to create joint programs 
with municipalities. This constitutional breach has been 
circumvented. Ironically municipalities are not even 
constitutionally recognized entities. These are big questions to ask 
and to answer.
<P>
	The written Constitution in the end appears to matter little to 
federal policy makers. Ottawa in the post-war period attracted 
some of the best and the brightest  determined to build a modern, 
positive state. Fuelled by tax money from a rapidly expanding 
post-war economy and convinced that only the federal government 
could put into practice the lessons learned from Keynesian 
economics, Ottawa promoted a new constitutional doctrine which 
ignored the written Constitution.
<P>
	Donald Smiley, one of Canada's leading constitutional scholars, 
explained: ``According to the constitutional doctrine that came to 
prevail, the central government might legally spend revenues as it 
chose, even on matters within the jurisdiction of the provinces, and 
could at its discretion fix the circumstances under which a potential 
recipient might receive the federal largesse''.
<P>
	Bill C-11 allows the federal government to enter into agreements 
now with agencies and municipalities. The reason for this is so the 
federal government can continue to dole out that largesse and take 
credit for it. It is simple to understand. The federal government is 
reducing transfers to the provinces and as a result it is losing its 
clout, its ability to dictate how the money is spent. Therefore, it is 
losing its ability to buy votes by proclaiming how it is giving out 
the dole at the provincial level.
<P>
	However, the Liberal need to buy votes through empty rhetoric 
and equally empty promises remains just as strong today as it ever 
was. In order to be able to buy those votes the federal government 
is now compelled to deal directly with agencies and municipalities.
<P>
	The federal government did not wait long after World War II to 
introduce measures in the areas of health care and social policy. 
Within 20 years it would put in place a wide array of 
federal-provincial measures ranging from old age pensions to the 
establishment of a national health care program. In time the federal 
government would introduce its own programs and carve out for 
itself a powerful role and presence in virtually every sector in the 
economy.
<P>
	When it opted for conditional grants it essentially intervened in 
provincial fields on its own terms. In the end it was able to carve 
out a role for itself in the provision of welfare assistance, in 
assisting the unemployed, in post-secondary education, in 
medicare, in energy, in industrial development, in economic 
development and so on.
<P>
	The desire and ability of the federal government to intervene in 
areas of provincial jurisdiction did not wane in the 1970s. In the 
early 1970s the federal Department of Regional Economic 
Expansion introduced a new approach to economic development. 
In doing so, Ottawa signed a series of general development 
agreements, known as GDAs, with the provinces.
<P>
	The GDAs were enabling documents in that they cleared the way 
for the federal government to support whatever measures were 
regarded appropriate to local, provincial and regional economic 
circumstances. It is not  an exaggeration to suggest that the GDA 
approach essentially tossed aside our written Constitution to enable 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1637"> 1637 </A></B>
<P>
government to support whatever it felt was necessary to promote 
economic development.
<P>
	A cursory look at the activities sponsored by the GDAs and their 
replacement agreements reveal an incredible array of measures and 
initiatives. No economic sector was considered off limits.
<P>
<B>(1140)</B>
<P>
	One corollary of this blurring of the constitutional lines is to 
confuse not just at the government level but more important at the 
level of the citizenry exactly which level of government is 
responsible for which service. The clauses in this bill which give 
new and greater powers to the provinces do nothing to redirect the 
constitutional blurring of the jurisdictional lines. In fact it only 
contributes to more blurring as now we can add another layer of 
government to the confusion.
<P>
	As well, it has also given rise to overlap and duplication in 
government programs and to a costly government overhead. Try 
counting the number of units in the federal government sporting the 
labels of liaison, co-ordination, federal-provincial relations and 
intergovernmental relations, to describe what they do. Now we will 
have to add yet another level to this red tape insanity.
<P>
	Countless meetings are held every month to administer 
federal-provincial programs and agreements. We should bear in 
mind that Ottawa spends over $20 billion a year to pay federal 
public servants and to provide them with office space and other 
administrative arrangements. I can only imagine just how much 
more money this bill will end up costing Canadian taxpayers as it 
adds another layer to that already overburdened bureaucracy.
<P>
	My colleague from Mission-Coquitlam moved an amendment 
to redress the offending clauses to which I have been referring. She 
moved an amendment that before the federal government enters 
directly into agreements with agencies or municipalities of a 
province that it first consult with and receive the approval of the 
lieutenant governor of the province in question.
<P>
	The amendment was reasonable. It would still have allowed the 
federal government to enter into such agreements, even though of 
course we oppose them, but it would only have then required that 
the federal government inform the provinces of the actions about to 
be undertaken. However, the Liberals needed so badly to 
implement their vote buying clause that they refused to entertain 
this reasonable amendment.
<P>
	I used to think that we were here in the House to work together. 
However, cynical partisan moves like that cause me to be 
circumspect. They cause me to believe that the Liberals are not 
really here for the betterment of our country. They are really only 
here to maintain the status quo, to hold onto power at all costs, even 
if it  means willingly and knowingly doing the wrong thing and 
implementing vote buying policies just as those in this bill.
<P>
	I have great concerns that Bill C-11 will go another step down 
the road to giving the federal government greater powers, despite 
what it says. Not only will it create overlap and duplication, it will 
probably cost us billions of dollars all for the sake of buying 
Liberal votes.
<P>
	Speaking of buying Liberal votes, that brings me to my second 
concern over this bill, which is the creation of the Ministry of 
Labour. This bill finally enables the last of the Kim Campbell 
cabinet departments.
<P>
	In 1993 when the Prime Minister named his cabinet he did not 
name a minister for labour. Not a single Liberal complained then 
that such a position was necessary. Why was that? Because the job 
can be accomplished within the Department of Human Resources 
Development. We do not need an expensive portfolio for an issue 
that can be covered by other ministers. For almost two years the 
Liberals agreed with us on this point. Why did they change their 
minds? What caused the epiphany?
<P>
	When the Liberals took power in 1993 they did not see a need for 
this individual or the assignment of this ministry. We did not hear a 
peep from anybody. However the Prime Minister changed his mind 
in February 1995. In order to entice the so-called star candidate 
from Quebec to run in a Quebec byelection, the Prime Minister 
promised her a new cabinet seat if she agreed to run. She agreed 
and they created the Ministry of Labour for her.
<P>
	Let us face facts. The Liberals only created the job to satisfy 
their partisan backroom interests. Their focus was not labour; it 
was about their own job creation formula to entice a so-called star 
candidate.
<P>
	During report stage on Bill C-11 we heard a lot of sanctimonious 
talk from the Liberals. They pretended to be the friends of labour. 
We know the truth, do we not?
<P>
	The Reform Party has nothing to learn from the federal Liberal 
Party when it comes to labour relations and how to treat people. 
Our policies clearly state that we recognize the right of workers to 
organize unions, to strike peacefully and to carry out the business 
of collective bargaining.
<P>
<B>(1145)</B>
<P>
	The Liberals cancelled the federal public service workforce 
adjustment directive. I wonder how many Liberals campaigned on 
a promise to fire 45,000 public service workers. How many of them 
were honest enough to tell their constituents that as part of their 
job, job, job program they meant to fire 45,000 civil servants? I 
wonder how many of these Liberals campaigned on a promise to 
allow collective bargaining except, of course, when there is a strike 
in the port system. They were all very quick to force labour back to 
work, were they not?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1638"> 1638 </A></B>
<P>
	I wonder how many in the labour movement know that the 
Liberal Minister of Human Resources Development refuses to 
meet with the head of the Canadian Labour Congress. Over and 
over again in committee there have been complaints regarding this 
very action, or lack of action, on the part of the minister. This 
is what Liberals mean about being open to the concerns of 
Canadians. They refuse to even meet with labour leaders.
<P>
	Also how many on that side of the House campaigned for quota 
based employment equity legislation like the kind they rammed 
through the House? The Liberal record speaks for itself. When it 
comes to labour issues, this government should be ashamed.
<P>
	The Reform Party has clearly and honestly established its 
position regarding the existence of the job of Minister of Labour. 
Reform favours smaller, less expensive government that 
effectively provides services for Canadians where they cannot 
provide for themselves. To this end we believe that labour issues 
should be managed by the Department of Human Resources 
Development. As the Liberals first believed in 1993 there is no 
need for this position. The difference is that Reform is consistent 
on labour issues. Our Liberal colleagues appear not to be. They 
have flip-flopped all over the place on labour issues.
<P>
	My final disagreement with Bill C-11 pertains to the fact that the 
government is trying to hide from Canadians both its performance 
and its future plans. It is doing this by eliminating the requirement 
for the production of an annual report. Indeed, this is really quite 
alarming when it is taken at face value. Colleagues on the other 
side of the House will say that it is just because they are really 
trying to reduce costs but this is a matter of financial accountability 
and certainly in terms of performance standards in any corporate 
sector would be an obvious expectation from a board of directors.
<P>
	We had proposed an amendment that would require the Minister 
of Human Resources Development to table an annual report to the 
House. Typically the Liberals rejected this proposal. Anything that 
appears to promote open and honest government they oppose.
<P>
	Bill C-11 as presented does not require an annual report to be 
made from the department. I am concerned that this may be just 
another way for the government to withhold information from the 
House of Commons and the people of Canada. I believe it should 
be mandatory for all government departments to publish annual 
reports and for the purpose of accountability they should be placed 
before Parliament.
<P>
	As part of the new program review, the federal government is 
changing the production of the estimates. It suggests that in a few 
years it will make the estimates more user friendly, whatever that 
means, and that more useful and practical information will be 
included in the  estimates. The government suggests that annual 
reports are so general that they border on being useless.
<P>
	Every bill that has been introduced to create a new department 
has had the annual report component deleted. The government has 
deleted the requirement for the production of departmental annual 
reports. Our amendment would have required the government to 
continue producing that annual report component for each of those 
departments.
<P>
	We are sceptical of the process for improving the estimates. At 
minimum, until such improvements have been made, annual 
reports should be continued. Until the estimates are improved, the 
lack of annual reports will result in the Canadian public receiving 
less information from government. In effect the Liberals are trying 
to hide, at least it appears, information from Canadians about the 
workings of their government.
<P>
	We all know that the red book promises more open government. 
This is open government? No more annual reports is open 
government? I do not think so.
<P>
	Reform exists to change government. Liberals had an 
opportunity to demonstrate to Canadians that they were willing to 
open up government and to allow Canadians greater access to all 
information regarding how it operates. It should not be a secret. 
What is the government trying to hide? It had the chance to open 
itself up to greater public scrutiny and it chose to hide.
<P>
<B>(1150)</B>
<P>
	It is taxpayer money that the Liberals are spending, my money 
and yours, Mr. Speaker. Canadians should know how and where 
their money is going.
<P>
	The government, by opposing our amendment, proved to 
Canadians that it does not give the appearance of caring about 
accountability or openness. I ask the question again: What is the 
government trying to hide? Is this just another way for the Liberals 
to address their dismal failure on the deficit fight? They will not 
make public or even produce an annual report for this department, 
one of the largest spenders in the government.
<P>
	This department is huge. Canadians, thanks to the Liberals, will 
not be able to keep track of its developments. The government says 
its estimates will be improved but it also said it would scrap the 
GST, and we know where we are at with that right now. Who are we 
to believe? Is this a case of what we do not know will not hurt us? 
Maybe that is why the government did not mention the debt in the 
budget speech. Ignore it and perhaps everyone else will too.
<P>
	The Liberals should talk about it. They should admit that they 
have been responsible for the growth of the debt since 1968 and 
honestly attack the debt problem. We are seeing no action.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1639"> 1639 </A></B>
<P>
	I insist that we need an annual report for this department. I 
believe with the inclusion of the amendments the Reform Party 
suggested, Bill C-11 would be a much better bill. The amendments 
would make the department more forward thinking in its approach 
to problems and certainly more accountable.
<P>
	If the Reform amendments had been approved and passed in the 
House we could have supported this bill. However, we have 
attempted to improve the bill and yet again the government has 
resisted.
<P>
	Given that the government has clearly made a substantial new 
power grab in this bill and given that it refused even to listen to 
Reform's reasoned compromise, we cannot support it.

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Guelph-Wellington, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak to Bill C-11, 
the act to establish the Department of Human Resources 
Development.
<P>
	This legislation is part of the overall efforts of this Liberal 
government to get government right, to reduce program overlap 
and to control costs.
<P>
	The government prides itself in not forgetting the human 
element in all that it does. I find it important that the first word in 
the new department is in fact ``human''. Guelph-Wellington is a 
community where people care for one another. We are strong 
because volunteers and other caregivers reach out to assist those in 
need, the vulnerable, the aged and the many people in our 
community who need a hand during a difficult time.
<P>
	We are fortunate to have such organizations as Block Parents, 
Change Now, Seniors Peer Advisory, Stepping Stone and 
Wyndham House that provide assistance, information, life skills 
and, most important, a smile for people in times of crisis.
<P>
	The dedicated staff and volunteers of these and hundreds of other 
organizations in my community want government to assist them as 
they assist others. They want us to improve efficiency. This 
legislation brings together parts of several former departments in 
order to focus on human resource programs.
<P>
	Portions of employment and immigration, health and welfare, 
secretary of state and labour have been gathered together in order 
to focus on employment and income security matters. By focusing, 
the government can offer one coherent approach to the fundamental 
issues of  dealing with Canadians in need. That really is what 
governments need to be about.
<P>
	Guelph-Wellington uses its resources to build the greatest 
community in Canada. Therefore I am pleased that the second word 
in this new department is ``resources''. We often speak of natural 
resources, wood, coal, water and minerals, when we describe our 
country.
<P>
<B>(1155)</B>
<P>
	The government knows that its greatest resource is its people. 
The central question for the government has been, how do it use the 
resources to better serve the Canadian people? All around the 
country, individual Canadians as well as private industry, have had 
to reorganize in order to provide service in a different way. 
Canadians must be encouraged to think differently about how 
government relates to them. That does not mean that inadequate or 
poor service should be offered to the taxpayer.
<P>
	The people who rely on the government for pensions, income 
support programs, unemployment insurance and labour market and 
employment information deserve the best service that they can get. 
However, the deficit crisis means that services must be provided 
differently.
<P>
	One of the more unique ways is the new service delivery 
network. This includes conventional offices, electronic information 
kiosks, on-line services and community partnerships. This new 
information service will also offer two-way communication with 
clients across Canada. Its goal is to reduce costs, something the 
Reform Party should be pleased about, and to improve and expand 
client access, again, something I would hope all parties would be 
pleased about. The new service delivery network, like the 
Department of Human Resources Development, is using its 
resources to better serve all Canadians.
<P>
	The final word in the department is perhaps its most interesting 
``development''. We are talking here about many of the social 
programs that were developed by Liberal governments.
<P>
	Whether it was the first Department of Labour established in 
1900, the first Veterans Pension Act in 1919, Old Age Pensions Act 
in 1927, Unemployment Insurance Act in 1940, Family Allowance 
Act in 1944, universal pensions in 1952, the Canada pension plan 
and medicare in 1966, or the Canada Health Act in 1984, Liberals 
have had a long and important tradition of developing programs 
that provide assistance to Canadians.
<P>
	This is nothing new. This is what Liberalism is. This is what 
Liberals stand for in this House today. Liberals have always had to 
fight off the naysayers, just as I hear from the Reform Party right 
now, who reject efforts to help each other through difficult times, to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1640"> 1640 </A></B>
<P>
provide extra  assistance in raising families, in our senior years or 
when we are sick.
<P>
	Let us not forget, especially as there are members in the House 
of Commons today who want to take away these programs, that it 
was the social support programs that have made Canada the 
greatest nation on the earth. The opposition parties, in particular, 
should always remember that it was by the development of 
programs like unemployment insurance and universal pensions that 
Canada is respected in every single corner of the world.
<P>
	Liberals know we have to continue to develop resources, to 
provide better service to Canadians. Like many service based 
agencies in Guelph-Wellington, we are learning on a daily basis 
to do with less.
<P>
	Regrettably, that sometimes means busy signals and longer 
waits. I am proud that the local Guelph Canada Employment 
Centre offers and provides good service to the people of my 
community. Its downtown location offers a central place for clients 
who require service from the federal government. I am proud 
because the most important element of any human resource 
provided by government is service. In this legislation, a department 
has been created that reduces administrative expenses while 
improving services.
<P>
	My constituents would be unhappy if I opposed this legislation. I 
would be curious to see if, like so many times before, Reformers, 
the self-proclaimed protectors of taxpayer dollars, will oppose the 
legislation.
<P>
<B>(1200)</B>
<P>
	Liberals cannot listen to those who say it cannot be done. It was 
heard in 1900 when the labour department was created and it was 
heard again in 1940 when unemployment insurance was created. In 
1984 we heard again that it could not be done when we created the 
Canada Health Act. The ghosts of the naysayers are alive and well 
in the House today and they have found a home on the Reform 
benches.
<P>
	It is time to exorcise those ghosts, time to stand with the Liberals 
and build a department that does not forget the human element and 
uses resources to their full advantage and develops on all of the 
great programs of the past. We must use the past to build the future.
<P>
	I remind the House of the important issues before us. The people 
of Guelph-Wellington want us to create jobs and stimulate 
economic growth. They want us to co-operate with other levels of 
government and the private sector to build practical solutions for 
their benefit and for the benefit of all children.
<P>
	The people of Guelph-Wellington are interested in this from 
the federal government. They have told me to get on with building 
the country, create jobs and growth and invest in the Canadian 
people.
<P>
	The reorganized Department of Human Resources Development 
is giving Canadians innovative, cost  effective programs and 
services. Once again we will rise to vote on this legislation. We will 
be asked to vote for legislation which builds on successes of the 
past and which helps create new successes. It helps us to go ahead.
<P>
	I challenge the opposition parties to let go of the status quo. Do 
not be defenders of what has gone by and has not worked. Abandon 
the narrow political view of Canada they hold and stop holding on 
to the old way of doing this.
<P>
	This legislation deserves the support of every member in the 
House of Commons today.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to speak on this bill, but at the same time 
somewhat troubled to have to do so, for it has been said almost ad 
nauseam already that the federal government's decision to create 
the Department of Human Resources is evidence of its disdain 
toward Quebec and the provinces in general. This is just one more 
piece of the puzzle, along with unemployment insurance reform 
and the Canada social transfer, to allow the federal government to 
continue to be involved, and to step up its involvement, in training 
and education.
<P>
	In fact, the Department of Human Resources Development is a 
sort of embryonic Canadian ministry of education. It is as if the 
government had learned nothing from the past. Again and again, it 
has been said that the government no longer had the means to 
intervene in areas that were outside its jurisdiction, that it ought to 
learn to stick to what was within its jurisdiction, but the lesson has 
not been heeded. Once again, the creation of the department of 
resource development represents involvement in an area in which 
the federal government has never been very efficient.
<P>
<B>(1205)</B>
<P>
	In fact, using legislation to create a department is legalizing 
behaviour that was already there under the previous Conservative 
government and has been carried on by the Liberals, but now it is 
made official, made legal by a law. It is quite simply stated: ``The 
federal government can decide to sign training agreements with the 
provinces, with groups, with individuals'' without necessarily 
having to respect the priorities a province has defined.
<P>
	With this type of analysis, people can easily think that this is a 
matter of sovereignists versus federalists, but I would like there to 
be a concrete examination of what it means and what its impacts 
will be.
<P>
	Take the following case for instance. The Government of Quebec 
is presently developing an active employment policy. The minister 
responsible in Quebec asked each region in Quebec to examine 
existing programs at the provincial level aimed at helping people to 
find jobs, improving their employability and identifying target  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1641"> 1641 </A></B>
<P>
groups in need of special support. These consultations are going on 
in every region.
<P>
	At the same time, by creating the Department of Human 
Resources Development, the federal government gets the power to 
sign an agreement in a particular region in Quebec or elsewhere in 
Canada that could easily go against the conclusions which will 
come out of the ongoing consultations, in Quebec, on the 
establishment of a regional employment policy.
<P>
	Such things have occurred on a regular basis in the past. For 
example, we have seen the federal government giving contracts for 
training projects in areas where people had already been trained 
under other regular training programs. Those people were getting 
training which is not recognized by the Quebec Department of 
Education in areas such as mechanics, office automation or 
electronic data processing and which did not necessarily follow the 
same curriculum as those defined by the Quebec government.
<P>
	The end result was that instead of having 15 trained people 
available for that type of job, their were 25, 30 or 35 of them and 
this led to a result opposite to the one expected: Instead of being 
placed for jobs, people were faced with undue competition and 
some had to go elsewhere to find work. Therefore training, which 
was aimed at allowing people to remain in their own region, did not 
reach its objective.
<P>
	In the past, the frequency of this sort of happening was often 
lessened through the good relations that developed between federal 
and provincial officials in each of the communities. However, that 
did not prevent $250 million from being wasted in Quebec alone 
because of duplication of jurisdictions. Passing legislation 
establishing the Department of Human Resources Development 
will make this sort of duplication official. So, unless Quebec 
simply abandons its field of jurisdiction to the federal government, 
we will continue to have the useless expenditures and the perpetual 
duplication of the past. This is quite out of the question and beyond 
the means of our country.
<P>
	There are needs. As the OECD has said, we in Canada spend a lot 
on training. The problem is that we do not spend wisely. We spend 
a lot on parallel bureaucracies, we no longer necessarily have the 
means to pay for duplicate bureaucracies, and we can no longer 
afford our inefficiency.
<P>
	The actions of the federal government continue to roll along, like 
a steam roller, as if there had been no referendum. In fact the 
sovereignists lost the referendum by a hair, but the message was 
very clear and where the message sounds its clearest is in the area 
of manpower. This message was repeated at the Quebec City 
socio-economic summit. It was expressed by the Conseil du 
patronat du Québec, which even repeated it this week to the 
Standing Committee on Human Resources, saying that it is time 
the Canada employment centres came under Quebec's sole 
jurisdiction, so that concerted action may be taken and dynamic 
regional employment policies put in place to avoid having those on 
welfare shifted to unemployment and the unemployed shifted to 
welfare.
<P>
<B>(1210)</B>
<P>
	Why is the federal government insisting on intervening in this 
sector? Understandably, for the rest of Canada, outside Quebec, 
there may be a role for a department responsible for training. I have 
heard this already, for instance when the Standing Committee on 
Human Resources was touring the country, from a university 
chancellor who said: ``If the Canadian training system is to be 
effective we must have national standards. The system must be 
highly operational. We must know precisely where we are going 
and have training objectives''.
<P>
	In Quebec, we have never claimed that this was impossible in the 
rest of Canada if the provinces and the federal government agreed. 
However, we need to have the required autonomy to act in keeping 
with our labour situation. The situation in Quebec is very different.
<P>
	For example, we often hear talk in the Standing Committee on 
Human Resources Development about manpower mobility. People 
say that if we had, across the board, an unemployment insurance 
plan which required the same number of weeks everywhere, there 
would be a natural movement of people who would go where the 
jobs are and therefore there would be a more natural balance than 
with the present legislation.
<P>
	Of course, this disregards the fact that people have acquired the 
taste, the habit and the will to work in certain regions, and to live 
there with their families, because they like it there. Moreover, this 
argument in Quebec becomes crucial if the system were to be 
applied uniformly as the Department of Human Resources 
Development-that steam roller which is a creature of the federal 
government-would like. The Department of Human Resources 
Development wants to ask people to move to find work. This will 
not only lead to diluting the French fact concentrated in Quebec, it 
will also have a negative impact on the very social fabric of 
Quebec, and on the fact that Quebecers are a people anxious to see 
to their own development.
<P>
	We must realize that the creation of this kind of department is 
based to a certain extent on the federal government's decision to 
have a uniform and very neutral development tool that can be used 
across Canada. This is the kind of tool that did not work during the 
last 20 or 25 years. It did not produce anything. It did not yield the 
expected results, but the government persists in trying to make it 
work.
<P>
	The present government members were not elected 15 years ago 
but at the same time as any one of us, that is two and a half years 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1642"> 1642 </A></B>
<P>
ago. I hope they came here with the idea of controlling the 
bureaucracy instead of being  under its control. Why are they 
bringing us back to the old ways? They decided they would listen to 
the deputy ministers, to the senior public servants, and try once 
again to impose solutions instead of allowing people to make their 
own decisions, determine their directions and make the necessary 
choices locally.
<P>
	The creation of the Department of Human Resources 
Development is a clear demonstration of this. In the end, the 
federal government is going over the provinces' heads. Let me give 
the House an example.
<P>
	Clause 7 of the bill reads: ``the Department may, with the 
approval of the Governor in Council, enter into agreements with a 
province or group of provinces for the purpose of facilitating the 
formulation, coordination and implementation of unemployment 
insurance, employment and immigration programs''.
<P>
	However, the other clause allows the same thing to be done 
directly with groups and organizations, and this causes the 
problems I explained earlier that all of us are experiencing in our 
ridings. Funds were given by the federal government for specific 
type of training, but that training was not necessarily in line with 
the priorities set by the Société québécoise de la main-d'oeuvre for 
that particular area.
<P>
<B>(1215)</B>
<P>
	At times, consultations at the local level prevent problems, but at 
other times, there are situations where the training being provided 
is in direct conflict with what Quebec is offering.
<P>
	Six months after the referendum, in this area as in the other 
sectors, after the Prime Minister decided to forget about the distinct 
society issue, it is business as usual in the House. The steam roller 
is going full speed ahead. The government is fully committed to 
creating the human resources development department, which will 
legitimize the federal government's interference in areas which had 
never come under its jurisdiction.
<P>
	The fact that Quebec sovereignists are not the only ones to 
condemn this decision should get the federal government to think 
twice about it. The Société québécoise de la main-d'oeuvre passed 
several unanimous resolutions denouncing this bill. There has been 
statements to the effect that in Quebec the consensus is to have this 
whole area under Quebec jurisdiction.
<P>
	In Quebec there are diehard federalists who are part of this 
consensus; a case in point is the head of the Conseil du patronat du 
Québec, who cannot be accused of being a sovereignist, or 
pro-independence. He himself has asked the Minister of Human 
Resources Development to look closely into the matter and to 
realize that the best thing the federal government could do 
regarding this issue would be to withdraw from this area.
<P>
	Today, we are in the final stage of the bill. You will recall that it 
was introduced during the previous session and should have died 
on the <I>Order Paper</I>, but was revived in the new session.
<P>
	Despite the fact that there has been a new Throne Speech, that 
we have the referendum results, that we now know what kind of 
changes Quebecers want, that there is unanimous agreement in 
Quebec on what should be done with regard to the manpower 
training issue, the federal government remains deaf or chooses to 
ignore the issue.
<P>
	It goes ahead with the bill in order to interfere in several areas 
which do not come under its jurisdiction. I predict that, in a few 
years, we will see the federal government being judged by the 
Auditor General or by the population for the inefficiency of this 
department's spending on training.
<P>
	We have examples of this in cases where the federal government 
decided to take action, like the strategy it adopted to fight 
unemployment in the Maritimes fishing industry or its approach to 
the problem of discrepancy between the workers available on the 
labour market and the jobs offered. Why is it that in x number of 
years, the government has not succeeded in solving that problem, it 
has not found a way to train the unemployed so that they can take 
on the available jobs? All this is the result of the current system, 
and they want to officialize that system by creating the Department 
of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	They lack imagination, initiative and receptiveness to what 
people are saying about the kind of system they want and about 
their need to know that decisions will be made at a local level and 
within the context of governmental choices.
<P>
	Within the Canadian system, there is a provincial government 
which has chosen to say: ``Employment will be our priority. We 
will do all we can to optimize the potential of our people''. But the 
federal government leans the other way; I am not using that 
example to say one attitude is better than the other, but the federal 
government chooses a completely different approach, as we can see 
now with the Unemployment Insurance Act, where it is said that 
people who regularly receive unemployment benefits do so 
voluntarily and exploit the system. They are made to appear to be 
abusing the system.
<P>
	The federal government approaches the area of unemployment, 
the area of manpower mobility, in a way which is completely 
different from that of the provincial government. As long as both 
levels of government can intervene in the same area of jurisdiction 
there will be inefficiencies. Measures taken by one cancel out 
measures taken by the other.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1643"> 1643 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
	This is not good and, in the end, it is always at the expense of the 
taxpayer. Although the money in the unemployment insurance fund 
comes from employers and employees, nobody denies that the 
government has some responsibility to make sure that the money is 
used adequately, that it is used for the intended purpose. There is no 
excuse for not opting for the right way to do things, for not 
delegating to Quebec all the active measures regarding 
employment, so that Quebec may have full jurisdiction and be able 
to harmonize them with all its other economic actions.
<P>
	You cannot operate in isolation. You cannot have a certain 
approach to economic action and another one to employment. This 
is inconceivable. This, however, is more less the result of the mess 
we are now in with regard to the use of our human potential. We 
launched into a race for productivity without expanding the 
necessary effort to make sure that those who get trampled in this 
race, those who are pushed out of the labour force, have other 
opportunities to find employment.
<P>
	Unfortunately, the bill on the table today for the creation of the 
Department of Human Resources Development will never have the 
efficiency, the reaction speed required to be able to respond quickly 
to the new requirements of the labour market. In order to do that the 
action has to be decentralized, it has to be geared to very local 
priorities and it has to fit a single government orientation.
<P>
	At the present time we do not find that in Canada and the victims 
of that situation are the young people entering the labour force and 
the older workers in their fifties who lose their jobs and cannot find 
any alternatives.
<P>
	For all these reasons, I think it is important that the government 
reflects once more on this bill before passing it and that the citizens 
realize that this bill creating the Department of Human Resources 
Development will be much more useful to the federal upper 
bureaucracy than to the people it is supposed to serve, that is all the 
citizens who need an efficient, viable and reasonably priced 
service.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Richard Bélisle (La Prairie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish to 
congratulate the hon. member on his speech, which the government 
should use as a model for developing its employment and 
manpower policies.
<P>
	The hon. member told us, and rightly so, that we can no longer 
afford to be ineffective. However, with a deficit that is now close to 
$33 billion and a debt of nearly $600 billion, I would like to ask the 
hon. member whether he agrees that it is time for the government 
to wake up and that the fight against unemployment is not 
incompatible with the fight against the deficit.
<P>
	I would also like the hon. member to comment on whether the 
government responsible for human resources development could 
be a little more imaginative in its employment policies and leave 
this in the hands of the provinces, which have real expertise in the 
area of employment and manpower.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think it is indeed the wrong approach 
to oppose unemployment and deficit as if both could not be fought 
at the same time. For example, if the federal government had really 
decided to thoroughly review its spending in various areas, it could 
have reduced the deficit without also having to generate a UI fund 
surplus that is somewhat artificial and designed to make the federal 
government look good. The government can then brag about 
reducing its deficit. This money, however, is not being used 
productively but merely collected in this fund.
<P>
	There may be a reserve fund-the amount is now pegged at $5 
billion for this year. There is a need to put this money back into 
circulation. One approach would be to make premiums low enough 
so that employers and employees can have money in their pockets 
allowing them to consume and thus stimulate the economy. And by 
reducing their costs, employers would be able to develop their 
businesses and create more jobs.
<P>
	We are going through a very particular situation in which 
economic growth does not necessarily lead to job creation.
<P>
<B>(1225)</B>
<P>
	In this regard, we should perhaps start as we did with the deficit 
by setting clear objectives. We could set a target employment rate 
for January 1, 1998 and plan departmental actions accordingly. It is 
not a matter of creating artificial jobs, but of making sure that 
every departmental employee will be concerned about maximizing 
human potential.
<P>
	When the government goes before the electorate two or three 
years from now, it should be judged on how it helped people to 
work, to develop their potential; we would then have a clear, 
objective criterion. As far as the employment issue is concerned, 
this government can be criticized for never making clear 
commitments and being lulled by an economic growth that never 
led to additional jobs.
<P>
	Proposals should be put forward with respect to the reduction of 
overtime or to work sharing. Even the UI reform has some perverse 
effects in this regard. Reducing the maximum wage on which 
premiums are paid encourages large corporations with highly paid 
staff to raise their salaries and increase overtime a little, with the 
net result that they hire fewer people.
<P>
	There is much thinking to be done in this regard, but we must act 
quickly. This will not be done by creating a department such as the 
new Department of Human Resources Development.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1644"> 1644 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
grateful to my hon. colleague for his accurate representation of 
my constituents' concerns.
<P>
	I would like to ask him how this so-called reform will actually 
penalize women and young people who are currently looking for 
work or waiting for unemployment insurance benefits. In what way 
will they be twice penalized? In my riding, we have many mothers 
who are single parents and whose jobs are not secure. I noticed how 
accurately the hon. member depicted my constituents' concerns in 
his remarks.
<P>
	In my region, the rate of unemployment is upwards of 11 per 
cent. There is also a very large number of people on welfare. How 
will this reform, as I am told in my riding, drive more people onto 
welfare?
<P>
	I would like my hon. colleague to explain to the people of my 
riding how they will be affected by this reform?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> I thank my hon. colleague for her question, Mr. 
Speaker.
<P>
	It is important to realize that the unemployment insurance 
reform was developed and put forth by the Department of Human 
Resources Development, the very department to be established 
through the bill before us.
<P>
	As for how this reform will penalize women and young people, 
first of all, by requiring people to work 910 hours, or 26 thirty-five 
hour weeks, to qualify, it will automatically condemn many young 
people to pay into the unemplyment insurance fund without 
drawing any benefit from it, which will encourage them to go 
underground. That defies comprehension.
<P>
	There are also tighter requirements affecting women. The 
Fédération des femmes du Québec felt that the bill, as it stands, 
even closes the door on maternity leave. Incidentally, the 
government has yet to move an amendment to remedy this 
situation.
<P>
	As women hold down the most precarious jobs on the market, 
they are the first victims of the current wave of restraints. 
Increasing the hours of work required to qualify will unavoidably 
force them back onto unemployment insurance and welfare faster, 
since they will have been unable to accumulate enough hours.
<P>
	So, before tightening unemployment insurance requirements 
like this bill does, the government should have put programs in 
place to really give people a chance to find a job. Young people, 
women and all the others do want to work and to develop, but this 
reform is certainly no help, quite the contrary.
<P>
<B>(1230)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, there are rules in 
this House which keep me from mentioning certain observable 
facts, but we are now dealing more with the unobservable. What we 
can observe though is an incredible attitude on the part of the 
government during a debate on the new authority being delegated 
to the  Minister of Human Resources Development. We, the Bloc 
Quebecois, the official opposition, seem to be the only party in this 
House that cares about this issue.
<P>
	Rather surprisingly, the federal administration has been 
operating for over two and a half years without this legislation, 
which officializes the consolidation of various services that used to 
be part of other departments. The government is trying to tell us 
that this is a minor change of little consequence.
<P>
	Those who follow politics might think that, indeed, this is a 
minor change. However, the hon. members for Mercier and for 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, who spoke before me, both sit on 
the human resources development committee and they strongly 
emphasized that this is not a minor change, but a major one.
<P>
	The government wants to increase the authority of the Minister 
of Human Resources Development. This comes barely a few 
months after Quebec was promised it would decentralize and 
provide for greater flexibility, so as to avoid duplication between 
the federal and provincial governments.
<P>
	If the bill reflected that commitment, I would be the first one to 
recognize it. However, if you read the bill you quickly realize that it 
goes in the opposite direction, toward greater centralization and 
control by the federal state regarding areas which do not come 
under its jurisdiction.
<P>
	This allows the federal government, and particularly the 
minister, to be even more involved in manpower training. The 
government refers to decentralization, and we can see in this bill 
that it would be possible. This bill gives the minister the authority 
to bypass provincial governments regarding manpower training, 
even though there is a consensus in Quebec to do just the opposite. 
That consensus calls for leaving all the necessary tools, including 
active employment measures, in the hands of the Quebec 
government, which should be the only level of government 
involved, to ensure greater consistency and avoid duplication and 
waste.
<P>
	Instead, when the federal government talks about 
decentralization, it means that the process would be achieved 
through its employment centres dealing directly with community 
groups, businesses and perhaps even municipalities. The minister 
is being given full authority. This is the government's idea of 
decentralization.
<P>
	However, it is just the opposite of what Quebecers were told 
shortly before the referendum, when the federal government said it 
would fulfil their wish for change.
<P>
	This is another example of double talk which is ultimately 
tantamount to telling a falsehood. Why? Because the government 
means exactly the opposite of what it says.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1645"> 1645 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1235)</B>
<P>
	Another thing bothers me. You have to remember that we are 
now dealing with Bill C-11. This bill is identical to Bill C-96 which 
was introduced in this House in June 1995 and which the 
government left hanging throughout the pre-referendum period in 
order to avoid stirring things up.
<P>
	Now the government comes up with a new throne speech. 
Usually, after prorogation, a speech from the throne contains some 
new ideas. Yet, except for the measure implementing the budget, 
all the other bills, including Bill C-11, are old pieces of legislation 
left in abeyance. Is there anything new? We do not think so. There 
is nothing new, just another smoke screen.
<P>
	While delivering a new throne speech, stating some great 
principles and using a lot of rhetoric, the government is in fact just 
carrying along and acting as usual. Nothing has changed. It is just 
chugging along.
<P>
	Today, the party across the way has decided not to have any of its 
members take part in this debate on a bill that will officialize the 
most important federal department. When I say the most important, 
I mean financially. If we set aside debt servicing, we realize that 
almost 50 per cent of the budget, that is between 40 and 50 per cent 
of program expenditures go to the human development resources 
department. That is a lot of money.
<P>
	But what do we notice here, in the House? No backbencher has 
spoken in the House for a while now, as if nothing was going on. I 
can maybe understand the behaviour of hon. members from other 
parts of Canada, but how can the members from Quebec remain 
quiet when this bill will officialize greater centralization and 
intervention by the federal government in provincial areas of 
jurisdiction?
<P>
	The members from the province of Quebec read the newspapers 
and meet the people. They are aware of the consensus on this issue. 
They know that the Société québécoise de développement de la 
main-d'oeuvre is what can be called a group of organizations or a 
consortium that is trying to implement job creation measures. Let 
me remind the House of who belongs to this Société québécoise de 
développement de la main-d'oeuvre. There are, of course, the 
unions and central labour bodies, but also the Conseil du patronat, 
the Institut canadien des adultes, the Mouvement Action-Chômage 
and a lot of community organizations. The Société brings together 
all the organizations who are concerned about the employment 
situation and who have given their support. They are members of 
the Société québécoise de développement de la main-d'oeuvre or 
they have supported it by submitting briefs. I am sure all Quebec 
Liberal members have received those briefs.
<P>
	Unfortunately, we cannot help but see that they do not seem to be 
moved by that. The contradiction between  what the government 
says officially and what it does is obvious. Nevertheless, they 
remain silent, they stay away from this debate as if this matter had 
no significance whatsoever.
<P>
	We are talking about Bill C-11, that will officially establish this 
department. What does the government do in the meantime? It uses 
the same approach with human resources development. It tried this 
approach with the unemployment insurance reform. It tried to 
avoid any direct contact with the people during consideration of 
that bill.
<P>
<B>(1240)</B>
<P>
	The committee is sitting at this very moment and it is using 
video technology to hear evidence. One organization at the time, 
and they are hand picked. And because of its majority, the 
government can invite practically whoever it wants. It is trying to 
do this very quietly. Oh the unemployment insurance reform will 
not change a lot of things; it is being done very quietly in 
committee.
<P>
	But hundreds of organizations have asked to be heard, and they 
are being told that it is not possible, that time is of the essence, that 
July 1 is coming soon. This is exactly how this government 
operates. I have also noticed recently, especially during question 
period, that it is difficult for the opposition to attack the 
government because the Prime Minister is often away or a 
particular minister is on a tour somewhere. It seems that we are 
fighting I would not say ghosts, but people who are less and less 
visible in Parliament.
<P>
	We, in the official opposition, find it deplorable that the third 
party also finds this issue insignificant, since its members are not 
concerned about this bill that will create a department that will 
administer an enormous amount of money. Almost half, or between 
40 and 50 per cent, of the government's total budget is allocated to 
this department. That does not seem to be of any interest to the 
third party, nor to certain independent members, nor to the leader 
of the Conservative Party. The leader, who aspires to become Prime 
Minister one day, is not concerned about a department whose 
budget represents almost half of the government's total budget. It is 
unbelievable.
<P>
	What will it take to wake them up, to change this law of silence? 
For Bill C-11 is a law of silence, a law making silence official. I am 
almost tempted to stop for a minute of silence, since that would so 
aptly symbolize what is happening here. I am almost tempted.
<P>
	I did keep silent for five seconds, but my convictions and beliefs 
prevent me from staying quiet, for this is so important. I would like 
the people watching us at home to realize what is happening here in 
terms of social programs. They are trying to make cuts, vigorous 
cuts, but ever so quietly. And our viewers will be affected.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1646"> 1646 </A></B>
<P>
	Without any demagoguery, let me just say this: ``Fellow 
citizens, take care, be even more vigilant than before, because this 
government is trying to make us adopt changes in a new way, 
through a quiet approach, or in other words by not attaching any 
importance to subjects that in fact are very important''.
<P>
	I have been on the Human Resources Development Committee 
for two and a half years now. When we take the trouble to go out 
the consult the public, when we go into the field to meet with 
organizations, when members of Parliament take the trouble to 
meet with the people in their ridings, no matter what region they 
are in, there is one reality which strikes us, independent of the 
statistics.
<P>
	Officially, the unemployment rate has dropped a bit, but if the 
Statistics Canada figures are examined more closely, we realize 
that the drop is not because more people are working, but because 
more are giving up looking for work. These statistics do not include 
employable welfare recipients who cannot find work. We cannot let 
this pass without comment.
<P>
	I am sure that the hon. members see people in their riding offices 
every time they are back in their ridings, and hear from them that 
things are not getting any better. There are no more jobs than 
before.
<P>
<B>(1245)</B>
<P>
	What we see in the labour market at the moment is that, through 
globalization, government cuts and deregulation, the number of 
part-time jobs is increasing and the number of full-time jobs is 
decreasing. Companies are trying to re-open collective agreements, 
citing competition, in order to cut back working conditions in some 
cases. Salaries are on the decline at the moment.
<P>
	I have just come from a meeting of the Standing Committee on 
Human Resources Development. People were talking about 
change. They were saying that more than a third of jobs right now 
are part time. And who holds these jobs primarily? Women. 
Women hold 70 per cent of jobs that are mostly part time, 
threatened, ill paid, insecure and non unionized. There are young 
people in such jobs too.
<P>
	What is this government doing with its unemployment insurance 
reform at the moment? It is trying to tighten unemployment 
insurance eligibility requirements. It is making unemployment 
insurance less accessible especially to young people and to women 
who want to return to the labour force after raising their children. 
These are the two main population groups affected.
<P>
	The method of calculating by weeks is being changed to a 
method of calculating by hours. With the hours system, two 
part-time jobs may indeed be combined, but this arrangement will 
create increased competition, a race, a marathon, a sprint for the 
latest little job on the market. Even workers in full-time, but 
seasonal, jobs for a short time will be tempted in the tourist season, 
for  example, to find some little job or a part-time job and thereby 
increase competition for such jobs. This will be the case especially 
with young people.
<P>
	People do not realize we can no longer rely on unemployment 
statistics. I even heard a Reform member say yesterday that 
unemployment insurance was the cause of unemployment and that, 
if we abolished unemployment insurance, there would be no more 
unemployed. I can understand most people taking even the meanest 
of little jobs anywhere to avoid starving to death, but this sort of 
approach has nothing to do with reality.
<P>
	We need more than just jobs, we need quality, well paid, stable 
and affirming jobs. We are no longer in the industrial age when 
children were made to work and when people worked six or seven 
days a week. This is an age, according to the sociologists, of quality 
of life.
<P>
	The Canadian government was delighting in the fact that Canada 
was one of the countries with the highest quality of life-I have a 
hard time accepting that.
<P>
	Representatives of Campaign 2000 have said on a number of 
occasions that 20 per cent of children are poor. When we talk of 20 
per cent of children being poor, it is not the children who are poor, 
but their parents. Sometimes the families are single parent families 
and very often the single parent is a woman.
<P>
	We do not see the social change taking place today. Nobody can 
do anything about it, but, increasingly, we are seeing very poor 
families and low income single parent families.
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
	We are supposed to believe that everything is fine, that we can 
rejoice, that we can afford to cut help to the poorest members of 
society in an effort to bring the deficit under control, and to make 
UI eligibility criteria three times as strict for new claimants on the 
assumption that once they try UI they will become addicted to it, as 
to a drug. What a warped view of society!
<P>
	The other day, the Minister of Human Resources Development 
told me that there were 125,000 UI abusers. I checked with 
agencies working in this area, such as Action chômage Québec, and 
I was told that 75 per cent of people who appeal, who ask for a 
review of their case, win in the end. If you win, does this mean that 
you abuse the system? I do not think so.
<P>
	You are motioning to me that my time has expired. I hope that I 
will be asked questions so that I can go on.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Godin (Châteauguay, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to thank my colleague, the member for Lévis, for his analysis 
of the situation. I agree with him wholeheartedly; we are in a very 
distressing situation. It is true. I cannot understand why, given the 
seriousness of the situation, the Liberal Party does not co-operate 
more and does not try to give us some explanations.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1647"> 1647 </A></B>
<P>
	I agree with my colleague that a society with so many 
unemployed, a society where there are no jobs is an ailing society. 
What do we have to offer? There is only confusion in everything 
that is proposed.
<P>
	Last Saturday, I listened to the Prime Minister's speech where he 
explained that the advantage of the unemployment insurance 
system is that it takes money from the rich provinces to give it to 
the poor ones. But that is not what they are doing. Maybe they do 
take money from the rich provinces, but they use it to pay the debt 
and reduce the deficit. Instead of creating jobs with that money, 
they apply it to the deficit in order to create more commissions 
dealing with provincial jurisdictions, in order to interfere in other 
provincial areas, spend again and generate duplication and 
squandering.
<P>
	There is confusion in the bill we are debating now, but there is 
confusion in other areas also. We clearly saw that this week with 
regard to the Constitution. Last Saturday, they had found the idea 
of the century: the homeland of the French language. But three or 
four days later, that wonderful idea had fallen by the wayside and 
they might go back to the distinct society. It is the same in many 
areas.
<P>
	In my riding, we are facing a problem that maybe my colleague 
could talk about. It is the SEA program, the Self-Employment 
Assistance program. It is dreadful. They want us to believe this 
program is meant to create jobs, but in many cases the only result 
of that assistance is to cut unemployment insurance benefits and 
send the people back to welfare. They tell people that if they have a 
good idea, they will help them to implement it and create their own 
job. But they ask for a plan and when the plan is presented, they tell 
the unemployed: ``Well you were working on your plan and 
therefore you were not available and looking for work, so we are 
withdrawing your unemployment benefits''.
<P>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
	There have been many such cases. There is always duplication 
and waste. They talk about replacing unemployment insurance with 
employment insurance, but that does not deal with the problem. 
What they are really doing is reducing the number of recipients in 
order to have more money for other projects. Instead of using the 
money to create jobs, they make the unemployed pay for past 
spending.
<P>
	I would like my colleague to explain the SEA a bit further. Did 
they have the chance to discuss it in committee? Could we not 
suggest that when they want to give an unemployed person the 
opportunity to create his or her own job, they should let that person 
do so in peace?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dubé:</B> Mr. Speaker, I note yet again that my colleague for 
Châteauguay is very much attuned to the reality of Quebec and of 
his riding.
<P>
	The SEA program, it must be said, is an active employment 
measure, which the federal government intends to continue. Those 
of us forming the Quebec consensus would prefer the money 
currently invested in this program be given to Quebec to permit 
more consistent management of the various activities involved in 
job development.
<P>
	My colleague is absolutely right in the present context. He has 
given me the opportunity to point out that there is a problem with 
the program. There can be no appeals. The officials on the 
committee reach a decision after looking at a business plan and, in 
the case my colleague mentioned, had an appeal been possible, the 
individual in question might perhaps have won his case, 
particularly because the appeal is not heard by the same people.
<P>
	This is what the people of Action-chômage told me: ``When 
appeal is possible, 75 per cent of the people win their case''. I am 
not saying the existing legislation is perfect or that it ought not to 
be improved, because this is a specific case, but it would have to be 
amended or improved to provide for an appeal mechanism. This is 
the sort of solution we must look at.
<P>
	We must remember, as the member for Châteauguay rightly 
pointed out, that this program must not be seen as a way to resolve 
all the problems. We must understand that those who have access to 
this program are on unemployment insurance and therefore, by 
definition, people who have lost their job. Not everyone has the 
means to set up a business. There could be a trap. I am not saying 
that it is the intention of the officials, because they carry out the 
programs chosen by the government.
<P>
	But there is a trap. If the business works, that is fine. However, 
if, because of a lack of money it does not, and the unemployment 
insurance benefits run out, the individual, because he has a 
business and is independent, is no longer entitled to unemployment 
insurance.
<P>
	If his business got financing from different people, friends, or 
banks or elsewhere, he may not be eligible for social assistance. 
You know, to be eligible for social assistance, your assets must be 
limited. Without being wealthy, someone could have a house or 
some possessions. There is a trap.
<P>
	Furthermore, not everyone is destined to be a business person. 
People think you just start a business, but you need training and 
resources. It has to be done with the support of the community.
<P>
	Other members may have questions for me.
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> We have only 60 seconds 
remaining, which can be split.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to speak on Bill C-11, which is so important, and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1648"> 1648 </A></B>
<P>
particularly pleased to follow my two illustrious colleagues for 
Lévis and Châteauguay. Bill  C-11, as you know, is more or less a 
housekeeping bill, in that it is aimed at creating the new 
Department of Human Resources Development, which is a fairly 
weighty component of the federal government.
<P>
	This bill will, of course, be passed. We are discussing it, and 
discussing it a great deal, because there are a number of highly 
negative aspects connected to it which we want to point out. Yet we 
know it will go through, because the federal government has the 
majority. If, however, it were in my power to prevent the 
department from being created, of course I would do so, because to 
date this department has provided the most glaring example of 
abuse by the federal government.
<P>
	The Department of Human Resources Development has, 
perhaps, wrought more havoc on Canada as far as social programs 
are concerned, than all of the other departments combined. It is the 
one which sends so many people to my office in a terrible situation, 
worried about their future, their job, their unemployment 
insurance. And it is not finished with its mischief, either, for this 
department is the one they want to use to more or less solve one of 
Canada's most serious problems.
<P>
	As you know, Canada has a huge debt, one that has been 
denounced by the International Monetary Fund on several 
occasions, and one that places Canada in the ranks of the most 
indebted countries in the world. In fact, looking at the G-7 
membership, Canada is second only to Italy. Canada is in a 
financial crisis, a debt crisis, in fact it is technically bankrupt. 
Canada's $550 billion debt is a big problem. A very big problem, 
one that was created by the incompetence of certain members of 
this House, before our time of course.
<P>
	Previous governments have all been so irresponsible in their 
spending, especially since the arrival of Pierre Elliott Trudeau, and 
Brian Mulroney later on. When Trudeau came along, Canada's debt 
was a small one. You might say it was reasonably manageable, one 
which did not worry foreign investors or harm Canada's economic 
development. Then it went up to $250 billion, and doubled that 
under Mulroney. The present Liberal government is, of course, 
attempting to curb it, but without any appreciable success.
<P>
	They talk of success, but we know very well that the $5 billion 
reduction in Canada's deficit was made at the expense of Canada's 
workers and employers, and at the expense of the unemployed. It 
is, as we know full well, in this Department of Human Resources 
Development that this kind of misappropriation of funds, what I 
would call a kind of fraud, a kind of lie perpetuated in Canada, is 
planned.
<P>
	The money in the UI fund comes from Canadian employers and 
employees; the federal government has not contributed a single 
penny since 1990. This fund comes from a tax on employers and 
employees, who are the sole contributors. The federal government 
then takes $5 billion from this fund to reduce its deficit.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	It is in short what happened with the Department of Human 
Resources Development and all other federal policies. It is the only 
major bill this government managed to come up with and it will 
pass. I am sure this bill will pass because government members are 
in the majority. It is essentially the key bill that this government put 
forward through the Department of Human Resources 
Development.
<P>
	Of course, we can also talk about the reduction of transfer 
payments to the provinces, in that the government may cut 
spending on health and education programs by $7 billion by the 
year 2000. These cuts put pressure on the provinces. These cuts in 
transfer payments have forced the provinces to adjust, as Quebec is 
now doing.
<P>
	It has even become necessary in the area of health care, as we 
know full well. But I wonder about education. I wonder if this 
government really has lofty designs on society in trying to reduce 
its contribution to education. This threatens the future of our young 
people, who these days need a good education in order to find jobs 
and make ends meet.
<P>
	Through the Department of Human Resources Development, the 
federal government has taken measures such as reducing spending 
in health and education by cutting transfers to the provinces. The 
federal government tried to shift these cuts to the provinces to 
make them take the blame, and then misappropriated money from 
the UI fund. The fact is that, over three years, something like $15 
billion will be diverted.
<P>
	Then the Minister of Finance will say: ``I managed to reduce the 
federal debt.'' I mean by that that he will at least have reduced the 
deficit and discharged his duty to the people of Canada.
<P>
	As I said earlier, this is misappropriation of funds, nearly 
embezzlement, because contributions to an insurance program are 
normally expected to be used for that purpose and not for some 
other purpose. Normally, employees and employers who contribute 
to the UI fund should expect their money to be used to make sure 
that those who loose their jobs are paid benefits out of the UI fund 
and provided with manpower training so that they can re-enter the 
labour force.
<P>
	But that is not how it was used. Not only does the government 
use this money to reduce its debt, but it also tightened UI eligibility 
requirements, thereby effectively reducing the number of people 
who qualify for UI benefits. Imagine that. Do you think that is fair? 
More and more frequently, participating employers are seeing their 
UI claims denied.
<P>
	This government has brought down three consecutive reforms. 
First, the number of eligible claimants was reduced to about 60, 57, 
55 per cent. Then, the second  reform further reduced this 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1649"> 1649 </A></B>
<P>
percentage to about 47 or 45 per cent. This means that 47 or 45 per 
cent of those who lose their jobs are entitled to UI.
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	Now with the latest reform, the most drastic and unfair one 
conceivable in Canada, only one third of people losing their job 
will be entitled to UI. This is a fraud, this is embezzlement. If only 
the number of people losing their job remained the same, and 
eligibility criteria were such that more people could be on UI. But 
this is not the case. Fewer and fewer people will be eligible.
<P>
	Not only will there be fewer people eligible, but they will receive 
smaller benefits for a shorter period of time. This is marvellous, 
magical, because of course according to statistics there will be 
fewer and fewer unemployed workers in Canada since, when you 
are no longer eligible for UI, have no job and are not entitled to UI, 
and there is no other recourse, what do you do? You go on welfare. 
Welfare is a different kind of system, it is a provincial system. If 
one is not eligible for welfare, one disappears from the face of the 
earth, one becomes invisible.
<P>
	From the federal perspective, this is marvellous, it is as if the 
unemployment rate was going down in Canada. This is marvellous. 
Through various tricks, statistics and funds, the problem created in 
the first place by the federal government and its disastrous 
overspending over the last 10 years is being dumped on the 
provinces. Provinces will now have to support more people on 
welfare.
<P>
	Access to the unemployment insurance fund will be more 
limited and, moreover, provinces will be faced with cuts in the 
most important areas, the most vulnerable like health and 
education, and now, with the new Department of Human Resources 
Development, pensions. They are now going after our seniors, 
because they have been spared until now. The reform of old age 
pensions will primarily target women, since the pension will be 
determined based on family income.
<P>
	This means that the woman who stayed home all her life to raise 
a family, who did not have any form of employment recognized by 
society, because she was a housewife, might not have the right to an 
old age pension. She will continue to be dependent on her husband. 
This way, the federal government will save billions of dollars at the 
expense of the most vulnerable people of society: the young, the 
sick, the old and the unemployed.
<P>
	This is what the Liberal government is doing to Canada. It is 
going after the most vulnerable. It is going after those who are 
poorly organized, insecure and focus on surviving from one week 
to the next.
<P>
	People come to my office, single women with two, three 
children, who are without a job and have a really hard time 
surviving on welfare. They want to work.
<P>
	If you allow the federal government to use the money from the 
unemployment insurance fund to reduce the debt rather than 
investing into job creation or manpower training, this is what we 
will get. More and more people will know hardship and suffering. 
This is what the federal government will give us. This a rotten 
government.
<P>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I am not referring to you directly, but the 
government's social policy is totally rotten and unfair. It is a fraud, 
a misappropriation of funds. It is so rotten. One cannot imagine a 
worse social program, given that the root of the problem is the huge 
national debt of $550 billion, which concerns the International 
Monetary Fund and which will soon exceed $600 billion, in the 
year 2000.
<P>
	When you think about the problems that triggered the initiatives 
taken by the human resources development department, you realize 
that there were other, easier, more reasonable and fair solutions to 
solve the issues. But the government deliberately chose to target 
young people, the sick, the elderly and the unemployed.
<P>
	Who was spared? Who was spared in every possible way? The 
rich, the well-to-do and the large corporations. The government 
was generous to them. It is that simple.
<P>
	Let me just give you a few examples. Take the all-important 
family trust issue. For those who do not know how family trusts 
work, you first have to be a millionaire. Family trusts are not for 
everyone: it is a very select club. One has to be very rich, like the 
Minister of Finance, who is worth several million, or like the 
Reitman, the Bronfman and all the other very rich families. So, you 
must first be rich to join the select group benefiting from family 
trusts.
<P>
	It costs a lot of money to set up the program that allows these 
families, through a family trust, to avoid having to pay taxes. These 
families never pay taxes. This is great. They make millions in 
profits each year, but they do not pay taxes. This is truly wonderful.
<P>
	It is estimated that, in Canada, thanks to these family trusts, 
about $100 billion are not subject to any taxes. One hundred billion 
dollars in profits there wealthy families make in Canada. If I were 
the Prime Minister, I would go and get at least half of these $100 
billion. There are thousands of people who are hungry, who have no 
jobs and who do not have enough to feed their children. 
Consequently, when you have rich people who do not know what to 
do with their $50 million, you go and tell them: ``Listen, not only 
have you not paid taxes on your profits for X number of years, but 
you have $100 billion in family trusts. Therefore, we will collect 
half of that amount, that is $50 billion''.
<P>
	Imagine, only with this fair, reasonable and justifiable measure, 
the government could have collected $50 billion more in taxes. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1650"> 1650 </A></B>
<P>
However, it chose not to take $50  billion from the family trusts, 
but rather $5 billion from the unemployed.
<P>
	This government spared the wealthiest families. It even warned 
them to reconsider their finances, because in five or six years from 
now, it may have to change the conditions applying to family trusts.
<P>
	The government could have gotten more money from 
corporations who avoid paying taxes. An estimated $3 to $4 billion 
go to banks in the Bahamas and the West Indies. An estimated $4 
billion a year, from what I have heard.
<P>
	The government could have closed the tax loopholes used by 
corporations. It could have taxed the banks. Imagine, last year 
alone, banks pocketed $5.2 billion in net profits. Shareholders took 
all that money home with them. The banks' profits almost doubled 
from the previous year. We are not talking peanuts here. The 
government collected about $100 million from the banks over a 
two-year period. That is a little under one per cent. That is not 
much for banks.
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	All that to say that this government is rotten to the core. It does 
not have a social policy, it promotes a policy based on the best 
interests of the fittest and the richest and it picks on the most 
vulnerable people of all, the weakest, the young, the old and the 
sick. Come next election, I hope the people will realize that we 
need a change of government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réjean Lefebvre (Champlain, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my colleague for his wonderful speech. I would like him to be more 
specific. We know that Mr. Martin's budget has affected three 
generations: the 18 to 30-year olds, the 30 to 60-year olds and those 
who are 60 years old and over.
<P>
	I would like my colleague to be more specific on the issue of part 
time jobs. In Champlain riding, there are many part time jobs, and I 
would like him to explain what it implies. We know that 
unemployment insurance has been cut, and that this will this 
category of workers very badly.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Marchand: </B>Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from 
Champlain, who in fact is paid to do this job. All joking aside, there 
is nothing funny about part time jobs. The schedule that the 
government was using before to give out unemployment insurance 
was based on the number of weeks worked, while it is now based 
on the number of hours worked. But in some cases, we could 
consider that the number of hours required to qualify for 
unemployment insurance has tripled. A person must work three 
times as much, at least twice as much, to qualify for unemployment 
insurance.
<P>
	So, people who have part time jobs, especially fishermen, 
seasonal workers, young people who have jobs or jobs at 
McDonald's, for instance, and many other  people will be in a 
situation where they will have to contribute to the unemployment 
fund, but they will not be eligible for benefits. That is what is 
happening. That is another example of the blatant unfairness the 
government is creating with this bill.
<P>
	We can hope that the government will make changes, but I do not 
know if cosmetic changes will do when deep down the whole thing 
is rotten. It is like cancer. For a person who already has cancer, if 
we cut off one of his arms or add on a finger, we give him some 
support, but it is still difficult to give him his health back. 
Essentially, this bill sponsored by the Department of Human 
Resources Development should be thrown out. We ought to rethink 
this bill's whole approach.
<P>
	In fact, it is not just this bill. This reflects the whole mentality of 
the Liberal government, its social and economic policies. On that, I 
must say that except for a minor initiative of a few million of 
dollars at the beginning of its mandate in 1993, under the 
infrastructure program which, as my colleague from Champlain 
knows, created jobs, and was a good initiative, the government has 
done nothing to create jobs, absolutely nothing.
<P>
<B>(1325)</B>
<P>
	The Liberals did nothing but get what my other colleague on my 
right described a few moments ago as a case of ``verbal diarrhea''.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The government suffers from a big case of verbal diarrhoea. Its 
members are the ones standing in this illustrious hall, giving us all 
kinds of theories and explanations on how well they are doing.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, as my time has almost expired, I want to thank 
again my colleague from Champlain for allowing me to speak for 
another five minutes.
<P>
	Nevertheless, I wanted to be sure to underline something I find 
important. In Canada and in Quebec, people must be made aware of 
the situation, because this is no laughing matter. It is not something 
without importance. When we talk about unemployment insurance 
and employment, youth training, health and pensions in a society, 
or when we talk about a government which has nothing to offer to 
stimulate job creation, thse are not trifling matters. Today, millions 
of people are affected. The worst will come in a few months. That 
is why people are not really aware of this bill's impact. They are 
not aware of the full impact of this bill, which will come into effect 
in the next few months.
<P>
	We are still waiting, but these are extremely serious measures 
that will affect many people. Once again, this bill reflects the 
government's unfair attitude. The greatest injustice that can be 
imagined, that has been condemned since the beginning of human 
history, is precisely this  kind of injustice favouring the rich, the 
establishment of programs or projects allowing those better off to 
feather their nests and fill up their pockets, while the poor and 
vulnerable are ignored, denigrated and robbed. It is indeed in this 
case a kind of fraud, a kind of misappropriation. Many of the 
workers who contribute to the UI fund will not even qualify for 
benefits. It is robbery, to a certain extent.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1651"> 1651 </A></B>
<P>
	Young people starting out may be the most vulnerable of all 
because, as you know, finding a job and carving out a career 
nowadays is not the same as when I was young. I am 52 years old. 
When I was a student in my twenties, jobs were not that hard to 
find. I am-
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Is this the short answer?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Marchand:</B> The government needs a lot of detailed 
explanation, which is what I am trying to do.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Young people are facing an increasingly difficult situation, 
because it is so expensive to go to university to get the education 
required to find a job. It is already difficult enough just to get a 
diploma, without facing the prospect of not having any job 
opportunities upon graduating. This demoralizes young people and 
causes them to drop out of school in growing numbers.
<P>
	Both the young and the old are affected, as well as the sick, the 
most vulnerable, and women. Everyone is affected by the measures 
taken by this government because, as I said, there is no social 
policy in any way, shape or form. That is incredible. Instead of 
running the country as it should, the government is sitting on its 
power and letting itself be led by rich individuals, corporations and 
banks, in spite of the fact that, in a former life, when in opposition, 
the Liberal Party found much fault with banks, accusing them of 
ruining the economy.
<P>
<B>(1330)</B>
<P>
	A few years ago, as incredible as it may sound, the Prime 
Minister, who was the leader of the opposition then, warned: 
``When I become the Prime Minister, you can be sure you will have 
to pay your share.'' That is more or less what he told banks. And he 
was right.
<P>
	Today, banks are charging-
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> $5 billion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Marchand:</B> That is right, last year, they made $5.2 billion in 
profits. They certainly are not poor. They are charging almost 20 
per cent in interest on credit card balances. It takes some doing. 
That is incredible. As rich as they are, banks are doing what they 
can to become even richer.
<P>
	Recently, the Liberal government denied banks access to the 
insurance sector. I must admit that they were served a warning. 
Perhaps their next request will be  granted, like automobile leasing 
for example, which is extremely profitable. Perhaps the Liberal 
government will decide to give them a nice little present.
<P>
	Of course it is in the best interest of this government that the six 
federally chartered banks make huge profits. It is well known that 
they do make profits. They are doing well and the government will 
make sure that they can expand into other areas.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Your time has expired. Does the hon. 
member have the unanimous consent of the House to continue?
<P>
	Resuming debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> I have a question, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The time for questions and comments is 
over. Is there unanimous consent to extend the period by a few 
minutes?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have a brief question about what the member opposite 
just said.
<P>
	I wish to understand his opinion on the issue of leasing contracts. 
Is he saying that he favours Ford Motors Credit over the National 
Bank of Canada?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Marchand:</B> Mr. Speaker, I can answer. First, I wish to thank 
the hon. member for his question.
<P>
	The problem that I was discussing before concerned the banks, 
and how we could prevent them from getting more powerful. 
General Motors Acceptance Corporation and Ford Motors Credit 
are American investment agencies. These companies are exactly 
like banks. In the U.S. today, Ford Motors is the sixth biggest 
financial institution.
<P>
	If the hon. member makes a small verbal distinction between 
Ford Motors and GM, I do not think it matters, especially since 
they are American companies.
<P>
	In my opinion, in Canada, we should crack down a little harder 
on the banks, but not on companies, like car dealerships, that 
provide jobs and make a profit. Why amend legislation once again 
to benefit banks, at the expense of those in the automobile industry 
who have a hard time making ends meet? Life is not always easy. 
Unlike banks, car dealers do not pocket profits of $5.2 billion, year 
in year out. This is definitely not the case.
<P>
	I hope that answers the hon. member's question. If I had more 
time, I could elaborate on that social concept. There is a difference. 
The question was put by a member who is indeed a francophone. 
This lack of social concept within the federal government may 
reflect a difference in the English Canadian perception, versus the 
French Canadian one.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1652"> 1652 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1335)</B>
<P>
	In Quebec, the concept of distinct society implies a social policy. 
We have a social policy, and I challenge anyone in this House to 
claim that, in Quebec, we favour the banks. This is absolutely not 
the case. We will never favour the banks in Quebec. We treat them 
fairly, but we also ask them to contribute to the province's financial 
and economic recovery.
<P>
	The federal government does not do that. This is a big difference 
in terms of social policy. This is not the way things are done in our 
province. As you know, the caisses Desjardins were established in 
Quebec and they are very successful. These institutions provide 
extensive quality services without making exorbitant profits like 
the banks.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
very pleased to take part in the debate on Bill C-11 this morning. It 
was said that it is an administrative bill. I do not think so. I would 
call it a pernicious bill. Why? Because it will increase federal 
involvement in areas of provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	Far from indicating a withdrawal of the federal government from 
the manpower training area, it will increase its involvement. We 
will again see duplication and overlap, although Bloc Quebecois 
members were elected to condemn duplication and overlap in the 
area of manpower training, among others.
<P>
	Therefore, this bill is pernicious and the government has no 
other choice but to withdraw it because the population of Quebec 
does not want it. The population of Quebec does not want it for the 
simple reason that it does not show respect for democracy nor for 
the people of Quebec which has been asking that the Quebec 
government be the only one in charge of manpower training and 
employment.
<P>
	The population of Quebec does not want this bill, and I am not 
only talking about individuals. Many of my colleagues mentioned, 
this morning, several organizations that have reached a consensus 
on the issue of manpower training and job creation. There is a 
consensus in Quebec, but I do not think the government 
understands the intentions and the concerns of Quebec.
<P>
	I am talking not only about individuals, but also about editorial 
writers, intellectuals, unionists and workers. When we examine the 
positions of Lise Bissonnette and Jean-Robert Sansfaçon, of the 
FTQ, the CSN and the CEQ, of the bishop of Bathurst, of the 
Canadian Labour Congress, of the Acadian mayors and 
municipalities, and of the labour council, we see that this view is 
held not only in Quebec, but that other provinces are also asking for 
withdrawal.
<P>
	However, we, in Quebec, want all the moneys related to 
manpower training to be returned to the provincial authorities. This 
bill is pernicious. A clause by clause examination of the bill shows 
how the federal  government will abuse its power. Why? I will 
explain a few clauses of the bill.
<P>
	How will the human resources development minister assign the 
management of the programs he wants to establish? If money is 
handed out to individuals or agencies, who will be responsible for 
the management of these programs?
<P>
	That is why we are saying that this minister and his department 
will increase their spending power, and their ability to encroach 
upon provincial jurisdictions. That is clear.

<P>
	There is a consensus on this, and I cannot figure out why the 
government cannot understand what Quebec wants. It wants to get 
the money and powers to finally introduce a comprehensive social 
policy. When we talk about employment, we also talk about 
unemployment and welfare. Unemployment insurance is not just 
unemployment insurance anymore.
<P>
	A commission will be created and will include the word 
``insurance'', so the government will be able to further intrude into 
provincial jurisdictions. By offering this ``insurance'', the 
government will be able to determine the type of program, local 
institution or community network. That is what I call piecemeal 
management of unemployment insurance. Incidentally, many of 
my colleagues have pointed out that the federal government is no 
longer paying into the unemployment insurance fund. That does 
not prevent it from trying to have its way in unemployment 
insurance and employment assistance programs.
<P>
	You are aware of the $5 billion surplus the federal government 
got its hands on in order to bring down its deficit or perhaps to play 
Santa with certain community institutions. Community 
organizations in my riding too would like some of that money to be 
able to help out those most in need.
<P>
	This bill does not reflect the will of Quebecers. This is about 
unemployment insurance, but the words will be changed to 
employment insurance. Why do we say this bill is so harmful? 
Because, unlike his colleagues, this minister will not have to report 
annually on his department's activities. How will we be able to 
check on the government and the money it gets from the taxpayers 
if this department is not held accountable? No annual report will be 
tabled, none. This bill reinforces the powers of the minister and his 
department.
<P>
	I am concerned about how the policies and programs will be 
managed once the money has been distributed. I am concerned 
about the issue of confidentiality once agencies have been 
designated to manage these policy programs. I urge the government 
to agree to what the people concerned are asking for. You will not 
find only sovereignists among these people, as we have said several 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1653"> 1653 </A></B>
<P>
times in committee and in the House, but mainly people  who have 
reached a social consensus on the issue of labour training. I have a 
lot of difficulty accepting the fact that the federal government is 
withholding $5 billion from the Unemployment Insurance Fund, 
money paid in part by the taxpayers, employees and employers, of 
Quebec, when this money is needed to implement a real 
employment policy in sync with social reality.
<P>
	Meanwhile, as the President of the Treasury Board told us 
himself, the government will be very pleased to release very 
shortly a pamphlet explaining to the people of Quebec that only the 
government of Canada, the federal government, can provide them 
with any guarantee about the future of the social safety net.
<P>
<B>(1345)</B>
<P>
	The government was sleazy enough to wait for the tabling of the 
Quebec budget. They thought this budget would not be very 
popular. After all, who is blamed for the cuts? The Canadian Health 
and Social Transfer, for example, is being reduced by $4 billion 
over three years. This means that the provinces have to cut down 
health care services. And yet, we are now creating a health care 
research fund. Still another overlapping, another duplication.
<P>
	I fail to see the efficiency of such a process. I can give you seven 
good reasons to withdraw this bill. I also wonder why the 
government waited until after the referendum to introduce in the 
House this bill which allows them to take over the direction, 
implementation and control of social and economic policies. Why?
<P>
	This bill allows the government to go over the head of the 
provinces, to interfere directly, as I said, with organizations, 
municipal governments or individuals, regardless of the provincial 
jurisdictions.
<P>
	This will lead to disputes and a lack of social cohesion. That is 
what my constituents tell me. As the hon. member for Quebec, I am 
often asked who was the federal member before me, the federal 
government being so far away. For example, we know what 
happened when the federal government managed Quebec harbour. 
We know what happened to cultural activities when the federal 
built the Old Port in 1984. They put up cement blocks and erected 
structures that had to be torn down because they were not 
integrated to the cultural reality, the historic environment of the old 
port of Quebec City. So we know what happens when, being so 
detached from the people, the federal government decides for the 
provinces.
<P>
	The bill prevents Quebec from implementing a truly integrated 
social policy. The minister's intervention power will be 
dangerously increased in matters concerning income security, 
children, seniors, support for provinces for secondary education, 
social assistance, labour market adjustment and student loans.
<P>
	That is why the Bloc is opposed to the bill. The bill also opens 
the door to privatization, contracting out of certain programs, such 
as unemployment insurance and the Canada pension plan, for 
example.
<P>
	I repeat, the government is giving itself the legal basis enabling 
it to encroach massively upon provincial fields of jurisdiction. 
Many of my colleagues have already mentioned this morning, but 
that is what is going on it bears repeating: the government will 
encroach upon provincial fields of jurisdiction, such as child care 
and manpower. That is what I call waste.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois was elected for those reasons. Quite 
naively, I thought we, the 52 Bloc Quebecois members who were in 
the House, could convince the federal government to put an end to 
all these overlaps and encroachments.
<P>
	On the contrary, what have we seen in the last three years? The 
speech from the throne contains only new encroaching and 
overlapping measures. They are trying to make us believe they are 
decentralizing. But there is no such thing as decentralization 
without the powers and money that go with it; you do not give 
powers without the necessary funds. We know very well what can 
be achieved without funds: not much. With one dollar, you can do 
so much, with two dollars, you can do a little more, but with three 
dollars, you can do a lot more.
<P>
	Transfers to the provinces in the areas of health, post-secondary 
education and welfare have been cut. We know what is happening; 
people are very angry.
<P>
	Once again last weekend I met with some of my constituents. 
They urged me to ask the government in this House not to go ahead 
with the proposed reform.
<P>
<B>(1350)</B>
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois has done a very good job. We were able to 
explain to people and to organizations in our ridings how the 
federal government was hurting the provinces by cutting its 
transfers. My constituents understand, and I am sure the same is 
true for all members who have worked in their ridings and who 
have been able to make the people understand what is going on. 
Our constituents will not be fooled. They will no longer be fooled. 
On the contrary, they are well-informed, they read and watch the 
same news we do.
<P>
	The news tell us that it is not what we want. We are speaking for 
Quebec, but I am sure that in other provinces, several ministers and 
premiers also deplore what is going on.
<P>
	In this bill, the federal government legitimizes and legalizes the 
numerous interventions it has made in areas under provincial 
jurisdiction in the name of its spending power. I think this is clear.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="1654"> 1654 </A></B>
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois will fight. Should this bill be passed, we 
would still continue to inform people, to tell them about the cuts 
and about the federal government's interference in areas under 
provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	When there is a consensus in a province, that is what we call 
social unity, and that kind of social unity must be respected and not 
ignored in this House. This bill is an example of just how the 
desires of an entire population, federalists, sovereignists, anyone 
and everyone, can be trampled on. This is what the federal 
government is being asked, but it turns a deaf ear.
<P>
	I shall end here, trusting that what I have had to say this morning 
will have been successful, if not in changing anyone's mind-for I 
do not believe that the other side of this House is likely to change 
its mind-at least in making them think of the reality of what is 
going on in Quebec in the area of manpower training, when the 
unemployment rate is 11 per cent or more, as it is in my riding. 
What does it mean if over 11 per cent of people are on welfare?
<P>
	It means that the provinces will have to assume responsibility for 
these people as they look for work. Often, these are not true job 
creation measures, because true job creation measures need to be 
cohesive and they must involve the various local, social and 
economic stakeholders.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Godin (Châteauguay, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to thank my colleague for Québec. I am also sorry not to hear 
from the Liberal government on such an important bill on 
unemployment insurance.
<P>
	I too fail to understand how, despite a consensus at all levels in 
Quebec, this government can still refuse to decentralize its powers 
to the provinces. Quebec is not the only province calling for 
decentralization, they all are. We know we are carrying around this 
debt, which, around 1997-98, will reach $600 billion with $50 
billion in interest.
<P>
	Just imagine, if we had $50 billion a year to invest in job 
creation, we would not be here debating this bill. We know the debt 
is simply the result of waste, duplication and the symbols of 
Canada they have been trying to build in recent years.
<P>
<B>(1355)</B>
<P>
	My colleague was saying earlier that this government's 
management style is piecemeal. I would say, rather, that all these 
programs are much more the government's showcase. What is 
important for the federal government is to have a showcase in each 
province to establish its presence. But what is the effect? It serves 
practically no purpose.
<P>
	I would ask my colleague to tell me about the advantage, not 
only for Quebec but for all the provinces, of having only one 
employment window with all the  powers and the costs and the 
money and of not being constantly stymied by these national 
directives.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Gagnon (Québec):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for 
his remarks and his question. I could simply say that this 
government does not understand the meaning of the words 
decentralization and deregulation. When the government wants to 
ignore the provinces and negotiate agreements directly with local 
organizations and institutions, it is indeed because it wants to have 
a window. It insists upon having its place next to the Government 
of Quebec or the government of another province to show that, with 
its little grants, it will get a little recognition.
<P>
	As for what the result of all this would be, the answer I would 
give my colleague is another word to which this government is 
probably allergic: efficiency. That is what we would get. I think 
that, if we had the money and the programs, this is the policy we 
would like to implement in Quebec, a policy that is agreed upon by 
sovereignists and federalists alike in that province. I hope the 
government will finally understand that the views we express in 
this House are not sovereignist views, but the views of the people 
of Quebec and of stakeholders in the social and economic fields in 
that province.

	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
an issue of <I>Entre parenthèses</I>, Impératif français reminds us that in 
the federal government, English is the real working language.
<P>
	It says that 22.8 per cent of management positions are held by 
francophones whereas 32.8 per cent of support positions are filled 
by francophones. In other words, the higher you go on the salary 
scale, the less room there is for francophones.
<P>
	Impératif français also points out that the federal government is 
more bilingual in Quebec. While the English minority in Quebec 
forms only 10 per cent of the population, 52.7 per cent of positions 
in the federal public service are bilingual.
<P>
	Moreover, according to the most recent statistics issued by the 
Treasury Board, in 1994-95, 88 per cent of translation done in the 
federal government was from English into French, or roughly the 
same proportion as 10 years ago. Impératif français is quite right: 
in Canada, 25 years after the coming into force of the Official 
Languages Act, English is more official than French.

forces today resulting in many deaths and injuries.
<P>
	This tragic occurrence must be condemned by everyone. 
Although Israelis said it was an accident, this does not make it 
acceptable. Civilians being sheltered by the UN must not only 
avoid being targeted but combatants must avoid them in all 
circumstances.
<P>
	This tragedy points to the futility and destructiveness of the

	Recently I sent requests to approximately 600 publishing 
companies across Canada for donations of  Canadiana. These books 
are for the library at the recently established department of 
Canadian studies at the University of Havana.
<P>
	The response has been tremendous. On a daily basis we are 
receiving eight to ten boxes of books. These donations are a clear 
example of the sympathy that Canadians have for the struggle 
faced by the people and students of Cuba. We should continue to do 
all that we can to help this island nation overcome the hardships 
imposed upon it by the unjust embargo.

treatment program for young people between the ages of 14 and 19 
experiencing substance abuse problems along with significant 
difficulties in their personal growth.
<P>
	The community supports the individual's efforts in living up to 
personal obligations and encourages progress. This is done in the 
context of a series of groups where achievements are reviewed and 
new challenges set.
<P>
	Portage is widely recognized as one of the most successful and 
cost effective programs in existence for rehabilitating substance 
abusers. Globally the program boasts that 85 per cent of graduates 
remain drug free.
<P>
	Atlantic Canada is in need of this kind of therapy program as 
many of those in need of treatment have been travelling to the U.S. 
for rehab.

No. Norman Desrocher had dared to do the unthinkable. He sold his

state employees, one-third of them well armed, to seize a legally

cowardly actions but usually it is by Canada's enemies and not 
Canada's own. I cannot condone the cheap shots from the defence 
minister as he questions the loyalty of Reform MPs to our military 
merely to deflect criticism of his own incompetence.

me or any member on principled behaviour, integrity or even on 
being un-Canadian.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="RESEARCHANDDEVELOPMENT">RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, historically, Quebec has always been penalized when it 
came to federal research and development spending. The proof of 
this is that, from 1979 to 1991, Quebec received only 18.6 per cent 
of federal funding in this area, while Ontario received 50 per cent. 
These funds create many jobs and are highly stimulating to the 
economy.
<P>
	This is an area in which Quebec would like to have its fair share. 
It is certainly more positive on the economic level for our tax 
dollars to come back to us for research and development instead of 
unemployment insurance.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Natural Resources. How, 
under these circumstances, can she justify her department's choice 
of priorities in cutting off funding for the Tokamak project in 
Varennes, when this adds to the inequity from which Quebec has 
suffered far too long already in R&amp;D?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Natural Resources, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, as I have indicated in this House before, this 
government confronted with a significant fiscal crisis has been 
forced to make very difficult choices. We have to set priorities as a 
government.
<P>
	We are an energy rich nation and I am sure the hon. member 
appreciates that fact. In this energy rich nation, unfortunately 
fusion research is not a priority. Therefore, when asked to reduce 
my department's budget by some 60 per cent over three and 
one-half to four years, we had to set priorities. We set priorities and 
unfortunately fusion was not one of them.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, how can the minister justify her decision to end 
investments in the Tokamak project without any consultation with 
her partners, including the Government of Quebec, despite the fact 
that they funded 50 per cent of the project?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Natural Resources, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I come back to the point that we have to make choices 
and we have to set priorities. In this country we have done that in 
relation to energy research.
<P>
	I am not suggesting that fusion research does not have a place. I 
am sure that the people who do this work do good work. 
Unfortunately it is not a priority when we look at the other energy 
sources this nation possesses.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B>Mr. 
Speaker, I feel obliged to tell the minister that everyone in Quebec 
is opposed to her decision and would offer as proof the unanimous 
resolution by the National Assembly condemning her decision. 
That makes it twice this week that the federal government has 
managed to turn Quebec unanimously against it.
<P>
	How can the minister persist with her decision to cut off her $7.5 
million involvement in the Varennes basic research project, in 
which she is involved with other partners, while last June she added 
$15 million to the TRIUMF project in B.C.? This is also a basic
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1659"> 1659 </A></B>
<P>
research project, and one in which the federal government is the  
sole investor. Why cut back in Quebec, where there is already anR&amp;D deficit, while stepping up investment elsewhere?
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Natural Resources, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, let me assure the hon. member that my department 
has not contributed any funding to the TRIUMPH project.
<P>
	Let me come back to the basic point. Government, especially in 
these difficult fiscal times, is about choices and setting priorities. 
We all must do this. The government has set those priorities.
<P>
	My department, facing a 60 per cent reduction, set priorities and 
made choices. In this country fusion as a possible energy source is 
not a research priority.

	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, last night we heard on the news that the government was 
on the verge of announcing that it has reached an agreement with 
the maritime provinces on the goods and services tax. Under this 
agreement, these provinces would receive $1 billion in 
compensation from the federal government.
<P>
	Can the minister confirm that such an agreement has been 
reached and, more importantly, that $1 billion will be paid to the 
maritime provinces as compensation?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
we are negotiating with several provinces. This being said, there is 
no final agreement to date. When we have one, I will be pleased to 
make an announcement in this House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, is the minister aware that, if indeed the maritime 
provinces receive compensation, he will be asking Canadians in the 
other provinces to pay for it out of their own money? He will reach 
into their pockets to compensate for a tax people in the maritimes 
will no longer be paying. This is quite a present.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, if 
ever there were compensation, it would be for losses incurred. As a 
matter of fact, if we look at federal adjustment programs, as in the 
case of the Crow benefit, even if they were adjustments in 
transportation subsidies to the Atlantic provinces and Quebec, 
adjustments were made.
<P>
	This is what our country is all about, the federal government 
together with the people of Canada provide assistance to those 
regions or parts of the country in need. Is the member saying that 
when compensation was  specifically geared to Quebec, it should 
have been denied? I believe this to be a rather absurd notion 
Quebecers would find totally unacceptable.

	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of National Defence.
<P>
	Chief of Defence Staff Boyle is up to his ears in the Somalia 
scandal cover-up, and yet the defence minister continues to allow 
Boyle to act as suspect, star witness, judge and jury in the Somalia 
affair.
<P>
	Will the defence minister, in the name of fairness and justice, ask 
Boyle, who should never have been made chief of defence staff in 
the first place, to step aside until the Somalia inquiry gets to the 
bottom of this whole affair?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in the name of 
fairness and justice, the hon. member should allow the inquiry to 
do its job.
<P>
	It is quite alarming when the hon. member comes to the House 
day after day and attacks a hard working public servant who is 
unable to come into the Chamber and defend himself.
<P>
	The chief of defence staff will be able to give all of his views on 
matters relevant to Somalia when the commission begins its 
hearings. That is the way Canadians expect justice to be handled, 
not by answering such libelled questions coming from the hon. 
member day after day.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I do not blame the chief of defence staff. I blame the 
Minister of National Defence for this mess.
<P>
<B>(1425 )</B>
<P>
	Canadians will not be surprised if the defence minister refuses to 
take any action against his friend Jean Boyle. The defence minister 
and the Prime Minister could not have appointed Boyle as chief of 
defence staff with the recommendation of the privy council office.
<P>
	Will the minister admit that the privy council office had serious 
reservations about Boyle's suitability for the position of chief of 
defence staff? Can he tell the House what concerns the office 
expressed and why he rejected them?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member's question is absolute nonsense. I ask him, with all 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1660"> 1660 </A></B>
<P>
decency, to cease and desist  these horrible personal attacks on a 
man who is serving Canada with distinction.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, in view of the attempted cover-up of data relevant to 
the Somalia inquiry, the Somalia inquiry had to shut down this 
week. The commissioners continue to be concerned about the 
integrity of the documents they received from the minister's 
department and they are now concerned about the integrity of the 
work the commission is able to do.
<P>
	When will the minister accept responsibility for this entire 
scandal and cover-up and resign?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, most Canadians 
understand that when one gives the answer no, one means no. 
Obviously the Reform Party cannot understand that barest of 
two-letter words.
<P>
	With respect to the question of documentation, the department 
has met the deadline established by the commission. The 
commission is now evaluating the department's response. The 
commission, I assume, will have something to say about this 
tomorrow.
<P>
	The commission will have to decide if it still requires documents 
essential to its work which have not yet surfaced. Then it is its job 
as a commission, quoting the terms of reference, ``to investigate all 
matters, including allegations of cover-up and destruction of 
evidence''. The matter is for the commission to investigate and to 
decide what has happened to those documents.

	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Natural Resources.
<P>
	For some weeks now, Quebec has been trying to reason with the 
Minister of Natural Resources. In a letter dated April 2, three 
Quebec ministers argued that the Canadian Centre for Magnetic 
Fusion represents one of the biggest scientific projects ever 
undertaken in the province of Quebec and asked the Minister of 
Natural Resources to reconsider her decision.
<P>
	Does the minister realize that her decision to cut off the $7.5 
million federal contribution to the Tokamak project in Varennes 
will entail the loss of about 100 high tech jobs in Quebec, including 
some 40 international level research jobs in greater Montreal, and 
will jeopardize the future of a centre of excellence set up in Quebec 
and recognized world wide?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Natural Resources, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, as I have said before in the House, government 
involves setting priorities and making  difficult choices. 
Unfortunately expenditures on fusion by the government at this 
time are not a priority.
<P>
	The hon. member talks about high tech jobs and benefits for the 
province of Quebec. As I have already mentioned to him on a 
number of occasions, Candu research by AECL and the sale of one 
Candu reactor in the export market potentially delivers $100 
million worth of economic benefits to the province of Quebec. It 
delivers 4,000 potential person hours of employment to the 
province of Quebec.
<P>
	I come back to the point I made before that government is about 
choices. One of our choices is to develop the export market for the 
Candu reactor. That will lead to significant economic opportunities 
and high tech, high skilled jobs for the province of Quebec.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
minister is reminding us of the benefits the province of Quebec is 
getting from CANDU. She should know that these benefits amount 
only to 12 per cent, well under what Quebec should receive in 
benefits.
<P>
<B>(1430)</B>
<P>
	The minister always talks about priorities. The province of 
Quebec is sick of paying for this government's priorities. Quebec 
has had enough of the federal government making miserly 
economies at its expense.
<P>
	Given the unanimous motion passed yesterday in the Quebec 
National Assembly and the overwhelming negative impact the 
minister's decision will have on the economy of Quebec and on its 
international reputation in fundamental research, will the minister 
agree to reconsider her decision and to reinstate the $7.5 million 
federal subsidy that can save the Tokamak project in Varennes?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Natural Resources, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member talks about concepts like fair share 
and priorities. My department spends 25 per cent of its R and D 
budget in the province Quebec. That is proportionate to the 
population of the province of Quebec. We spend that R and D in 
part in areas that are an energy priority for the country such as 
energy efficiency, renewable energy and remote community energy 
efficiency.
<P>
	As a department we do more than our fair share in the province 
of Quebec, and that money is spent on the government's priorities.

GST issue has come to a head.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1661"> 1661 </A></B>
<P>
	During the election the Liberals campaigned up and down 
streets promising that if they were elected the GST would meet 
its end. That was then, this is now.
<P>
	I want the finance minister to make something very clear for 
Canadians and for the House. Was it his position that when they 
were campaigning on doorsteps around the country they were 
telling Canadians that if elected they would spend $1 billion to 
permanently weld into place the most hated tax in Canadian history 
by integrating it with the sales taxes of the Atlantic provinces? Is 
that what he expects Canadians to believe?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
our position during the election campaign was set out very clearly 
on page 22 of the red book. I suggest the member read it. It talks 
about ease of administration, it talks about simplification, it talks 
about harmonization with the provinces. It talks about making the 
tax system more responsive to consumers and to small businesses, 
which is clearly the intention of the government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not 
know how the finance minister expects Canadians to believe that 
when his own caucus does not even believe it. That is why it is 
voting against him.
<P>
	The finance minister knows there are many Liberals in the 
government who would not be sitting where they are today if they 
had not promised their faces off that the GST would be gone under 
a Liberal government.
<P>
	Why does the finance minister not just ask for the public's 
forgiveness and admit the Liberals made a promise they knew they 
could not possibly meet?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
how many members of the Reform Party does the member think 
would have been elected if they had known that last year Reform 
would come forth with a budget which would eviscerate medicare?
<P>
	How many members of the Reform Party would have been 
elected if they had known Reform would virtually eliminate the old 
age pension? How many members of the Reform Party would have 
been elected had they known that what this party really stands for is 
old age pensions for the rich but nothing for the poor and had they 
known it would cut transfers?
<P>
	How many members of the Reform Party would have been 
elected if the true colours of that party and the divisions that have 
been made manifest had been clear to them at the time of the 
election?

	The conflict in Lebanon is getting worse. Today, the Israeli army 
attacked a refugee camp under UN  protection. Sixty-eight people, 
mainly civilians, including children, and also UN peacekeepers, are 
reported to have been killed. Although Israel did acknowledge its 
mistake, the fact remains that such mistakes are unforgivable and 
could be repeated as long as the conflict rages on.

<P>
	Does the Minister of Foreign Affairs intend to intervene with the

<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, on behalf of the government and the people of Canada, I 
wish to express our deep sympathy and regret to the families of the 
victims and the people of Lebanon. This morning's attacks, which 
killed civilians, including children, and members of the UN 
peacekeeping mission, are unacceptable to Canada.
<P>
	We called a meeting with the Israeli chargé d'affaires to convey 
this message. We asked for a ceasefire, a cessation of hostilities, 
and the reinforcement of the peace process in Lebanon.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, can the 
minister undertake to intervene with the UN to have the Security 
Council present Israel and Lebanon with a plan for a lasting peace?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I welcome the suggestion from the hon. member. The 
security council will take up this matter sometime this afternoon 
based on a resolution from the Egyptians.
<P>
	We are not at present a member of the security council. However, 
I will certainly have our ambassador there make the position of the 
Canadian government known, as I have stated it.
<P>
	There is a meeting scheduled for Monday in Luxemburg of all 
the foreign ministers whose governments were part of the Sharm el

Israel, the Palestinians and us.
<P>
	We will use that forum as well to express our strong concern 
about the attacks, to put in place actions against terrorism, to 
promote the development of peace and to initiate the kinds of aid or

	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in seeking

would get rid of the GST. He further  stated on March 6, 1990 it 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1662"> 1662 </A></B>
<P>
would be difficult to do that if the federal tax becomes integrated 
with provincial taxes.
<P>
	If harmonization was bad then, why is it not bad now?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
harmonization obviously leads to a better tax for consumers and for 
small business.
<P>
	With a harmonized tax one still has all of the flexibility required 
to administer the tax system both at the federal level and the 
provincial levels.
<P>
	I cannot believe the hon. member is actually suggesting we 
should not try to rationalize the system, that we should not try to 
reduce the costs, that we should not try to develop a tax system that 
would be far more efficient and make us far more competitive as 
we face the opposition that exists outside our borders, not inside.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I guess the 
short version of that answer is he is now enlightened.
<P>
	Not all the Atlantic provinces have jumped on the harmonization 
band wagon. The MLAs of Prince Edward Island are seeking 
further input because, to quote one, ``a blended levy would broaden 
the tax base moving into areas not currently taxed by the PST such 
as electricity, heating oil, drugs, some clothing and footwear, 
equipment for the physically challenged and textbooks''.
<P>
	Is this what the finance minister wants to do, tax the physically 
challenged?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, if 
one takes a look at the GST one will see there is an extensive line of 
rebates to take care of physically disadvantaged people or lower 
income people. This is a great advantage that exists within the GST 
that does not exist within the PST.

<P>
	Those concerned continue to oppose the coast guard's new fee

the impact of the new fee structure, our marine sector will become 
less competitive vis-à-vis the U.S.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister

based on the principle of user pay, user say.
<P>
	I should, however, remind the House and the hon. member that 
this matter is now the subject of an inquiry by a parliamentary 
committee which is currently sitting. It will complete its very 
extensive hearing of witnesses from all parts of the country this 
afternoon and will write a report this evening.
<P>
	The minister has engaged himself to read the report, to wait on it 
before making decisions. It would be a lack of conformity to the

Therefore, further statements should wait until the minister has 
read the report.

<P>
	Since fees will be charged to the ships going to Canadian ports

	The Freshwater Institute in Winnipeg and the Canadian Centre 
for Inland Waters in Burlington are facing severe budget cuts, 
threatening one of Canada's greatest assets, namely fresh water.
<P>
	Can the minister commit to maintaining the 1993-94 funding 
levels of these two internationally renowned institutions for fresh 
water science?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. 
member for Davenport for his question.

<P>
	<B>Mr. McWhinney:</B> No one has spoken more eloquently before 
the House and in international arenas in support of principles of 
environmental protection and conservation of scarce natural 
resources.
<P>
	The hon. member will understand that the government is 
committed as a top priority to reducing the deficit, to balancing the 
budget. Our treasurer has brought in a magnificent budget that has 
commanded general support. This has involved, however, in the 
interests of achieving that, across the board economies in all 
departments imposed.

	<B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is 
also for the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans.
<P>
	The Government of Canada has provided hundreds of millions of 
dollars to the east coast fishery through a variety of programs for 
the last decade.
<P>
	Recently the minister announced an $80 million licence 
buy-back in British Columbia. He is aware that virtually all of this 
money was contributed by west coast fishermen through licence 
fee increases they have had to pay for the past 25 years.
<P>
	Can the minister of fisheries explain the disparity of treatment 
between the east and west coast fishing industries by his 
department where billions of dollars are dedicated to the east coast 
but only $80 million is dedicated to the west coast, which is really 
only a return of fishermen's contributions in the first place?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the situations on the 
east coast and the west coast are not cognate. On the east coast we 
face the disappearance of an industry and the loss of 40,000 jobs. 
The situation on  the west coast is one that involves a crisis in the 
year 1996 with the expectation that the industry will get back to 
better times in 1997 and 1998.
<P>
	The measures taken by the government have been taken with the 
advice of a round table of 70 people representing all segments of 
the industry. We believe they are enough to carry us through this 
difficult time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wonder if the 
minister has tried to determine how many jobs on the west coast 
will be lost as a result of his plan.
<P>
	There is a delegation of people here from British Columbia 
today representing half a million British Columbians who are very 
concerned about their future and the future of their communities in 
the wake of the minister's plan. These people participated in these 
round table discussions and state unequivocally that their 
recommendations in that process were ignored.
<P>
	Can the minister explain how it is that although he claims wide 
consultations with all the stakeholders, there is a delegation 
representing half a million British Columbians here today 
demanding that he withdraw this plan? Will he listen to them and 
do so?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am happy to assure 
the hon. member that I have met with this delegation today on 
behalf of the minister. I believe, after a number of years of 
experience outside Parliament, that I am good at listening to 
representations.
<P>
	The government is very concerned with the fate of the industry 
on the west coast. Urgent measures are being taken to meet the 
situation in 1996. The plan put into operation, about which we are 
still receiving advice and looking for advice, will carry us to the 
better times in 1997 and 1998.

<P>
	Tran Trieu Quan, a Canadian citizen, is still rotting in a

Excel Cotton, a company owned by Mr. Morgan, submitted its

January.
<P>
	Why is it that, while both the current Minister of Foreign Affairs

more than a year, the federal government hid from Mr. Quan's 
family and the Vietnamese authorities the fact that they knew 
where Mr. Morgan was?

<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the government is hiding nothing. All the information we 
had was shared with the lawyers of the family, the family itself and 
with the respective authorities.
<P>
	This is a matter of very serious consequence. I have watched 
with some dismay the statements of the hon. member who rather 
than trying to provide a solution simply tries to provoke more 
misrepresentation and misinformation.
<P>
<B>(1450 )</B>
<P>
	If we are going to find a solution to this problem we should be 
working together, not trying to provoke the kind of uninformed 
reaction the hon. member is promoting.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philippe Paré (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Minister of Foreign Affairs is apparently about to announce the 
appointment of a special advisor to deal with cases such as that of 
Mr. Quan. But his colleague, the President of the Treasury Board, 
stated yesterday that there was nothing more that the federal 
government could do to resolve this matter.
<P>
	How credible are the minister's alleged initiatives, given that his 
remarks are contradicted by his own colleague's statements and 
that the government keeps developing trade relations with Vietnam 
without demanding that human rights be respected, as they should 
be in Mr. Quan's case?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in any one year some four to five million Canadians travel 
abroad in a wide variety of circumstances. In most cases when they 
need assistance it is provided through the consular services of the 
government. From time to time there are special or difficult cases 
where people get entrapped in local laws, requirements and 
regulations.
<P>
	For that reason I am announcing today that we have set up a 
special adviser on consular matters who will take on the 
responsibility for dealing with the kinds of cases on an 
active-proactive basis such as the Quan case or the 
Spencer-Lamont case so that we can provide the full attention of 
government. That as much as anything else demonstrates our real 
commitment to ensure the full protection of the rights of Canadian 
citizens when they go abroad.

	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, on Tuesday, 
the Deputy Prime Minister said it was the policy of the government 
to protect the viability of the  Canada pension plan for seniors in 
the long term. That policy was reaffirmed yesterday by the 
Minister of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	Yet when I look at the fine print on page 1.16 of the public 
accounts what do I find? ``The government's authority to pay 
pensions and benefits is limited to the balance in the account.''
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Finance. Is the government 
prepared to put its money where its mouth is and demonstrate its 
commitment to the Canada pension plan by reporting the unfunded 
liability of $500 billion in the public accounts of Canada?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the way in which the government provides for its accounts is 
obviously established by a tradition and also by generally accepted 
accounting principles established by the auditor general. We will 
continue to provide for accounts in that way.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, that was as 
an eloquent reply.
<P>
	The point I am trying to make is that we hear all kinds of verbal 
commitments from the government, but when we look at the fine 
print we find out there are all kinds of loopholes for it to escape 
through and walk away from its obligation to people.
<P>
	Can the Minister of Finance preserve the Canada pension plan 
for seniors and maintain their faith in the government's pension 
plan by putting the unfunded liability in the public accounts of 
Canada?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the hon. member for his comment about my eloquence. After 
my answer to the member from Calgary I needed that.
<P>
	The government stands four square behind the Canada pension 
plan. The unfunded liability, as the member describes it, is a 
natural consequence of a pay as you go plan. One of the options 
that is being looked at by the commission is to fund it a great deal 
more and that is something we will be discussing with the 
provinces.
<P>
	The fundamental point is that the government is engaging in 
these consultations because it supports the Canada pension plan. 
The government believes it is important to have a Canada pension 
plan there for all Canadians, not simply wealthy Canadians. The 
government supports the Canada pension plan because it does not 
agree with the position of the Reform Party which is to have 
pensions only for the rich and to leave the poor, poor.

question is for the Minister of Health.
<P>
	The Minister of Health and those who attended yesterday's raw 
milk cheese tasting organized by the Bloc Quebecois and several 
cheese producers were able to see that the various products 
currently on the market are simply excellent. In that regard, I am 
pleased to see that the Minister is the picture of health.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Picard:</B> Does the minister realize that, according to data 
from his own government, the consumption of raw milk cheese has 
not resulted in any case of poisoning in Canada, unlike several 
other food items, including cabbage in Nova Scotia? Will the 
minister also prohibit the sale of cabbage from Nova Scotia?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday I accepted the invitation of my colleague. She is quite 
correct. I did attend a very good reception put on by the producers 
of cheese in the  province of Quebec. I also shared with my hon. 
colleague some good wine from the province of Nova Scotia.
<P>
	As for my side effects, that is probably demonstrable in the 
answer I am going to give. The information that we have from the 
scientists has now been put out to the scientific industry and the 
various experts. They are going to examine it. After their 
examination, we will then be in a position to make our decision.
<P>
	I want to thank the hon. member for bringing this issue to our 
attention. However, I want to say to her and to all hon. members, it 
is important that we keep our rhetoric down so that we can make 
the most appropriate decision for all Canadians.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, will the 
minister realize that there is no problem with raw milk cheese, that 
the current standards are very adequate, and that the real issue 
concerns his public servants who have nothing better to do than bug 
people to justify their employment?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member again raises the question. As the minister 
responsible for health, it is my duty, my fiduciary obligation, that 
when scientific evidence and information becomes available I have 
to share it with the Canadian people and take the appropriate action 
on that information.
<P>
	In my view, no minister of health, federally or provincially, can 
take that scientific information and throw it in the garbage can. It is 
very important that we examine it. We will examine it thoroughly 
with all the various experts and we will make the appropriate 
decision based on scientific information.

<B><A NAME="1666"> 1666 </A></B>
<P>
preservation of the Canada pension plan.  That is the reason we set 
up, along with the provinces, the consultation process which is now 
under way.
<P>
	As the hon. member knows, a number of options are being 
looked at within that consultation process, one of which is to 
increase substantially the degree of funding so that it will go from 
simply a two-year reserve to a much greater degree of funding, 
which may well be an option the provinces and the federal 
government will come to. It is premature, but it is one of the things 
being discussed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, could the 
Minister of Finance indicate that in follow-up public accounts this 
unfunded liability will be noted and that the government is 
prepared to accept it on a long term basis, rather than the present 
situation where there is not a commitment either by public 
accounts, as noted, or by the finance minister?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
there very clearly is a commitment to the Canada pension plan. It 
has been stated unequivocally by the government, in terms of 
young Canadians coming along, that the Canada pension plan will 
be there for them. That is the purpose of the consultation.
<P>
	I believe the member's question goes beyond that, that he is 
talking about the way accounts of this government or any other 
government are provided. That is a valid debate, the outstanding 
liabilities of any national government or any provincial 
government of this country or any other. That certainly is a debate 
in which we are prepared to engage. It is precisely to deal with 
those kinds of problems that the government is dealing with the 
problems the country faces today and also anticipating those in the

Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in a meeting I held 
yesterday with my assistant deputy minister, in response to the 
concerns expressed by employees about their futures, I issued a 
directive that we look at a number of options.
<P>
	The first option would be to seek further economies, as required 
under the program review, the possibility of economies from 
within. The second option would be to pursue a number of 
expressions of interest by employees interested in takeovers. The 
third possibility would be to examine whether there might be an 
application for a strict commercialisation of services which would 
guarantee employees not only their long term jobs but also their 
current union status. Those three options are being explored by the

	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-11, 
an act to establish the Department of Human Resources Develop-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1667"> 1667 </A></B>
<P>
ment and to amend and repeal certain  related acts, be read the third 
time and passed, and of the amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. George Proud (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Labour, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am proud to have the opportunity to 
speak on Bill C-11.
<P>
	As hon. members know, the legislation deals essentially with 
administrative matters regarding the formation of Human 
Resources Development Canada, better known as HRDC.
<P>
	The government is surprised that the Bloc Quebecois suddenly 
decided to attack this legislation. There is certainly nothing sinister 
about it. It contains no new powers and simply reiterates HRDC's 
existing mandate.
<P>
	I understand that members opposite are especially concerned 
about clauses 6, 20 and 21 of the bill. I will begin by dealing with 
clause 6.
<P>
	This clause addresses strictly the department's mandate. 
Apparently there is a misunderstanding that clause 6 would enable 
the Government of Canada to intrude in provincial jurisdiction. 
This is definitely not the case.
<P>
	The hon. members who comprise Her Majesty's Loyal 
Opposition are reading things into this legislation which are just 
not there. If members opposite will read the bill carefully they will 
see it limits the minister's powers to ``matters over which 
Parliament has jurisdiction''. That seems clear enough to me. The 
provision does not give the minister jurisdiction over provincial 
matters; it does just the opposite.
<P>
	There is nothing in clause 6 that does not relate to existing 
programs. It simply combines the existing program mandates from 
the four former departments which constitute HRDC. There is no 
subterfuge designed to undermine provincial legislation at all.
<P>
	The government does not think it necessary to waste 
Parliament's valuable time spelling out in the bill every detail of 
every program HRDC is responsible for. Even if we did, something 
tells me members opposite still would not be satisfied.
<P>
	Clause 6 of the bill before us sets out the basic objectives of the 
department: enhancing employment, encouraging equality and 
promoting social security. These objectives are clearly within the 
jurisdiction of the Government of Canada.
<P>
	Members opposite have also raised concerns regarding clause 20 
of Bill C-11. This clause allows the minister to enter into 
agreements with the provinces or with financial institutions or 
other such bodies. Clause 20 is adapted from section 7 of the 
employment and immigration department and commission act, 
from section 6 of the heritage act and from section 5 of the labour 
act. Under the legislation before the House clause 20 will allow the 
minister to enter only into agreements similar to those in the past.
<P>
	For example, in 1991 the minister of employment signed an 
agreement with the Government of Quebec. That agreement 
recognized Quebec's Société québécois du développement de la 
main d'oeuvre, SQDM, and its vital role in labour force training in 
that province.
<P>
	Nevertheless, apparently members opposite still think clause 20 
gives the minister too much discretionary power; that is, too much 
power to reach agreements they think will intrude on all areas of 
provincial jurisdiction. That is definitely not the case.
<P>
	Let us look at the wording of clause 20. It states clearly that these 
agreements are for the purpose of facilitating programs related to 
``the powers, duties and functions referred to in section 6''. This 
clause sets out the minister's mandate. There is nothing new in it, 
nor does it create any new powers.
<P>
<B>(1510)</B>
<P>
	Surely the members of Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition can see 
the minister's discretionary powers are limited by the department's 
mandate.
<P>
	The bill clearly states the limitation is to matters over which 
Parliament has jurisdiction. Therefore there is no way clause 20 
authorizes the minister to encroach on provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	Clause 20 allows HRDC to sign contracts with other 
organizations. The department could not function without that 
authority. The minister has signed thousands of contracts and 
agreements with numerous organizations, including the example I 
have already given, and organizations in the province of Quebec. 
Not only that, HRD has signed agreements with the Government of 
Quebec to help unemployed Quebecers return to the labour force.
<P>
	In fiscal 1994-95 we signed more than 50,000 labour market 
contracts in the province of Quebec. Through those contracts we 
invested a total of $695 million in program funding and income 
support. That was done under existing legislation. Bill C-11 simply 
carries forward these arrangements.
<P>
	As I emphasized, clause 20 will not be used to bypass the 
authority of provincial governments or to intrude on their areas of 
jurisdiction.
<P>
	The third clause apparently keeping members opposite awake at 
nights is clause 21. I do not know why, because all clause 21 states 
is that the minister may delegate his authority, especially to the 
Minister of Labour. This section also enables the minister to 
delegate authority in order to support single window delivery, a key 
component in Human Resources Development Canada's services 
delivery network.
<P>
	The ultimate aim is to provide Canadians with a simplified, 
faster and more accessible gateway to HRDC's programs and 
services. Single window delivery is a more flexible and a more 
efficient means of reaching that goal.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1668"> 1668 </A></B>
<P>
	As I speak, in Alma, the home town of the premier of Quebec, 
HRDC, SQDM, local municipalities and local clubs are working 
in partnership in a single window delivery system. This is one of 
a number of similar projects we have with the Government of 
Quebec. If the Government of Quebec is willing to work with us, 
and we are glad it is, I fail to understand why members of Her 
Majesty's Loyal Opposition are upset about these arrangements.
<P>
	Another consideration is part II of the government's 
employment insurance legislation. It contains active measures to 
help unemployed Canadians get back to work quickly. This is part 
of our comprehensive response to addressing the underlying causes 
of unemployment.
<P>
	To that end, the minister is currently discussing new 
arrangements with the provinces. However, these agreements will 
not infringe on provincial jurisdiction. On the contrary, the 
minister has made it abundantly clear that the Government of 
Canada will withdraw fully from labour market training in 
recognition of provincial responsibility in this area. We will do this 
over three years or less as we work out the details with each 
province.
<P>
	The federal government would provide financial assistance to 
skills development but only with provincial agreement. In addition, 
the Government of Canada will work in concert with the 
governments of each province to put in place new customized 
labour market arrangements which will meet the different needs 
and circumstances of each province.
<P>
	The Government of Canada will live up to its constitutional 
responsibility. We will retain jurisdiction over the national 
employment insurance system and the national dimension of our 
labour markets.
<P>
	If that is not enough assurance for the party opposite, during the 
debate and the speech from the throne the Prime Minister stated: 
``The federal government is also prepared to withdraw from its 
functions in such areas as labour market training, forestry, mining 
and recreation. That in the 21st century will be more appropriately 
the responsibility of others, provinces, municipalities or the private 
sector''.
<P>
<B>(1515 )</B>
<P>
	In conclusion, I say to members opposite that there is nothing in 
Bill C-11 to suggest that the Government of Canada is centralizing 
national programs. This legislation deals strictly with 
administration. I urge the House to pass this bill so that we can 
move on to more urgent matters which I am sure all Canadians, 
including the people of Quebec, would prefer.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, can I count on the hon. member for Kingston and the 
Islands' friendly support? It would motivate me  in my 
presentation. I would have liked to speak to a bill more concerned 
about fighting poverty.
<P>
	On my way to the House from my office, I was thinking that, 
instead of recycling Bill C-96, a bill that was roundly condemned 
by just about everyone in Quebec, the Minister of Human 
Resources Development would have enjoyed greater support from 
us if he had tabled a bill with two objectives.
<P>
	The first objective would have been to take steps to fight poverty 
and the second one, to give back to Quebec some 25 manpower 
training programs duplicating provincial initiatives in this area, 
because $250 million is being wasted or not used as efficiently as 
possible.
<P>
	Why talk about poverty in 1996? Why should we, as members of 
Parliament, talk about poverty when the minister is about to put 
forward a centralizing bill? May I remind you that, by and large, 
government members took little notice of the annual report tabled a 
few days ago by the National Council of Welfare, which-I think it 
is important to remember this-pointed out that, globally, the 
number of poor people in society is not going down.
<P>
	The government majority may act as though this was not an issue 
but, for all those with a social conscience-and God knows that 
includes the opposition-the fact is that even though people in our 
society are living longer, the poverty rate is rising.
<P>
	In Canada, poor people-that is to say those who have to spend 
56 per cent of their income on basic necessities, such as food, 
clothing and housing-according to Statistics Canada, are 
considered as such when they live in a large urban center and have 
to spend 56 per cent of their income on clothing, food and housing.
<P>
	Looking at poverty rates in Canada, while 15 per cent of the 
population was living under the poverty line in the 1980s, 14 years 
later, 16.6 per cent of Canadians are still living in extremely 
difficult conditions and can be considered as poor.
<P>
	Why did the minister and his government not look into this 
matter? Let me remind the House that the National Welfare 
Council prefaced its remarks by saying-I realize that some 
parliamentarians may not like to hear this, but let us nonetheless 
bear in mind the opening line of the council's press conference and 
related press release, which said: ``Governments should add 
combatting poverty to the list of immediate economic priorities''.
<P>
	When was the last time we heard any member of this cabinet 
protest against the fact that such a situation is tolerated in a society 
like ours, where resources are plentiful, new production 
technologies available and a gross national product of about $750 
billion? Why is this situation being tolerated? How can this 
government allow that? In philosophical terms, it means something 
to be a liberal. But what did these Liberals do, those  Liberals who, 
in the 1960s, were calling upon us to live in a just society, an 
increasingly just society? What does it mean for this Liberal 
government, in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1669"> 1669 </A></B>
<P>
1996, to live in a just society, an increasingly just society, when 
poverty rates are allowed to raise as high as 16 per cent?
<P>
<B>(1520)</B>
<P>
	The National Council of Welfare which, as we will see later, the 
government is about to muzzle with Bill C-11, tells us that 4.8 
million people live at the poverty level. It must be understood that 
poverty, like other phenomena in our society, is not evenly spread.
<P>
	Single parents are hardest hit. Three times out of four, it is the 
woman who is alone, often in difficult conditions, to raise her 
family. The reality is that, in 67 per cent of the cases, it is these 
women who are hit hard and who suffer from poverty.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, you may wonder what these comments have to do 
with Bill C-11. As you know, since I became a member of this 
House, I never allowed myself to be out of order. The connection is 
the following: had the minister taken a good look at the situation, 
he would have realized that we cannot afford to have two levels of 
government investing in programs which are similar in many 
respects.
<P>
	Let me just give you the example of Quebec. Quebec 
employment minister Louise Harel, who happens to be the MNA 
for my riding of Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, told us during the last 
referendum campaign that the province of Quebec alone spends 
$10 billion on its labour market policies. If you take the Quebec 
territory for the purpose of this comparison, relatively speaking 
this is more than what is invested by all OECD countries.
<P>
	As you can see, the problem is not a lack of money. Considerable 
resources are allocated to labour market programs. The problem is 
the duplication of resources.
<P>
	The minister is asking us to pass a bill which, for all intents and 
purposes, seeks to allow federal involvement in areas over which 
this government has no mandate. Try for a moment to imagine one 
of the 33 Fathers of Confederation coming back here and trying to 
understand what provision of the Constitution Act gives this 
government the authority to get involved in the area of labour or 
manpower.
<P>
	Yet, if we were to accept this bill, the human resources branch 
would get involved, as it does unfortunately too often, in income 
security, post-secondary education, social welfare and student 
loans.
<P>
	On the train earlier this week I read-maybe you heard about it 
because I know you have a sharp mind and that nothing escapes 
you in social matters-the Fortin report, which was commissioned 
by Quebec's minister of income security. The economist Pierre 
Fortin is not a research officer for the Bloc. Moreover, he has never 
declared himself in favour of sovereignty. You will be surprised,  
but even more disappointed, to see the analysis made in the Fortin 
report. I take the liberty of quoting from it, with the consent of my 
colleagues.
<P>
	Part of the report reads as follows: ``The federal government has 
already reacted to its own financial crisis in several ways. Of 
course, as we very well know, the federal government's debt is 
rather astronomical, and its deficit out of control''. It goes on to 
say: ``Three federal measures directly affect income security in 
Quebec. First, access to unemployment insurance benefits has been 
reduced in 1990, 1993 and 1994''. In fact, Mr. Fortin should or 
could have gone even further back to 1988, when the 
unemployment insurance program was first attacked by the now 
infamous Conservatives.
<P>
<B>(1525)</B>
<P>
	The report reads: ``For the year 1996-97, a cumulative reduction 
of 15 per cent of transfers to provinces under the CHST has been 
announced. Third, the elimination of the Canada Assistance Plan in 
1996 has been announced''. Hon. members will remember that, 
under CAP, Ottawa used to share the cost of welfare programs 
fifty-fifty with the provinces. The most interesting part in this 
report is that it estimates that the federal retrenchment-in other 
words, the kind of policy being adopted here with regard to 
unemployment insurance-will create a very heavy burden for 
Quebec because 70,000 households will go onto income security if 
the bill is not amended. The direct and indirect costs of this will not 
translate into a deficit, but into unforeseen expenses of $1 billion 
for the province. All of this, because of the offloading the federal 
government is doing. That is how harmful this system is.
<P>
	In a system such as this, it is getting extremely difficult, even for 
the best Quebec government-and I think Quebec has a pretty good 
government right now-to plan effectively and to abide by its 
budgetary decisions, because the federal government can at any 
moment, without prior notice and without negotiating anything, 
wreak havoc with Quebec public finance. That is exactly what 
happened during the last three recessions.
<P>
	As many have said before and as the hon. member for Mercier 
put it so eloquently, this bill which the government side wants us to 
pass is unanimously opposed. It is hard to think of another bill that 
brought together, in a unanimous show of displeasure, the 
employers, the unions, and various associations and co-ops.
<P>
	What I am saying is so true that the hon. member for Kingston 
and the Islands, a lawyer by profession-not his best quality, but 
then it was his choice-will perhaps want to raise a question of 
order at the end of my speech to have this document tabled. Should 
that be the case, I would be glad to table a resolution concerning the 
first version of this bill, numbered C-96, adopted by the Société 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1670"> 1670 </A></B>
<P>
québécoise de développement de la  main-d'oeuvre, whose work 
the hon. member from Kingston may be following.
<P>
	Pursuant to this unanimous resolution, the tripartite board of the 
Société, made up of representatives from the unions, the employers 
and the Quebec government, is asking the federal government to 
take a very praiseworthy initiative, which meets the consensus 
reached in Quebec, and to give back to the province about 25 
programs it currently manages.
<P>
	This is no small achievement when a non-political organization, 
authorized and mandated by the government of Quebec to review 
the labour market policies, has its board, where the Bloc is not 
represented of course, pass a unanimous resolution to urge the 
federal government to give back the areas of jurisdiction related to 
manpower.
<P>
	What are we seeing instead? How can the human resources 
minister be so insensitive, ill-advised and confused as to fail to 
recognize that by passing and supporting Bill C-11, we would 
thoroughly not only violate Quebec's interests but a consensus, 
which is a sacred thing in democracy.
<P>
	If all this was only academic, there would be no reason for 
concern. These would only be rhetoric debates that would have 
nothing to do with the day-to-day life of our fellow citizens.
<P>
<B>(1530)</B>
<P>
	Here are some of the consequences resource duplication in the 
management of labour training programs can have. First, as it is 
now well known, there are 25 manpower training programs in 
Ottawa and 25 others in Quebec.
<P>
	When his party was in power in Quebec, former minister 
Bourbeau, a Liberal, estimated that human resource duplication 
costs us $275 million that could be put to a better use.
<P>
	Even more dramatic is the fact that the system's inconsistency is 
such that, at this very moment, people really need help, really need 
training. You know full well that, as we near the year 2000, more 
and more the jobs that will be created will require 13, 14 or 15 
years of schooling. This is a fact.
<P>
	My father, who is almost 60, worked all his life for the same 
company. He succeeded in earning his life, supporting his family 
and making his children happy, but he spent all his working years 
with only one company.
<P>
	I am only 33 years old, or rather I will be on May 13, and I 
already have three careers to my name. It is said that in the year 
2000, people will accumulate five careers. That is why continuing 
education is so vital. It is not true that once you have a university 
degree or a technical of vocational diploma you will have the same 
job for all your working life without having to go through 
adjustment periods. On the contrary, nobody, in the  young 
generation, can think that he or she will have only one employer for 
all his or her life.
<P>
	We will be committing a sin, a crime if we do not establish a 
manpower training system that is more rational, more coherent, 
and is based on the single-window concept.
<P>
	This is so true that, at this very moment, there are approximately 
25,000 people on the waiting lists in Quebec. There are 25,000 
people in Quebec who, at different levels, need to improve their 
skills, who need to acquire experience, who need guidance 
services, but who are deprived of this resource, who are deprived of 
the assistance to which they are entitled because the system is 
inefficient.
<P>
	You will ask: ``Yes, but did the minister learn the lesson?'' No, 
this minister is stubborn. This minister is looking ahead without 
concerning himself with what is going on in his environment. All 
Liberals are not like him, but I must say a majority of them seems 
to be of that type.
<P>
	We can only wish, and anybody in their right mind would agree, 
that the minister will realize that the best thing that can happen to 
Quebec is that he changes his mind, that he does not authorize, as 
proposed in Bill C-11, various bodies which do not represent the 
Government of Quebec to obtain mandates directly from the 
Department of Human Resources Development, that he respects 
Quebec's jurisdiction and that he contributes.
<P>
	He would become famous should he accept to put an end to 
duplication and work towards the establishment of a single 
window, as he has been asked to do by Quebec's Minister of 
Employment and Concerted Action, Louise Harel. This would 
ensure a more productive use of the resources that are available in 
the system, because it is absolutely wrong to suggest a lack of 
resources as an excuse. That is the challenge facing a minister who 
has been too stubborn until now.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
carefully to my colleague for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, who once 
again has expressed social concerns, and not just for the people in 
his riding, which is very large.
<P>
<B>(1535)</B>
<P>
	I obviously support all he said on the attitude of the government, 
which, despite the message it sent during the referendum promising 
change and greater sensitivity towards Quebec, spoke 
gobbledegook.
<P>
	Unfortunately, we are forced to recognize that it was 
gobbledegook, that the government's centralizing approach 
continues unabated. I know he has many more examples of this 
centralizing approach and of the government's desire to meddle 
even more in provincial jurisdictions. With Bill C-96, creating the 
Department of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1671"> 1671 </A></B>
<P>
Human Resources Development, there is the example of  training, 
education. Unfortunately, we can see that it is still not resolved.
<P>
	I would like to ask the following question, because we have to 
comment and ask a question. I know I will not bother him at all, but 
I would like his opinion on the government's alleged 
decentralization, when we can see in the bill that the Minister of 
Human Resources Development is giving himself the power to go 
over the heads of the provincial governments and conclude specific 
agreements with organizations, even with businesses, in training or 
other areas. I would like his opinion on that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ménard:</B> Mr. Speaker, you will understand that no matter 
how repetitive and expected this question is, it is still relevant. 
Allow me to stress the excellent work the member did on the 
human resources development committee; he was a very vocal 
representative of the Bloc Quebecois on this issue.
<P>
	I appreciate his question all the more as there are certain 
parallels to be drawn between Lévis and 
Hochelaga-Maisonneuve. We both have in our ridings people 
who have experienced de-skilling. For the most part, this is the 
history of my riding. It used to be a thriving city. It is hard to 
believe that between 1883 and 1918 Hochelaga-Maisonneuve had 
such a vibrant industrial sector that it was called the Pittsburg of 
Canada. I know that in his riding too, I am thinking about shipyard 
workers among others, there has been a de-skilling process.
<P>
	What the member for Lévis is asking us to realize is that 
periodically through the history of federalism and through the 
history of the Liberal Party, we have witnessed a profoundly 
despicable, not to say shameful, and I believe totally unacceptable 
manoeuvre on the part of a government refusing to accept the 
position of a legitimately elected government, its counterpart in 
Quebec, and instead going through intermediaries.
<P>
	This was done in the sixties on the language issue, such an outcry 
was raised that the government had to back down. What is 
unacceptable in this bill, I believe, is the push toward centralization 
and the lack of respect for the authorized agencies.
<P>
	As far as manpower policies are concerned, the authorized 
agency is the Government of Quebec. So by what authority, what 
rationale would a government, even a Liberal government, think it 
has the right to use a CDEC, a municipality or any other agency or 
corporate entity to ignore Quebec's wishes?
<P>
	All this must not keep us from seeing-I will try to be brief 
because I would be most honoured if the member for Kingston and 
the Islands were to be so daring as to ask me a question-that as 
long as there will be duplication of resources, some people will not 
receive training. Mr. Speaker, look at the member for Kingston and 
the Islands, I think he wants to talk to me.
<P>
<B>(1540)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Georgette Sheridan (Saskatoon-Humboldt, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I hope the hon. member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve 
will not be disappointed, but I will try to stand in for my colleague 
from Kingston and the Islands as best I can.
<P>
	I would preface my remarks by saying that as a woman I have 
often been plagued by the question: What do women want? I could 
translate that by saying: What does a Bloc Quebecois want?
<P>
	I listened to my colleague opposite asking for the minister to do 
away with duplication and overlap and to deal with the province of 
Quebec, i would answer him by saying that is exactly what this bill 
proposes.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, when the bill now before us was tabled in this 
House last June 7, and this March 7, a number of us were amazed 
that the Bloc was so strongly opposed to it. Many of us were 
amazed at their heroic efforts to delay passage of a bill which has as 
its sole purpose the regularization of a government administrative 
restructuring that took place two years before. Amazed yes, but not 
in the least surprised.
<P>
	At that point we were on the verge of the referendum campaign 
and the opposition wasted no opportunity to try and convince 
Quebecers of the dark intentions of the federal government. Nor 
did they waste any opportunity to hinder the smooth operations of 
government, to hold up to scrutiny every little action or statement 
by members of the government, as a diversionary tactic. It is easy 
to understand what was behind their actions at that time, but then 
the referendum came along and Canada remained Canada.
<P>
	When the bill came back, the opposition began to sing the same 
tune again, to throw up the same roadblocks, but for a different 
reason. This time it was a sort of warm up in preparation for their 
opposition to the employment insurance bill the minister was going 
to introduce shortly. Here again, their reasons for acting on the 
federal level to immobilize and oppose any proposed change are 
easily understood.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The reasons were clearly demonstrated recently, on March 12, 
when it proposed that the bill on employment insurance be 
withdrawn even though everyone agrees that the current 
employment insurance program is in need of reform.
<P>
	However, one important change has taken place since the last 
time the bill to establish the Department of Human Resources 
Development was debated.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1672"> 1672 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Quebec employment minister agreed, after 
meeting with the federal minister, to discuss our proposal regarding 
employment insurance. Discussions are still going on with Quebec, 
as well as with all other provinces. Quebec is interested in the 
formula proposed because it will allow updating the management 
of worker adjustment programs; because it is consistent with its 
own goals regarding decentralization in favour of regions; and 
because the federal government has clearly indicated its intention 
to withdraw from manpower training.
<P>
	For a large part employment insurance entails decentralization 
and partnership with provinces. If clause 20 allows the minister to 
enter into agreements with a province, financial institutions or 
similar agencies it is simply because we have taken into 
consideration, by adapting them, section 7 of the Employment 
Department and Commission Act, section 6 of the Heritage 
Department Act and section 5 of the existing Department of Labour 
Act.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The Department of Human Resources Development Act does not 
give the minister any powers other than those already being 
exercised. It does not confer any powers that were not previously 
exercised, respectively, by the ministers responsible. What is 
involved, essentially, is internal management. In other words, 
hypothetically even if the bill were never passed the minister would 
still continue to do everything he does now. When the bill is passed 
the minister will not be doing anything more or anything less than 
what he has been doing until now.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We all know we must invest in our human resources if we want 
to stay ahead of the world's nations in terms of quality of life.
<P>
	This bill reconfirms the basic mission given to that department 
by the Government of Canada by bringing under the same roof all 
initiatives and programs designed to help Canadians at all stages of 
life: learning, work and retirement. In fact, as the bill stipulates, the 
powers, duties and functions of the minister ``are to be exercised 
with the objective of enhancing employment, encouraging equality 
and promoting social security''.
<P>
	The act to establish the Department of Human Resources 
Development is especially designed to allow the department to 
continue helping put Canadians back to work.
<P>
	To do so, we need a legislation which provides a simple and 
integrated mechanism in order to clarify the role of the department 
and the responsibilities of the minister with respect to the Canadian 
people.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Members of this House have had ample opportunity to 
thoroughly examine and discuss the bill which will put an end to 
this transitional phase, a transitional phase not only for this 
department but for the entire government reorganization.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I therefore believe it is time to put an end to it now and to 
consider other issues far more crucial for Canadians and the future 
of this country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
carefully to the speech of my colleague opposite. I want to 
comment on it and perhaps ask her a question in closing.
<P>
	As you know, I am the member for Shefford. The main town in 
my riding is Granby. Granby is an industrial town of approximately 
45,000 inhabitants. There are about 90,000 people in the region.
<P>
	Cuts were announced under both human resources development 
ministers. This reminds of the dismantling of railways in Canada.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, you are a federalist-I have no doubt about that, 
Mr. Speaker-and I believe that all across Canada, employment 
centres are considered as a symbol of Canada. They are actually 
closing them down, doing away with them, so much so that Granby 
now receives only $36,000 from the federal government in lieu of 
taxes. Might as well say there is no federal presence in our region.
<P>
	When our great country was created, the federal government's 
goal was to distribute wealth fairly across the territory. But now, 
my region is cut off by this government. Some 50 or 55 people 
were working in the employment centre, and now the government 
is considering going down to 12 or maybe 18 employees-no 
decision has been made yet.
<P>
	This is sad for my region. It is a heavy blow since the 
employment centre, as it was organized, was making a significant 
contribution to the region's development. It is a whole network 
they are breaking up. This network is important for the regions. It is 
important for Quebec, for its development. Usually, all kinds of 
people are represented on boards of trade, people from every 
political affiliation, mostly federalists.
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
	The Granby Board of Trade circulated a petition that was signed 
by over 6,000 people to condemn the government's attitude and to 
ask it to give more consideration to regions. As I said earlier, 
employment centres are a symbol of the Government of Canada, 
but this symbol is about to disappear because of the policies of the 
department and the minister.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1673"> 1673 </A></B>
<P>
	My question is this: When the government makes decisions like 
the one to reform the system, why does it ignore the other 
governments? I would like to hear the member's comments on that 
matter.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sheridan:</B> Mr. Speaker, my initial response to the 
member's question would be the same as the introduction to my 
speech: What does the Bloc Quebecois want? On the one hand it is 
saying to keep our nose out of its affairs; on the other hand it is 
saying to do more for it specifically and do not worry about the 
interests of other Canadians.
<P>
	The business of governing this country as a country is to take 
into account the interests of all Canadians. The minister is taking a 
positive step forward in doing that. He is doing it in Quebec in the 
same way he is doing it in any other region of the country. As part 
of the family, we all share and share alike.
<P>
	Sooner or later the member opposite will have to figure out what 
he wants.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Shefford):</B> Mr. Speaker, what do we want? That is 
a good question. As I said before, we want the government to 
behave in an equitable manner. The hon. member says this is done 
everywhere in the country. That does not mean it is a good thing.
<P>
	That is not the problem. We know there are structures, we know 
there is some co-operation between Canadian employment centres 
and those responsible for employment in Quebec, where there is a 
tradition of co-operation at the local level. However, what is 
happening at the present time is that they are dismantling the 
network, and this will do considerable damage to job creation. It is 
as if the federal government were withdrawing while continuing to 
exercise control over programs. It wants control but it does not 
want to invest in the area, and that is unacceptable.
<P>
	The federal government has a certain responsibility in that 
regard and, frankly, you will agree with me that it should give all its 
support to the level of government best able to decide and closest to 
the people of the regions.
<P>
	What I am asking, and I would like the opinion of the hon. 
member on this, is for the federal government to stop, once and for 
all, interfering needlessly in our affairs and give back to the regions 
what they are entitled to.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sheridan:</B> Mr. Speaker, again I think the member is 
encumbered with a lot of rhetoric and misapprehension of the facts 
as they exist.
<P>
	As I said in my speech, it was that member and all of his friends 
across the way who wanted the Government of Canada to keep its 
nose out of their affairs during the time leading up to the 
referendum in Quebec.
<P>
	In response to the concerns of people in Quebec and all across 
the country the Prime Minister made a commitment at the end of 
last year. He stated that the Government of Canada would withdraw 
from labour market training, apprenticeship programs, 
co-operative education programs and so on. This seems to be 
exactly what the member opposite was saying, that we should let 
the government that is in the best position to understand local needs 
design the programs. This has been delivered on.
<P>
	I know the member is full of fuss and bother this afternoon but it 
has nothing to do with any failure of this government to deliver on 
those promises.
<P>
<B>(1555 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, for the 
last two and one-half years the Department of Human Resources 
Development has been operating without a mandate and some 
would say without any direction or agenda.
<P>
	Back in January 1994 amid the fanfare of the speech from the 
throne, Canadians were promised social program reform. One 
would have thought the government would have quickly given this 
department a mandate to operate and then tackled the task of 
bringing Canada's outdated social programs into the 21st century.
<P>
	The fact that it has taken the government two years and two 
ministers to get this far is further evidence that real reform will not 
happen before the next election. No doubt social program reform 
will turn up as an election promise in the 1997 version of the 
Liberal red book of broken promises.
<P>
	One of the most intriguing parts of the bill was the appointment 
of the Minister of Labour and the deputy minister. When the old 
department of labour was amalgamated with the new superministry 
of human resources development, the whole idea behind it was 
incorporation. At last, we thought, here was a department whose 
function would be transferred to the provinces and to the private 
sector. What a step forward for labour relations in Canada. Then 
along came the Quebec referendum and suddenly we needed a 
labour minister. At the last minute, to accommodate the member 
for Saint-Henri-Westmount, this strange reporting structure was 
included in what was then Bill C-96.
<P>
	According to Bill C-11 the Minister of Labour may be appointed 
but if there is no labour minister, the duties fall to the human 
resources development minister. The question has to be asked: Do 
we need a full time labour minister, a secretary of state for labour, 
or just a parliamentary secretary? Maybe the minister was included 
so there would be no question about the need for a deputy minister.
<P>
	If labour requires a full minister, should such a position not be 
designated by statute rather than just simply an optional position? 
If labour requires a minister  other than a junior minister, will it 
ultimately break away from human resources development and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1674"> 1674 </A></B>
<P>
become a department unto itself? This bill raises a lot more 
questions than it answers. These are things that have not been 
debated fully and should have been considered by the author ofthe bill.
<P>
	By bringing the labour department under the human resources 
umbrella and its superminister, perhaps the government hoped to 
get the unions onside and perhaps take advantage of the decline in 
popularity of the faltering New Democrats.
<P>
	If the government was really concerned about labour relations, it 
would not have allowed things to deteriorate to the point where in 
two years time it would have to legislate grain handlers and railway 
workers back to work three times. Three times in two years the 
system did not work properly. If the government was truly 
concerned about workers in Canada and management, it would 
have amended the Canada Labour Code or at least looked at 
amending the Canada Labour Code to include final offer arbitration 
as a mechanism for solving labour disputes.
<P>
	The government would be introducing more legislation like Bill 
C-3. Bill C-3 brings all workers in nuclear facilities under 
provincial jurisdiction and certainly is a step in the right direction. 
The labour component of the department of HRD would cease to 
exist and would not require the services of a minister or of a deputy 
minister.
<P>
	If the government had allowed passage of Motion No. 2 as 
presented by my colleague for Mission-Coquitlam, it would not 
be presented with the problem of court rulings over who has 
jurisdiction in overlapping industrial sectors as was the case which 
necessitated the drafting of Bill C-3.
<P>
<B>(1600 )</B>
<P>
	It is time to move forward with the devolution of federal control 
in labour matters to the provinces. Certainly there is much support 
for that on this side of the House. I would encourage members 
opposite to come to like thinking.
<P>
	Part I of the Canada Labour Code is currently under review and 
would be an appropriate starting point for the minister who is 
anxious to do away with duplication of services.
<P>
	I would like to remind members that Canada has a $580 billion 
debt. The minister opposite and certainly the finance minister are 
very cognizant of that. They are looking for ways in which to 
whittle down that debt.
<P>
	The Minister of Labour could contribute to this reduction if he 
initiates measures to do away with overburdensome bureaucracy 
and duplication by giving the provinces control over labour 
standards, labour relations and occupational health and safety. I 
suggest that he would find that workers and management alike  
would support his action because both sides want and deserve a 
level playing field.
<P>
	Labour and management have the common goal of maintaining a 
productive workplace. As legislators, we should do all we can to 
advance that goal. We can facilitate this by relinquishing control 
over the bureaucratic regulations that stand in the way of sound 
labour relations.
<P>
	Reflecting back to Bill C-3, I again say that it is a step in the 
right direction. Bill C-11 would be worthy of support had it 
followed along the same path.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
would like to put a question to my colleague after making a few 
remarks.
<P>
	The Quebec government, Quebec as a whole and labour 
confederations would most certainly agree with the total takeover 
of all the labour sector. However, we cannot talk about this issue 
without referring once again to the Constitution, since the Privy 
Council in London established, in a 1925 decision, after a seven 
year delay, I believe, that labour relation jurisdiction belonged to 
the provinces, except that all businesses that, one way or another, 
came under more than one province would come under federal 
jurisdiction. That is what brought about this duplication that is 
causing so many problems for workers.
<P>
	I would like to point out to the member that in Quebec, for 
instance, the act respecting occupational health and safety provides 
that women who find out they are pregnant and believe that their 
work may affect them or their child have the right to ask for a 
change of position. If the employer cannot transfer them to another 
position, they have the right to stay home with 90 per cent of their 
salary. The same thing applies when the mother breast-feeds her 
child.
<P>
	You can understand that women work for businesses that come 
under federal jurisdiction are not allowed the same right, they say it 
is not fair and the whole union movement has been doing the same 
for years now. This goes to prove what our colleague just said, 
except that we cannot deal with this matter without going through 
the Constitution.
<P>
	In my speech this morning, I have demonstrated how Bill C-11 
calls for a constitutional debate.
<P>
<B>(1605)</B>
<P>
	The only way provinces disagreeing with decisions taken by the 
central government, by the Department of Human Resources 
Development under this bill, can have their way would be to 
sidestep this decision and manage the money themselves.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1675"> 1675 </A></B>
<P>
	This calls for a constitutional type amendment, or the 
government should agree to recognize the full jurisdiction of the 
provinces, which it does not, even in the throne speech.
<P>
	So, my question to my colleague is whether he and his party 
should not have chosen to criticize more than the labour relation 
considerations of the bill.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Johnston:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for the 
question.
<P>
	My Reform colleague spoke to the bill this morning. Although 
she touched on some labour issues, she had broader criticisms of 
the bill.
<P>
	I would like to address an issue that my Bloc colleague has 
raised. It is the overlap in provincial and federal jurisdiction. The 
position of our party is that jurisdiction should be given to the level 
of government which is closest to the people. Less government is 
the best government. To decrease the bureaucracy would be of 
benefit to all Canadians. The bureaucracy would be closer to the 
people it serves.
<P>
	As is sometimes the case now with the federal government, there 
would not be a nameless, faceless entity. Canada is a huge place 
and the capital cannot be everywhere. For the vast majority of 
Canadians the capital is a long way from home.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, my 
colleague argues that a department of labour is not necessary, that a 
minister of labour is not necessary. I totally disagree. As you know, 
there are labour disputes in several areas still under federal 
jurisdiction, and a minister is needed to try to settle these disputes.
<P>
	The labour code must be revamped. Anti-scab legislation is 
needed, for instance. The union movement needs a full-time 
minister of labour, and I ask the hon. member why he is against 
appointing a minister of labour, a position that has always existed 
in Canada.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Johnston:</B> Madam Speaker, my Bloc colleague suggests 
that the Minister of Labour is needed because he adjudicates or 
solves problems that arise between labour and management. I 
submit to him that I have never seen a labour minister, provincial or 
federal, who has solved a labour problem.
<P>
	I would like to cite the three instances in the two and a half years 
that I have been here when the House voted to force workers back 
to work, whether they were locked out or on strike, in order for 
grain transportation to continue. That is not ministerial 
intervention. That is intervention by the entire House of Commons. 
The minister does not solve those problems. If he really wanted to 
do something to solve those problems he  would look at 
implementing final offer arbitration selection so that both groups, 
management and labour, would have the tools to resolve their 
problems without involving either the minister or the House of 
Commons.
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
	All due respect to my friend, just because we have had a minister 
of labour for years and years is no justification for us to continue 
with that position.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to participate in the debate at third reading of Bill C-11, the old Bill 
C-96, an act to establish the Department of Human Resources 
Development and to amend and repeal certain related acts. I had the 
opportunity last November to participate in the debate at second 
reading of Bill C-96.
<P>
	Only a few minor changes, which increase the number of 
departments and organizations allowed to consult recipients' files, 
were made to this bill in committee. This breach of confidentiality 
is another reason why I will vote against this bill.
<P>
	I, however, support the motion requiring this department and the 
department of labour to table an annual activity report. This 
requirement is not new. The public as well as parliamentarians 
need to be informed of the actions and decisions taken by the 
department, the unemployment insurance commission and the 
national council of welfare.
<P>
	In essence, this bill provides for the administrative restructuring 
of the department, merging sections and services from the former 
departments of employment and immigration, health and welfare, 
labour and the old secretary of state. At the same time, the bill 
gives the Prime Minister the authority to appoint a Minister of 
Labour and a Deputy Minister of Labour. I am all in favour of 
having a labour minister. We absolutely need one, especially if we 
want a thoroughly revised Canadian Labour Code, and more 
specifically anti-strikebreaking legislation, to be submitted to us as 
soon as possible.
<P>
	This bill promotes a greater federal presence and gives the 
minister new powers, enabling him, among others things, to go 
over the heads of the provinces, and Quebec in particular, and 
negotiate directly with local authorities and organizations. Under 
clause 20, the minister may enter into agreements with agencies 
and bodies other than the provinces.
<P>
	According to clause 6, the powers, duties and functions of the 
minister extend to all matters relating to the development of human 
resources in Canada. He is responsible in particular for enhancing 
employment, encouraging equality and promoting social security. 
That is a far cry from what has been happening in Canada for the 
past two and a half years.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1676"> 1676 </A></B>
<P>
	However noble these goals may be, the situation is deteriorating 
rapidly in these areas. Statistics Canada data show that, while 9.3 
per cent of the population, or 1,407,000 people, were unemployed 
in Canada in March 1996, 10.9 per cent of the population, or 
400,000 people, were unemployed in Quebec.
<P>
	Just last week, Kenworth announced it was shutting down its 
truck manufacturing plant in Sainte-Thérèse, but this government 
did not lift a finger to save the 900 jobs at stake. I urge the federal 
government once again to make every effort to ensure this plant 
remains in operation to provide employment to its workers.
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	The new Department of Human Resources Development must 
increase efficiency and productivity. People often tell me that the 
processing of claims takes too long. We must shorten the amount of 
time needed to process unemployment insurance claims, appeals of 
unemployment insurance decisions, old age pension claims, etc.
<P>
	Once again, I am strongly opposed to the closure of the Canada 
Employment Centre located on Papineau Street, in Montreal, 
which serves constituents in my riding of Bourassa, hard hit by 
unemployment. By 1997, this office will be closed. People in 
Montreal North need help, services and resources, but they do not 
need government cuts when they are going through hard times. My 
riding is already poverty-stricken.
<P>
	Given the situation, the federal government should also provide 
more resources for the Program for Older Worker Adjustment, or 
POWA.
<P>
	Other employment centres have closed or will be closed on 
Montreal Island. I vigorously oppose such measures because they 
smack of partisan politics.
<P>
	I took advantage of the Easter recess to invite representatives of 
community agencies in my riding to participate in a discussion on 
the changes made in the unemployment insurance system. Once 
again, I wish to thank all the agencies represented at this meeting, 
including the local community service centre of Montreal North, 
and the CDEC in my riding which, fortunately, is starting to receive 
the necessary resources to carry out its much needed mission. The 
meeting was also attended by representatives of the following 
agencies: Maison des jeunes l'Ouverture, Impulsion travail, 
Rond-point Jeunesse au travail, Centre multiculturel Claire, 
Maison Saint-Laurent, Fondation de la Visite, Centre d'activités 
pour le maintien de l'équilibre émotionnel de Montréal-Nord, 
Association des travailleurs haïtiens au Canada, Entre-Parents, 
Centre Louis-Fréchette, etc.
<P>
	Almost all these organizations have clients who receive 
unemployment insurance benefits, and they often rely on the 
various programs offered by the Papineau employment centre.
<P>
	Participants were shocked to see that, once again, the cuts will 
affect the unemployed. These new measures will intensify the 
exclusion process and make it worse.
<P>
	Last March, I condemned the federal government's refusal to 
include social clauses in the bilateral trade agreement between 
Canada and Chile. It is officials from the human resources 
department who negotiate labour issues on Canada's behalf. 
Thanks to our representations and to the very effective action of the 
Canadian and Chilean union movements, the government relented 
and agreed to that very legitimate request. We must congratulate 
the Chilean government for always recognizing the social 
dimension of NAFTA and of this trade agreement.
<P>
	However, the Canadian government is not willing to go further 
than what is provided in the parallel agreement that is already part 
of NAFTA but which is inadequate. The agreement should include 
more effective ways to protect the rights of workers, as well as 
better labour standards.
<P>
	During my trip to Chile last January, I was shocked to learn from 
Chilean workers and union members that some Canadian 
businesses, including mining companies, do not always comply 
with basic health and safety standards. Among other things, they 
mentioned the use of toxic substances which are prohibited in 
Canada.
<P>
	I am pleased that the value of Canadian and Quebec investments 
in Chile has reached $7 billion.
<P>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
	I take this opportunity to send a message of social responsibility 
to Canadian companies investing in Latin America and other 
continents.
<P>
	To conclude, I would like to talk briefly about pensions, another 
matter the human resources development department is responsible 
for. I was shocked to learn that some people are considering the 
privatization of the Canada pension plan. True, other countries 
have tried that, and it has been a disaster.
<P>
	I am against any reduction in benefits, and we must have full 
access to the plan. Universality has to be maintained. However, I 
would agree to raising the maximum insurable income above 
$35,000 to collect more contributions. I am strongly opposed to the 
idea of raising the age of retirement to 67. We need to make room 
for the young. The existing Canada pension plan should be 
improved and not reduced.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, once again 
the hon. member for Bourassa has shown that he understands the 
problems of his constituents, the people he represents. He has 
shown also that he has a good understanding of the nature and the 
scope of the Department of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	It must be remembered that, except for the servicing of the debt, 
this is the one that accounts for the largest  share of the money 
allocated in the federal budget, more than 40 per cent. It is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1677"> 1677 </A></B>
<P>
responsible for a huge number of programs and services. The hon. 
member for Bourassa recalled, and rightly so, the closing down of 
some employment centres, including the one in the district of 
Papineau, as he mentioned. That happened also elsewhere.
<P>
	The debate today deals with the legislation establishing the 
Department of Human Resources Development; we see on the 
cover that it is Bill C-11, the former Bill C-96, which brings back 
the previous legislation unchanged. We see that this legislation 
could be called the law of silence.
<P>
	I would like to ask my colleague what he thinks about it. This 
bill will strengthen the powers of the Minister of Human Resources 
Development. It will give him authority to encroach even further 
on and bypass provincial jurisdictions, especially in the area of 
manpower training. It will allow the minister to bypass the 
provincial government and deal directly with organizations and 
businesses in matters of training, among others. Therefore, this is 
something important that raises the constitutional issue. The Bloc 
Quebecois is not pleased to deal with this issue, but the government 
is grabbing even more constitutional powers to interfere in areas 
under provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	At the moment, I am asking questions to my colleague, but the 
answers should come from members opposite. We are surprised to 
see that members opposite, especially those from Quebec, are not 
making speeches and not taking part in the debate on the bill 
establishing the largest federal department, and that members of 
the third party, who usually deal so meticulously with 
expenditures, are not interested either in that topic. Where are we? 
I would like the hon. member for Bourassa to comment on that law 
of silence that is in force, on yet another operation designed to put 
Quebec in its place.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nunez:</B> Madam Speaker, I want to thank the hon. member 
for Lévis, who is doing a remarkable job both in the House and on 
the human resources development committee.
<P>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
	Of course, I agree with him and with my party that Bill C-11 
reinforces the powers of the federal government as opposed to 
those of the provinces. As I said in my speech, the minister will be 
able to go over the provinces' heads and negotiate directly with 
organizations, and that is unacceptable.
<P>
	There are a lot of community organizations in my riding. These 
organizations would rather deal with the Government of Quebec, 
which has a better understanding of the situation and the problems 
in Montreal and Montreal North in particular, than with Ottawa, 
which is so far away. This is why I  wholeheartedly agree with what 
the member said. Again, I want to stress that, with this bill, the 
federal government is infringing upon provincial areas of 
jurisdiction, especially the labour training area.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead, 
BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am very pleased to take part in this debate 
on Bill C-11. As my colleague from Lévis mentioned a few minutes 
ago, it is amazing to see how government members and even 
members of the third party in this House, the Reform Party, are 
silent on this subject.
<P>
	This has to be noted since, as mentioned by the member for 
Lévis, this is the most important department in terms of its budget 
and even, I would say, in terms of its repercussions on the lives of 
Canadians. Forty per cent of the federal budget is allocated to that 
department.
<P>
	So we have to wonder why government members are silent on 
this subject. How is it that only the official opposition, the Bloc 
Quebecois, wants to take part in this debate to inform the people, to 
tell them how dangerous this bill is and what could happen if we 
give so much power to the Minister of Labour. In the few minutes I 
have, I will do my best to explain what powers the minister is 
getting in this bill.
<P>
	To do so I will refer to the legislation itself. Clauses 6 and 7 of 
Bill C-11 talk about the powers, duties and functions of the 
minister.
<P>
	Clause 6 says:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>6. The powers, duties and functions of the Minister extend to and include all 
matters over which Parliament has jurisdiction relating to the development of 
the human resources of Canada not by law assigned to any other Minister, 
department, board or agency of the Government of Canada, and are to be 
exercised with the objective of enhancing employment, encouraging equality 
and promoting social security.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Everybody should agree with that since clause 6 says that, in 
creating this department, the federal government wants to enhance 
employment, encourage equality and promote social security. This 
is really apple pie; of course everybody wants to attain such goals.
<P>
	Moreover, it says in this clause that the minister recognizes that 
he will have to exercise these powers, duties and functions in his 
own areas of jurisdiction. It is said specifically that his department 
cannot infringe upon the powers of other federal departments or 
agencies. Consequently, we could say: ``At last, the federal 
government intends to mind its own business, to play in its own 
backyard, and, therefore, to respect the powers of the provinces''.
<P>
<B>(1630)</B>
<P>
	In order to understand if such is the government's intent, we 
must also read clause 7 as well as clause 20, which go together.
<P>
	Clause 7 reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1678"> 1678 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>7. In exercising the powers or performing the duties or functions assigned to the 
Minister under this or any other Act of Parliament, the Minister may</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is the Minister of Human Resources Development.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(<I>a</I>) subject to the Statistics Act, collect, analyse, interpret-</BLOCKQUOTE>
And so on. These are all formalities. Paragraph (<I>b</I>) reads as 
follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(<I>b</I>) cooperate with provincial authorities with a view to the coordination of 
efforts made or proposed for preserving and improving human resources 
development.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It is there in black and white, if words mean anything, even in the 
House: ``The Minister may cooperate''; it is not written that the 
minister must cooperate, but that he ``may'' cooperate with 
provincial authorities. Therefore, the minister has all the leeway he 
needs to accept or refuse to cooperate with a provincial 
government.
<P>
	In clause 6, it is said that the minister cannot exercise powers 
assigned to other federal departments, boards or agencies, but in 
paragraph 7(<I>b</I>), it is said he ``may'' cooperate with the provinces. 
We know that, since its inception, the federal government has used 
all acceptable and unacceptable means available to it to invade 
provincial fields of jurisdiction.
<P>
	We have seen it time and time again in the past, such as in the 
case of old age security, family allowances and unemployment 
insurance, which were all provincial fields of jurisdiction. And, 
over the years, for all manner of reasons, including the depression 
in the 1920s and then later on the war, the federal government has 
laid its hands on powers, supposedly temporarily, but the situation 
then became permanent. Over time, some have been entrenched in 
the Constitution, as is the case with unemployment insurance.
<P>
	So there is nothing reassuring about clause 6, when read in 
conjunction with clause 7.
<P>
	If I may, let us jump ahead a bit to examine clause 20. What does 
clause 20 of Bill C-11 say? Since we are still looking at the same 
bill, it is appropriate to link them up. Clause 20 states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>20. For the purpose of facilitating the formulation, coordination and 
implementation of any program or policy relating to the powers, duties and 
functions referred to in section 6, the Minister may</BLOCKQUOTE>
	-repeating the wording of clause 7-
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>enter into agreements with a province or group of provinces, agencies of 
provinces, financial institutions and such other persons or bodies as the 
Minister considers appropriate.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	So, as the saying goes, the thing has come full circle; we have 
just grasped that the minister can decide to co-operate with a 
province, as it says in paragraph 7(<I>b</I>). So,if by chance the minister 
does not feel like co-operating with a province, he can pass on it. 
But what  will he do then, according to clause 20? He will go over 
the heads of the provinces, and negotiate directly or conclude 
agreements with bodies in each of the provinces.
<P>
<B>(1635)</B>
<P>
	Clause 20 does not say so because, naturally, the federal 
government wants to deceive, to hide the truth. Clause 20 does not 
say that the federal government or one of its agencies will be able 
to deal directly with a municipality, but it must be understood that 
provincial public agencies are just like municipalities. 
Municipalities are agencies, creatures of provincial governments. 
Therefore, as I understand it, under this clause the federal 
government is giving itself the necessary leeway to bypass 
provincial governments and deal directly with municipalities and 
agencies at the provincial level.
<P>
	This is the government's, the minister's intention and we know 
that this minister more than anyone else will not hesitate to push 
provinces aside, especially Quebec, and to try to enter into 
agreements which will go against the wishes, goals and policies of 
the Government of Quebec.
<P>
	During the few minutes I have left, I want to talk about the 
common will and consensus regarding professional training 
policies. This is not the only area where Quebec will stand alone, 
where it will be a distinct homeland-the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs may wish to use another expression 
since ``distinct society'' and ``principal homeland'' seem to have 
disappeared; we could perhaps use ``distinct homeland'' for a few 
weeks. In Quebec there has been for many years, I repeat, for many 
years a consensus between all stakeholders, all interested parties. 
This includes the Government of Quebec, labour confederations 
and employers. For the first time in the history of Quebec, I would 
say, a consensus was reached to ask the federal government to 
withdraw from manpower training, to take its paws off this 
provincial jurisdiction and to put a stop to the duplication and 
endless meddling in this sensitive area, not only in economic terms, 
but in the day-to-day existence of our fellow citizens. We are 
talking about real people, who work or who need retraining or 
additional training because of the closure of their place of work.
<P>
	As my colleagues have pointed out here and elsewhere, how 
many times do we have to reiterate the need for a clean-up in 
manpower training? In Quebec, management, unions and 
government have all said the same thing. When I speak of 
government, I do not mean the separatist government of Mr. 
Bouchard currently in power, but the federalist government before 
it, the governments of Mr. Johnson and Mr. Bourassa, and no one 
can accuseMr. Bourassa of even the slightest hint of a separatist tendency.

make every concession, in order to keep Quebec within the 
Canadian Federation, it was the former premier of Quebec,Mr. Bourassa. Yet, even he and his government joined in the 
consensus, in QUebec, that manpower training should be under 
exclusive provincial jurisdiction, as already provided for in the 
Constitution, and that the federal government should be asked to 
withdraw from this area.
<P>
	However, when reading clauses 6, 7(b) and 20 of the bill before 
us, we see that the federal government does not intend to abide by 
this consensus, but intends on the contrary to continue to do what it 
has been doing for years, that is to interfere in any way, at any time 
and with anyone it wants to.
<P>
	Question period after question period, the Prime Minister, the 
Deputy Prime Minister, the former Minister of Human Resources 
Development and the present minister of this portfolio, have all 
stood in this House one after the other to state their intention, their 
firm resolve to decentralize, to withdraw from this area of 
provincial jurisdiction in order to abide by the Constitution.
<P>
	That is what they are saying day after day, question period after 
question period, election campaign after election campaign but, in 
reality, when the time comes to make a decision, the first thing they 
do is to write, in black and white, that they intend to do just the 
opposite.
<P>
	After that, one hardly wonders at the cynicism-not to call it 
something worse-of the population with respect to politics and 
politicians. This is called double talk. One cannot say one thing, 
then say the opposite, and claim there is no inconsistency.
<P>
	The federal government says over and over that it is ready to 
withdraw from manpower training. Why did not they write in their 
bill that they are leaving this responsibility to the provinces and 
that they recognize once and for all the consensus arrived at in 
Quebec? It would have been simple and easy. I am convinced that, 
for once, the House would have been unanimous on a bill, since 
that is what all stakeholders in Quebec are demanding.
<P>
	I think the minister can still act before the bill is passed. 
Consequently, it is necessary for the Minister of Human Resources 
Development and his Prime Minister to have a serious discussion 
as soon as possible and for them agree that this bill is flawed-that 
is the least we can say. In fact, the bill does not follow through on 
the federal government's intentions to withdraw from manpower 
training. The Minister could see to it that the necessary changes are 
made.
<P>
	Nothing would do more to prove the government's good will 
than if it announced during this debate that it is once and for all 
withdrawing from manpower training. If  it did so, it would gain 
the full support of stakeholders in Quebec and of the official 
opposition. I think there would be no better way to conclude this 
debate.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
would like to thank my colleague for his excellent statement, which 
illustrates once again the importance of the manpower issue.
<P>
	Before I ask a question, I want to say that this bill has a greater 
scope than what we might think since human resources 
development can mean much more than training and labour 
adjustment. It can pertain directly to training but it can also 
concern family policies. In fact, it can relate to anything that affects 
human development.
<P>
	He is right in stressing how outrageous it is, for instance, that the 
manpower training issue has not yet been resolved in view of the 
fact that the consensus in Quebec is so strong and has been so for so 
long. This morning, I quoted a 1991 letter in which Mr. Bourbeau, 
then labour minister, was making the same requests to Mr. 
Valcourt, the federal minister, and stating Quebec's opposition to 
any federal action that would bypass the province in that area.
<P>
	The minister referred to some correspondence between himself 
and Mr. Valcourt, but reminded him also that he had discussed the 
issue with Mrs. McDougall and that she had agreed not to bypass 
the province. He made the following interesting comment on the 
relation between that issue and the constitutional debate:``Mrs. McDougall told me that the federal government sees a 
connection between whatever Quebec requests and the 
constitutional review process. I disapproved of that idea, because 
even if there was perfect constitutional harmony in the 
country-which is not the case as we know, especially since 
October 30-Quebec would still make the same requests, since it is 
urgent for the economic development of Quebec to make all 
manpower programs efficient and in line with Quebec's own 
priorities''. This is Mr. Bourbeau, a Liberal minister, a federalist 
talking.
<P>
	Needless to say, five years later, when we see that the minister is 
claiming as his own Bill C-96, which is now C-11, and that he 
believes he can bypass the province in all areas of manpower 
development, make agreements with anybody without granting the 
province the power to opt out of an agreement and to manage the 
related funds, we can only react with outrage. Why? Because this is 
not a quarrel between two levels of government. It is of the highest 
urgency that the little money we have be put to work on behalf of 
the people; the Quebec government is responsible for the economic 
and social development of Quebec. The Quebec government is the 
one closest to citizens. It has the duty and responsibility to provide 
its citizens with the tools they need.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1680"> 1680 </A></B>
<P>
	It is not for nothing that we have the Société québécoise de 
développement de la main-d'oeuvre cooperating with labour, 
management and everybody. It is because things are terribly 
urgent.
<P>
	I would like to ask my colleague how the need to put all the 
resources available at the service of citizens can be felt in his 
riding, in a concrete way?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I thank my colleague from Mercier who, as everyone 
knows, is an expert in this field and who always brings us down to 
earth.
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	I do not want to talk about agriculture, even though this would 
make the hon. member for Beauséjour happy. Some of the bills 
passed by this House may be a little ``far out'', if I may use this 
term, or have little impact on people's everyday lives. However, on 
reading Bill C-11, an act to establish the Department of Human 
Resources Development and to amend and repeal certain related 
acts, for the first time, members may wonder what impact this bill 
could have on their fellow citizens' daily lives.
<P>
	The hon. member for Mercier has just reminded us that the 
perverse effects of this bill, and to an even larger extent those of the 
decisions made by the Minister of Human Resources Development, 
can be seen every day. In fact, in my riding, as in all ridings in 
Quebec, how many times have we heard unemployed people and 
owners of small, medium size and large businesses complain about 
the time-in business time is money-needed to deal with 
bureaucrats, to meet the requirements of officials from all 
departments? They also have to deal with other bureaucrats asking 
the same questions in the same area. There is one official from the 
Quebec government and one from the federal government.
<P>
	That is why, as my hon. colleague indicated, the Department of 
Human Resources Development interferes in a multitude of aspects 
relating to manpower development, and the same could be said 
about other areas over which the department has authority. Over 
time, this has created such confusion that we do not know if we are 
coming or going. It is a well-known fact that has been stated and 
demonstrated time and time again. That is the explanation, and it 
has nothing to do with their generosity of spirit or with the various 
organizations losing sight of their mandate or clientele. I am 
thinking of the Conseil du patronat negotiating with the CSN or the 
FTQ. They do not do so for the fun of it, to take advantage of the 
CSN, but rather because they believe it is in everyone's best 
interest to reach a consensus.
<P>
	The same goes for the unions. I do not think Gérald Larose is 
crazy about sitting at the same table as Ghislain Dufour, from the 
Conseil du patronat. But dealing with  manpower training and 
making sure Quebecers receive appropriate training to become not 
only competitive on the work market but also more efficient in 
their jobs, which in turn ensures that we produce higher quality 
products, is good for everybody. That is what the consensus in 
Quebec is all about.
<P>
	It is quite simple. We must achieve tangible results. Labour, 
management, governments, we all have to work together to ensure 
that our workers are well trained and our plants operating to the 
satisfaction of the consumers, so that everybody is happy. We must 
revisit various programs to avoid duplication, implement programs 
in line with reality, so that where cooks are needed, we train cooks, 
not engineers.
<P>
	As my colleague from Mercier mentioned, this affects people in 
their daily lives. Finally, it is important that the Liberal members 
who are listening to the debate talk to their colleague and try to 
convince him, if possible. I wish them good luck, because we are 
having a hard time trying to convince the Minister of Human 
Resources Development that he should improve his bill and 
announce he will not interfere in areas of provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I would 
like to take exception to the member's speech. In his opening 
remarks he said that he was quite surprised and expressed 
disappointment that the government and the third party were very 
silent on this bill. I take exception to that.
<P>
	We have not been silent on this bill. I would like him to 
acknowledge the fact that we have not been silent on this bill. Our 
two critics stood in this House today and expressed this party's 
point of view. They expressed it quite clearly and very eloquently. I 
would like the hon. member to acknowledge that fact.
<P>
	Just because his party wishes to prolong the debate and wishes to 
have more people speak on this issue, he should not then put down 
members of the third party who have spoken to this bill. Would he 
please acknowledge that?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead, 
BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, my answer will be very brief.
<P>
	In making these comments, it was indeed my intention to help 
Reform Party members realize the importance of this debate and 
take part in it. However, their interest is limited to say the least, 
since we have heard very few of them.
<P>
	As for us, our intention is not to unduly prolong this debate, but 
to make people aware of the importance of this bill and particularly 
of its dreadful consequences.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1681"> 1681 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, indeed I 
come from the riding of Longueuil, the nicest one in Quebec. 
Located along the St. Lawrence River, it reflects the history of 
French Canadians, the history of Quebec. There are some very old 
houses. I myself own a house built in 1854. It was bought by the 
Oblate Fathers when they first came to Canada. They settled on 
Saint-Charles street, in Longueuil. As you know, the Oblate 
Fathers were missionaries and discoverers. They promoted 
Quebec's development and we are very proud of that.
<P>
	As regards Bill C-11, the Liberal government is once again 
helping itself. It creates a new department, it changes the name of 
the department so as to give itself more power, much more power 
as was explained by the Bloc Quebecois members who spoke 
before me. It seeks to provide the minister with the authority to get 
involved with the private sector, with the provinces, or some of 
them, for the purpose of creating a system that will be detrimental 
to the Quebec employment department.
<P>
	In Quebec, a manpower development agency was set up a few 
years ago. This structure reflects the unanimous will of all 
Quebecers, whether they are from business or labour, and whether 
they belong to either one the two main parties, namely the Parti 
Quebecois and the Quebec Liberal Party. There is a definite 
consensus. All Quebecers agree that the province must have its 
own way of dealing with the unemployed or with welfare 
recipients, who had the misfortune of losing their job. There are 
some who had the misfortune of losing their employment because 
of the federal government's way of managing.
<P>
<B>(1700)</B>
<P>
	We know that the federal government, through its policies of 
concentrating all the powers here in Ottawa, wants to show 
Quebecers that it is the big leader of this country. It wants to show 
that, without the federal government, it would be impossible to 
survive in Quebec. All the measures it has taken have had the effect 
of bringing about inflation in some cases; after having caused 
inflation, it increased interest rates, which generated recessions 
between 1970 and 1980.
<P>
	Between 1984 and 1986, we experienced the same problem when 
inflation and recession were brought about. So, the real cause of the 
social problems we have in Quebec is particularly related to the 
inappropriate actions taken by the federal government. Today, the 
minister wants to give himself powers to manage the 
unemployment insurance program better. But the government is the 
cause of unemployment.
<P>
	I want to point out that we cannot have much confidence in this 
Liberal government. Only three weeks ago, I asked questions of the 
secretary of state for finance, who was saying that he wanted to set 
up an unemployment insurance fund, adding that he wanted to use 
the moneys collected from both employees and  employers, some 
$5 billion a year, to collect even more and then give it back under 
the new way of managing the unemployment insurance program.
<P>
	He was saying that this fund could be used to reduce Canada's 
debt, and that he also wanted to set up a fund to accumulate money 
for lean years to come. Let me remind him that these are lean years.
<P>
	If the government wants to build up a reserve during the lean 
years, how much more money will it collect when prosperity 
returns? Apparently, it will collect $5 billion during a lean year like 
this one. How much will it collect when times are good? Will it be 
$10 billion, or $15 billion? Where will all that money go? In the 
consolidated revenue fund, to reduce the Canadian debt.
<P>
	The poor are being squeezed, and the small businesses too. We 
know that the maximum insured income has been reduced. The 
higher the salary, the lower the relative contribution will be. 
Quebec has many have small businesses, and our salaries are lower. 
That means that small businesses will pay more. In a way, workers 
and employers will have to pay a new tax to reduce the federal 
deficit.
<P>
	It is a strange way to put government finance back in order. They 
squeeze money out of workers and small businesses in Quebec to 
reduce the federal deficit. As you can see, we do not trust this way 
of doing things. This bill gives more powers to the minister, so you 
will understand why we are apprehensive, and why we worry so 
much about the future.
<P>
	My colleagues have already mentioned that Quebec wants to 
have complete jurisdiction over manpower training. That has been 
said so many times in the past. There reasons why Quebec wants 
this. Quebec is a distinct society, whether you like it or not. It is a 
fact of life.
<P>
<B>(1705)</B>
<P>
	It is a reality. English Canada has to understand once and for all 
that Quebec is a distinct society.
<P>
	We are a distinct society, not necessarily because of our French 
language. The fact that we speak French is patently obvious, of 
course. Quebecers speak French and quite a high percentage of 
French speaking Quebecers do not speak English. For instance, the 
minister could ask a Quebec worker who just lost his job to take a 
job in Toronto or in Vancouver. That is what is called manpower 
mobility.
<P>
	Any worker who loses his or her job could be asked to move to 
Vancouver for example or Toronto to get a job. However, a French 
speaking Quebecer who does not speak English could refuse to take 
a job in Toronto or in Vancouver, but then he would stand to lose his 
UI benefits, because a French speaking Quebecer can be forced to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1682"> 1682 </A></B>
<P>
move to an area where he, in principle, cannot  work, and where he 
is not at all interested to go. It is too big a change to ask of him.
<P>
	Because Quebec is a distinct society, we cannot make the same 
rules for Quebecers as for the rest of Canadians. This is one of the 
reasons we believe Quebec should be responsible for 
unemployment insurance and for manpower training. Everybody 
agrees with that in Quebec.
<P>
	Quebec is not a distinct society just because of its language. 
Quebec is not a distinct society just because of its folklore. Our 
folk dances are not the only difference. We dance the typical square 
dances of the Scotch and the Irish. If ours is a distinct society, it is 
not only because of folklore. We have a distinct culture.
<P>
	In particular, we are distinct because of our financial institutions. 
Quebec's financial institutions are distinct, as is again obvious 
when we deal with amendments concerning financial institutions. 
This is of the utmost importance.
<P>
	The Mouvement Desjardins alone, for example, has assets of 
more than $80 billion. This is quite significant. Why did Quebecers 
have to put in place their own financial institutions? Because 
English Canada would not give loans to good French speaking 
Quebecers who needed money. No loans were given. In Quebec, 
loans were only for English speaking individuals and for their 
businesses.
<P>
	So we had to set up our own financial institutions with Quebec 
charters and rules. But there is not only the Mouvement Desjardins.
<P>
	Quebec chartered mutual insurance companies were created 
specifically to answer Quebec's needs. There is also the Quebec 
Deposit and Investment Fund which manages more than $50 
billion. The money is used to develop our economy, give loans to 
Quebec businesses and to create partnerships with certain 
companies. This is what distinct society is all about. It means that 
we created our own financial institutions, our own corporations and 
all that.
<P>
	Now, you will understand that we do not intend to lose what we 
duly earned by the sweat of our brow. How could we accept that the 
federal government should decide how we are to be trained, and 
what rules are to be established even without our consent?
<P>
	Just look at what the government did our fusion project in 
Varennes. It decided unilaterally that the federal government's 
priority was not nuclear fusion.
<P>
<B>(1710)</B>
<P>
	It acted unilaterally. It did not talk to Quebec, to other investors, 
and Hydro-Quebec is one of them. It decided unilaterally to pull 
out of this research.
<P>
	The great federal master decided on his own to suddenly 
withdraw or change the rules without taking into account the efforts 
that we made in Quebec to  develop ourselves. We have created 
many things. In spite of all our efforts, if we succeed in having an 
unemployment rate no higher than 10 or 12 per cent, we are 
considered to be top players, extraordinary people. The federal 
government has never helped us much in terms of economic 
development, we have had to do it all by ourselves with a lot of 
hard work.
<P>
	Do you think we can have confidence in the federal government 
for our development? When we think that in R&amp;D in 1989, and I 
have had the opportunity to do a study of this, federal contracts to 
Quebec using our tax money for R&amp;D-which is somewhat linked 
to training, because businesses need to develop, as people need to 
be trained, it is all connected-research and development contracts 
or assistance from the government, to businesses or educational 
institutions were $1.2 billion less than to Ontario.
<P>
	I do not recall all the figures exactly, since it is quite some time 
since I did the research, but I do remember clearly that the shortfall 
for Quebec in R&amp;D contracts from the federal government was 
$1.2 billion. So, if you wonder why there is more unemployment in 
Quebec than in Ontario, there is the reason.
<P>
	In the industry committee this morning I asked the people from 
Statistics Canada who were there testifying what the distribution of 
Statistics Canada staff was. They said the distribution was good, 
and relatively representative of the population, but when I asked 
for details, they told me that there were 4,600 employees at 
Statistics Canada, and some 3,500 of those were in Ottawa. Now, as 
far as I know, Ottawa is in Ontario, so when you look at the $346 
million spent by Statistics Canada, and think of the relationship 
between the total of 4,600 employees and the 3,600 Ontario 
employees, you will see that the repercussions for Ontario are 
markedly greater, and that is where the difference lies.
<P>
	The purpose of all that is to say that we cannot count on the 
federal government to help us develop. We really have no 
confidence in them. As the saying goes, once burned twice shy, and 
let me tell you that we have absolutely no confidence in the federal 
government to look after manpower training, to look after our 
jobless.
<P>
	They say unemployment is running at only 10 per cent, 11 per 
cent in Quebec. Unemployment is still much too high in Quebec 
compared with the United States, where it is at about 5 per cent. 
The worst of it is that there are somewhat fewer unemployed than 
there should be because those who have run out of unemployment 
insurance are now on welfare.
<P>
	Welfare in Quebec is very high. Why? Because people are 
getting less unemployment insurance, because they are working 
less. Why is there more unemployment in Quebec? For the reasons 
I mentioned earlier. Because the federal government has never 
taken Quebec seriously, and we have always had to work a lot 
harder to achieve economic growth.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1683"> 1683 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1715)</B>
<P>
	That is what the distinct society is all about. Quebec will never 
agree to let the federal government manage its affairs, unless major 
changes are made.
<P>
	On that point I conclude and I thank you very much, Madam 
Speaker.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I would like to start my maiden speech in the House by 
thanking my riding for trusting me since, as you can see, I am the 
youngest member in the House of Commons. It was not certain, 
when I first stood as a candidate, that my youth would be an asset. 
As a mater of fact, I would also like to congratulate the Bloc 
Quebecois for being an open and forward looking party which is 
ready to forge ahead with young people and the whole gamut of 
society. I am very proud of our party.
<P>
	I am very happy and greatly honoured to represent the riding of 
Lac-Saint-Jean. A Tremblay representing Lac-Saint-Jean, a riding 
which does not shy away from innovation, a riding which could be 
called the heartland of Quebec. My colleagues here are very close 
to me, but the riding of Lac-Saint-Jean was the first one to say yes 
to sovereignty along with the area of Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean-I 
am talking about the 1980 referendum, of course-and which 
showed the way to the rest of Quebec, as we saw during the last 
referendum. It is practically the birth place of the Bloc Quebecois 
thanks to my predecessor, Mr. Lucien Bouchard, who is now the 
Premier of Quebec.
<P>
	When I say that it is Quebec heartland, I do not mean only in 
political terms. Michel Gauthier comes from Roberval, the riding 
next to mine, which is also part of the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean 
area; this is truly the heartland of Quebec. People in my riding are 
warm, welcoming, fun-loving people who are easy to get along 
with.
<P>
	Unfortunately, it is a riding faced with some problems, and this 
is one of the reasons why I decided to enter politics. Like many 
other remote areas in Quebec, in the rest of Canada, and even 
throughout the world, it is plagued by a serious problem: young and 
not so young people are leaving in search of a job.
<P>
	Another reason is the fact that my riding is the victim of the 
transition from the industrial era to the era of the small and medium 
size businesses. We will probably need, and I hope so, the help of 
the federal government to support businesses.
<P>
	This is also a riding that, I think, is full of potential, full of 
natural resources and full of people with great potential. Last 
September, this riding, this region of Quebec showed it can 
innovate by developing a regional strategic planning. When they 
noticed things were going badly, they got all the stakeholders 
together to establish a guideline. The main element that came out 
was decentralization.
<P>
	Which brings me to the bill before us, a bill that goes against 
what our region and Quebec as a whole, what all Quebecers want, 
namely decentralization. Ultimately, we want to take matters in our 
own hands. We want to manage our own business. And the more 
things will be close to the people, the better it will be.
<P>
<B>(1720)</B>
<P>
	At the last referendum we lost-we lost it, these are very big 
words-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Shefford): </B>We almost won it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean):</B> Yes, we almost won it. I had a 
glimmer of hope. I was thinking: Jean Chrétien's government had 
promised us it would decentralize, it had promised us a new 
country. But with this bill, it is obvious we were had. Again it is 
obvious we cannot trust this government, we cannot trust the 
federalist system.
<P>
	This bill increases the federal government's presence in many 
sectors. We must keep in mind the unemployment insurance sector. 
It is a well-known fact that a region such as mine needs 
unemployment insurance. The new bill will have negative effects 
on my region.
<P>
	There are also income security programs for children and 
seniors. This bill also affects support to the provinces for 
post-secondary education, welfare, labour market adjustment, 
social development as well as student loans. This is a bill that 
centralizes far too much.
<P>
	When we travel throughout Canada, people ask us: ``What does 
Quebec want?'' I will tell you: we want decentralization, we want 
to be masters in our own home. There is a wide consensus around 
managing our own affairs and decentralizing. A simple example is 
manpower development. Practically everyone is part of this wide 
consensus: the current Quebec government and the previous one. 
Mr. Bourassa, the Conseil du patronat, the labour bodies, the 
education system, the employment fora, they all agreed. We simply 
wish to manage our own affairs.
<P>
	I will conclude my maiden speech by saying that I hope the 
Minister will have the nerve to amend his bill and to listen to his 
people, who really want that decentralization. Finally, I wish to 
thank once again the constituents of Lac-Saint-Jean who showed 
confidence in one of their young people. I can say that I will always 
be there to represent my riding, which I consider as one of the most 
beautiful in Quebec.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Hurray for Lac-Saint-Jean!
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear!
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I wanted to 
make a comment because, when the new member for 
Lac-Saint-Jean arrived in this House, my duties as training and 
youth critic were transferred to him. I agreed that this duty should 
be given to him since he is the youngest member in the Bloc 
Quebecois and  indeed in the House of Commons. I was once a 
young man myself, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1684"> 1684 </A></B>
<P>
of course, youth comes with age, and I think the member showed us 
in his maiden speech, which was very eloquent, that he has a lot of 
heart.
<P>
	He expressed his concerns, and I think I have heard him talk 
about his concerns for youth before.
<P>
	He talked a lot about his riding and he talked about youth. I 
would like to ask him this question-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Question, question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Discepola:</B> Give him a chance to answer the question at 
least.
<P>
	<B>Mr Dubé:</B> It is interesting, Madam Speaker. After total silence 
this afternoon during this debate on the creation of an important 
department, the arrival of a new member, a young member who has 
shown some enthusiasm, has finally waken up this House, and I am 
very happy about that.
<P>
<B>(1725)</B>
<P>
	I would like to ask him what he thinks about young people 
moving away to find work. Does he thinks it is important that this 
responsibility be given to the Government of Quebec to ensure 
consistency and is it possible to finally put an end to the duplication 
of programs? Does he agree that Quebec should regain control over 
all its tools? He has already talked about that but, in the few 
minutes he has left, I would like to hear him say a few more words 
about his concerns for youth.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean):</B> Madam Speaker, before I 
answer, I would like to make a comment. It is true I am young, but I 
was elected by my constituents. In politics, people often talk about 
youth to make political hay. They like to surround themselves with 
young people. We all know parties which court young people to 
show they are open to all age groups and are looking to the future, 
whereas the Bloc Quebecois and Lac-Saint-Jean riding do not 
believe in tokenism.
<P>
	They really give tangible examples by electing a young member 
to Parliament, even if it might be risky; but if you never take risks 
in life, you never make any progress and those who do not progress 
regress. That was only a short comment I wanted to add.
<P>
	I will reply to my colleague that, in a way, youth is in a way a 
symbol of decentralization. The closer the decision-making body is 
to the public, the more the people feel they are involved. I do 
believe in decentralization and the more we decentralize, the more 
people will feel involved, including young people. Too often, they 
feel lost in the political debate because they feel it does not concern 
them. So we just have to get closer to the population for the people 
to feel more concerned.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I would 
like to congratulate the member for Lac-Saint-Jean on his maiden 
speech, his first presentation in the House of Commons.
<P>
	I would like to make two comments. The first is that I hope this 
new member does not feel too guilty about taking away the crown 
of the youngest member of the House of Commons from his 
colleague from Témiscamingue who held the crown until he 
showed up. I worked with the former youngest member of the 
House in the Standing Committee on Finance. I know he tried to 
hold this government accountable, as he should, and he did a good 
job. I hope the hon. member for Lac-Saint-Jean does the same in 
holding the government accountable.
<P>
	Having said that, hopefully the member will have time to answer 
my second comment. In delivering his speech, I noticed some 
traces and hints of the former leader of the Bloc Quebecois. The 
member's style is very similar. However I hope there is a little 
more substance to what the member says and does.
<P>
	The former leader is all things to all people. He is able to deliver 
everything to everybody in Quebec. He is able to walk on water. He 
is able to save social programs yet cut at the same time. He is able 
to promote youth employment. He is able to do all those things but 
the money is not there.
<P>
	How does the member propose to add some substance to what he 
has talked about?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean):</B> Madam Speaker, I believe my 
first achievement was to run in that election. I am not bragging, but 
I can tell you that it took a lot of courage. One of the things I 
wanted to do was not simply talk, but to show that there are still 
young people out there who want to take part in the political 
process of this country.
<P>
	When I decided to go for it, I asked myself: ``Are people ready to 
vote for someone who is only 22?'' It was not obvious.
<P>
	The first concrete sign I got was when students and other young 
people told me that I was showing them the way and giving them a 
reason to go for it. Therefore, concretely, I had already done more 
than just talk. With due respect, I am saying time will tell what I 
will be able to do in the future, but at the very least I tried, I jumped 
the fence, as for what will come of it, tomorrow will tell. I had two 
alternatives: give up or roll up my sleaves and go for it. I decided to 
try my best and I am ready and willing to start building the Quebec 
of tomorrow.

	<B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should consider the 
advisability of amending section 3 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms, according to the amending formula provided for in section 38 of the 
Constitution Act, 1982, which amendment would read as follows: ``Every 
citizen of Canada, except one who is (a) confined in a penitentiary, a prison, or a 
psychiatric institution, or (<I>b</I>) at large from a place referred to in paragraph (<I>a</I>), 
with or without a lawful excuse, has the right to vote in an election of Members 
of the House of Commons or of a legislative assembly and to be qualified for 
membership therein.''</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Madam Speaker, less than 100 years ago a woman from 
Victoria, B.C. shocked local citizens by showing up to vote. As a 
widow she had inherited property from her husband and as a new 
property owner she was therefore qualified to vote according to the 
way the franchise was limited at that time of Canadian history.
<P>
	How times have changed. For the law-abiding adult citizens of a 
nation to have a real voice in how affairs are conducted now is 
regarded as a hallmark of democracy. In our lifetime thousands of 
young Canadians have fought and died on foreign soil to defend 
that basic principle.
<P>
	Most recently much of the world was shocked when mainland 
China conducted war games using live ammunition to discourage 
the citizens of Taiwan from casting their ballots for Taiwan's new 
president, the first time voting for president had been allowed in 
the 5,000 year history of the most populated nation on the planet. 
With great courage over 76 per cent of eligible Taiwanese voters 
cast ballots, a great testament to how much those free Chinese 
valued their new found democracy.
<P>
	Within our commonwealth of nations the Republic of South 
Africa based the right to vote on racial qualifications which 
allowed a small white minority to control the much larger black 
majority, including through a seemingly endless list of human 
rights violations until the practice of apartheid recently was ended.
<P>
	I mention these examples to point out what a precious privilege 
it is to be able to vote and to be able to run for public office rather 
than have our lives controlled by  totalitarian dictators, or by 
communist or fascist parties, or by members of a particular race.
<P>
	Citizens of Canada value that right very highly. Therefore many 
Canadian citizens were shocked when they realized that our charter 
of rights and freedoms now has given the right to vote to criminals. 
Section 51 of the Canada Elections Act disqualified many citizens 
from voting:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The following persons are not qualified to vote at an election and shall not 
vote at an election:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(e) Every person undergoing punishment as an inmate in any penal institution 
for the commission of any offence;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(f) Every person who is restrained of his liberty of movement or deprived of 
the management of his property by reason of mental disease.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1735 )</B>
<P>
	These election act provisions were what Canadians expected.
<P>
	It is also interesting to note that in the United States, a great 
democracy and our nearest neighbour, the 14th amendment to the 
United States Constitution excludes prisoners from voting. Its 
Constitution has been in the possession of the American people 
since the 1700s, whereas the Canadian Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms dates from only the 1980s. It is not surprising that 
Americans have passed many Constitutional amendments.
<P>
	At the present time section 748 of the Criminal Code of Canada 
provides that persons convicted of an indictable offence for which 
they are in prison for a term exceeding five years cannot hold 
public office or any employment under the crown. They cannot be 
elected or sit or vote as a member of Parliament or of a legislative 
assembly and cannot exercise any right of suffrage.
<P>
	However, convicted killers have challenged section 51(e) of the 
Canadian elections act based on the charter of rights and freedoms 
which now states this in section 3:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Every citizen of Canada has the right to vote in an election of members of the 
House of Commons or of a legislative assembly and to be qualified for 
membership therein.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This issue has been taken before various courts a number of 
times. For example, in 1992 the federal government lost a case to 
Richard Sauvé, who was serving a life sentence in Kingston 
Penitentiary and had sued the government for the right to vote.
<P>
	Decisions of the court have been divided and appeals have gone 
to the highest levels regarding both provincial and federal 
elections. The courts have decided that the Canada Elections Act 
does not stand up against the charter of rights and freedoms.
<P>
	I know from talking with Canadian people that the fact the courts 
have removed those limitations on who gets to vote is offensive to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1686"> 1686 </A></B>
<P>
the majority of Canadians who are  too busy earning a living to 
appear before royal commissions.
<P>
	It is a typical example of bleeding hearts who are more 
concerned with advancing the rights of prisoners than with 
demonstrating that serious punishments are attached to the 
commission of crimes.
<P>
	One of the biggest complaints I hear from many voters in my 
riding is that offenders get a slap on the wrist for virtually any 
crime they commit. Working police officers also tell me they feel it 
is not even worth the paperwork they must complete to get an 
offender convicted and sent to jail.
<P>
	It is not as though we throw people into jail at the drop of a hat, 
even though Canada has one of the highest per capita prisoner rates 
in the world, second only to the United States. It is not because the 
Canadian law is so tough that we have so many people in jail. The 
truth is that crimes of violence have increased by 782 per cent from 
1971 to 1994 in Canada. Property crime has increased by 1,031 per 
cent, although our population has increased by only 27 per cent.
<P>
	In 1994 almost three million crimes were committed compared 
with just over a quarter of a million back in 1971. This is an 
astonishing fact. It is time the government woke up to that. The 
bleeding hearts, including the justice minister, like only to refer to 
the past couple of years when certain categories of crime have 
decreased a little.
<P>
	Law-abiding Canadians do not feel safe and they want to see 
offenders punished. One of those punishments should remain that 
going to jail means losing voting rights. Once offenders have paid 
their debt to society they should get their voting rights back, but not 
until that debt is paid.
<P>
	This position was clearly stated by some witnesses who appeared 
before the royal commission on electoral reform and party 
financing which submitted its report in November, 1991. One 
witness told the commission in Edmonton: ``It is a punishment. 
The reason why they should not receive a vote is that they are not in 
society in a sense. Until they return to society and act within the 
confines of our laws, they are barred from certain privileges, one of 
them being, in my feeling, the right to vote in an election''.
<P>
<B>(1740)</B>
<P>
	In Thompson, Manitoba the commission was told: ``We believe 
that the right to vote is a very special privilege in our country. We 
believe that once you break the law of the land, part of the deterrent 
would be the loss of the right to vote as long as you are in prison. I 
do not believe the charter, at any point, says you have the right to 
break the law''.
<P>
	The commissioners pointed out that most witnesses supported 
giving prisoners the right to vote, but none advocated allowing 
prisoners to stand as candidates.
<P>
	It also mentioned a brief from the John Howard Society which 
pointed out that prisoners have the right to vote in Italy, Sweden, 
Norway and Denmark but not in the United Kingdom, France, 
Switzerland or the United States.
<P>
	The number of prisoners and costs raise two more points against 
allowing inmates to vote. According to testimony of Mr. 
Jean-Claude Léger, director of operations, office of the Chief 
Electoral Officer, to the procedure and House affairs committee on 
April 21, 1994, 6,800 inmates used special voting rules.
<P>
	According to testimony of the Chief Elector Officer, Mr. 
Jean-Pierre Kingsley, to the same committee, there were 7,502 
incarcerated electors. The cost per elector was $23.81 compared 
with the cost of $9.38 for the average registered elector outside the 
penal system.
<P>
	That number of votes cast in prison could very well mean that 
prisoners wanting weaker laws to punish crime could determine the 
outcome in many elections. Votes of prisoners are being sent to 
their home ridings to be counted, and many elections are won and 
lost by small margins.
<P>
	In the riding of Edmonton Northwest the Minister of Natural 
Resources won over the Reform Party opponent by a mere 12 
votes. I wonder how many were cast from the penal system.
<P>
	Another close call saw the Liberal member for Edmonton East 
defeat the Reform candidate by 115 votes. With those numbers, it is 
clear that in prison voters could readily tip the scales of an election.
<P>
	How fair is that to law-abiding citizens who must support these 
prisoners at considerable expense? I do not think it is fair at all. 
Some on the other side of the House probably do.
<P>
	The other section of the Canada Elections Act to which I draw 
attention in my motion is that inmates of mental institutions should 
not be allowed to vote. That may not be the best way to word my 
concern, but this is a motion intended to push the government in 
this direction, not for a finished piece of legislation.
<P>
	The justice department has hundreds of lawyers. Private 
members have access to only three. Regarding mental hospital 
inmates voting, in October 1988 the Canadian Disability Rights 
Council challenged the present wording of section 51(f) of the 
Canada Elections Act. In its decision, the court basically said that 
any mental patient 18 and over who can recite his or her name, age 
and address can be on the voter's list.
<P>
	Many Canadians are offended by such a low standard to 
determine who is eligible to vote; lest we forget that anybody who 
is allowed to vote is allowed to run for  office. I am sure Canadians 
do 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1687"> 1687 </A></B>
<P>
not want inmates of mental institutions running for either federal or 
provincial governments.
<P>
	Since I have been here I have been told it seems as though for 
years perhaps the inmates are running the asylum here. Sometimes 
we wonder.
<P>
	Witnesses appearing before the Royal Commission on Electoral 
Reform and Party Financing were divided about voting rights for 
the mentally ill or the mentally handicapped.
<P>
	A member of a hospital volunteer committee stated: ``We are 
fiercely opposed to voting by proxy for persons who are mentally 
ill. We believe the right to vote is essentially personal and can be 
exercised only by the holder of the right, not by the third party. The 
psychiatric population is very vulnerable in that risks of abuse are 
higher than for so-called normal people''.
<P>
<B>(1745 )</B>
<P>
	Many people pointed out how difficult it would be to develop a 
competency test unless the same test were applied to the general 
voting population. A common sense solution is simply to require 
that voters be able to get to their home polling station and once 
there to be able to complete a ballot properly.
<P>
	The Conservative government issued a white paper in 1986 on 
election law reform which recommended that mentally disabled 
Canadians have the right to be enumerated and vote. The white 
paper also recommended that no polling stations be established in 
mental hospitals and that residents of such institutions should not 
have the right to vote by proxy. However, the legislation died on the 
Order Paper.
<P>
	There is one category of residents in mental institutions which I 
know Canadians do not want to see voting, namely, those confined 
because they are not criminally responsible, the NCR, or not 
criminally responsible because of a mental disorder, NCRMD, the 
two terms used by the provinces for mental institution patients 
forcibly confined for criminal reasons.
<P>
	Although the rules and details vary from province to province, 
basically these patients are detained under federal legislation which 
is administered by the provinces. Having that label means they 
were deemed to be ill at the time of the criminal offence and 
therefore were never convicted of an offence. It is a label which has 
been applied to some of the nastiest criminals in our history.
<P>
	Currently in British Columbia there are 130 NCR patients 
detained in the mental institution which has a total of 174 detainee 
beds.
<P>
	In Alberta, 36 NCR patients are lodged in two mental 
institutions. Overall Alberta has 1,000 psychiatric beds and about 
10 per cent of those are for forensic.
<P>
	The figures are small for Saskatchewan and Manitoba with 16 
NCR patients under board review in  Saskatchewan. Twelve are in 
Saskatchewan Hospital. Manitoba reports 35 NCR patients in 
mental institutions representing about half of the psychiatric 
patients of that province.
<P>
	Newfoundland reports six to eight in the provincial mental 
hospital's forensic unit. There were seven or eight in New 
Brunswick and four or five in Prince Edward Island. Nova Scotia 
seems to have the greatest difficulty providing this information for 
me as they are in the process of restructuring.
<P>
	Neither of the territories has its own forensic mental facilities. 
Instead NCRs are sent to B.C. from the Yukon and are sent to 
Alberta from the Northwest Territories.
<P>
	With the largest populations in Canada, Ontario and Quebec also 
have the highest numbers of mental patients who are not criminally 
responsible. In Ontario approximately 550 NCRs account for about 
20 per cent of the overall mental patient count of 2,400 to 2,600 
beds.
<P>
	Quebec has 750 NCR patients but it also has review board 
hearings on others. In 1994-95 there were 988 Quebec hearings, 
plus six judged unfit for hearing, for a total of 994 patients who 
were in some form of mental treatment for criminal reasons.
<P>
	I hope all hon. members are aware that there are many Canadians 
with mental illnesses of one sort or another. For example, a friend 
checked herself into the mental illness unit of our local hospital 
when a drinking problem led to a suicide attempt. She was 
voluntarily confined but only briefly. She had absolutely no interest 
in politics at that period in her life.
<P>
	Section 51(f) of the Canada Elections Act excluded from voting 
persons confined involuntarily or not able to manage their own 
affairs due to mental illness.
<P>
	Canada's standards are changing about including people with 
various mental disabilities in group homes, sheltered workshops 
and so on where they often make a real contribution to their 
immediate families and to the community in which they reside.
<P>
	The fact that the mentally disabled are loved and valued does not 
mean they must be allowed to vote. All too often the mentally 
disabled merely become the pawns of their caregivers. These 
mentally disabled Canadians are not independent. Even their 
sources of information can be readily controlled. Therefore, for 
their own protection as well as to protect the voting process, I 
believe it is simply common sense not to turn over the running of 
Canada to people who are mentally incapable either of managing 
their own affairs or of standing trial for crimes they may have 
committed.
<P>
<B>(1750)</B>
<P>
	I must repeat that the people who are allowed to vote are also 
allowed to run for office. That role is not appropriate for the 
mentally handicapped.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1688"> 1688 </A></B>
<P>
	A final point I wish to raise is a recommendation for an 
amendment to section 3 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms. Sections 2 and 7 to 15 can be overridden by an action 
of Parliament alone, as provided by the override clause in section 
33. According to section 33 of the charter, Parliament or a 
provincial legislature can insert a clause stating that it is passing 
a given piece of legislation notwithstanding specific provisions of 
the charter.
<P>
	Additionally, any federal or provincial law containing such a 
notwithstanding or overriding clause has to be reviewed and the 
declaration re-enacted at least every five years or it will not remain 
in force.
<P>
	In conclusion, I would like to quote Mr. Chuck Cadman, 
president of an organization called CRY, for crime, responsibility 
and youth. He stated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I certainly support Darrel on this motion. Anybody who's been convicted of a 
crime against Canadian society has lost their right to vote. When they come out 
of an institution, fine, but while they are serving their time they should not be a 
factor in any decision making on who is in power or what the law should be.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Also, Mr. Dave Langlois of the Vernon Courtwatch Society 
stated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The members of Citizens Courtwatch Society entirely support your private 
member's motion No. 143 to amend the charter of rights and freedoms to 
prevent convicted criminals from voting.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Our government, supreme court and citizens must come to realize that the 
charter acknowledges that all rights are not absolute and must be in balance with 
the rights of the law-abiding citizen. A vast majority of our democratic citizens, 
I can assure you, agree fully with this motion.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I would therefore like to ask for the unanimous consent of the 
House to make this a votable motion.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> Is there 
unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to 
participate in order to give the government's response to the 
Reform member for Okanagan-Shuswap on this private 
member's bill.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This motion raises the issue of whether individuals confined to 
penal and psychiatric institutions should be restricted in the 
exercise of their democratic rights. We are urged to consider 
equally the advisability of an amendment to section 3 of the charter 
which enshrines the right of all Canadian citizens, without 
exception, to vote in an election of members of the House of 
Commons or of a legislative assembly and to be qualified for 
membership therein.
<P>
	I would begin by stating that we on this side of the House do not 
consider that a constitutional amendment  restricting the 
application of this guarantee is advisable. I say this for several 
important reasons, related both to the nature of rights protected 
under the charter and to the legislative history of these issues.
<P>
	The charter itself recognizes the need for a balance between 
individual rights and societal interests and provides a mechanism 
for achieving this balance quite equitably.
<P>
	Section 1 of the charter provides that the rights and freedoms it 
guarantees are subject only to such reasonable limits prescribed by 
law, and can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic 
society. The existence of this special balancing provision provides 
legislators with a significant measure of flexibility. Although 
legislation may contravene individual sections of the charter, such 
as section 3, the government had the opportunity to demonstrate 
that this legislation is justified, once again, in a free and democratic 
society.
<P>
	The charter has therefore established an important dialogue 
between the courts and the government, as legislation is scrutinized 
by the judiciary for consistency with constitutional requirements. 
The Supreme Court of Canada has indicated that government 
restrictions on rights will be justifiable under section 1 of the 
charter when they are designed to accomplish a pressing and 
substantial government objective and when the means used to 
accomplish the objective are proportional. Legislation that does not 
conform to these criteria will be struck down, but this does not 
preclude Parliament from introducing new, and often better, 
legislation on the same subject, with qualifications added to ensure 
the full protection of charter rights.
<P>
<B>(1755 )</B>
<P>
	This dialogue between Parliament and the courts is clearly 
illustrated by the legislative history relating to inmate voting. The 
1985 enactment of the Canada Elections Act defranchised all 
inmates and in 1993 the prohibition was struck down as 
unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of Canada in the Richard 
Sauvé case.
<P>
	It is clear from the supreme court's decision that restrictions on 
the right of inmates to vote will violate section 3 of the charter. But 
as I have stated, that does not mean the government is precluded 
from acting, for it always has recourse to section 1.
<P>
	In the Sauvé case the court found that the government had not 
met the burden of demonstrating that a complete ban on inmate 
voting was demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society, 
as the prohibition was drawn too broadly. This step opened the 
possibility that certain more narrow restrictions on inmate voting 
might be justifiable.
<P>
	The challenge for Parliament is to find a reasonable restriction 
that can be justified as an appropriate limit on individual rights in 
light of the compelling public objects.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1689"> 1689 </A></B>
<P>
	In seeking to find an acceptable compromise after the Sauvé 
decision Parliament reviewed two major reports on electoral 
reform, both of which have been critical of the disenfranchisement 
of all inmates and both of which proposed concrete alternatives.
<P>
	In 1991 the Royal Commission on Electoral Reform and Party 
Financing, more commonly referred to as the Lortie commission, 
had recommended that only persons convicted of an offence 
punishable by a maximum of life imprisonment and sentenced for 
10 years or more be disqualified from voting.
<P>
	In 1992, the special committee on the electoral reform of the 
House of Commons had recommended in its all party report that 
inmates convicted of an offence punishable by a maximum term of 
life imprisonment be disenfranchised.
<P>
	While noting these options, Parliament chose a different 
approach. Under Bill C-114 the impuged paragraph of the Canada 
Elections Act was re-enacted in 1993 to provide that all prisoners 
serving a sentence of two years or more be disqualified from 
voting. It was felt that individuals sentenced to a term of two years 
or more should be viewed as serious offenders and that forfeiting 
their right to vote would send a powerful message that serious 
crimes are inconsistent with the concept of civic responsibility and 
respect and rule for the law. The voting prohibition was also 
viewed as a means of further sanctioning the offender. In other 
words, the measure supported the punitive objective of the law.
<P>
	Perhaps not surprisingly, Parliament's new proposals soon ended 
up back in court. Inmate Sauvé and others filed court actions in the 
Federal Court, trial division, challenging the constitutionality of 
the newly enacted provision of the Elections Act under section 3 of 
the charter and also under section 15, the equality to rights 
provision.
<P>
	The cases were heard jointly by Mr. Justice Wetston and in his 
decision released in January of this year, Justice Wetston concluded 
that the restriction on inmate voting did not violate section 15. 
However it violated the inmates right to vote in section 3.
<P>
	Although Justice Wetston found that the objective of the voting 
prohibition were pressing and substantial, he felt that the wording 
of the legislation provision was overly broad and, therefore, failed 
the test of section 1. He pointed out equally that Parliament could 
provide sentencing judges with the authority to disenfranchise 
convicts on a case by case basis rather than enact a blanket 
disqualification for persons serving two years or more.
<P>
	The federal government has filed an appeal of Mr. Justice 
Wetston's decision to the Federal Court of Appeal. Until this 
litigation runs its course it would be premature to consider any 
further legislative action, be it  constitutional or otherwise and to 
address the issue of inmate voting.
<P>
	It would be prudent for Parliament to wait to receive guidance 
from the Federal Court of Appeal and perhaps even the Supreme 
Court of Canada on whether the existing prohibition on inmate 
voting is sustainable under the charter. If not, what other sorts of 
options for restricting the right to vote would be permissible?
<P>
	Any reconsideration of this issue by Parliament prior to 
obtaining this input would not only be premature but might well 
colour the government's defence on existing legislation.
<P>
	Governments should not consider amending the charter each 
time an adverse court ruling is handed down. The constitutional 
amendment procedure, as we know, is lengthy and complex and is 
not the proper way to address these issues. The charter was never 
intended to be amended on a piecemeal basis in response to 
discrete court decisions. Our challenge therefore in the case of 
restrictions on inmate voting is not to amend the charter but to 
sustain reasonable legislative provisions that strike an appropriate 
balance between individual and collective interests.
<P>
<B>(1800)</B>
<P>
	Although both the Lortie commission and the special committee 
recommended the continued disenfranchisement of certain 
individuals on the ground of mental incapacity, the government of 
the day chose not to accept these recommendations. Instead, the 
law prohibiting voting by mentally ill persons was repealed as part 
of Bill C-114.
<P>
	Finally I should say that the question of who has the right to be 
qualified for membership in the House of Commons under section 
3 of the charter is a separate and distinct question from who should 
have the right to vote. The Supreme Court of Canada has not yet 
had the opportunity to pronounce on the extent to which it is 
possible for the government to restrict the conditions of 
membership in the House and still remain within the bounds of 
section 3 of the charter without recourse to section 1. It is not clear 
that it would be inconsistent with section 3 of the charter as 
currently worded.
<P>
	These and other reasons mean that restrictions imposed on the 
rights of inmates and those of psychiatric institutions to become 
qualified for membership in the House of Commons may be 
sustainable within the bounds of section 3. In short, incarcerated 
persons may not be-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> Order. The 
member's time has expired.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
it is a pleasure to speak to this issue which my colleague from 
Okanagan-Shuswap has brought to this  House. This is an issue 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1690"> 1690 </A></B>
<P>
which is very critical in this day an age: should federal inmates 
have the right to vote.
<P>
	We just heard from the Liberal member that the government has 
filed an appeal to Judge Wetston's decision that inmates should 
have the right to vote. I find that very interesting because it was not 
too long ago that a judge in this country made the decision that the 
use or abuse of cocaine and alcohol were an excuse for murder. 
These very same Liberals came back into the House in a hurry to 
reverse that decision. Now the member stands up and says that gee 
whiz, they are going to have to file an appeal and they will see if it 
works and so on. The fact is that they just do not have the intestinal 
fortitude to turn that decision around.
<P>
	Should federal inmates have the right to vote is the big question. 
There are some questions which have to be answered here and I am 
going to make an attempt at that. Why are we at this stage today? 
Why are we even discussing this here when it could have been a 
votable issue? And why is this not votable? Why are we discussing 
Motion No. 143 on a non-votable basis? I will cover that in a 
moment. Another question relative to federal inmates having a vote 
in this country today is: When will this government start putting 
the affairs and issues that are relative to victims in this country on 
the front plate instead of those affairs relative to criminals?
<P>
	Why is this motion not votable? The solicitor general said on the 
day this issue broke that the government believes that withholding 
the right to vote is reasonable. If the solicitor general believes that 
withholding the right to vote from federal inmates is reasonable, 
then why is it that this motion could not have been voted on tonight 
in the affirmative? Why is that so unreasonable? What is most 
obvious is that there is no will to do so in the federal government.
<P>
	Why are we at this stage today? Why is it that judges appear to 
be making decisions that are not in the best interests of the country 
and not in the best interests of victims?
<P>
	One of the Liberal members is suggesting that we whip the 
judges. We can understand the methodology and the logic coming 
from over there.
<P>
<B>(1805 )</B>
<P>
	Let me give these folks across the way a little lesson in some of 
the decisions judges are making today. I ask whether judges are 
making rational decisions today and whether decisions like that of 
Judge Wetston to allow criminals, federal inmates, the right to vote 
is a good one.
<P>
	Let us hear what B.C. Supreme Court Justice Sherman Hood said 
before acquitting a man of sexually assaulting a North Vancouver 
waitress: ``No sometimes means maybe or wait a while''. That is a 
judicial decision in this country which will be used as 
jurisprudence in other decisions. Does that make any sense? That is 
supposed to be a rational decision coming from this country's 
judiciary.
<P>
	Northwest circuit Judge Michael Bourassa on sexual assaults in 
the Northwest Territories said: ``Sexual assaults occur when the 
woman is drunk and passed out; the man comes along, sees a pair 
of hips and helps himself''. That is another judicial decision that is 
a total avoidance of the protection of victims. The government, just 
like on the issue of the right of federal inmates to vote, does 
absolutely nothing about it. Government members sit here and pass 
rhetoric off as though we were supposed to buy it.
<P>
	I will give another example. Members are asking over there how 
is this relevant. It is relevant because judges are making bad 
decisions and Justice Wetston made a terrible decision. Members 
over there just do not like to hear this.
<P>
	In my province in February 1996: ``Port Hardy, British 
Columbia provincial court Judge Brian Saunderson gave 57-year 
old Vernon Logan `an absolute discharge' even though Logan 
pleaded guilty to possessing child pornography. The judge said the 
law banning child pornography violates the charter of rights'', it 
sounds familiar, ``because it is an infringement of one's freedom of 
thought, belief or opinion as unfettered access to reading material 
is necessary to exercise those freedoms''.
<P>
	With this kind of charter of rights decision by a judge to let off 
someone who possesses or is dealing in pornography, the very 
criminal act he was charged with, because it is a violation of his 
rights under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, how far 
is this government going to allow this to go? That is the question.
<P>
	David Snow was charged in Vancouver with kidnapping two 
women and trying to strangle a third. The judge declared: ``I cannot 
conclude that the placing of the wire around the neck of the victim 
and the placing of the plastic over her head are sufficient enough to 
establish intent to kill''.
<P>
	I ask that group, which is somewhat more quiet now, are these 
kinds of decisions made by judges, including the decision to allow 
federal inmates the right to vote, in the best interests of law-abiding 
Canadian citizens? The answer is no.
<P>
	If the solicitor general is to be believed, if he says he believes 
that withholding the right to vote is reasonable, then why does this 
government not come in here and do it? What is wrong? The fact is 
this government, those people who are speaking on the other side 
of the House, believe it is fair.
<P>
<B>(1810 )</B>
<P>
	Let us deal with what criminals are getting today. Are we going 
too far to the left where the Liberals are? What  do criminals have? 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1691"> 1691 </A></B>
<P>
We know they get their conjugal visits. We know they get GST 
rebates. We all know they are getting the Canada pension plan-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> They do not.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> The member says that they do 
not but they do. He is not well informed about these issues. We 
know they get old age security and the guaranteed income 
supplement. We know they have access to legal aid at the cost of 
the taxpayer. I believe that Clifford Olson is up to his 32nd 
litigation at the cost of the taxpayer. We know they have the right to 
sue. We know they have the right to refuse work. We know they get 
overtime and on and on it goes.
<P>
	The final insult to law-abiding Canadian citizens is in front of 
them: Offenders now have the right to vote. This government 
refuses to do anything about it. However the government will not 
have to because when it is replaced in the next election, something 
will be done.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Kingston and the Islands, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I want to correct a few of the inaccurate suggestions made 
in the speeches by my colleagues opposite.
<P>
	The Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General of Canada 
made an excellent speech, although he did not remember certain 
facts which occurred during the course of the last Parliament in 
relation to the bill he was referring to, Bill C-114. It was passed 
toward the end of the last Parliament in a successful effort to 
amend the Canada Elections Act.
<P>
	Had he been a member of the electoral reform committee which 
was an all-party committee established in this House that basically 
drafted Bill C-114, he would have been aware-
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> The hon. member opposite does not want to listen 
to this. I recognize that facts are always troublesome to members of 
the Reform Party.
<P>
	It was a government bill but the basic outline of the bill had been 
designed by a committee. No matter what the hon. member for 
Fraser Valley East has said, there had been a previous court 
decision on this very issue. The law as it existed before Bill C-114 
was passed provided that no person incarcerated in a prison had the 
right to vote. There had already been a decision, I believe by the 
Supreme Court of Canada, although my recollection is hazy. It has 
been some years since I have looked at this problem and I did not 
plan on speaking today, but hearing so many inaccuracies I thought 
I should try to correct the record.
<P>
	There had been a court decision concerning the previous law. It 
was for that reason that when Bill C-114 came along, the 
committee considered the issue of the right of inmates to vote and 
came to a decision.
<P>
	There was a referendum in Canada prior to the passage of Bill 
C-114. In that referendum because of the court decision throwing 
out the provision in the electoral law that prohibited all persons in 
prisons from voting, all federal inmates in Canada had the right to 
vote in that referendum. Some did exercise their franchise and 
voted in the referendum. If we listened to members of the Reform 
Party we would think the sky had fallen in but it did not. The 
referendum took place and those persons exercised certain voting 
rights.
<P>
	Then the committee studied the whole issue and decided to 
recommend there be a limited right to vote for persons incarcerated 
in prisons. My recollection of the committee report is hazy. I will 
tell the member that I am accurate within two years. I am surprised 
he has not looked at this because it might have been relevant to his 
speech, but as I say, facts are troublesome to members of the 
Reform Party. The fact is the committee recommended that all 
inmates who were serving a sentence of seven years or more be 
permitted to vote. In my recollection that was a unanimous 
recommendation from the committee.
<P>
<B>(1815 )</B>
<P>
	The Conservative government, notwithstanding the fact that it 
had a majority on the committee which agreed to that 
recommendation, decided that was too generous and so it opted for 
a two-year term. That is, every person serving a sentence of two 
years or more would be disqualified from voting. It meant that all 
federal inmates were automatically disqualified because by 
definition persons serving prison sentences in a federal institution 
must have been sentenced to two years or more.
<P>
	I recall very well the day the bill was debated because I was the 
electoral reform critic for the Liberal Party. I moved amendments 
to this section because I said at the time, and it is on the record, that 
this section would be thrown out by the courts as being too 
restrictive.
<P>
	Seven years was chosen based on the legal advice that the 
committee received at the time. We had to have something 
reasonable in terms of length in order to justify it under the charter 
of rights and freedoms. It was the committee's unanimous view 
that seven years was a reasonable time and could be defended 
before a court. It also constituted a reasonable restriction on the 
right to vote given in the charter which granted to every Canadian 
citizen the right to vote.
<P>
	The members of the Reform Party want to take that right away 
from citizens that they consider unworthy of the right. Once you 
start inching away at who is unworthy you can start to whittle away 
other rights.
<P>
	I know there will be some members in the House who might 
want to take away rights of members of the Bloc Quebecois to vote. 
I know there are some who would like to take away the right of 
members of the Reform Party to vote. I am not one of them. I am a 
firm believer in the  principle that citizens should have the right to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1692"> 1692 </A></B>
<P>
vote. That principle is stated in the Canadian Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms which I fully support.
<P>
	I moved amendments that would have taken away any 
restriction. I moved a seven-year amendment. I believe I moved a 
five-year amendment in an effort to get a compromise that I 
thought could be supported before the courts and that would win 
the support of members of the House. The Conservative House 
leader at the time, the Hon. Harvie Andre, would hear none of it. 
He was insisting on the two-year rule and it was that or nothing. 
Because the bill had a lot of other amendments in it besides this one 
item, we agreed to pass the bill.
<P>
	I remember the day we did it because some fancy agreements 
were made between the parties to get the bill through. I think it was 
a Friday afternoon before Easter or something like that. It was 
certainly a time before the House was to break for a period of at 
least a week.
<P>
	I remember the day. This particular clause caused great difficulty 
because in my view it was unconstitutional and would be found to 
be so by a court. And it was. The surprising thing is that the 
government is bothering to appeal this. In my view it is a waste of 
money. This clause is contrary to the Canadian Charter of Rights 
and Freedoms.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stinson:</B> We already know your view.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Obviously the hon. member shares my view in 
this regard, otherwise he would not have brought forward this 
motion. He wants to change the charter. He obviously shares my 
view that this is unconstitutional. He wants to fix it so that it will be 
constitutional. He wants to take away the right of all persons in 
prison to vote as I read it.
<P>
	It says a penitentiary and everyone knows what a penitentiary is. 
He says everyone in a psychiatric institution should not have a right 
to vote. A person who checked in because he or she needs treatment 
for depression would not be allowed to vote. That is the effect of 
the hon. member's motion. That is why the committee when it 
considered this matter was so reluctant to move in this area. It was 
because of the difficulty in choosing who should be voting and who 
should not. It was an extremely difficult question.
<P>
	The committee did not think it was something that it ought to 
make a decision on and ought to fix in the law. It was better to give 
the franchise on a broad spectrum, allow everybody to vote, than 
try to determine who is reasonable and who is not. If we went on 
reasonability I am sure we would have psychiatrists in here 
checking out some of the members of the House to see if they were 
suitable for voting.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stinson:</B> Yes, and you would be the first.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> The hon. member says I would be the first one. I 
think I would find more of the opinion that he  would be higher on 
list than where he put me on the list. I am happy to humour him by 
volunteering to undergo psychiatric observation for the purpose of 
determining whether I should vote or not if his rule ever became 
law.
<P>
	Fortunately the hon. member was unable to persuade the 
procedure and House affairs subcommittee to make this motion 
votable. I assume he went there and made his pitch and the 
subcommittee members decided that this motion ought not be 
votable. There were other motions that were more important and I 
can understand why. The hon. member is really nit-picking.
<P>
<B>(1820 )</B>
<P>
	There is a wide variety of opinions on whether or not inmates 
ought to have the right to vote. I am inclined to the view that they 
ought to have that right. I say that directly.
<P>
	Taking away the right to vote makes practically no difference. 
There are something like 12,000 inmates in federal penitentiaries 
in this country. In the referendum, very few of them exercised their 
right to vote. I do not have the precise figures, but I would guess it 
was something around a third of that group at the most who 
exercised their right to vote in the referendum.
<P>
	The same figure would apply in an election campaign. Most of 
these people would not be interested in voting and would not cast a 
vote. If they had the right, under the rules that were in place in the 
referendum which, no doubt, would apply during an election, their 
voting rights would be exercised in the area from which they came 
and not in the area where they are incarcerated.
<P>
	I have a very large prison population in my riding and, frankly, I 
would not mind if they were each voting in Kingston. That will not 
happen. They will be voting across the country. If the hon. member 
does not think he can persuade some of these people to vote for 
him, I can understand why he might oppose allowing them the right 
to vote.
<P>
	Most hon. members would find that in terms of the voting 
patterns of inmates, they reflect that of the general population. 
They are not a group that is going to vote as a block on any issue. In 
my view, the casting of 12,000 votes out of the millions that are 
cast in an election campaign would have practically no substantial 
effect on the outcome.
<P>
	I know it bothers hon. members opposite to think that people 
who have been sentenced to prison are somehow exercising this 
kind of democratic right. I am at a loss to understand how it hurts 
the rest of us.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
very pleased to speak to the motion presented by the hon. member, 
my colleague from Okanagan-Shuswap. I will read the motion 
again so that we know what we are debating today.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="1693"> 1693 </A></B>
<P>
	This is a motion that is meant to be a guideline for future 
legislation. We are not debating legislation now. The motion reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of the House, the government should consider the 
advisability of amending section 3 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms, according to the amending formula provided for in section 38 of the 
Constitution Act, 1982, which amendment would read as follows: ``Every 
citizen of Canada, except one who is (a) confined in a penitentiary, a prison, or a 
psychiatric institution, or (b) at large from a place referred to in paragraph (a), 
with or without a lawful excuse, has the right to vote in an election of Members 
of the House of Commons or of a legislative assembly and to be qualified for 
membership therein''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I would like to touch on three areas related to this motion. First, I 
would like to talk a little about how we got to where we are, how 
we got to be in the House debating whether or not prisoners should 
be allowed to vote. It seems absolutely incredible that things have 
slipped far and we have to be here debating this motion today.
<P>
	Second, I want to talk a little about what my constituents said 
when a court decided that prisoners should have the right to vote.
<P>
	Third, I would like to discuss briefly the issue of people who 
have committed so-called less serious crimes and whether they 
should be allowed to vote.
<P>
	What was the direct cause for the debate today was the decision 
in Sauvé <I>v.</I> the Chief Electoral Officer of Canada. There are many 
other things behind that and I will talk a little about a few of them.
<P>
	Prior to this decision, persons imprisoned in a correctional 
institute who were sentenced for two years or more could not vote 
in federal elections. In Sauvé, the court declared this law to be 
invalid because it violated the prisoners' right to vote under the 
charter and because there was no compelling justification for 
violating this right.
<P>
	I would like to touch briefly on the purpose for removing the 
right to vote in the first place. Some of the reasons given was the 
enhancement of civic responsibility, the respect for the rule of law 
and the imposition of an additional sanction on persons committing 
serious anti-social acts.
<P>
<B>(1825 )</B>
<P>
	The hon. member for Okanagan-Shuswap covered very well 
why prisoners should not be given the right to vote so I will not get 
into any more discussion on that. The question I have to ask is: Are 
these not far more important to society than the rights of individual 
prisoners? In other words, are these reasons given that disallow 
prisoners from voting not more important than the rights of the 
individual prisoner? I will talk a little bit more about that later.
<P>
	The Sauvé decision concludes that disenfranchising prisoners 
would make prisoners feel isolated from the community, would 
impede the subsequent reintegration of prisoners into the 
community and would prevent prisoners from experiencing any of 
the rehabilitative effects which flow from political participation. 
These are the main reasons given by Sauvé in his decision.
<P>
	Again, by removing the franchise from prisoners, Judge Sauvé 
reasoned that this could make prisoners feel isolated from the 
community. Well, prisoners are isolated from the community. The 
intent is for prisoners to be isolated from the community. That is 
part of the punishment and part of the deterrent for criminals to 
discourage them from committing crimes. The other reasons given 
by Judge Sauvé really do not make any more sense than that.
<P>
	When my constituents heard that the supreme court had ruled 
that all prisoners, including people like Clifford Olson, would have 
the right to vote, they could not believe it. Few issues had sparked 
this kind of reaction from my constituents as this issue had. People 
just could not believe it had happened. They asked me how we had 
come to this. They wanted to know how this kind of thing would 
happen and how we had arrived at this. They also wanted to know 
how the court in Canada was making the law. They asked me 
whether it was not my job as a member of Parliament and the job of 
the House of Commons to make the law.
<P>
	Those were some of the feelings, some of the questions and 
some of the reactions of my constituents to this decision. I wonder 
whether the constituents of the members across the floor, who are 
heckling and speaking out against the motion presented by my hon. 
colleague, reacted any differently. I doubt very much that they did. 
In fact, they have acknowledged that their constituents reacted in 
exactly the same way which does not surprise me.
<P>
	How have we arrived at this point? If we could pick a pivotal 
time in history, we would have to go back to 1972. It was a Liberal 
government. I have seen the quote in Hansard where Solicitor 
General Goyer said that the Government of Canada should change 
the main focus and the priorities of the justice system so that no 
longer was the protection of the citizenry the most important focus 
and the top priority. He said that we should change that focus so 
that the rights and rehabilitation of the criminal were top priority 
and only secondary were the rights of citizens to be safe and to feel 
safe in their homes. It is unbelievable. That is not a direct quote; it 
is a paraphrase but it is accurate.
<P>
	It was a Liberal solicitor general and the present Liberals have 
no different view from that. They still believe that the rights and 
rehabilitation of the criminal should be top priority. They are 
wrong and Canadians say they are wrong. The top priority should 
be the protection of our citizens in all cases.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="1694"> 1694 </A></B>
<P>
	Some people would argue that criminals who have committed 
so-called petty crimes should be given the right to vote while those 
who have committed more serious crimes should not have the 
right to vote.
<P>
	I want to refer to something that happened in New York City a 
few years back. William J. Bratton was a former police officer who 
became head of security for the New York subway system. Bratton 
enforced this kind of environment in the subway system. He said 
all criminals, including those who commit the crime of writing 
graffiti on walls or panhandling, should be treated as serious 
offenders. He cracked down on this so-called petty crime.
<P>
	By cracking down on petty crime Mr. Bratton lowered the 
serious crime as well in a dramatic way. When he later became the 
police commissioner of New York City he engaged the same policy 
to take petty crime seriously. When he did that the crime rate in 
New York City dropped dramatically.
<P>
	When considering this motion it is important that people who 
commit petty crimes know that even a petty crime is serious and is 
a good enough reason to lose the right to vote.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> There being no 
further speakers rising and as the motion has not been deemed 
votable, the time allotted for the consideration of Private Members' 
Business has now expired and the order is dropped from the Order 
Paper.
<P>
	It being 6.30 p.m., the House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 
10 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 6.31 p.m.)
