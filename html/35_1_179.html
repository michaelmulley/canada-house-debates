	<B>Mr. Jim Jordan (Leeds-Grenville, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
residents of my riding of Leeds-Grenville have expressed 
grave concern about skyrocketing health costs.
<P>
	Approximately 40 people from the community of 
Merrickville have signed a letter to me indicating their support 
for an increased availability of generic drugs as one way of 
reducing health care costs.
<P>
	It has been estimated that Canadians now have 36 per cent of 
their prescriptions filled with generic drugs. On average, 
generic drugs are 40 to 50 per cent less expensive. This saving is 
achieved without compromising the quality of health care.
<P>
	The greatest concern of seniors in today's economy is that 
they will not be able to afford proper health care when they get 
sick.
<P>
	Citizens of my riding are asking the drug manufacturers to 
respond to dwindling resources in health care by putting more 
prescribed drugs on the generic drug list.

	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, yesterday, when Marcel Beaudry, chairman of the 
National Capital Commission, appeared before the Standing 
Committee on Canadian Heritage, I made some exaggerated 
comments about the City of Hull to make the point to Mr. 
Beaudry that the NCC invariably passes over Hull in favour of 
Ottawa in the choices it makes.
<P>
	Taken out of context, my remarks offended the people of Hull. 
I would like to apologize to them in this House. It really was not 
my intention to hurt anyone.
<P>
	The tendency to inflated language, which sometimes afflicts 
those involved in politics, surfaced in my attempts to ensure that 
Mr. Beaudry, who makes no distinction between a Liberal Party 
fundraising dinner and a committee for a no vote fundraising 
dinner, really understood my explanation.
<P>
	To the people of Hull, I again offer my most sincere apologies.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of the constituents of 
Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt to congratulate film makers 
Alison Snowden and David Fine for winning an Oscar at the 
Academy Awards on Monday night for their film ``Bob's 
Birthday''. Their success demonstrates that Canadian film 
projects can compete effectively in the global marketplace.
<P>
	Reform members believe it is high time for the federal 
government to get out of the way and allow Canadian 
entrepreneurs to take their place as the producers of Canadian 
film projects.
<P>
	Canada has proven that we can win Oscars. Let us do it 
without federal funding. Canadian taxpayers want to know why 
the Liberals continue to spend dollars to make films. Our film 
industry can stand on its own two feet and should be supported 
by the investment from Canadian entrepreneurs, not 
government subsidies.
<P>
	This side of the House wants to congratulate ``Bob's 
Birthday'' for proving once again that Canadian film 
productions can prosper in a global marketplace.

	<B>Mrs. Eleni Bakopanos (Saint-Denis, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
this past weekend a sea of Greek, Canadian and Quebec flags

Greek origin celebrated Greek Independence Day.
<P>
	It was a tremendous turnout with people from every

that recognizes the significant  contributions that Canadians of 
Greek origin have made over the years.
<P>
	We live in a country that celebrates its diversity and for which 
it has become the envy of the world.

	We are all lucky to live in a country where diversity is

the world of generosity and open-mindedness.

	<B>Ms. Beth Phinney (Hamilton Mountain, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
today in the Ottawa <I>Citizen</I> a former adviser to Ed Broadbent 
stated that the NDP must either be revived or declared dead. I 
would like to respond by stating that it is my sad duty to declare 
the NDP dead.
<P>
	The New Democratic Party in the past has made valuable 
contributions to Canadian political debate. However its recent 
performance is showing it to be increasingly divided and 
irrelevant.
<P>
	The current NDP seems bereft of ideas for dealing with the 
challenges of the global economy. As the article stated, it has 
been a long time since a member of the NDP has had anything 
innovative to say about Canada's economy. To quote: ``They 
project no civic mission for the country as a whole, no 
intelligent reflection on the consequences of their mumblings 
and no credible grappling with contemporary issues''.
<P>
	Those hoping for renewal of the NDP are going to be 
disappointed. A party with no visionary candidates for its 
leadership is not in a position to begin to renew itself. No ideas, 
no leadership, no renewal, no party.

	<B>Mrs. Jane Stewart (Brant, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, one of the 
greatest barriers to international development efforts comes as a 
result of the devastating impact of buried land mines. I would 
like to draw to the attention of the House the fact that there are 
110 land mines buried in 62 countries across the world. Each 
month 800 people, many of them children, die as a result of 
stepping on one of these.
<P>
	The problem is getting worse because the international 
community can only clear about 100,000 mines in a year. In the 
same time frame nearly two million more are buried.
<P>
	Land mines obstruct post-war reconstruction. In Angola, 25 
per cent of the food production capacity is lost because farmers 
cannot get into the fields. In Mozambique, a serious drought has 
been exacerbated.
<P>
	Land mines do not stop for foreign aid. They do not stop for 
development and they do not stop for peace. They are always at 
war. I call on our government to work carefully and closely with 
our international partners to find the solution to this modern day 
plague.

Mohammed Abder Rahmani, the chief editor of the Algerian 
daily <I>El Moudjahid</I> was buried yesterday in Algiers. He is the 
35th journalist to be assassinated in Algeria in the unending 
struggle between Islamic and government forces.
<P>
	Mr. Abder Rahmani, the dean of the country's journalists, 
openly criticized the actions of armed Islamic groups. 
Intimidated and fearing for their lives, over 200 journalists have 
already fled the country.
<P>
	These murders of people who have the courage to express 
their opinions, their ideas and their values, risking their lives in 
doing so, is an affront to us all. All too often, we remain silent 
and unmoved in the face of obscurantism and intolerance. We 
must denounce Mr. Abder Rahmani's assassination and see to it 
that his killers are brought to justice.

	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, recently I received numerous suggestions for getting 
Canadians to buy government debt now held by foreigners. 
While tax concessions or special interest rates can bring home 
the bonds, Canada's vulnerability to falling and fluctuating 
exchange and interest rates will not be eliminated.
<P>
	First of all, the purchase of these government bonds from 
foreigners will crowd out other domestic securities. Therefore, 
net foreign indebtedness will not change.
<P>
	Second, the existing vulnerability would exist even if 
foreigners held no Canadian obligations at all. Both foreigners 
and Canadians could still speculate in spot and futures markets.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11185"> 11185 </A></B>
<P>
	The simple fact is that Canada's exchange and interest rates 
respond to news about the government's ability to service the 
debt. The downward trend in exchange rates will end, interest 
rates will stop rising and fluctuations will become less severe 
only when government deficits are eliminated.
<P>

cannot alter this basic truth.

	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it was interesting to note the governor of the Bank of Canada 
said he was opposed to the Tobin tax. He did not think there was 
anything wrong with the effect that money speculators were 
having on national and regional economies.
<P>
	I wonder whether this reflects the real position of the 
government. Over the last little while I have been asking the 
government to show some leadership at the G-7 in Halifax in 
trying to bring about a tax that might dampen speculation and in 
making some proposals for a new financial world order. It would 
be a sort of second Bretton Woods that would prevent money 
speculators from doing this kind of thing to our economy, to our 
dollar, or to anyone else for that matter.
<P>
	What is it the governor of the Bank of Canada has in common 
with the money speculators? I think it is this. We could ask these 
questions of both of them: Who elected them? Who elected the 
governor of the Bank of Canada to make the policies he makes? 
And who elected the money speculators?
<P>
	It is a democratic question. Who really runs the world, the 
money speculators and the banks or democratically elected 
parliaments like this one here?

	<B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Vaudreuil, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, a new 
study by two economists from the University of Calgary, soon to 
be published in the <I>Canadian Business Economic Journal</I>, 
shows that the Province of Quebec is the biggest winner in 
Canadian federalism.
<P>
	The researchers compared the total amount of money that 
each province paid to Ottawa in the form of taxes, etc, with the 
amount of money directly transferred to each province over the 
last 32 years.
<P>
	Between 1961 and 1992, Quebec has gotten $168 billion more 
out of the federal government than it put in in taxes and other 
payments to Ottawa. The province has netted an average annual 
bonus of $803 per person.
<P>
	Quebecers are not gullible. And the polls prove it. The 
opposition's lame arguments are not winning over flocks 
because federalism is working in Canada, despite its 
imperfections, and Quebec benefits from it.

but the whole region take pride in the city of Hull.
<P>

The region does not come under the responsibility of the

Liberals just do not understand. Their promise to reform the big 
bucks for life club, euphemistically known as the MP pension 
plan, has gone by the wayside. Despite the token changes to the 
plan, MPs' pensions still have unlimited protection against 
inflation and will grow in value at a rate twice the legal 
maximum in the private sector.
<P>
	If the Deputy Prime Minister retires in three years, she will 
stand to collect a cool $2.7 million until age 75. She fought to 
maintain her cushy pension plan, which comes courtesy of hard 
working Canadians.
<P>
	Perhaps she fought so hard for her pension because she 
thought she would be forced to keep her promise and resign. We 
all remember when the Deputy Prime Minister said she would 
quit if the GST was not scrapped by her government. Lucky for 
her, she has an understanding boss who will let her keep her job, 
despite the millions of Canadian taxpayers who despise both the 
GST and the outrageous MP pension plan.

Mr. Speaker, in the absence of the Prime Minister, my question

	The number of accusations is growing concerning the role 
played by the Liberals in the process of privatizing Pearson 
airport, including allegations that appeared recently in the 
<I>Financial Post</I> about a possible involvement of the Prime 
Minister himself. Today, an influential newspaper, the <I>Globe 
and Mail</I>, is demanding a public and independent inquiry to get 
all the facts on this murky business.
<P>
	In view of the troubling allegations that question the integrity 
of the Prime Minister and of his government, does the 
government intend to establish a genuine commission of inquiry 
into the contract for the privatization of Pearson airport, 
something 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11187"> 11187 </A></B>
<P>
the official opposition has been requesting for over a year and, 
in a major editorial, the <I>Globe and Mail</I> is asking for today?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, yesterday the Prime 
Minister himself made it clear that the allegations reported in 
the <I>Financial Post</I> were absolutely false, and there is nothing 
more to be said.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it could not have been that clear since it did not 
convince the <I>Globe and Mail</I>, which today responded with an 
editorial on the subject.
<P>
	I want to ask the Deputy Prime Minister whether she agrees 
that only a public inquiry, a genuine public inquiry, would make 
it possible to clear up any doubts about the circumstances 
around the contract to privatize Pearson and also about the 
decision of the government and of investigator Robert Nixon to 
keep under wraps, in other words, hide, an important report 
drafted in November 1993 by senior officials of the Department 
of Transport?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the 
Minister of Transport gave the facts on all the events that led up 
to this report. And if the Leader of the Opposition is so 
interested in the opinion of the <I>Globe and Mail</I>, why does he not 
call the referendum, as requested by this newspaper?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, we are not playing games here. The government's 
ethics are involved, and this is a very fundamental issue.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> Any government should be ashamed of using 
the Quebec referendum as a diversion, to prevent the truth from 
coming out.
<P>
	My question is straightforward, a question all Canadians and 
Quebecers are asking: Why does the Prime Minister stubbornly 
refuse to establish a commission of inquiry, if he or his 
government have nothing to hide?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I think the Leader of 
the Opposition has always been known as a man of honour. If he 
has any accusations to make against the Prime Minister, let him 
make them here in the House. And if he does not, it is dangerous 
to claim that certain facts were hidden, and coming from him, it 
is absolutely and totally irresponsible.

	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, allow me to start with a quote: ``Economic policies 
must not merely attack an individual problem in isolation from 
its costs in other areas. The Conservatives' single-minded fight 
against inflation resulted in a deep recession, three years 
without growth, declining incomes and skyrocketing 
unemployment''.

<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Finance. Are we to 
understand from this excerpt found in the Liberals' red book that 
the Minister of Finance does not agree with the statement made 
yesterday by the Bank of Canada governor, to the effect that 
fighting inflation through interest rate increases is the one and 
only priority of the Canadian monetary policy?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, there is no doubt 
that, when it formed the official opposition, the Liberal Party 
criticized the policy of the Bank of Canada governor of the day.
<P>
	The country was going through a period of high 
unemployment and economic decline, so we certainly had to 
comment on the monetary policy of the time. But Canada is now 
first among the G-7 countries in terms of growth, and it has just 
created 433,000 new jobs. Clearly, the situation is now 
drastically different.
<P>
	I do support the statement made yesterday by the governor of 
the Bank of Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Minister of Finance is providing the very same 
answer as his Conservative predecessors, and he is 
implementing exactly the same monetary policy. The minister 
kept tearing up his shirts when the Conservatives applied the 
medicine which he is now pouring down Canadians' throats.
<P>
	Does the minister realize that, by supporting a policy which is 
only geared to fight inflation, he is deliberately hurting job 
creation, and, consequently, he accepts unemployment rates of 
9.5 per cent in Canada and close to 12 per cent in Quebec, where 
417,000 people are without work?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, again, many new 
jobs were created in Quebec, during the months of January and 
February. In fact, even the Premier of that province confirmed 
that job creation in Quebec was very strong, thus contradicting 
the comment which the hon. member just made.
<P>
	However, the issue is whether or not the Bloc Quebecois 
accepts the fact that we must set objectives in the fight against 
inflation. Our objectives are in the one to three per cent range. If 
the hon. member is not happy with them, then let him tell us 
which inflation rate he is prepared to accept.

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Anne-Marie Doyle may be gone from the Somalia 
inquiry but a serious unanswered question remains about how 
she ended up on the panel in the first place.
<P>
	The Minister of National Defence has told the House that he 
personally named Ms. Doyle to the panel after reviewing the 
résumés of potential commissioners. Therefore, he should have 
no trouble in answering my question.
<P>
	Who put Anne-Marie Doyle's name on the minister's list of 
potential commissioners?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence 
and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I had 
occasion to review the transcript of <I>Hansard</I> and this question 
was put yesterday. I felt that I had answered it to the best of my 
ability. Perhaps I was not explicit enough for the hon. member 
for Calgary Southwest. I will attempt to clarify the situation so 
that he is satisfied.
<P>
	I said yesterday that the name of Anne-Marie Doyle had come 
to my attention as someone who had served with great 
distinction at the OECD. It was I who put her name forward. I 
felt that she was a good choice.
<P>
	Before I gave that answer, the hon. member asked if I could 
assure the House that the former deputy minister, Bob Fowler, 
had nothing to do with framing the terms of reference of the 
inquiry and played no role whatsoever in proposing the name of 
Anne-Marie Doyle as a possible panel member. I answered 
those questions but perhaps not clearly enough for the hon. 
member. In both cases the answer is no.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the minister just said that this name was brought to his 
attention.
<P>
	My question is, who brought this potential commissioner's 
name to the your attention?
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Colleagues, I would remind you please always 
to address questions to the Chair rather than directly to one 
another and your answers the same way.
<P>
<B>(1425 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence 
and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I said 
yesterday and I say again today, quoting from <I>Hansard</I>: ``The 
name of Anne-Marie Doyle had come to my attention as 
someone who had served with great distinction at the OECD''.
<P>
	As ministers, we are aware of many distinguished public 
servants working for the government now and also past public 
servants. I thought it would be good for the composition of the 
inquiry to have someone from the bench as the chair; someone 
from the field of journalism  who was retired but who had some 
credibility as a member, and also someone who knew the 
workings of the government but specifically how foreign policy 
and defence policy were discharged by the government. I started 
looking at those kinds of people within the public service as well 
as former public servants.
<P>
	I knew of Ms. Doyle's previous involvement in the Privy 
Council office as someone who had that particular dossier. 
When I asked for greater details about her career, it became 
obvious that she was someone of outstanding reputation who 
could discharge that position.
<P>
	Had she continued to serve, I believe she would have 
discharged her obligations fully to the best of her abilities and as 
a credit to the commission.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the minister's refusal to answer the question 
undermines confidence in the inquiry.
<P>
	Yesterday the minister also stated that the Judge Advocate 
General helped him to draft the terms of reference of the Somali 
inquiry.
<P>
	As the minister knows, the Judge Advocate General works 
with, and some would say for, the chief of defence staff and the 
deputy minister of defence. In effect the Judge Advocate 
General is part of the same military hierarchy that the inquiry is 
to investigate.
<P>
	How big a hand has the national defence hierarchy had in 
drafting the terms of reference of the Somali inquiry? How can 
Canadians be assured that this involvement has not already 
prejudiced the inquiry?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence 
and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member for Calgary Southwest displays a profound ignorance of 
the National Defence Act.
<P>
	First, the Judge Advocate General is appointed by the Prime 
Minister of Canada. It is an order in council appointment 
because that person must be independent in the advice he or she 
gives to ministers. That person is the chief legal officer in the 
Canadian Armed Forces.
<P>
	Under the terms of the National Defence Act that person 
reports on a day to day basis to the Minister of National Defence. 
It was quite appropriate for me in the course of the last year to 
discuss aspects of the Somalia case with the Judge Advocate 
General, as his role under the National Defence Act explicitly 
says that he should be the one giving legal advice to the minister.
<P>
	I verified certain aspects with the Judge Advocate General 
this morning because I wanted to make sure that anything I say 
on the floor of the House of Commons is absolutely and totally 
the truth. The government has the interests of all Canadians in 
mind in getting to the bottom of the events in Somalia in 1993.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11189"> 11189 </A></B>

	The Judge Advocate General confirmed that the former

of the terms of reference. They were submitted to the Privy 
Council office. They were reviewed by the Department of 
Justice and everyone stands by them.

	<B>Mr. Michel Guimond 
(Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
Monday, in reply to a question in the House from the Leader of 
the Opposition, the Minister of Transport said that his decision 
to delay Air Canada's access to Hong Kong market was 
connected to a similar decision involving Canadian's access to 
the German market. These are two separate issues. In the case of 
Hong Kong, negotiations were successful. Air Canada said it 
was ready to start operations this summer and has even 
negotiated landing slots.
<P>
	My question is directed to the Minister of Transport. In the 
case of Hong Kong, could the Minister tell us what other 
reasons, aside from Canadian's access to the German market, 
would prevent him from letting Air Canada start its operations 
on this market in the summer of 1995, since everything is in 
place?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member knows perfectly well that 
negotiations with the Hong Kong airport authorities were 
concluded only a few days ago.
<P>
<B>(1430) </B>
<P>
	When we decided to establish a level of 300,000 passengers 
before identifying a second destination, we made sure that there 
would be two locations on this planet where this rule would 
come into force this year: in Germany and Hong Kong.
<P>
	As I have already pointed out, for the past 14 months Air 
Canada has had access to Japan, a market this airline has coveted 
for a very long time. It is now able to prepare for its arrival in 
Hong Kong, another very important market. For Canadian 
Airlines International, which needs landing rights in Germany 
and other destinations in Asia, it is also very important to be able 
to plan ahead and have some certainty when agreements are 
negotiated, not only with these countries but also with the 
financial institutions that support these airlines.
<P>
	I still say that, after all, Air Canada president Hollis Harris 
said publicly that he appreciated the work done by a government 
that opened these markets to Air Canada for the first time in its 
history.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Guimond 
(Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
would the minister not agree that it was his eagerness to 
accommodate Canadian that led him to delay Air Canada's 
access to the Hong Kong market, in the process delaying the 
creation of 500 jobs with this airline,  including a large number 
of jobs at headquarters in Montreal and at the Dorval 
maintenance centre?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Canadian aviation industry would explain to my 
hon. friend that the progress we have made in the last 14 or 15 
months is unparalleled in Canadian aviation history.
<P>
	We have been able to arrange a situation in which as of the end 
of this year every allocation of an air route in this country will be 
absolutely transparent. There will be conditions and criteria that 
allow for Canadian Airlines International and Air Canada to 
plan, to purchase aircraft, to lease aircraft, to do their marketing 
in an atmosphere of certainty unheard of in the aviation industry 
in Canada.
<P>
	The proof of that is even before we announced the second 
designation based on the 300,000 passenger level, Air Canada 
had already indicated it was in the process of hiring nearly 1,000 
new employees: pilots, attendants and people who work in 
maintenance and on ground activities.
<P>
	I understand the hon. member's distaste for the progress we 
have been able to make. The airline industry in Canada is in 
better shape today than it has been for the last 20 years.

Experts from the SPCUM, the Quebec police force and the

for a year.

	Rather than simply pay lip service, as he did yesterday, how 
can the Minister of Justice hide behind the current provisions of

am looking at the question, as is the Solicitor General.
<P>
	Our departments are examining amendments to the code that 
might be of help. When we conclude that assessment we will 
respond. In the meantime, I have invited the hon. member if he

	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr.

	The police have asked us to consider an amendment to the

organizations. That is not something one does with the snap of a 
finger or without taking care with the language.
<P>
	We also have to be concerned about motorcycle groups, for 
example, that are not criminal, that are quite legitimate. We also 
have to bear in mind that police already have some 800 sections 
of the Criminal Code to deal with today.
<P>
	We will look at the question seriously. We will do the

<P>
	With Turkey continuing its military offensive against the 
Kurds in northern Iraq, the Canadian government still has no 
official policy on the matter. Moreover, as the government 
embarks on negotiations with Turkey for the sale of CF-5s, 
Germany is suspending delivery of military materiel destined 
for Turkey.
<P>
	My question is very simple: Does the government intend to 
follow Germany's example and suspend all deliveries or sales of 
military materiel to Turkey and to break off negotiations on the 
sale of the CF-5s to Turkey?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence 
and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
answered in the House a couple of times that there are no formal 
negotiations going on. The Turkish government has expressed 
some interest in the disposition of the CF-5s. This is not unusual 
since a number of years ago it received surplus planes from us.
<P>
	As a NATO ally we have to entertain at least its interest. There 
are no formal negotiations going on. There is no deal pending. 
The Minister of Foreign Affairs has given the House every 
assurance that should we at any time sell any armaments, those 
sales will be under the strictest of controls.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>]

	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, you

the minister's statement that negotiations are being held, but not 
formally.
<P>
	In view of the seriousness of the present situation, and rather 
than continue waffling about how to treat the Turkish offensive 
against the Kurds, will the government not acknowledge that it 
should submit this delicate matter to NATO and to the UN

	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker,

	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the fact is that the 
judgment has been appealed. We are taking the position in the 
Court of Appeal that the judgment was in error.
<P>
	With great respect to the hon. member, there is nothing at all 
inappropriate about the government saying that it disagrees with 
the court judgment, and it is appealing it.
<P>
	We will be making our arguments to the appellate court and 
we are confident that those arguments will prevail.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this confirms what I am saying.
<P>
	The decision is being appealed by the Alberta government, 
not the federal government. It is my understanding that the 
federal government has not even applied for intervener status. 
Yet the minister says and continues to say: ``We will pursue the 
appeal with every confidence that we shall win it''.
<P>
	The Attorney General of Canada has publicly vowed to pursue 
and win the appeal. How can the defendant ever get a fair trial?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, to begin with, what is 
at issue is the validity of an instrument created under federal 
jurisdiction. I am very confident that the federal interpretation 
of the law will prevail.
<P>
	Second, the Alberta government, as the hon. member has just 
pointed out, agrees with the position. It is taking the appeal. It 
will argue the appeal and it will contend that the judgment 
should not stand.
<P>
	Third, there is a world of difference between commenting on 
the facts of the case implicating the guilt or innocence of the 
accused person, which would be improper, and commenting on 
the legitimacy of a piece of legislation before the court on a 
legal argument as to validity. There is a world of difference and 
nothing improper at all has occurred.

	<B>Mrs. Dianne Brushett (Cumberland-Colchester, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Health.
<P>
	A recent Statistics Canada study indicates that women in 
Cumberland county have the highest rate of hysterectomies in 
the country. Because the rate is two to three times higher than 
the national average, because it is a costly invasive surgery 
removing the uterus, will the Minister of Health investigate to 
determine if these alarming statistics are unnecessary surgery?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, phenomena such as this occur across the country. 
While the issue of medical practice is largely a responsibility of 
provincial governments, the federal government has taken some 
initiatives in this regard.
<P>
	In collaboration with provincial governments as well as 
national medical groups, Health Canada has developed 
guidelines for Canadian clinical practice. As well, the National 
Forum on Health is taking a close look at why patterns of 
medical practice differ across the country.
<P>
	We are launching and have launched centres of excellence 
that will be looking at the entire issue of women's health. The 
government is determined to address issues of women's health 
that have been ignored for a very long time.

	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Canadian Heritage. In the midst of 
the Ginn Publishing controversy, the heritage minister, we will 
recall, proved to be incapable of adequately looking after the 
interests of Canadian publishers. One year later, the minister 
does it again, announcing cuts in excess of 33 per cent to 
Canadian publishing development assistance and 71 per cent to 
grants for the distribution of new publications.
<P>
	How can the minister justify such extensive cuts, which will 
hurt publishers, after his gross mishandling of the Ginn 
Publishing issue?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage, 
Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, let us not get ahead of ourselves here. We are 
in the process of reviewing programs, to see how they can be 
amalgamated to increase efficiency, and the stakeholders will be 
consulted in the process.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, how 
can the minister claim to protect publishers when he is chopping 
programs specifically designed to offset losses resulting from 
the elimination of the postal rate on books and the introduction 
of the GST, two measures that are still in effect?
<P>
<B>(1455) </B>

the Minister of Defence intend to do about the ten armed forces 
suicides at Valcartier? What is he doing to get to the heart of  this 
distressing situation?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence 
and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, when the 
matter of suicides in the armed forces was raised some months 
ago, I looked into the matter and discussed it with the chief of 
defence staff. We have found that the rate of suicides is lower in 
the armed forces than it is for the population as a whole.
<P>
	There has been some concern recently about a number of 
suicides, specifically with troops coming back from Bosnia and 
Croatia. I have asked for more information on it to see whether 
or not there is a disturbing trend.
<P>
	Any suicide, any death is tragic. The hon. member talks about 
morale and leadership in the armed forces. As a former 
distinguished general officer in the armed forces, I would hope 
he would discuss with his colleagues ways in which they can 
help to assist with morale and leadership in the armed forces, not 
by the comments in their questions.
<P>
	The morale and leadership in the armed forces are a hell of a 
lot better than they are in the Reform Party.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would be more than delighted to help him or the 
troops directly in any way I can.
<P>
	In the meantime my question through you, Mr. Speaker, to the 
minister is: What are you doing specifically?
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I am sure the member would want to rephrase 
his question.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ringma:</B> In that case, Mr. Speaker, I have a 
supplementary. Canadian soldiers and their families know that 
death is an occupational hazard. It is expected in the course of 
duty, but when it takes the form of ten suicides, some sort of 
explanation is necessary.
<P>
	What steps will the minister take to reassure the families of 
the other soldiers that he has the situation in hand and will 
initiate a plan of action to resolve the problems in the armed 
forces?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Michael Collenette (Minister of National 
Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
the suicide rate is lower in the armed forces than it is in the 
general population.

	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, world leaders are beginning to meet in Berlin. I 
believe the Minister of the Environment will be travelling next 
week to Berlin to participate in talks aimed at stabilizing levels 
of greenhouse gases now threatening the earth's climate.
<P>
	Most of the world's largest per capita emitters of greenhouse 
gases including Canada have filed shameful reports indicating 
that they will not meet the commitments they agreed to at the 
Rio Climate Summit in 1992.
<P>
	Given that it is clear the world is facing an issue with uniquely 
large and irreversible consequences and the delegates in Berlin 
cannot afford to waste the opportunity to begin turning the ship 
around, why is it that Canada's wimpy actions on climate change 
are not as forceful as our resolve to preserve the fish stocks off 
the Atlantic coast?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, first I thank the hon. 
member for the question. It happens to be one of the few 
opposition questions on an issue which actually threatens the 
planet far more greatly than any threat for even the fish stocks.
<P>
<B>(1500 ) </B>
<P>
	In fact, the death of the cod stock is partly as a result of the 
global warming effect which has seen the level of the planet's 
temperature increase by three degrees since the beginning of 
time. We expect another three degree increase in the next 50 
years.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Copps:</B> Members across the way may not be interested, 
but the member is right. We need a stronger position and we 
need a stronger international position.
<P>
	We are hoping that with the forward thinking proposal we are 
bringing forward on technology twinning we will be able to 
achieve the dual goals of helping developing countries meet 
their global warming reductions utilizing Canadian technology, 
but above all making sure that we meet our goals not only for 
stabilization but also for the reduction of this deadly problem.

<P>
	The hon. member asked me about the registration of firearms. 
In response, I referred to Statistics Canada numbers. I said that 
in Saskatchewan the fatality rate from firearms is 50 per cent 
higher than the national average and the suicide rate from 
firearms is twice the national average. I was wrong.
<P>
	The statistics are, when correctly stated, that the firearms 
suicide rate is one-third higher than the national average in 
Saskatchewan. It is the rate of death from accidents with 
firearms that is twice the national average. Overall, firearms 
fatalities in Saskatchewan are 25 per cent higher than the 
national average. I shall furnish the hon. member with a copy of 
these statistics which bear out those numbers.

<P>
	The petitioners request that Parliament support laws which 
will severely punish all violent criminals that use weapons in the 
commission of a crime, support new Criminal Code firearms 
control provisions which recognize and protect the rights of 
law-abiding citizens to own and use recreational firearms, and 
request that Parliament support legislation that will repeal and

	<B>Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
accordance with Standing Order 36 I would like to present a 
petition from the residents of my constituency of Athabasca, 
mainly from the Westlock area.
<P>
	The petition requests that Parliament support laws that 
severely punish all violent criminals who use weapons in the 
commission of a crime; support new Criminal Code firearms 
control provisions which recognize and protect the right of 
law-abiding citizens to own and use firearms; and support

<P>
	In it the petitioners call on Parliament to oppose any

<P>
	The first group deals with euthanasia and is signed by 151 
people in my riding. The petitioners pray that Parliament ensure 
the present provisions of the Criminal Code of Canada 
prohibiting assisted suicide be enforced vigorously and that 
Parliament make no changes in the law which would sanction or

	<B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, the second 
group of petitions deal with the release of repeat sex offenders. 
The petitioners pray and call on Parliament to enact legislation 
that would enable residents to be notified when repeat sex 
offenders are released into the community.
<P>
	This legislation would make the safety of our children a 
priority.

	<B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, the third 
and final group of petitions is signed by 209 people from my 
riding and other parts of New Brunswick.
<P>
	The petitioners pray and request Parliament not to amend the 
human rights code, the Canadian Human Rights Act or the 
charter of rights and freedoms in any way which would tend to 
indicate societal approval of same sex relationships or of 
homosexuality, including amending the Criminal Code to 
include in the prohibited grounds of discrimination the

<P>
<B>(1520 ) </B>
<P>
	In both petitions, the petitioners make it known that they are 
overburdened with taxation due to high government spending.

government spending instead of increasing taxes and implement 
a taxpayer protection act to limit federal spending.

	<B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have one 
petition to present today and it says in part that the Minister of 
Transport has directed the Canadian coast guard to proceed with 
detailed plans for a program of unmanning all west coast light 
stations. The savings to the coast guard will be insignificant and 
the impact on the users of these services will be considerable 
due to the loss of local weather services, assistance in search and 
rescue and the manned presence on this remote rugged coastline.
<P>
	Therefore, the petitioners humbly pray and call on Parliament 
to revoke this directive immediately and request a complete and 
thorough public inquiry in the province of B.C. into the need for 
the manned light stations on the west coast.

	I placed a question on the Order Paper on October 4, 1994. 
That was 179 days ago. I am seeking information on financial 
assistance provided to each federal riding in Atlantic Canada by 
ACOA.
<P>
	It is my understanding that the government tries to answer all 
Order Paper questions within the 45-day period. However 179 
days is an unacceptable length of time to respond to my 
question. It indicates either an inability or an unwillingness to 
answer.

an answer to the question I asked over five months ago?

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="ELECTORALBOUNDARIESREADJUSTMENTACT,<BR>1995">ELECTORAL  BOUNDARIES  READJUSTMENT  ACT,<BR>
1995</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Raymond Chan (for Leader of the Government in the 
House of Commons, Lib.)</B> moved that Bill C-69, an act to 
provide for the establishment of electoral boundaries 
commissions and the readjustment of electoral boundaries, be 
read the third time and passed.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew (Secretary of State (Training 
and Youth), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I 
rise in the House today to speak to Bill C-69, an act to provide 
for the establishment of electoral boundaries commissions and 
the readjustment of electoral boundaries.
<P>
<B>(1525 ) </B>
<P>
	I greet this bill from a different perspective than has been 
presented to the House before. I would like to speak specifically 
to clause 30(a) which directly impacts on my riding of Western 
Arctic.
<P>
	Once this legislation is enacted, four more communities will 
be added to my riding. The population of my riding will increase 
by over 1,700 people. The land mass will be increased by 
approximately 200,000 square kilometres. The increase in land 
to the Western Arctic is larger than many of the ridings in 
Canada. This makes my riding the second largest in terms of 
land mass.
<P>
	It is a riding with very few roads. As a matter of fact, 90 per 
cent of my riding is not accessible by road. In the summer people 
can commute by boat along the Mackenzie River, but in the long 
winter the only forms of travel are by plane or on a sometimes 
rather treacherous winter road in very inclement conditions.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11200"> 11200 </A></B>
<P>
	I am not here today to speak on the enormity of my riding and 
the difficulty in travelling from one area to another. Those 
concerns go without saying. It is what people would call part of 
the turf.
<P>
	However, I would like to take this opportunity to welcome the 
four communities of Sachs Harbour, Holman Island, Paulatuk 
and Tuktoyaktuk into my riding and to encourage greater 
participation by aboriginal people, women and youth in the 
electoral process in both the north and in Ottawa.
<P>
	The four communities which will be entering Western Arctic 
are Inuvialuit communities. They are represented by the premier 
of the Northwest Territories in the legislature. The riding is 
named Nunakput. It is with great enthusiasm that I will be 
working closer with her to best represent these areas. All four of 
these communities are on the coast of the Arctic Ocean, the third 
great ocean in Canada.
<P>
	These communities are currently within Nunatsiaq. Once the 
redistricting is done they will be within Western Arctic riding. 
However, they have been well served by my colleague, the 
member for Nunatsiaq, who has served the communities since 
1988 when he was first elected to Parliament.
<P>
	The population of these four communities is composed 
largely of Inuvialuit people. Inuvialuit are western Inuit. They 
are distinct from the Inuit of the eastern Arctic. The Inuvialuit 
are descendants of the Karngmalit or Mackenzie Inuit who lived 
in a rich hunting territory containing woods, barrens and seas. 
This area contains much of the original Thule culture with its 
emphasis on the beluga as the main source of food, bone, fuel 
and hide.
<P>
	Young people make up at least one-third of the population in 
all of these communities. They are a very young, growing set of 
communities. The cost of living in these communities, as with 
all northern communities, is very high. The living cost 
differential between Edmonton, Alberta in the south and these 
communities is between 185 and 190. This means that an item of 
food which costs $1 in Edmonton will cost between $1.85 and 
$1.90 in these communities.
<P>
	Although there are many similarities between the four 
Inuvialuit communities, each has its own distinctive history. 
One of these communities, Sachs Harbour or Ikaahuk, is located 
on the most westerly island of the Canadian Arctic archipelago, 
Banks Island. Archaeologists have found Thule house ruins in 
several places on Banks Island, indicating that Inuit lived on 
those islands for hundreds and hundreds of years.
<P>
	Sachs Harbour was named after the ship <I>Mary Sachs</I> of the 
Canadian Arctic expedition in 1913. Permanent occupation did 
not begin until 1929 when three Delta Inuit families sailed in 
their schooners to Sachs Harbour. The major attraction of the 
island was white fox. For more than 50 years the island has been 
considered one of the best trapping areas in the entire North 
American  Arctic. The Banks Island people were particularly 
well off and well educated during the Delta fur trade boom of the 
thirties. The first Inuk doctor was a member of the well known 
Banks Island Carpenter family. Education has remained a 
powerful source in Sachs Harbour.
<P>
<B>(1530) </B>
<P>
	According to the 1991 census, with a population of 85 people 
over the age of 15, 30 had a university education or 
non-university education with a diploma. The people of Sachs 
Harbour have remained very self-sufficient in comparison to 
many Arctic communities. They have continued to trap. 
Outfitting for big game hunts for polar bear and musk ox also 
takes place. Sachs Harbour has an 88 per cent participation rate 
in the labour force and has the largest average income of the four 
communities which in 1991 was $25,000 plus.
<P>
	Holman Island, another community to be added to my riding, 
is situated on the Diamond Jenness Peninsula on the western 
side of Victoria Island. Victoria Island was the ancestral 
homeland of the Copper Inuit. During the winter they hunted on 
Banks Island and in the summer travelled to the centre of 
Victoria Island to hunt caribou. The people of Holman were 
taught print making by Reverend Henri Tardi, who came from 
Viviers, France to the settlement as an Oblate missionary in 
1939.
<P>
	In 1961 the Holman Inuit Cooperative was formed to retail the 
output and print making is now a major source of the 
community's income. Among the Holman artists the late Helen 
Kalvak is the most well known. Holman has a participation rate 
in the labour force of only 59 per cent.
<P>
	Paulatuk is another community. This is interesting for all 
Canadians. Canadians seldom ask questions about the north. 
This is a great opportunity to let them know the constituency in 
which we exercise a democratic franchise is one that includes 
these wonderful communities. Paulatuk, the other community to 
be added to my riding after the redistricting, is located between 
the seashore and an inland lake on the Arctic coast. The name 
Paulatuk derives from the Inuktitut term for soot of coal. Coal is 
found in the vicinity and was used by the Inuvialuit inhabitants 
for heating.
<P>
	The original inhabitants of the Paulatuk area suffered greatly 
from the effects of many of the outside influences brought in by 
some of the outside whalers. However, the early and extensive 
contact the people had with many of the European cultures 
meant they were more independent of trader and missionary 
influence than Inuit to the east. Many could do business in 
English and read and write their own language in Roman script.
<P>
	Paulatuk is known for its carvers. The largest segment of the 
population in Paulatuk is between zero and fourteen years of 
age. There is a 14 per cent rate of participation in the labour 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11201"> 11201 </A></B>
<P>
force. Of those who are in the labour force 30 per cent are 
unemployed. The average income in Paulatuk is about $17,000.
<P>
	The fourth community is Tuktoyaktuk. It is the final 
community which will be added to my riding. Tuktoyaktuk 
means resembling a caribou. Legend has it that when caribou 
were plentiful a woman looked on them as they waded into the 
water and the caribou were petrified. Reefs resembling caribou 
have been seen at low tide.
<P>
	Tuktoyaktuk was traditionally the home of the whale hunting 
Mackenzie Inuit. This community is the largest of the four 
communities and the most ethnically diverse, although the 
Inuvialuit make up almost 90 per cent of the population.
<P>
	Tuktoyaktuk is now the sea edge base for oil and gas 
exploration in in the Beaufort Sea. I have many fond memories 
of Tuktoyaktuk. As a young teacher in the early seventies I 
spend three years teaching there. Over half of the population, 15 
years and over, have not completed secondary education.
<P>
	These communities are diverse. The land around those 
communities is awesome, serene and wonderful. The sea life, 
the animal life and the marine make-up and the ecosystem of 
that area are a tourist's dream. It is actually an eco-tourist 
dream. It is something that people from all around the world pay 
a lot of money to see. It is worth every penny.
<P>
<B>(1535) </B>
<P>
	In winter and late fall we can see the aureole borealis that 
everyone talks about. In the summer we can stand in some of the 
communities and see beluga whales from houses facing the 
Arctic Ocean. It really is quite a sight to behold. In winter the 
land is covered with snow and people go out throughout that 
season to enjoy the community.
<P>
	The member of Parliament who represents the area, the hon. 
member for Nunatsiaq, has been very honoured and very 
gracious in representing the area. I look forward to having these 
additional communities added to the western Arctic riding once 
the whole issue of redistribution and readjustment has been 
completed.
<P>
	Historically the electoral boundaries were drawn without any 
consideration of how they would impact on the aboriginal 
communities in the area. The western Arctic was no different. 
The Inuvialuit who lived in the most northwestern area of 
Canada were split between two federal electoral districts. In 
1984 the Inuvialuit became the first aboriginal group north of 
the 60th parallel to sign a comprehensive land claim agreement.
<P>
	However, the Inuvialuit who reside in the six coastal 
communities remain split in two different federal electoral 
districts. After recently having celebrated the 10th anniversary 
of the signing of the historic final agreement and the passage of 
Bill C-69, the Inuvialuit will finally all be included in the same 
electoral district.
<P>
	There is a very interesting point in the documents put forward 
about the impediments to electoral participation. They noted the 
Inuit did not receive the right to vote until 1950. No ballot boxes 
were placed in Inuit hamlets until 1962. That was unfortunate. It 
is unthinkable in this day in age that any citizen of this country 
would not be able to exercise the right to vote in a democracy 
such as we have, in future elections. However, that was the case.
<P>
	These communities will provide a positive contribution to the 
already diverse riding of the western Arctic. Now the Inuvialuit 
people from Inuvik and Aklavik will be together with the other 
four Inuvialuit communities of Sachs Harbour, Paulatuk, 
Holman Island and Tuktoyaktuk. They will be together in one 
federal riding of the western Arctic.
<P>
	In years past we had the Lortie commission look at a number 
of issues regarding electoral reform. One I was much seized 
with, along with some of my colleagues, was in the names of 
Senator Len Marchand, former member of Parliament Gene 
Rheaume, and someone who is very capable and who has helped 
us, Mr. Marc LeClair, who worked with the aboriginal Liberal 
commission in looking at the impediments that faced aboriginal 
people systemically and structurally in terms of the districts and 
the distribution of seats in the House, and in looking at some of 
the historical impediments. It made for a very interesting 
exercise.
<P>
	We undertook a subcommittee for the royal commission and 
were successful in meeting a number of groups across the 
country that spoke to the issues. It was quite extensive.
<P>
	In the world wars aboriginal people were able to fight for their 
country. They loved this country and wanted to contribute. They 
made a great sacrifice. Upon their return to this country they did 
not have the right to vote until the 1960s. They could lay their 
life down for their country, they could honour their country, but 
they were not given the opportunity as other Canadians to 
exercise their democratic right to vote.
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
	That was a great inequity. These were some of the things we 
dealt with. It should be of interest to some of the people in the 
House that there have been 13 self-identifying aboriginal 
people elected to the House of Commons, including myself, the 
member for Nunatsiaq and the member for Churchill.
<P>
	These 13 out of over 11,000 members have been elected since 
Confederation. Ten of the aboriginal people were elected this 
century. Only three have been elected in districts where 
aboriginal people do not constitute a majority.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11202"> 11202 </A></B>
<P>
	Six have come from my part of the territory where aboriginal 
people are a majority, in the Northwest Territories. The 
selection came from Churchill with an aboriginal population of 
42 per cent.
<P>
	It is astounding to think only 11 out of 11,000 people have 
been aboriginal. This is the home of the first peoples along with 
all other Canadians.
<P>
	It is an esteemed privilege as a member of Parliament to be 
able to speak on behalf of the people who put us here, to come 
forward with a conglomeration of their views, with their 
convictions, their passion, their vision, their beliefs about this 
country.
<P>
	Only 13 people of aboriginal descent have been able to do that 
since Confederation. One of those people was Louis Riel and 
that is a whole other story. We will not get into that. It is quite an 
interesting set of circumstances to think about.
<P>
	My reason for standing is to address Bill C-69 and encourage 
more aboriginal people, more women and more youth to get 
actively involved in the electoral process.
<P>
	Aboriginal people make up to 16 of the 24 seats in the 
Northwest Territory legislature. Unfortunately the 
representation of people in the House of Commons is not nearly 
anywhere as representative. There are only three members, 
ironically. They are all in the Liberal Party.
<P>
	That does not stop the other parties from including aboriginal 
people. Look at the membership of the opposition. It has huge 
aboriginal populations in the north of its province. In James Bay 
there are some of the most outstanding aboriginal leaders in the 
name of Billy Diamond, Matthew Coon-Come, Ted Moses and 
Chief Violet Pachanos.
<P>
	A lot of aboriginal people in that area could stand with any 
other member of Parliament from that province and be proud. In 
other areas, northern B.C., we have predominant members from 
the Liberal Party as well as from the Reform Party. We have 
many New Democrats. We could easily elect in those areas, in 
the upper places where we have the Gitksan and Wet'suwet'en 
and where we could have aboriginal people represent not just 
themselves and their people but non-aboriginal people.
<P>
	There cannot be a false assumption that because one is of this 
race or this background one cannot represent fairly other people 
from other races as well. The doors are open. The opportunities 
are there.
<P>
	I encourage the participation of youth, women, people from 
ethnic minorities, the disabled. There is in this House of 
democracy, in this community of communities, in this home for 
true democratic practices and vision a home and a seat for 
everyone who wants to put their name forward who is capable of 
being able to come here and speak on behalf of the people who 
elect them.
<P>
	Women who make up 52 per cent of the population are not 
representative in either the territorial legislature or the House of 
Commons. In the Northwest Territories there are only three 
female members of the legislature, one of whom is the premier. 
What a premier, what an outstanding member of the government 
we have in the name of the premier of the Northwest Territories.
<P>
<B>(1545 ) </B>
<P>
	We in the Northwest Territories are proud of the premier when 
she goes around the world, when she goes to parliament or 
wherever she represents us. There is no gender barrier to the 
competence of an individual who thinks well, who speaks well, 
who presents her views and who has a passion to represent 
people.
<P>
	There are only 53 women members of Parliament or 18 per 
cent of the MPs in Ottawa. The way to ensure greater 
representation of women and aboriginal people is to become 
involved in the process. I urge all aboriginal people, in 
particular the people of the four new communities that will be 
added to the western riding, to get involved in the political 
process to ensure that there are good people who will bring the 
issues that concern them to Ottawa or to Yellowknife, whatever 
level of government they want representation at.
<P>
	The youth are an integral part of any political process. Youth 
have the energy and the enthusiasm to bring victory to any 
individual seeking office including one of their own. We can 
look at the list of young people elected to the House of 
Commons over the years. I believe Father Sean O'Sullivan was 
elected when he was 21 years of age. My baby is 21 years old, 
the youngest child in my family. It is wonderful someone like 
that could be elected to the House of Commons.
<P>
	Richard Cashin was elected when he was 21 years old; the 
hon. member for Sherbrooke when he was 24 years old; Lorne 
Nystrom when he was 22 years old; the Hon. Perrin Beatty when 
he was 22 years old; the hon. member for York North when he 
was 28 years old; and the Prime Minister when he was 29 years 
old. They were all young people. They are people who have 
contributed. They have given the best years of their lives to this 
honourable process. It is quite possible. Young people out there 
who are listening should know that this can belong to them, that 
a seat in the House of Commons can be theirs.
<P>
	We are here but for a short time. It can be for years or it can be 
for a lifetime but we are not here forever. Young people, women, 
disabled people, visible minorities and other capable and 
competent people have to be encouraged to get involved and 
participate. The north with its young population has an 
abundance of vital energy. I encourage Canadian youth to 
organize and participate in the electoral process to ensure that 
their concerns are heard.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11203"> 11203 </A></B>
<P>
	Over the last while we have heard many concerns about 
post-secondary education, employment, and programs and 
services for young people. We have heard the concerns of 
disabled people. One way of advancing views is by 
participating, by being here. There is something to be said about 
being here; about having a voice, a true voice; and about 
standing in the highest court in the land to represent people. That 
is one way to advance views.
<P>
	It is my hope that Bill C-69 will encourage more people to 
become involved in the electoral process and that in the future, 
when electoral maps are being drawn, greater care will be given 
to ensure that aboriginal communities like the Inuvialuit do not 
have to wait 10 years to be joined together in one federal 
electoral district.
<P>
	I should like to take the time remaining to discuss the main 
components of Bill C-69 which will impact Canadians living 
south of 60. First, Bill C-69 eliminates unnecessary decennial 
redistributions in provinces where there has not been a 
significant population shift which leads to unacceptable 
deviations from the provincial quotient.
<P>
	The committee's bill provides that boundary commissions 
will no longer be established in provinces where as a result of 
the decennial census the number of seats to which the province 
is entitled remains the same and where none of the ridings vary 
by more than 25 per cent from the provincial quotient. This will 
eliminate unnecessary redistributions and result in savings to 
the taxpayers.
<P>
<B>(1550 ) </B>
<P>
	Bill C-69 also provides for quinquennial readjustments in 
addition to the current decennial redistribution. Quinquennial 
redistributions would take place in provinces where following a 
quinquennial census more than 10 per cent of the constituencies 
varied by more than 25 per cent from the provincial quotient.
<P>
	It would not affect the total number of seats, in layman's 
terms, in the House or the number of seats allotted to the 
provinces. It would only allow for the boundaries of ridings 
within the provinces to be redrawn. By allowing for the riding 
boundaries within a province to be redrawn more than every 
decade, the effects of major population shifts in certain 
provinces would be minimized.
<P>
	The appointment of boundaries commissions will be more 
transparent. The chair of each commission will continue to be 
appointed by the chief justice of the province. In appointing the 
two other commissioners, the Speaker will have to publicize 
openings, solicit applications for positions, and consult widely 
before making appointments.
<P>
	Another change is that the Speaker's appointments can be 
reviewed and voted down by the House. The new requirements 
of public notice, solicitation of applications  and consultations 
will make for a more open and transparent process.
<P>
	The boundary adjustment process will be a more open and 
transparent process. Bill C-69 requires that at the beginning of 
the readjustment process commissions publish a notice of 
population figures and of their work plans and invite 
submissions from the public. I am certain it will encourage more 
public participation in the readjustment process.
<P>
	Bill C-69 will ensure more informed public debate. The 
committee's bill requires commissions to prepare three 
alternate maps instead of only one, as is the current process, 
showing how riding boundaries could be divided within the 
province. Although commissions would still indicate their 
preference, they would have to justify their preferred option. 
The two additional maps would assist members of the public 
who wish to make submissions. I believe these new 
requirements will favour more informed public debate and 
encourage more public participation in the process.
<P>
	Bill C-69 provides for the possibility of a second set of public 
hearings to be held where necessary. When in response to public 
comments a commission makes changes to the proposed 
boundaries of a riding that would affect 25 per cent of that 
riding's population, Bill C-69 provides that a second set of 
public hearings would have to be held. The change recognizes 
and reflects the importance of public participation in the 
process. After all, people are what the electoral process is all 
about.
<P>
	Bill C-69 sets out the circumstances in which the boundary 
commission's current discretion to create exceptional ridings is 
to be exercised and requires the commission to justify the 
decision in its reports. This is very critical. Recognizing there 
may be some need for ridings to vary from the 25 per cent 
provincial quotient, the committee maintained the boundaries 
commission authority to create exceptional ridings. The country 
is diverse. There are exceptional circumstances such as the 
massive land track in my area that we have to cover; it is huge. It 
is a very cumbersome exercise for an elected member to traverse 
the huge land mass, for instance.
<P>
	However, the committee's bill limits the exercise of that 
discretion to extraordinary circumstances where the population 
is more than 25 per cent under the provincial quotient and where 
the riding is isolated or not readily accessible from the rest of 
the province. In addition the bill requires the commission to 
indicate the reasons for this determination in its report. I believe 
it will favour a responsible and consistent exercise of the 
discretion.
<P>
	The bill eliminates the current requirement that the 
commission's proposals be tabled in the House.
<P>
<B>(1555 ) </B>
<P>
	Considering that MPs should participate in public hearings 
like all other Canadians, the bill does away with added scrutiny 
by a parliamentary committee of the boundaries commission 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11204"> 11204 </A></B>
<P>
proposals. In any event we have seen that the interventions of 
MPs did not have much of  an impact on the commission's final 
reports. MPs will have the same rights as any other citizen to 
make representation in the course of public consultation.
<P>
	This is consistent with the intent of conferring the boundaries 
readjustment process on independent commissions rather than 
Parliament and ensures that the boundaries readjustment 
process remains non-partisan and independent.
<P>
	Bill C-69 sets out detailed criteria for commissions to 
consider in drawing constituency boundaries. The committee's 
bill establishes clear guidelines for commissions in terms of the 
criteria to be taken into account in drawing constituency 
boundaries including the community of interest, manageable 
geographic size and probability of future population growth. 
Hence the boundaries and finally the boundary commission.
<P>
	The new boundaries would come into force in less time than 
under the current act. Under Bill C-69 it is estimated that the 
boundaries readjustment process will take a total of two and a 
half years, which is three months shorter than under the current 
process.
<P>
	I hope aboriginal people would take advantage of the 
commission's requirements as would all other people. It is noted 
that the whole electoral exercise is quite costly. The 
administration of an election involves 450,000 people and costs 
approximately $100 million. It is no small or pretty penny to get 
members of Parliament elected. It is a major undertaking and it 
should be noted that very few aboriginal people participate in 
the process.
<P>
	This is particularly the case with senior positions such as 
returning officers who are responsible for administering the 
electoral machinery within the person's electoral district and for 
subdividing the district into polling divisions. Research was 
unable to identify any past or present returning officer of 
aboriginal descent.
<P>
	The lack of experience is no viable or legitimate excuse. 
Elections Canada has noted in the impediment to electoral 
participation that 253 of the 295 returning officers appointed for 
the 34th general election had no previous experience managing 
elections. In a sense I am pleading for participation on the part 
of the government, individuals and communities to organize and 
get involved in the public process.
<P>
	The commission is required to publish its plans and hear 
submissions from the public. This is one way to get involved in 
the electoral process but, more important, to ensure that 
electoral boundaries are drawn with more respect to the ties of 
neighbouring communities. It is my hope that in future 
aboriginal people will be able to elect members of Parliament 
from their areas where aboriginal people are the majority.
<P>
	I congratulate the committee for the hard work it has done in 
reviewing the current process and in proposing improvements. 
It could not have been simple.
<P>
	I also hope that aboriginal people, women and any other 
group, in particular the youth who are not adequately 
represented in the House of Commons, will take part in the 
public consultations on electoral boundaries to ensure that the 
boundaries are fair and respect the binding ties of neighbouring 
communities, in particular aboriginal communities but in fact 
all communities across the country.
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
process the final stage of which is being undertaken today 
started yesterday, more than a year after the introduction in this 
House of Bill C-18, which suspended the electoral 
redistribution process then under way and provided for a 24 
month waiting period before starting a new debate on 
redistribution.
<P>
	Unfortunately, the Reform Party then opposed Bill C-18 and 
the 24 month delay initially provided under this bill. However, 
the House of Commons passed the bill suspending the whole 
electoral redistribution process for 24 months.
<P>
	Later, in considering Bill C-18, the Senate did exactly what 
the Reform Party wanted to do in this House. It moved an 
amendment to Bill C-18 providing that a new bill had to be 
tabled by June 1995; otherwise, the old law would apply again, 
reviving the commissions suspended under Bill C-18.
<P>
	When the bill came back from the Senate, the government 
should have stood up and affirmed the will of the people 
represented by the hon. members in this place by approving the 
bill as presented and with the relevant amendments adopted in 
this House.
<P>
	Yet, the government then chose to go along with a Senate 
amendment that put us in a tight squeeze by reducing the amount 
of time available to do our work. It was, in my opinion, an 
unacceptable concession, which the Reform Party managed to 
secure through the Senate.
<P>
	Following final passage and Royal Assent of Bill C-18, the 
Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs was given 
the mandate to draft a bill to be submitted to the House. We 
worked on this for a very long time. I attended all the sessions, 
including those in the summer of 1994, in July 1994, in which 
we heard a great many witnesses, including political party 
representatives, hon. members of this House who came to 
testify, university experts and others. While working on this 
bill, we enjoyed the continuous collaboration of the Chief 
Electoral Officer and his staff.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11205"> 11205 </A></B>
<P>
	Although we spent a lot of time on this bill, we have precious 
little to show for it. Of course, the bill before us, Bill C-69, 
contains a few sweeteners. These sweeteners are improvements 
compared with the present situation.
<P>
	For instance, the provincial commissions will now be able to 
hold hearings before proceeding with their task, which is clearly 
an improvement on the current situation. The commissions will 
have to produce three maps for the regions they cover, three 
electoral redistribution proposals. If there is sufficient popular 
demand, the commissions will have to hold new hearings. 
Granted, the process was improved in this regard.
<P>
	The bill also sets out the factors to be considered by the 
commissions in establishing electoral ridings.
<P>
<B>(1605) </B>
<P>
	These considerations or factors are described in subparagraph 
19(2)(<I>b</I>), which states that, in determining reasonable electoral 
district boundaries, the provincial commission shall consider 
the following: first, the community of interest; second, a 
manageable geographic size for districts in sparsely populated, 
rural or northern regions of the province; third, the probability 
that there will be a substantial increase in the population of 
electoral districts in the next five years. And finally, the 
commission shall recommend changes to existing electoral 
district boundaries only where the above-mentioned factors are 
sufficiently significant to warrant such a recommendation.
<P>
	It is all fine and well to make a policy statement like that, 
making community of interest a guiding principle for every 
commission. However, we inevitably come across another 
provision, which sets the maximum variance from the 
provincial electoral quota at 25 per cent. For example, if, in 
Quebec, the provincial quota was 100,000 voters or a population 
of 100,000, the commission would be entitled to make electoral 
districts with up to 125,000 voters but no less than 75,000 or 
equivalent population.
<P>
	The commission may observe a community of interest, but 
note that the number of voters is not significant enough. Let us 
not take an hypothetical case, but a real one. At present, the 
population of the electoral district of 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine is 43 per cent below the 
provincial quota of 50,000 or 51,000, but encompasses a huge 
area. This district is at risk; it may actually be eliminated. While 
this bill allows the commissions not to apply this 25 per cent rule 
rigidly, the considerations are so restrictive that I wonder if they 
will ever be able to do so.
<P>
	The only time a provincial commission can depart from this 
rule is when, as mentioned in paragraph 19(3), an electoral 
riding or district is geographically isolated from the rest of the 
province or is not easily accessible. Who will define 
``geographically isolated''? The commissions, to start with, and 
of course the courts. No definition was provided. I consider the 
Magdalen Islands geographically isolated. No one will deny 
that. Will the  population factor apply? I suggest that the 
commissions consider this factor. Magdalen Islanders had their 
own electoral district up until 1968. Under Quebec law, they are 
guaranteed their own district. It is not that the hon. member for 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine is not doing a good job at 
representing the district, but I think it would be highly desirable 
to have a member of Parliament just for the Magdalen Islands.
<P>
	Magdalen Islanders will argue that they are geographically 
isolated, and I think that they can qualify under that factor. Then 
it will be a matter of satisfying the provincial commissions that 
the population of the islands does not vary too greatly to justify 
the creation of a separate district. But I can see a downside to 
this. While the new electoral district of Magdalen Islands gains 
a member of Parliament, the district of Bonaventure shrinks in 
terms of voters ratio. What will happen to the Gaspesian 
Peninsula then?
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	What becomes of the ridings of Gaspé, Matapédia-Matane, 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine and 
Rimouski-Témiscouata? What do we do? There is a problem in 
the Gaspé peninsula. Does clause 19(3) allow us to deal with it 
globally? I am not sure. We need more information. This is a 
region with a dwindling population where MPs, whatever their 
political allegiance, have a large area to cover. They must cope 
with problems that do not exist, or that take a very different 
form, elsewhere in the province or in the country. The Gaspé 
peninsula is the first thing that concerns me.
<P>
	Maybe clause 19(3) will apply to the riding of Manicouagan, 
which is indeed geographically isolated and particularly 
inaccessible, as my hon. friend from Manicouagan argued so 
convincingly before the Standing Committee on Procedure and 
House Affairs and again here in the House at the report stage, if 
memory serves.
<P>
	Maybe it will also apply to the northern regions of Quebec and 
Ontario. Last Monday, the ridings of Cochrane-Superior and 
Nickel Belt in northern Ontario were mentioned.
<P>
	They cover a vast area and their population, with certain 
exceptions, is generally on the decline. Will the division be 
made strictly on the basis of the numbers? Will a greater 
deviation be allowed?
<P>
	Clause 19(3) is much too restrictive, in my opinion, for us to 
give it our approval.
<P>
	We had suggested maintaining, in the bill before us, criteria 
now being used by the provincial commissions when deciding 
whether to waive the rules. What are these criteria?
<P>
	At the present time, a provincial commission may waive the 
25 per cent criterion in any case where any special community or 
diversity of interests of the inhabitants of various regions of the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11206"> 11206 </A></B>
<P>
province appears to the commission to render such waiving 
necessary or desirable. In other words, the provincial 
commissions  now have a much broader criterion when looking 
at particular cases.
<P>
	I think that a region like the Gaspé or the Magdalen Islands, 
even the Lower St. Lawrence, would have benefited much more 
under this criterion than under the extremely restrictive wording 
being proposed to replace it. This may not be as bad as the initial 
suggestion to include a schedule of the ridings in the act and 
freeze them, thus giving a form of statism to the act and to the 
list of ridings and making it extremely difficult to work with.
<P>
	Consequently, the official opposition considers clause 19 to 
be a major obstacle and cannot support the bill.
<P>
	Clause 16 is also questionable and even unacceptable, given 
what it says and what it does not say.
<P>
	Following the representations made last summer to the 
Standing Committee on the Procedure and House Affairs-by 
the hon. member for Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead, by the 
president of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada and, 
previously, on June 21, by Senator Jean-Claude Rivest of the 
Stadacona senatorial designation-we understood that the 
government would be receptive to the traditional request made 
by Quebecers and their government for guaranteed minimum 
representation in the House of Commons, as is the case for some 
Atlantic provinces.
<P>
	As you know, representation for the Atlantic provinces is 
guaranteed by the senatorial clause, which dates back to 1915 
and which we do not question.
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	The senatorial clause allows a population of 120,000 people 
in Prince Edward Island to be represented by four members in 
this House. Indeed, that clause provides that a province cannot 
be represented by fewer members in the House of Commons 
than senators in the Senate. Since four Senate seats are 
guaranteed to Prince Edward Island in the senatorial clause, that 
province can also be represented by four members in this House. 
The same rule applies for New Brunswick, which is guaranteed 
ten seats in the Senate, under the Canadian Constitution.
<P>
	Although the number of residents in that province does not 
justify such representation, New Brunswick gets ten seats and 
we accept that. The terms of union between Newfoundland and 
the Canadian federation, ratified in 1949, also contained 
provisions guaranteeing adequate representation of the province 
of Newfoundland, both in the House of Commons and in the 
Senate. In fact, Newfoundland was guaranteed six seats in the 
Canadian Senate.
<P>
	So if we agree with the senatorial clause that provides 
guarantees for Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia and 
Newfoundland, why are we up against a wall when we talk about 
the same guarantees for the Province of Quebec, when we talk 
about a minimum level of representation for Quebec?
<P>
	Quebec, which as a people and as a nation, is one of the two 
founding peoples of this country. We are told this time and time 
again. We learned this from our history teachers. It is part of our 
collective conscience as Quebecers that in 1867, Quebecers 
were one of the two founding peoples. I may recall that on June 
30, 1867, the day before the coming into force of the British 
North America Act, 1867, Quebec, then known as Lower 
Canada, was entitled to 65 seats out of a total of 130 in the 
Parliament of the Province of Canada, that is, 50 per cent.
<P>
	This was agreed to by the members who were elected to 
represent us at the time-there was no referendum to ask what 
the people of Quebec thought and certainly not the women of 
Quebec, since they did not even have the right to vote at the time 
and the Fathers of the Confederation were all males-but there 
were no constitutional provisions that provided for minimum 
representation for Quebec. The only guarantee Quebec obtained 
was those 65 seats, but 65 out of how many?
<P>
	On July 1, 1867, it was 65 seats out of 181. Later, when 
Canada's territory was expanded with the addition of new 
provinces including Manitoba, Prince Edward Island, 
Saskatchewan, Alberta, British Columbia and finally 
Newfoundland, Quebec's share of representation in the House of 
Commons dropped steadily, stabilizing during the past 20 or 30 
years at a level slightly over one-quarter. Obviously, the Fathers 
of Confederation made a mistake by not including a minimum 
representation clause for Quebec, which at the time should have 
been 50 per cent.
<P>
	We can hardly rewrite history and today insist on 50 per cent. 
People will say: Who do you think you are? We are not in a 
country that allows such deviations from the norm. Be that as it 
may, we are not asking for the representation that we had in 
1867, in other words, 50 per cent. We asked for a minimum 
guarantee of 25 per cent of the seats in the House of Commons. 
In the next general election, should Quebec participate-my 
good friend from Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine will 
agree it is pretty doubtful that we will be able to-when the 
thirty-sixth Parliament is elected, Quebec, for the first time in 
its history, will fall below this critical mass of 25 per cent, since 
it will have only 75 seats out of 301.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	Hence our proposal, which was akin to the Liberal 1992 
proposal. I read on Monday of the pleasure of the hon. member 
for Papineau-Saint-Michel and Minister of Foreign Affairs at 
being able to guarantee Quebec minimum representation of 25 
per cent, saying that this represented a significant gain for 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11207"> 11207 </A></B>
<P>
Quebec. The hon. member for Papineau-Saint-Michel 
described the  guarantee of 25 per cent for Quebec as an 
incredible step forward.
<P>
	Well, as regards our motion which was voted on yesterday, 
once again none of the Liberal members in this House in 1992, 
who are still here today, voted in favour. Why did the members 
change their minds in the space of three years? Why deny 
Quebec something so minor? I would like, in passing, to 
recognize the very open-minded approach to the matter taken by 
the hon. member for Burnaby-Kingsway, who voted with the 
official opposition to guarantee Quebec minimum 
representation of 25 per cent, as did the hon. member for 
Beauce, as if this were perfectly natural.
<P>
	It was perfectly natural, since the vast majority of members 
from Quebec present in this House yesterday voted in favour of 
this minimum guarantee of 25 per cent. We can therefore say 
that there is very broad consensus in Quebec, which goes beyond 
party lines, that Quebec should enjoy a minimum guarantee of 
25 per cent. When the Progressive Conservative Party, the 
official opposition, the Bloc Quebecois, the hon. member for 
Burnaby-Kingsway and the independent member for Beauce 
all support the motion to include guaranteed representation of 
25 per cent in Bill C-69, it is obvious that there is broad support 
in Quebec on this point. I need not add that Senator Rivest had 
given his support for this provision. Even the support of the 
governments of Quebec, which had called for the inclusion of 
this provision in the legislation, did not fail. As far as I know, as 
well, the present government never shied away from what had 
been agreed in the past.
<P>
	It is strange to see the government back away from something 
it supported in September 1992-the vote was on September 10, 
1992-without much justification. Two days ago, on Monday, I 
listened to the arguments which the hon. member for Kingston 
and the Islands and the hon. member for Scarborough-Rouge 
River put forward, arguments which were not convincing. I do 
admit, however, that under normal circumstances, these two 
people are extremely convincing, but, for people to be able to 
convince others, they themselves must be convinced.
<P>
	It goes without saying that, when people rise to make 
representations that they are forced to make-because any old 
reason to vote against the amendment will do-they obviously 
cannot be convincing. The unconvinced cannot be convincing. 
This was the impression that I got the other day from the hon. 
member for Kingston and the Islands, the impression that he did 
not believe in the things that he was saying and that he was using 
the pretext of constitutional technicalities as a reason for 
refusing to support a motion which had already been allowed by 
the Chair and declared admissible following a procedural 
debate. It is a little odd that the debate swung in this direction.
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	You will understand therefore, that, at the end of the day, this 
bill will be incomplete, as I said earlier, because of its stand on 
the issue of allowable deviations from the boundary rules in 
special ridings and because of its failure to take a stand on the 
issue of one of the country's founding peoples. Was this an 
intentional omission on the part of the government?
<P>
	We might have asked ourselves this question when debate 
began on the bill. But, after the vote yesterday on the official 
opposition's motion guaranteeing Quebec 25 per cent of the 
seats in the House, it was quite clear that the government had not 
simply overlooked this detail, but that it was omitted by design. 
The government does not want to guarantee Quebec fair 
representation in this House and does not want to accept as a 
criterion the fact that the nation of francophones in Quebec is a 
founding people, the cradle of francophones in America. The 
day we took such a decision was a very sad day indeed.
<P>
	Would Canadians have been unhappy to see the government 
finally recognize Quebec's distinct society status, founding 
people status, status as a nation which built this country? I think 
not. Yet, yesterday, all it would have taken to recognize this was 
a majority vote in this House. But it was denied us. It was the 
most modest demand formulated in the last 50 years.
<P>
	Without going back to prehistory, we can go back several 
decades: in the 1930s, there was the Rowell-Sirois commission 
in Quebec; in the 1950s, the Tremblay commission also studied 
constitutional issues; the Laurendeau-Dunton commission 
reviewed what was happening in this country in terms of the 
Constitution.
<P>
	I invite our friends from the Reform Party, who think that 
Canadian history started with their election, to read about the 
events of that period. It would be a good idea to return to the 
source to understand that Canadian history started, we are not 
sure exactly when, with the first people to land on our shores, 
probably the Vikings who landed somewhere near 
Newfoundland at the beginning of the millennium. Then there 
was the arrival of Jacques Cartier in Gaspé in 1534, the founding 
of Quebec City by Samuel de Champlain in 1608, the founding 
of Trois-Rivières and Montreal in the following decades. And 
finally, the establishment of the first government in New 
France, as Canada was then called.
<P>
	In the beginning, we had a government of companies. As you 
probably remember, the King of France entrusted private 
companies like the Company of One Hundred Associates and the 
Dutch West India Company with the administration of the 
territory. The King of England, for his part, gave the Hudson's 
Bay Company the English part of the territory that later became 
British North America. Territories throughout the continent 
were administered by private companies.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11208"> 11208 </A></B>
<P>
	Our first institutions, not democratic but public, were granted 
in 1663 by the King of France through the establishment of the 
Sovereign Council of New France. These institutions reflected 
the values of the time: a governor, an intendant, the Bishop of 
Quebec City and those co-opted by them for a total of seven 
people, near the end of colonial times, but without any 
democratic guarantees.
<P>
	We, francophones, had a hard time achieving our democratic 
rights on the American continent. Our motherland never gave 
them to us.
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	They tried to exercise in New France the same absolute 
domination as in Old France. Gradually, we stopped being 
French while, of course, maintaining good relations with what 
was then our mother or home country and became a more and 
more distinct nation.
<P>
	At first, we called ourselves Canadiens or, as we used say, 
``Canayens''. So, on one side, there was us Canadiens and, on 
the other, the English who occupied part of the land.
<P>
	From 1663 to 1759, we operated with these institutions. Then, 
in 1759, the battle that took place on the Plains of Abraham was 
a victory for some, but for us it was a defeat. It brought about 
constitutional changes, again, military government in 1759, a 
royal proclamation in 1763 which ceded the colony of New 
France to England in exchange for Guadeloupe and Martinique. 
It is clear that errors of judgment were made somewhere along 
the way because, while anglophones had won here, in America, 
when, on the Old Continent, the British won the war against the 
French and the Treaty of Paris was signed, they got New France, 
but France kept Guadeloupe and Martinique.
<P>
	Those are great travel destinations, but in terms of the relative 
value of the two, I think it was a sucker deal at the time.
<P>
	Still no democratic institutions. In 1774, the Quebec Act that 
was handed to us-because we got whatever was left 
over-nonetheless restored civil law in Quebec, which allowed 
us to have a legislative council, but not an elected one. They 
were afraid to give francophones, so peace-loving, democratic 
institutions in which Quebecers could be represented by the 
people of their choice. Instead, we were given a legislative 
council appointed by the governor.
<P>
	But the Quebecers, Canadiens of those days had certainly 
demonstrated great pacifism and great open-mindedness 
because there were 63,000 francophones in Quebec at the time 
of the conquest and only 3,000 to 4,000 survivors of Wolfe's 
regiment. With that kind of power relationship, had we been 
even slightly vindictive, the slightest bit vindictive, we would 
not have had to go into overtime to decide the fate of these 3,000 
or so people. We went along with a de facto situation and, guided 
by the elites who governed us in  those days, whether we liked it 
or not-we will not rewrite history-we tolerated this situation.
<P>
	Finally, in 1791, the Constitutional Act gave us for the very 
first time the right to have elected representatives and the first 
House of Assembly in Quebec. Naturally, we did not take any 
chances. It is like in a car: there is an accelerator, but there is 
also a brake pedal. The Westminster government allowed us to 
have a house of assembly made up of elected members, but it 
also maintained a legislative council, which was appointed by 
the governor and which could oppose the decisions of the 
assembly.
<P>
	In 1791, we gained control over some institutions. The 
situation evolved rather rapidly and the country was divided into 
two parts: Upper Canada and Lower Canada. The assembly 
elected in Lower Canada had no extra-territorial jurisdiction. 
Consequently, it could not legislate for Upper Canada, nor could 
Upper Canada legislate for Lower Canada. We then move on to 
the 1830s with the Patriotes' rebellion and the infamous Durham 
report, which recommended unifying the two Canadas to finally 
assimilate and anglicize the French-speaking nation in 
America, something which was not to happen.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	For eight years, while English was the only official language 
in the house of assembly of the Parliament of the Province of 
Canada, French Canadians fought, in their own language, to 
have French recognized as an official language. Thanks to their 
tenacity, justice was finally done in 1848, when they obtained 
the right to use French, which also became the language used in 
the legislation. I will end with 1867 and the emergence of new 
institutions.
<P>
	You will understand, Mr. Speaker, why I simply cannot agree 
when I hear simplistic comments such as those made by the 
Reform Party, to the effect that Canada started to exist in 
October 1993. Canada has existed for a long time. As a member 
of one of the founding nations which forged Canada's 
Constitution, I respectfully submit that, given our long common 
history, this critical mass of 25 per cent is the breath of life 
which Quebec needs if it remains, but I hope it will not, part of 
the Canadian federation.
<P>
	In any case, it is better to be safe than sorry; it is better to 
buckle up, even if you do not wish to have an accident. It is from 
that perspective that I wanted to discuss the 25 per cent rule. 
This rule is so fundamental that, even though Bill C-69 includes 
some improvements, the fact that Quebec is not guaranteed a 
minimum of 25 per cent of the total representation in the House 
of Commons is reason enough, in fact the only reason, for the 
Bloc not to support this bill at third reading. Consequently, we 
will oppose this legislation.
<P>

<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, we are now debating Bill C-69 for the last time in 
the House. The bill is consequential of Bill C-18 from some 
time ago and the perceived need to redraw the act which allowed 
the commissions to redistribute the ridings in various provinces.
<P>
	The bill is a result of the Liberal fiasco of interrupting the 
boundary redistribution with Bill C-18. The fiasco was started 
because Liberal members did not like the new maps produced by 
the commissions. Making a show out of calling for a 
fundamental review of the redistribution process, the 
government ordered new boundary maps drawn under new rules, 
costing Canadian taxpayers more than $5 million in wasted 
commission reports.
<P>
	Although there have been some minor improvements to the 
process of selecting boundary commissioners and publicizing 
the process, no substantial change to the composition of the 
boundary readjustment commissions, no substantial change to 
their powers and no substantial change to the method of drawing 
boundaries are proposed by Bill C-69. All the changes made to 
the redistribution act could have been made without throwing 
out the maps produced at great cost.
<P>
	This whole exercise was a crass political manoeuvre on the 
part of the Liberals hoping to have boundary lines redrawn 
closer to their liking. There was no requirement for the 
redistribution process to be suspended and for the expensive 
work to be thrown out in order to examine the process.
<P>
	Notwithstanding the minor technical improvements made to 
the act, the bill should be defeated by the House for two major 
reasons. Bill C-69 fails to address the problem of a rapidly 
growing House of Commons and it lays suspect the concept of 
equality of vote as a guiding principle in the redistribution 
process. The bill does not move the House of Commons any 
closer to respecting the mandate of representation by 
population, the cornerstone principle for a lower House in a 
bicameral system.
<P>
	What is interesting about these two failures is that the Liberal 
members of the procedure and House affairs committee were 
initially in favour of tighter variances and a capped or reduced 
number of seats in the House of Commons. Capping or reducing 
the number was a major part of the mandate the House gave to 
the procedure and House affairs committee.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	Witnesses were brought in from all over the country to discuss 
this issue with us. Many of the Liberals on the committee agreed 
that the restrictions on the size of the House were a good idea.
<P>
	Allow me to give members a few examples. Going back to our 
procedure and House affairs committee meetings of last 
summer, on July 7 the member for Scarborough-Rouge River, a 
very active member during  this entire process, said: ``I have 
always been in favour of the view that the House should be 
taking control of its numbers. We ought to, by formula or in 
another way, be capping the size of the House of Commons. I am 
in favour of capping, whether it is 250, 300 or something over 
300. It is not a big problem''.
<P>
	It seems pretty clear the member for Scarborough-Rouge 
River was in favour of dealing with the issue of the growth of the 
House. He was not alone on the Liberal side of the table. At the 
same meeting the member for Ontario said: ``I too support any 
initiative that might have the effect of limiting or capping the 
number of seats''.
<P>
	The member for Vancouver Quadra, very experienced in 
matters of riding redistribution and constitutional 
considerations, added: ``I have no problem at all with capping''. 
He was clear we had to recognize some of the difficulties in 
doing it.
<P>
	The Reform members on the committee were able to 
satisfactorily answer those concerns. The pattern of support for 
the idea of a smaller or capped House continued into the fall. In 
our meeting on October 20 the member for 
Scarborough-Rouge River again indicated his support for the 
concept: ``I oppose further growth in the House without any 
restrictions. I tend to be in favour of a capping arrangement at 
some point and I very much want to see that issue addressed''.
<P>
	It is very strange the member has spoken in favour of and has 
supported the bill at all stages even though that issue is not 
addressed at all.
<P>
	The chairman of the procedure and House affairs committee, 
the member for Kingston and the Islands, wanted to shirk all 
responsibility for capping the House and leave the problem to a 
future Parliament.
<P>
	The Liberal dominated 51st report from the committee says: 
``Many members of the committee reluctantly came to the 
conclusion that a cap or reduction in the size of the House of 
Commons is not feasible at this time''.
<P>
	I got a very different impression from many of the Liberal 
members during the committee hearings. Reformers 
demonstrated that a House based on 265 members plus a few 
more to account for senatorial limitations is workable. We 
included this in our minority opinion, an opinion the Liberal 
brass ordered defeated.
<P>
	On October 20 the member for Vancouver Quadra added: ``I 
think many of us would like a more compact House. This House 
certainly architecturally has been stretched to the breaking 
point''.
<P>
	This is all very interesting but when faced with a vote on the 
issue in that very meeting, all Liberal members voted against a 
reduced House or a House frozen at 295 members. They all 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11210"> 11210 </A></B>
<P>
voted for a House that grows to 301, the status quo formula for 
continued growth.
<P>
	Their personal support for capping the House continued. As 
late as November 1 the member for Scarborough-Rouge River 
said in committee: ``We should be addressing the size of the 
House in our report. I do not think as a committee we have nailed 
that one down yet''. He added at a later meeting of the 
committee on November 22: ``It would be naive to leave this 
issue without discussing the size of the House''.
<P>
	It was at this point that the chair, speaking for the government, 
indicated that it would be better to leave the problem of a 
growing House to some future Parliament. This comment 
seemed to concern the Liberal members who thought that 
capping or reducing was a good idea.
<P>
	The member for Mississauga West who also participated in 
our deliberations wondered why the next Parliament should be 
asked to investigate the problem: ``Is there any good reason why 
we cannot do it?''
<P>
	The answer to that is a very loud and resounding no, there is 
no good reason the bill could not have contained provisions to 
cap or reduce the size of the House of Commons, other than a 
lack of political will on the part of the government to deal with a 
controversial issue that would be acceding to the wishes of 
Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1645 ) </B>
<P>
	Her comments that day were reinforced by her colleague from 
Vancouver Quadra when he agreed with her that the work on the 
problem of size should start now. All of these comments are in 
the committee transcripts.
<P>
	There was a very real level of non-partisan agreement that 
capping and reducing the House was in order. The Liberal 
members of the committee wanted it and the Reform members 
of the committee wanted it. My friend from Mississauga West 
was absolutely right when she said: ``I think the Canadian public 
wants us to limit the size of the House''. It seems that the only 
people who do not want it are those in the government inner 
circle who really call the shots.
<P>
	It is always interesting to hear what any given government 
member thinks about a particular issue and then compare their 
response after a caucus meeting or after the whip has had a 
chance to talk to them. Time after time we see them 
mysteriously changing their minds about what is in the public 
interest.
<P>
	I noted with interest that the hon. member for Bellechasse was 
surprised that the Liberals had changed their minds. I do not 
understand that. Liberals have been changing their minds ever 
since this country was established in 1867. There is nothing they 
stand for and there is everything they stand for; it is whatever is 
convenient at the time.
<P>
	It is time that the House and the government acted on 
principle, on what is right and on what is in the best interests of 
the Canadian public. It should consult with the Canadian public 
rather than flim-flamming around from one position to another, 
depending on the whims of the inner circle of the Liberal Party.
<P>
	There seemed to be a pretty clear consensus among Liberals 
that capping and reducing the size of the House was a good idea. 
Why then was the issue suddenly and strangely dropped from the 
committee report, the bill which the government introduced, 
and all subsequent comments from those Liberal members? 
Suddenly, it was not an issue any more.
<P>
	The answer is quite clear. They were whipped into line by the 
party brass. The red book promises of giving ordinary members 
of Parliament more autonomy and control over committee and 
House business is demonstrably dead. It is one more example 
that the red book promises of open government and restoring 
integrity were nothing more than tricks designed to win support 
from a public weary of unethical politicians. How else can the 
Liberals explain the practice of standing firm on an opinion one 
day and then voting it down on the next?
<P>
	It was the same with the back to work legislation which the 
House dealt with last week. Many government members spoke 
in favour of designing legislation that would prevent costly 
strikes which damage the economy. Then they voted against the 
bill introduced by the hon. member for Lethbridge which would 
have done just that. Then within 24 hours the same members 
stood in support of the bill legislating an end to the crippling rail 
strike. It just does not make sense. It is pure partisan politics at 
its worst.
<P>
	It is exactly the kind of top-down decision making Canadians 
from coast to coast are sick of. It is the Charlottetown accord 
approach to making decisions. They are trying to impose their 
will on Canadians. The Liberals are demonstrating that they 
hold a very low opinion of the thoughts of their own 
backbenchers. They expect them to act like trained seals, to 
always toe the party line and to vote when and how they are told 
to.
<P>
	We saw exactly the same thing when we were discussing the 
allowable variance from the provincial population quotient, 
which is also a part of Bill C-69. Several government members 
expressed support for the idea of making constituencies, as 
close as possible, equal in population.
<P>
	The member for Mississauga West went so far as to vote in 
favour of a Reform suggestion to move to a 15 per cent variance 
in population quotient. In our committee meeting on October 20 
she admitted: ``I voted with you on that, if you recall, and got 
into big trouble''. Big trouble for expressing her own opinion in 
a committee meeting of this House. The member admitted that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11211"> 11211 </A></B>
<P>
she was censured for voting contrary to party  wisdom. That is 
not open government; it is authoritarian top-down government.
<P>
	I know the Liberal member for Vancouver Quadra will agree 
with me when I say that the monarch in Parliament is sovereign 
and MPs share in that sovereignty. Members of Parliament 
should not merely be puppets to their party brass. It is bad 
policy, it is bad for Parliament, and it is bad for Canada.
<P>
	Canadians elect MPs to represent their interests in 
Parliament. It is a shame that the government would not allow 
its members to exercise that responsibility. The support was 
there to create a redistribution bill that would meet the needs and 
wants of the majority of Canadians, but the government brass 
whipped its members into line to enforce its own agenda.
<P>
<B>(1650 ) </B>
<P>
	The Parliament of Canada should not be run in an 
authoritarian top-down decision making process. Every vote 
and every committee should not be considered a matter of 
confidence. Every member should not be forced by the inner 
circle to toe the line. That kind of practice reduces the House of 
Commons to nothing more than a grand rubber stamp for what 
the cabinet has already decided behind closed doors.
<P>
	I doubt the government had an open caucus debate on these 
issues before it determined to add seats to the House of 
Commons and allow the vast population variance differences 
that are included in Bill C-69. I doubt very much there was a 
very open debate in the Liberal caucus about this issue. I suspect 
the decision was made and members of the Liberal caucus were 
told that they would support Bill C-69. They were probably 
given four or five talking points to back them up as they were 
sent out to sell the government agenda.
<P>
	There was a rare opportunity here to make a positive change to 
our redistribution system. The government did not allow its 
members to make those changes in the area of a capped or 
reduced House to protect the equality of Canadian votes with a 
tighter variance.
<P>
	I want to briefly reflect on some of the observations made by 
the hon. member for Bellechasse. He took it upon himself to 
give Reformers a lesson in Canadian history. I want to assure the 
hon. member that Reformers are very aware of the history of our 
country. We are very proud of our past. We are very proud of all 
of those from the past who contributed to this country to make it 
the great country it is.
<P>
	I would like to remind the hon. member for Bellechasse and 
others who might share his concern about our understanding of 
Canadian history there are reasons that people came to this 
country. They came particularly to my part of the country, the 
west, and I believe they came to the province of Quebec, Ontario 
and Atlantic Canada because they wanted to get away from some 
things in their country of origin. They wanted to escape 
repressive regimes. They wanted to escape  governments that 
imposed undemocratic principles upon them.
<P>
	I am a bit concerned about the Bloc members' position on Bill 
C-69. They want to impose a principle that in my opinion and 
the opinion of my Reform colleagues is undemocratic. That is, 
we would put on the floor of the House of Commons 25 per cent 
of the seats for one province in this country, regardless of 
changes in population.
<P>
	That is why a lot of people left their country, to escape those 
types of oppressive laws and come to a place where the 
democratic principles of representation by population were 
adhered to. I believe that is the principle the people of Quebec 
adhere to as well. I also believe that is one of the reasons many 
people in the province of Quebec voted against the 
Charlottetown accord.
<P>
	Canadians, both within and outside of Quebec, find it 
abhorrent that we would call for special status for anyone in this 
country. It is not a principle that was accepted in the 
Charlottetown accord. It was repugnant back then and it is 
repugnant to Canadians today.
<P>
	We have to ask: Why would they want special status? Why 
would they want to be guaranteed 25 per cent of the seats of the 
House of Commons whether their population justified it or not?
<P>
	I think of two or three arguments that might be put forward. 
One argument might be that somehow their representatives are 
not as good as the representatives from other parts of the country 
and they need that floor and need that protection. I do not accept 
that argument. Quebecers can send qualified and able members 
to this House who can represent them adequately, just like we 
can in the rest of the country. I challenge that argument.
<P>
	Another argument might be that they are superior to other 
Canadians and deserve to have 25 per cent of the seats in this 
House. I reject that argument as well. It is a false argument. We 
need to look upon each other as equals in this country, equal 
citizens with equal responsibilities, equal privileges and a law 
that affects us all in the same manner.
<P>
	There is one other argument that might be put forth. They 
might say that they are one of two founding races and somehow 
that bestows some special privilege upon us. All of us know that 
the native people were here before those of English or French 
origin.
<P>
	This past weekend I was at a breakfast where a Metis leader 
spoke to us. He brought the point home to us again that in most 
of this country Canadians do not view Canada as being the home 
of two founding nations. In particular, if they are one of the first 
people or of Metis origin, they very much doubt that concept.

<P>
	I want to close by saying I appreciate the opportunity to make 
my final remarks on Bill C-69. For all of the reasons I have put 
forward in my speech at third reading, I urge the House not to 
pass Bill C-69. We are not getting the job done. If we are not 
prepared to face the issue square on and if we keep wanting to 
put off the tough decisions into the future, those decisions will 
become even tougher to make.
<P>
	If we let this House expand to 320 members, some 20 more 
people will have a vested interest in maintaining their seats in 
this House of Commons and not seeing the size of this House 
reduced. It is going to have a negative snowball effect which is 
not good for the country. Unfortunately there are too many 
politicians in this place who have a vested interest and are not 
able to put the well-being of the country ahead of their own 
self-interests.
<P>
	I urge all members of this House to do the right thing, the 
thing even Liberals argued for in committee, to cap the size of 
the House, to respect representation by population, and to vote 
against Bill C-69.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I want to very briefly run over the very positive aspects 
of the bill before the House today. I am afraid the opposition 
members, as is their wont, have dwelt on the negative aspects.
<P>
	We have heard the hon. member for 
Kindersley-Lloydminster complain about two aspects he feels 
were not there. We have to deal with what is there. We have a 
good bill here and the hon. member should have acknowledged 
that and indicated supported for it in his speech.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The hon. member for Bellechasse had several complaints 
about things that were not in the bill, but what is in the bill is 
clearly quite acceptable to everyone, and he should support the 
bill for that reason.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The bill provides a new, and I suggest better, appointment 
process for commissions and for the commissioners. It puts a 
limit on the need to appoint commissions in provinces where 
there have not been significant population shifts. That is a major 
change. It will save money. We have another major money 
saving device in this bill. Redistributions will cost less as a 
result of this bill.
<P>
	We have established quinquennial review, that is 
quinquennial redistributions in provinces where there have been 
significant population shifts within the province. Therefore we 
will avoid massive changes every 10 years.
<P>
	We put a new clause with new directions to commissions 
instructing them on how to do the redistribution within the 
boundaries they decide on. We have suggested new ways of 
doing it that in my view are more restrictive than the rules that 
were there before. We directed them more pointedly to deal with 
items such as community municipal boundaries and boundaries 
of existing electoral districts. I think it is a significant 
improvement. All the members of the committee agreed it was 
an improvement when we made those changes.
<P>
	There are limits which I suggest are much tighter on the right 
of commissions to deviate beyond the 25 per cent limit on the 
provincial quotients. Now they cannot create a riding that is 
bigger than the limits, which they could do before. Those are 
prohibited. They can only create one that is smaller than the 25 
per cent deviation. That is circumscribed very tightly because it 
must be geographically isolated from the province or very 
remote. Without quoting the exact words, it is significantly 
different from what it was before. Again, the hon. member for 
Kindersley-Lloydminster who harps on this point has fewer 
grounds to complain than he had in the previous bill. He should 
be supporting this bill.
<P>
	The publication of plans is different. There will be three of 
them. There will be an opportunity to comment before the maps 
are published for the first time. The member for 
Kindersley-Lloydminster says that the maps presently drawn 
by the boundaries commissions are thrown out the window. That 
is not true. They could be used as one of the three maps by the 
new commissions. There is no reason in the world why those 
could not be used as one of the three options put forward by the 
commissions when they publish maps.
<P>
	Members will have an opportunity to comment with members 
of the public in advance of publication, after publication and 
after significant changes in the maps.
<P>
	This is an improved process. It is more open. We have rid 
ourselves of the parliamentary review. We have made the 
process more open, more accountable to public pressure, and 
more accessible to the general public in that sense.
<P>
<B>(1700) </B>
<P>
	We have abolished the very expensive publication process for 
the maps. We have made them available to people who want 
them, not to publish them in newspapers at great public expense. 
It is saving literally millions of dollars.
<P>
	The commissions will give reasons for their decisions, which 
was not the case before. This will help explain to the public why 
the commissions have drawn boundaries in the locations they 
have. The period for implementation of redistribution has been 
shortened under the bill so that it will happen in a faster time 
frame than was the case before.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11213"> 11213 </A></B>
<P>
	Those nine or ten very positive improvements to the 
legislation are encompassed in the bill. All I hear in lengthy 
speeches from the opposition are complaints. There has not been 
mention of any of the very positive aspects. I invite hon. 
members to look at the brighter side and not dwell on the things 
that are not there.
<P>
	I should like to turn to a couple of things that are not in it and 
say something about them. I will deal first with the complaints 
of the hon. member for Kindersley-Lloydminister and then I 
will turn to the hon. member for Bellechasse.
<P>
	The member complained repeatedly that members of the 
House were not free to express their views in the committee. We 
obviously had a very free expression of views. He has quoted 
extensively from speeches of members, particularly members 
on this side. I can understand why he would want to quote them. 
In his remarks he said how they shared a view one day and 
changed their minds another.
<P>
	Part of the advantage of committee work is that we get to hear 
witnesses and study various options. The members of the 
committee looked at the things we could do. He may have 
forgotten that we spent three days in July last year, and he was 
there, hearing witnesses. We worked quite hard with long 
sessions lasting all day.
<P>
	Having heard the evidence of witnesses we had discussions. 
They influenced us in various ways. Some of us were swayed by 
some witnesses and felt that maybe we should do this one day 
and then, having read other material and reflected on it, we 
changed our minds. That was true of many members of the 
committee.
<P>
	Had I been expressing views in the committee as the chairman 
of the committee, I am sure he would have been quoting me as 
having said one thing one day and maybe something else the 
next. My views changed too as I read up on the subject and was 
persuaded by various witnesses, by discussions with my 
colleagues on the committee and by material I read on a subject 
such as the royal commission report on electoral reform and 
party financing.
<P>
	Having seen all that material, having formed our views and 
having reflected on the matter, many members changed their 
minds. The hon. member for Kindersley-Lloydminster 
attributed all kinds of reasons to this that are not really accurate 
in every case at all and certainly not generally fair to hon. 
members who made up their minds. He should not indulge in 
such speculation on the reasons people make up their minds the 
way they do.
<P>
	Naturally there are discussions in caucus. Naturally there is a 
consensus building on issues like this one. On the bill itself there 
was a significant change that he pressed for. That was the 
elimination of scheduled ridings and a change to put the power 
back in commissions to make the decisions that could have been 
made in the House because of various complaints from 
members. That was the response to complaints that he raised. 
The  members on our side looked at it and decided there was a 
better way. I think the bill reflects that. I heard no criticism of 
that aspect of the bill from the hon. member in his speech.
<P>
	The committee looked at the evidence, weighed the evidence 
and came to conclusions. We did not all come to the same 
conclusions. That is quite obvious from the speeches this 
afternoon. However, we came to conclusions on a bill that has 
very positive aspects that will have a significant impact on the 
way we do redistributions in the country and a very positive 
influence in that regard.
<P>
	The redistribution done under the bill will be good. It will be 
better than what we had before, in part because the process is 
more open, in part because the commissioners will be more 
responsive to the wishes of the members of the House as they are 
chosen essentially by the members of the House, and because 
the opportunity for public input is very significantly enhanced 
under the bill.
<P>
	In reflecting on whether or not to support the bill I invite 
members to consider those items, to look at the positive side and 
ignore the very negative side.
<P>
	Another complaint the member made dealt with the size of the 
House. Frankly that is not a matter for a redistribution bill. It is a 
matter for changes in the Constitution of the country. The 
committee was very reluctant to get into constitutional change. 
The number of seats assigned to the provinces under the 
Constitution is set out in the Constitution Act. It is a matter of 
constitutional amendment to change it.
<P>
<B>(1705) </B>
<P>
	The hon. member wanted either to cap or decrease the size of 
the House. Most members on our side have considered the 
matter. There was some initial attractiveness to the idea. Last 
summer there was a lot of media attention focused on the size of 
the House and whether or not we really needed a House of this 
size. They reflected and decided that with 295 members for a 
country the geographic size of Canada we were not significantly 
over-represented in the House.
<P>
	Our population is growing. Most of us in Ontario represent 
about 100,000 people. That is a significant number. We cannot 
get to meet them all in our term of office; it is virtually 
impossible to do so.
<P>
	I am sure the hon. member for Kindersley-Lloydminister 
knows from his own experience, having been in the House now 
for a year and a half, how difficult it must be for him to meet his 
electors. Members of Parliament do not have all the time in the 
world to be out in their constituencies. When we go to our 
constituencies it is difficult to go door to door when we are 
trying to do our work as representatives, meet groups and people 
in our offices who ask to see us, not just to see the people who 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11214"> 11214 </A></B>
<P>
perhaps would be interested to meet us but do not have the 
opportunity.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bélair:</B> Telephones help.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> As the member for Cochrane-Superior says: 
``Telephones help''. He has a particular problem given the 
geographic size of his riding. The country is enormous. 
Members of Parliament have a particularly difficult role to play, 
a multifaceted role that involves more than sitting in Ottawa and 
doing the work demanded of them in this place.
<P>
	I will continue with the subject of the Constitution.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I would like to comment on what the hon. member for 
Bellechasse said in his speech today and also on what he said 
Monday in connection with his motion in amendment to this 
bill.
<P>
	It is clear that what he wanted to change was really a section 
of the Canadian Constitution, not a section of this bill. He 
argued that he wanted a change that would give the Province of 
Quebec a minimum level of representation or at least 25 per cent 
of the members. This kind of change would require an 
amendment to the Constitution Act. Two sections are affected by 
this proposal, one of which is section 52 of the Constitution Act, 
1867, and I would like to read it to the hon. member, although I 
am sure he has already read it: ``The Number of Members of the 
House of Commons may be from Time to Time increased by the 
Parliament of Canada, provided the proportionate 
Representation of the Provinces prescribed by this Act is not 
thereby disturbed''.
<P>
	A change of the kind he proposed would clearly change the 
ratios established by the current legislation with respect to 
representation of the provinces. This means that to make the 
proposed change, we would have to amend the Constitution.
<P>
	The other section that is crucial to this matter is section 42(1) 
of the Constitution Act, 1982, which reads as follows: ``An 
amendment to the Constitution of Canada in relation to the 
following matters may be made only in accordance with 
paragraph 38(1)(a)''. One such matter is ``the principle of 
proportional representation of the provinces in the House of 
Commons prescribed by the Constitution of Canada''.
<P>
	So we cannot make changes except ``in accordance'' with 
section 38. Section 38(1) provides for ``resolutions of the Senate 
and the House of Commons; and resolutions of the legislative 
assemblies of at least two-thirds of the provinces that have, in 
the aggregate, according to the then latest general census, at 
least fifty per cent of the population of all the provinces''.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	So, it would be very difficult to make such a change in the 
Constitution. We tried to during the debate and the referendum 
on the Charlottetown accord, but the Canadian people did not 
want it. I am surprised today that the hon. member for 
Bellechasse and his party supported such a change to Canada's 
constitution, after opposing the Charlottetown accord.
<P>
	The accord would have guaranteed Quebec 25 per cent of the 
seats in the House of Commons, but they opposed it. What 
happened? Why are they supporting this amendment to the 
Constitution in the House today? This is nothing more than a 
game for them. They are not sincere in proposing such a motion 
in this House. Oh yes, indeed. And look who proposed the 
motion: a party that has decided it will not be here after the 
referendum.
<P>
	If this party wins the referendum, Quebec will separate from 
Canada. If it loses, its leader has promised he will resign, and all 
his members will do the same. How can they propose a change 
like this to guarantee Quebec a minimum number of seats here in 
the House, when they do not plan to stay? What is the problem 
here? I do not understand the position of the Bloc Quebecois on 
this matter. I would also suggest that the remarks of the hon. 
member for Bellechasse are just another attempt to confuse the 
issue and give a boost to the separatists' campaign to help them 
catch up.
<P>
	Clearly they have problems, and some other issue must be 
found for Quebec electors, an issue of no importance to anyone.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Everybody in Canada would be happy to ensure adequate 
representation for every part of the country, but the hon. member 
for Bellechasse in his speech criticized the fact that Prince 
Edward Island had a guarantee of four seats. He used that as an 
argument to suggest that somehow other provinces should also 
have guarantees.
<P>
	If we all had guarantees of a minimum percentage we would 
never make any changes in the representation. Everybody in the 
House including the hon. member for Bellechasse supported the 
notion of representation by population in the discussions in the 
committee. Clause 19 of the bill provides for effective 
representation based on population. It is the guiding principle 
for redistribution and was supported by all members. He 
supports that principle and he knows it.
<P>
	By his amendment he is trying to raise a red herring that has 
nothing to do with the bill. It is really an amendment to the 
Constitution of Canada that he would like to get and that frankly 
he opposes in relation to certain other provinces that are very 
small.
<P>
	I share his views. I do not think anybody should have a 
minimum number of seats in the House. We should be dealing 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11215"> 11215 </A></B>
<P>
with fairness and representation and trying to get the very best 
maps we can so that members have an area  they can represent 
that is manageable and that allows them to do a good job in the 
House for all the country. That is our aim.
<P>
	With great respect I invite hon. members opposite to rethink 
their negative thoughts on the bill, look at the good side of it and 
support it.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Langlois:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Kingston 
and the Islands has made a few errors. At one point, I almost 
thought I was hearing Flora MacDonald. Now really, we do 
understand that the riding may remain the same, but we do at 
least expect the incumbents to change. Indeed, Mrs. MacDonald 
did once hold the seat; now it is the hon. member and, one day, 
there will be somebody new there. If voters do not ensure this 
happens, nature surely will, as it will for me one day too.
<P>
<B>(1715) </B>
<P>
	Something remains to be clarified and corrected. The hon. 
member for Kingston and the Islands said that the amendment 
proposed by the official opposition on the issue of minimum 
guaranteed representation for Quebec would change the 
Constitution of Canada in an unorthodox way, that we cannot 
proceed in this fashion and that we should use the 7-50 rule, 
which is 7 provinces representing 50 per cent of the population 
of Canada, plus the two federal Houses. This is the way he 
suggests we do it, even though we clearly indicated that under 
the circumstances this is not the way to go.
<P>
	The amendment proposed by the Bloc Quebecois would have 
changed the text of subclause 16(2) of the bill to the 
following-I am sure that the hon. member for Kingston and the 
Islands will be listening to this: ``On receipt by the Chief 
Electoral Officer of a return referred to in subsection (1) in 
respect of a decennial census, the Chief Electoral Officer shall 
calculate the number of members of the House of Commons to 
be assigned to each of the provinces, subject and according to 
the provisions of section 51 of the <I>Constitution Act, 1867</I> and the 
rules provided therein''. And our amendment would add that: 
``and, notwithstanding the foregoing, when by application of 
this subsection the number of members to be assigned to the 
Province of Quebec is less than 25 per cent of the total number of 
members in the House of Commons, the Chief Electoral Officer 
shall assign at least 25 per cent of the total number of members 
to the Province of Quebec''. That is the amendment which would 
have guaranteed us 25 per cent of all seats.
<P>
	Our amendment refers directly to a constitutional 
amendment; by our wording we are modifying section 51. Did 
we have the right to propose this amendment from a 
constitutional point of view? The question has been raised 
before the courts. I will provide my hon. colleague from 
Kingston and the Islands with a copy of the decision in <I>Campbell 
vs. Attorney General of Canada,</I> reported in 1985-49BLR, 4th 
edition, page 321. Five judges of the British Columbia Court of 
Appeal ruled that under  section 44 of the Constitution Act, 
1982, the federal Parliament had the authority to make laws, and 
that it could make laws with respect to the criterion of 
proportional representation, bearing in mind that proportional 
representation must be interpreted in the Canadian sense of the 
term, not in a rigid, mathematical sense, but in the context of 
Canadian history. This was the ruling of the honourable judges 
of the British Columbia Court of Appeal in <I>Campbell</I>.
<P>
	The legislative authority on which the official opposition's 
amendment is based is section 44 of the Constitution Act, 1982. 
I would remind members that section 44 does not specify 
exactly how we in the federal Parliament are to use our authority 
to amend the Constitution of Canada within our areas of 
jurisdiction. Are we to change its wording directly or by 
reference? We are making a reference to the wording. As the 
Constitution does not specify a method, either, in my opinion, is 
acceptable.
<P>
	In concluding, I would like to ask the hon. member for 
Kingston and the Islands a question of principle. Setting aside 
the constitutional arguments that could occupy us for hours, why 
does the hon. member for Kingston and the Islands not wish to 
see the people of Quebec, as one of the founding races of this 
country in 1867, retain this critical mass of 25 per cent of the 
number of members, which gives it the power to influence 
certain decisions?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Mr. Speaker, in my opinion, the position of the 
hon. member concerning section 44 of the Constitution is 
wrong. It is obvious that the operative words in this case are 
``principle of representation by population'' and I do not need to 
quote the section again in this House; the words are quite clear. 
We can change certain things concerning representation in this 
House but not the principle of representation by population for 
the provinces. That can be changed only if census figures 
warrant it under the regulations if it is in section 51 of the 
Constitution.
<P>
<B>(1720) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I am a firm believer in the concept of the two founding races. I 
believe fully that the partnership that created our country and 
has caused it to prosper and develop is a fundamental part of our 
Constitution. I have absolutely no reluctance in recognizing that 
principle.
<P>
	I do not share the hon. member's view that the only way to do 
it is to accord a guaranteed minimum number of seats to one of 
the provinces. I do not like the minimum guarantees that we 
have for seats in the House. There may be other ways to do it, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11216"> 11216 </A></B>
<P>
perhaps by a minimum number of seats in the Senate or by some 
other method.
<P>
	I firmly believe that the House should be elected on the basis 
of representation by population. I have always been a believer in 
that principle. I stick by it.
<P>
	There are conflicts of principles now and again in the way we 
do things. The hon. member for Kindersley-Lloydminster in 
his speech referred to the principle of representation by 
population. I am a firm believer in it and so is the hon. member 
in his heart of hearts. I know he does not like the minimums that 
are already there. I do not either. I would prefer to see those 
changed.
<P>
	I recognize there are certain political realities in Canada by 
which we have to abide. I am not anxious to engage in changes to 
those realities without an overall view of how the Constitution 
could be changed in various ways.
<P>
	The Charlottetown accord was an attempt to do that. The hon. 
member opposed it. I supported it with some reluctance. I did 
not like parts of it. However in it was the 25 per cent minimum. I 
supported Charlottetown. I am prepared to support 
Charlottetown again if I have to. I would prefer not to. I would 
prefer a better deal. I think we can get a better deal some day.
<P>
	We are not into Constitution making now. Canadians are fed 
up with Constitution making. In my view we ought not to be 
engaging in it here in a roundabout way, as the hon. member 
suggests, and which I suggest is illegal.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, in listening to the member for Kingston and the 
Islands respond to the hon. member for Bellechasse he was 
arguing for and against himself. He reiterated what I said in my 
speech.
<P>
	He alluded a bit to some constitutional changes that would be 
necessary if we were to reduce the number of members in the 
House. We discussed this in committee. As the member for 
Calgary West very adequately explained to the hon. member for 
Kingston and the Islands, any constitutional changes would be 
minimal and could be done within the confines of the House. 
They do not require the very complicated and difficult amending 
formula to authorize the changes. It would be necessary to deal 
with the grandfather clause which prohibits an equitable 
reduction in the size of the House.
<P>
	The hon. member for Calgary Centre, who had some input at 
committee in the bill, used California as an example of a 
jurisdiction in the United States with a population equal to the 
population of our entire country which at the federal level only 
has, if I remember correctly, 56 federal members to represent 
nearly 30 million people.
<P>
	His argument that we need 294 MPs at the federal level to 
adequately administer this country does not hold water. Both our 
system and our capabilities are equal or perhaps superior to 
those of the politicians in the state of California.
<P>
	I have a concern the hon. member did not address and to which 
I would like him to respond. We have thrown away $5 million. 
We are going to draw new maps after the bill is passed. Given the 
population shift in the province of Ontario, I am quite sure that 
the results may be very similar to the results we saw when the 
maps came out in the former process. In those maps northern 
Ontario lost one seat. Perhaps now with the population changes 
it will lose two seats and the hon. member for 
Cochrane-Superior will have a larger riding and another 
member will not have a riding at all.
<P>
	How is the hon. member's government going to respond when 
the maps come out again? The results could be even less 
favourable to his members than they were this past time. Will 
they again demand changes? Is the government going to again 
delay the process and bring in new legislation to try to get the 
maps drawn the way those members want them?
<P>
<B>(1725 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member made some 
pretty far-reaching assertions in the course of his remarks. I 
want to go back to the California example he cited, although he 
did not specifically ask me a question on it.
<P>
	He suggested that because in California members of the house 
of representatives represent huge numbers of people that we 
should do the same. I do not agree that the American experience 
is one that we necessarily need to follow. We have never done so 
in the past on major political matters. I do not know why we 
would today.
<P>
	The hon. member, in reflecting on this issue, would agree with 
me that the American political experience has not been all roses 
either. He points to the parts of it he likes and says this is what 
we should do. However he ignores the disadvantages that their 
system affords, which are significant.
<P>
	Canadians do not expect their members of Parliament to 
represent huge numbers of people. They feel they are well 
represented now with a House of reasonable size. Based on 
population we have always had a fairly large House compared to 
the United States and I am sure we are going to continue to have 
for the foreseeable future.
<P>
	The second part of his question was about the proposals we 
have here and if the commissions are coming up with new maps 
are we going to throw those out a second time. I do not think so. I 
have no reason to believe that would be the case.
<P>
	However, the member should bear in mind that in dealing with 
these maps the government is not throwing them out. The 
commissions will be free to use them as one of the three they put 
forward for public consideration should they decide to do so. 
They do not have to redraw every line on every map. This may be 
one of the three sets they have to do but I remind the hon. 
<P>

<B><A NAME="11217"> 11217 </A></B>
<P>
member that they do now have to produce three. So these maps 
in fact could be quite helpful.
<P>
	The census figures that were set out on a geographic basis for 
the entire country will be available to the new commissions as 
were to the old. All that work will not be duplicated.
<P>
	For the hon. member to suggest that we have trashed 
everything by this bill and wasted $7 million is not accurate. We 
will have good use for some of things that have happened. 
Certainly some of the money that was spent on advertising will 
not be spent a second time. We are not going to trash everything 
and waste all the money. We are moving to save money with the 
new redistribution. There will be some loss from the expenses 
already incurred.
<P>
	However, had the hon. member been vigorous in supporting 
our first bill instead of supporting the senators who held it up 
and cost the taxpayers millions of dollars, we would be away 
ahead of the game. If those commissions had cancelled as soon 
as the bill was introduced we would have saved several million 
dollars. It was wasted because the hon. member and the Senate 
got into bed together and blocked the passage of the bill and cost 
us a lot of money as has-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> There are two minutes to go. I do not 
believe the member for Rimouski-Témiscouata wishes to 
begin her speech. I wonder if we might call it 5.30 by agreement.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It being 5.30 p.m., the House will now 
proceed to the consideration of Private Members' Business, as 
listed on today's Order Paper.

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="STATUTORYPROGRAMEVALUATIONACT">STATUTORY PROGRAM EVALUATION ACT</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.)</B> moved that Bill C-289, 
an act to provide for evaluations of statutory programs, be read 
the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I am glad to speak to this private 
member's bill. Unfortunately, it has been designated a 
non-votable bill and will not be referred to the Standing 
Committee on Public Accounts.
<P>
	However, there is a tide in the affairs of men which when 
taken at the flood leads on to fortune. Shakespeare said this 400 
years ago. There is a tide today that is causing government to 
re-examine its profligate ways and return to the sanity of fiscal 
responsibility, hence ensuring the prosperity of Canadians in 
future generations.
<P>
	Canadian taxpayers have seen their taxes rise dramatically 
over the last 15 to 20 years in the name of reining in the budget 
deficit. Yet that deficit is no closer to being tamed than in the 
years before. We have had a continuous stream of finance 
ministers stand in the House and proclaim that the battle will be 
won through the increased taxes that they have introduced. 
These have been empty promises. We have listened to finance 
ministers tell us that spending is being constrained in the name 
of deficit reduction. Every year when we add it all up, the 
spending has gone up.
<P>
	What is the problem? When more and more taxes only contain 
the unsustainable deficit, the problem is being perceived as 
insurmountable. Perhaps the real reason lies in the way we spend 
taxpayers' money and the needs we as a government have 
perceived as needs to be addressed.
<P>
	Over the years governments past and present have created 
programs to address virtually every perceivable need for 
Canadians from health to unemployment, grain transportation, 
disaster relief, alleviating aboriginal problems, educating our 
young, combating poverty, heritage, industrial development and 
international marketing. The list is endless.
<P>
	Some of these programs are highly visible. They serve 
Canadians every day. Some are out of sight of the Canadian 
taxpayer and yet we hope are performing some valuable service. 
Some are out of date and out of touch. Some are just plain 
obsolete. Some continue because no one has bothered to shut 
them down. They are forgotten, expensive and ongoing. Are 
they Beneficial? No.
<P>
	In this day and age when we are trying to justify every dollar 
spent, we should take the time to evaluate on a program by 
program basis what we are actually doing and why.
<P>
	The President of the Treasury Board has announced that 
45,000 civil servants are going to lose their jobs. Is that because 
we have suddenly found out their work was irrelevant? I doubt 
it.
<P>
	Somehow the Treasury Board is telling us that government 
can do the job required with 45,000 fewer civil servants. We do 
not have these answers, only questions and concerns. What does 
it mean for those Canadians who depend on a certain program? 
Will it still be there for them tomorrow?
<P>
	What about the career of a civil servant which has suddenly 
been shattered? What does the future hold for him? Why did we 
find out now that we can dispense with 45,000 civil servants? It 
did not appear apparent to us last year or the year before that we 
could dispense with these civil servants, 30,000 of them, 20,000 
of them or 10,000 of them. Why now?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11218"> 11218 </A></B>
<P>
	Over the last 10 to 15 years the private sector has realized 
technology has changed the world, that profit margins are 
slimmer. Efficiency must be improved to maintain profitability. 
Innovation is the only way to success.
<P>
	By recognizing these signs and acting on them, Canadian 
industry leads the world today in rising productivity growth. To 
them we owe a great debt of gratitude. If they had been as 
laggardly and as slothful as the Government of Canada, the 
country would have had a financial crisis long ago.
<P>
	The private sector is constantly reviewing what it does, how 
well it does it, how it can improve efficiency and how it can 
innovate. Is the government exempt from these issues? The 
answer is no. It does not have the political will to address them.
<P>
	My private members' bill is a serious attempt to redress that 
problem. I have focused on statutory spending in my private 
members' bill, spending that accounts for $112 billion this 
fiscal year. It is included in the estimates for information only.
<P>
	Members of Parliament cannot debate it. They cannot vote on 
it. They cannot reduce it. They cannot eliminate it. Like old man 
river, it keeps rolling on every day. I want to take stock of that 
$112 billion of spending.
<P>
	Like the private sector, I want it done rationally, completely, 
objectively and most of all on a cyclical basis of seven to ten 
years.
<P>
<B>(1735 ) </B>
<P>
	I am proposing in my private member's bill that all statutory 
spending, no matter how great or small, how meaningful or 
meaningless, be evaluated every decade using four fundamental 
principles. Is the program still relevant? Is the program 
effective in addressing the needs that have been identified? Is 
the program being delivered efficiently? Is there a better way to 
achieve the same results? Those are four fundamental criteria on 
which to evaluate every statutory program that has been 
authorized by the Government of Canada over the years.
<P>
	Let us look at these points again. Is the program relevant? We 
all know we live in a changing society. Statistics Canada is 
continually measuring these changes in our society, the size of 
urban poor, child poverty, wealth, the size of our houses, the 
products we buy, the appliances we own, our level of education. 
The index of Statistics Canada is an inch thick. Who says a 
program designed 20 or 30 years ago is meeting the challenges 
of today unless we ask what is the challenge we are trying to 
meet today?
<P>
	Therefore I want the question asked whether the program is 
still relevant. That will cause the senior bureaucrats and the 
political masters to define clearly and specifically what the need 
is in today's terms, not last year's terms or last decade's terms. 
What are they trying to accomplish today? It is simple enough. 
The private  sector does it all the time. It boggles my mind that 
this is an innovative idea for the Government of Canada.
<P>
	The second principle of evaluation is whether the program is 
effective in addressing the identified need. That again seems a 
fairly simple question to which we would want to know the 
answer. Surely if we have identified a need through the 
discussion on relevancy it behoves us to know we are addressing 
that need effectively, not just 60 per cent of the need being 
addressed and 40 per cent being ignored or whatever percentage 
we want to choose.
<P>
	On the other side of the coin, why would we want to address a 
need with 20 per cent overlap beyond that? We would be wasting 
taxpayers' money because we did not examine our programs to 
determine if they are effective. Worst of all, what would we say 
if we were to find that a program is addressing issues largely 
irrelevant to the fundamental focus of the programs, spending 
money with abandon while the need identified remains 
unaddressed?
<P>
	Surely it is our job as parliamentarians to be asking these 
questions to ensure on behalf of taxpayers that we have the 
answers.
<P>
	The third principle of my bill requires that we ask how 
efficiently we are delivering these programs. Is our service up to 
par or do we have to wait months for a disability pension from 
CPP, for example? I found out through my work on the public 
accounts committee that the Canada pension plan only answers 
four out of every 11 telephone calls. I found out that the 
Department of National Defence built a warehouse in Halifax to 
house inventory. However, after the building was largely 
complete it looked at the inventory it wanted to put into the 
building and realized it was largely obsolete and was not being 
used.
<P>
	Therefore, when we ask whether the program is being 
delivered efficiently, I hope in most cases the answer is yes. We 
want to know every situation when the answer is no.
<P>
<B>(1740 ) </B>
<P>
	The final principle of the bill asks the simple yet fundamental 
question is there a better way? Too often we get caught up in 
repetition instead of innovation. As needs change we have new 
tools and new technology to identify needs. As we improve our 
efficiency we should always ask whether there is a better way.
<P>
	Preventive maintenance goes a long way to reduce 
renovation. A stitch in time saves nine. Program evaluation, as 
proposed in my private member's bill, is an ongoing process that 
will provide value to the Canadian taxpayer. It is not politically 
driven. It is open and transparent.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11219"> 11219 </A></B>
<P>
	My bill will require each program evaluation be laid before 
the House and referred to a standing committee for its input, for 
public discussion, hearings and for recommendations. It would 
be a public process.
<P>
	We have program reviews going on today with the Minister of 
Human Resources Development. These reviews are taking place 
behind the scenes. They are being presented, according to the 
Auditor General, without pooled information. In his last report 
he mentioned we would require more information. It would be a 
public process and the government would be required to respond 
the committee's report within 150 days.
<P>
	Another major point is we must have faith in the quality of the 
evaluations. For that reason my bill causes evaluations on 
programs that spend more than $250 million annually to be 
reviewed by the Auditor General, and his report on the 
evaluation to be laid before the House also.
<P>
	Program evaluation is an idea whose time has come. The 
Auditor General has been critical of the progress of 
development of program evaluation in his 1993 report. Program 
evaluation has been introduced in other western democracies 
with significant success and savings to the taxpayer. It can, will 
and must do the same here.
<P>
	As parliamentarians who are wrestling with a serious budget 
deficit and an accumulated debt almost out of control, we owe it 
to the taxpayers to adopt program evaluation. As members of 
Parliament responsible for the public purse, program evaluation 
is without doubt the best tool that has come along to assist us in 
our work in decades.
<P>
	The Auditor General said: ``The story of program evaluation 
in the Government of Canada is one of high expectations and 
great potential that have only been partly fulfilled''. That quote 
is from the 1993 Auditor General's report, paragraph 844.
<P>
	Let us not have heads of gold and feet of clay. Let program 
evaluation achieve its full potential in playing its very real and 
substantial role in managing government programs.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
President of the Treasury Board, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to address the House on Bill C-289, a private member's 
bill.
<P>
	The bill provides for the regular evaluation of continuing 
government programs funded by statutory appropriations by a 
program evaluation process set by the President of the Treasury 
Board. Responsible ministers would be required to table in the 
House the results of these evaluations.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The bill also requires the Auditor General of Canada to review 
and report to the House of Commons on major evaluations.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	During this period of concern for the deficit and the level of 
the national debt, it is very important all parliamentarians and 
all Canadians know which government programs are working; 
which government programs are working well and which ones 
are not working well. We also want to know how we can improve 
them so they are affordable and that they meet the objectives 
established for them.
<P>
	Program evaluation is a good tool for reviewing programs. It 
allows for the questioning on a periodic basis of the rationale for 
each government program. It involves the systematic gathering 
of verifiable information on a program. This information would 
include demonstrable evidence of its results and cost 
effectiveness. This process would provide more and better 
information for decision making.
<P>
<B>(1745) </B>
<P>
	The government has already demonstrated its commitment to 
the need for regular program evaluations. Many of our public 
documents place an important focus on evaluation. For 
example, ``Creating Opportunities'', the red book, outlines the 
importance of evaluation information and the 1994 budget 
called for major reviews of federal programs.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	These important reviews of federal programs had two 
objectives: first, to identify the programs and services that the 
government will continue to provide if there are enough 
resources and, second, to ensure that these programs are 
delivered in the most efficient way possible. We can already see 
the results of these reviews.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In addition, in May 1994 the Treasury Board approved a new 
review policy. The intent was to strengthen the ongoing review 
capabilities of departments and the government in general. 
More and improved review and evaluation findings are to be 
made publicly available.
<P>
	Bill C-289 recommends evaluations be made of statutory 
programs on a cyclical basis. This a worthy approach. We need 
to ask how practical it is. There are only so many resources that 
can be devoted to program evaluation. We must use those 
resources carefully.
<P>
	While major statutory programs are important, sometimes it 
is much more cost effective to evaluate issues which impact on 
more than one program and possibly on more than one 
department. Evaluations involving many departments are often 
more strategic and more likely to be useful.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11220"> 11220 </A></B>
<P>
	The government needs to retain flexibility in this regard. 
Cyclical evaluations of singular statutory programs may not 
always provide the wider information base needed for a 
significant government decision. There is nothing wrong with 
supporting cyclical evaluation. One needs to think whether this 
approach is the best one in all cases.
<P>
	Ultimately we want to ensure review of activities undertaken 
by government departments and central agencies are better 
linked to government priorities rather than some predetermined 
schedule.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The needs and aspirations of the population change rapidly. 
Unforeseen problems may arise. Decision makers and managers 
must adapt quickly to any change in conditions.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A long term fixed evaluation schedule is not always 
appropriate. Programs should be evaluated based on an analysis 
of risk, their importance to Canadians and, as the information is 
needed, for decision making. To have an evaluation for the sake 
of an evaluation is not cost effective or wise.
<P>
	Evaluations are not the only source of information 
parliamentarians and Canadians can use to evaluate whether 
government programs and services are affordable and effective. 
There are many different activities in government which help us 
to learn how well programs are serving Canadians and also to 
identify successful practices that can lead to service and quality 
improvements when needed.
<P>
	Earlier this week the President of the Treasury Board released 
details of the renewed expenditure management system of the 
Government of Canada. The new system is intended to support 
the objective of making the best use of tax dollars to deliver 
quality services to Canadians. The renewed expenditure 
management system introduced the concept of departmental 
outlooks. These outlooks on program priorities and 
expenditures will be provided to the various standing 
committees of the House.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	These documents will give parliamentary committees better 
quality information that will enable them to evaluate future 
priorities and trends in departmental and program spending and 
to comment on them.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The public service is currently working to establish service 
standards for its programs. The role of service standards is to 
provide answers to questions such as how long will it take to 
provide a service? How often will it be provided? What can 
people do if they are not satisfied? Providing service standards 
that pose these types of questions invite public feedback. This 
feedback from the clients of government is an important 
element in the government's attempt to provide quality services 
that are  affordable, efficient, effective and responsive to the 
needs of Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1750 ) </B>
<P>
	Internal audit is another important tool available to provide 
information on the success of programs and activities. Internal 
audits are designed to help managers achieve their business 
objectives by identifying weaknesses or opportunities to 
improve the overall economy, efficiency and effectiveness of 
program management practices.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It is also important to note that the information on program 
performance must be available on an ongoing basis. Managers, 
members of Parliament and senators along with the Canadian 
people would not be very happy to learn long after the fact that 
the programs have not produced the expected results.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	There must be useful performance measures that provide 
answers on an ongoing basis. The Auditor General has for 
several years encouraged the government to improve the quality 
of the information in this area. Program managers must be 
encouraged to demonstrate on a timely basis the results being 
achieved by their programs.
<P>
	Most of the mechanisms for providing information on 
program performance, what I have discussed already, have a 
permanent place in the management framework of government 
and are already used to assess statutory programs.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I have tried to demonstrate that, even if evaluation is an 
important management tool, it is not the only one. No single tool 
such as evaluation can meet all information needs that 
determine program effectiveness. Each review tool and each 
information tool must be used at the appropriate time and for the 
appropriate purposes.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I have tried to demonstrate the most important aspects of what 
is happening in government in terms of relating information to 
parliamentarians. The House recently passed a private 
member's bill that changed the Auditor General's act to allow 
him to report more frequently to the House. This change will 
provide us again with more timely information on government 
activities and I am sure it will provide the Auditor General with 
more work.
<P>
	How much more work can we be asking the Auditor General 
to do before we start to reduce his effectiveness? That is one of 
the problems we would encounter.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11221"> 11221 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The bill before the House is the result of an admirable effort 
by an hon. member to ensure that we all have access to good 
quality information on program performance. I suppose that we 
can never have enough information. We must, however, 
consider the costs.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As the bottom line there are many good sources of 
information available to us on a routine basis. We must ensure 
we are making full use of these resources. If we need further 
information there are many options open to us. Should we be 
enshrining a new review process into legislation without fully 
considering the options and costs involved? I think not.
<P>
	I am prepared to look at the positive options of the proposed 
legislation. If they can be incorporated into some of the 
mechanisms we have in place it will be done.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Richard Bélisle (La Prairie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I take 
this opportunity to commend my colleague, the hon. member for 
St. Albert, for taking the initiative of tabling Bill C-289. 
Incidentally, the hon. member sits on the public accounts 
committee that I chair and I share and certainly understand his 
interest in ensuring that an act is passed to provide for the 
evaluation of statutory programs.
<P>
	The need for statutory program evaluation has clearly been 
established both in the public and the private sectors, especially 
at a time when costs are tightly controlled and we have to make 
the most of our scarce resources. The only thing standing in the 
way of this bill being passed and applied to major programs is an 
obtuse government unable to keep up with the times.
<P>
	The public accounts committee has already devoted several 
meetings to program evaluation. The Auditor General of 
Canada, for his part, devoted chapters 8, 9 and 10 of his 1993 
report to program evaluation, and made the following comment 
again in 1993, and I quote: ``Our audit found that the story of 
program evaluation in the Government of Canada is one of high 
expectations and great potential that have been only partly 
fulfilled. Cabinet has been paying sustained attention to 
program evaluation data over the last ten years''.
<P>
<B>(1755) </B>
<P>
	But this interest was given little more than lip service, really. 
The sixth report of the public accounts committee, tabled on 
November 21, reiterated the relevance of program evaluation. 
The auditor general indicated that most of the programs that 
were evaluated were not high expenditure programs.
<P>
	In 1991-92, the evaluation of programs with budgets over $1 
billion, that is to say 16 programs totalling $124.5 billion, 
showed that only two of these had undergone a comprehensive 
evaluation; the rest were only partially covered, if at all. In 
1991-1992, twenty-four per cent of government's program 
expenditures were  evaluated. That same year, 480 of the 
completed evaluations covered programs with expenditures of 
$250 million or less, as compared to 18 in the over $250 million 
category.
<P>
	There is therefore a need to eliminate this kind of 
laissez-faire in government with respect to evaluating mostly 
low expenditure programs. That is why I agree with paragraph 
8(2) of Bill C-289, which states that the Auditor General of 
Canada may review any program evaluation and submit a report 
on it to the House of Commons in the case of a program 
evaluation covering a statutory program with expenditures of 
$250 million or more each year.
<P>
	I also support this bill because it is directly based on the main 
recommendations of the sixth report of the public accounts 
committee, which I signed last November.
<P>
	This legislation would establish an objective decision making 
process regarding the continuation or the elimination of 
government programs, and it would help reduce the arbitrary 
and political nature of the decisions made. Having better 
documented and more objective decisions would give more 
weight to the role of managers and members of Parliament. An 
improved program evaluation process would result in a more 
efficient control of costs, given that the current deficit exceeds 
$37 billion for that the accumulated debt is close to $550 billion.
<P>
	As the hon. member St. Albert pointed out, program 
evaluation is a modern day management tool. In this era of 
electronic highway and state of the art technology, why would 
the government keep ignoring the value of cost benefit analysis 
and objective criteria on which to base its decisions, and instead 
follow trends, rely on a gut feeling, or base these decisions on 
political or partisan considerations?
<P>
	Program evaluation is definitely a protection against dramatic 
cost increases which become unmanageable over time. I should 
add that this explosion of costs which eventually become 
uncontrollable accurately reflects the Liberal Party saga of the 
last 25 years.
<P>
	Bill C-289 is a rare attempt by this Parliament to get us out of 
the vicious circle of expenditures, debts and subsidies to friends 
of the party, in which the Liberals put this country two decades 
ago.
<P>
	The purpose of this bill is to provide for the regular evaluation 
of government programs by a program evaluation process set by 
Treasury Board on a prescribed cycle. The President of the 
Treasury Board would determine the cycle for evaluating 
statutory programs. We could not agree more.
<P>
	New programs would also be covered by this process within 
six months after the coming into force of an act authorizing a 
statutory program, the President of the Treasury Board shall, by 
order, prescribe the fiscal year as an initial evaluation year for 
the statutory program and prescribe the evaluation cycle for the 
statutory  program. This whole process would tend to reduce the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11222"> 11222 </A></B>
<P>
risk of arbitrary decisions, and we therefore support section 3 of 
the bill.
<P>
	In concluding, I have two suggestions for the hon. member for 
St. Albert: first, in subsection 7(4), the hon. member suggests 
150 days for completing the evaluation of a statutory program 
after the end of the evaluation year. I think 90 days would be 
more reasonable. This means that tabling in the House would 
come after 120 days, instead of 180 as the hon. member initially 
suggested.
<P>
	Second, considering the strategic role played by the auditor 
general in program evaluation, I would suggest to the hon. 
member that the program evaluation report and the auditor 
general's report connected with the former be referred to the 
Public Accounts Committee instead of a committee designated 
by the House as provided under section 9.
<P>
<B>(1800) </B>
<P>
	I endorse Bill C-289, and I urge the House to support this bill, 
so that the government will stop this debt spiral caused by 
unnecessary spending and programs that have outlived their 
usefulness.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to have the opportunity to speak in support of this very 
thoughtful and very important legislation. As my colleague, the 
member for St. Albert, stated in his remarks, the objective of 
Bill C-289 is to hold statutory spending to the same standards of 
accountability that Parliament currently applies to discretionary 
expenditures. That is a very noble and worthwhile cause to put 
forward in this assembly.
<P>
	While time is limited, there are two points I want to make in 
these remarks. First, as statutory programs come to represent an 
ever-increasing amount or share of total government 
expenditures, the inability of Parliament to evaluate these 
programs effectively and objectively is making it more and 
more difficult for members of Parliament to hold governments 
accountable. For this reason there is a need to have a bill such as 
Bill C-289.
<P>
	The second point is that the intense fiscal pressures brought 
about by decades of government over-spending not only make 
enhanced review and evaluation of statutory expenditures 
desirable, but certainly very essential at this point.
<P>
	On the first point, I would like to remind the members of the 
House how our system of government is supposed to work. 
Under the Constitution as members of Parliament we have been 
granted three very important powers. First, we must decide how 
much government will be permitted to spend. Second, we must 
decide how the government will spend it. Third, we have an 
obligation to hold the government accountable for those 
expenditures.
<P>
	The objective of the legislation is to bolster and to enhance 
the third of these three parliamentary powers that are given to us 
as members of Parliament. Specifically, it asks that statutory 
programs be subject to the same periodic program evaluations 
that are presently applied to non-statutory programs.
<P>
	These program evaluations seek to answer four very 
fundamental questions. First, is the program relevant? Second, 
is the program effective in meeting its objectives? Third, is the 
program being delivered effectively and efficiently? Fourth, can 
the purpose of the program be fulfilled through a variety of 
different means?
<P>
	At present no such reviews are conducted for statutory items. 
When weighing the merits of extending program evaluations to 
cover this area, we must consider the following: This year, fiscal 
year 1995-96, the Government of Canada will spend some $164 
billion dollars. Of this only $48 billion will be subject to 
parliamentary review. That means that some 71 per cent, or the 
remaining $116 billion of our tax dollars will be spent 
automatically without any attempt to evaluate those programs 
success. That is just not accountability. That has to change. That 
is the main purpose of Bill C-289.
<P>
	Given the size of these annual expenditures, it seem rather 
ludicrous that members of the House would not be provided with 
the information to determine whether such programs are 
effective in meeting their objectives. It is hard to believe that 
members would have no way of determining whether there is a 
better way to do things. Yet that is the current state of affairs. 
Members do not have the information they need to evaluate the 
effectiveness of statutory programs.
<P>
<B>(1805) </B>
<P>
	This brings me to my second point. The federal government is 
presently facing what amounts to a fiscal crisis. It finds itself 
under immense pressure to reduce government expenditures. 
Even after making significant cuts to discretionary expenditures 
in its last budget, it will still have a deficit of $25 billion in the 
year 1997.
<P>
	Simple arithmetic tells us that if the government has any hope 
of achieving a balanced budget then the lion's share of the cuts 
will have to be made in the area of statutory expenditures. 
Discretionary programs have already been cut or pared to the 
bone. The only sizeable pool of money left is in the area of 
statutory programs and programs such as old age assistance.
<P>
	That is why Bill C-289, which would subject the statutory 
programs to periodic review and evaluation, is so critical. In the 
coming years, members of Parliament will be called on to make 
more difficult and tough decisions than previous Parliaments 
have had to make. We will have no choice but to reduce or even 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11223"> 11223 </A></B>
<P>
eliminate benefits which millions of Canadians consider to be 
virtual birthrights.
<P>
	If we as parliamentarians are to fulfil that task in a responsible 
manner then we will need the information to make intelligent 
decisions. At present this information does not exist. Bill C-289 
seeks to fill this information gap.
<P>
	In conclusion, Bill C-289 is valuable legislation which would 
address two fundamental concerns. First, by improving the 
scrutiny of statutory expenditures, it would begin to put control 
of the government purse back in the hands of Parliament.
<P>
	Second, the information obtained from these evaluations and 
reviews would provide members with the information they need 
to make intelligent spending decisions. At a time when every 
government program is being evaluated, when the most sacred 
of government cows is being reconsidered and when every 
dollar is now subject to careful scrutiny by the budget cutters, 
legislation like Bill C-289 is not merely desirable but is most 
essential.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am rising, along with the previous speaker from Lethbridge, to 
support Bill C-289. In doing so, I want to thank the hon. member 
for St. Albert for having brought the bill to the House. It is one of 
a series of bills he has brought forward to improve the financial 
accountability of Parliament.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I would also like to thank the hon. member for La Prairie for 
his support. He gives his party the kind of financial perspective 
we need in this House. As chairman of the Public Accounts 
Committee, he helps the cause of public finances in Canada.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In addressing the bill I would really like to ask a question. Do 
we do anything here other than provide the veneer of democratic 
decision making to what goes on in the massive leviathan we 
call the Government of Canada?
<P>
	Historically our system did not begin in Parliament. It began 
with the crown. The crown would periodically call together 
Parliament in order to get Parliament's input into important 
decisions. The crown would do that because it needed tax dollars 
and felt that a process of consultation with both the Lords and 
the Commons would aid in getting their consent to raise tax 
dollars in the general governance of the country.
<P>
<B>(1810 ) </B>
<P>
	As British history unfolded, Parliament asserted more and 
more its rights, not only to give its approval and its input, but to 
control the entire process: to control the agenda, to select 
ministers, to ultimately provide responsible government and 
democratic control over the affairs of the crown.
<P>
	The funny thing about this is that as time went on the process 
almost reversed itself. Gradually Parliament pushed the crown 
out as the governing force in British democratic countries. As 
soon as that happened, the government increasingly became a 
force very much independent of Parliament, until it is as we have 
it today, where estimates are presented in the hundreds of 
billions of dollars, approved by Parliament without serious 
scrutiny, almost on a ritualistic basis. We saw that here last 
week.
<P>
	Auditors General have pointed out on many occasions, and in 
many different ways, that Parliament has lost control of the 
estimate process. The question will increasingly arise, 
particularly as we go through this period of governments cutting 
spending, cutting favours and the goodies which they give to the 
population, as to why people believe that this process protects 
their interests, protects their tax dollars and protects their 
financial interests.
<P>
	We are talking about the estimates and a bill to expand the 
scrutiny of Parliament beyond the estimates. Previous to getting 
involved in politics I spent some time as a student and as a 
professional studying the history of federal government 
spending.
<P>
	One of the things that really strikes us when we look at what 
has occurred since the second world war is the relative decline in 
non-statutory spending as a proportion of the total and the 
increase in statutory programs as the significant element in 
federal government spending. Thirty years ago about one-third 
of all spending was of a statutory nature. Today it is well over 
two-thirds, as previous speakers have pointed out. That is not 
simply due to the increase in our debt and the statutory interest 
payments, it is also due to the focus which we increasingly have 
on a small number of statutory programs, mainly in the area of 
social spending.
<P>
	It is unbelievable to realize that this portion of spending is not 
at all controlled by the estimate process. It is only mentioned in 
the estimates. Information is provided, but it is not controlled at 
all. In fact, there is no formal review mechanism for Parliament 
on this 70 per cent of spending.
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary commented, as he has before, on 
the question of the cost effectiveness of these cost control 
measures. I find it distressing that the question of cost 
effectiveness only seems to come up on cost control measures 
and never on the actual spending programs in the first place.
<P>
	The hon. member for St. Albert gave us the example of the 
problem with the disability aspects of the Canada pension plan, 
which is a statutory program. I know in my own riding that we 
have recently dealt with cases where there are serious problems 
in program administration and in the attendant conduct and 
administration of the program. However, because it is a statuto-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11224"> 11224 </A></B>
<P>
ry program there is no regular review conducted through the 
parliamentary process.
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary also mentioned the resources 
that it might tie up to review these programs. One fact that needs 
to be mentioned is that we are talking about a large number of 
dollars but a small number of programs. There are 11 major 
statutory programs. There are payments under the Farm Income 
Protection Act. There are payments under the International 
Financial Organizations Act.
<P>
<B>(1815) </B>
<P>
	There is the public debt charge program. There is the fiscal 
transfer program to the provinces. There are military pensions in 
the Department of National Defence; payments to the provinces 
for health and medical care; payments to the provinces for CAP, 
the Canada assistance plan; the old age security program; grants 
to municipalities and other authorities under the real property 
program of the Department of Public Works; post-secondary 
education payments; and payments to railway companies by the 
National Transportation Agency under the Western Grain 
Transportation Act.
<P>
	These 11 programs account for 97 per cent of all statutory 
spending. In effect they account for over two-thirds of all 
federal government spending. They are the 11 programs for 
which the bill suggests there should be a mechanism to review 
on an ongoing basis.
<P>
	It is a new way. It is a suggestion to deal with what are some 
fairly obvious difficulties. I hope no one in his right mind, even 
in the government, would hold up the way we have conducted 
the public finances of the country in the last generation as a 
proper way to do business.
<P>
	We know from our background, wherever we came from, that 
we cannot run the Government of Canada as a committee of 295 
people. We know generally what happens when committees try 
to run anything, but especially a committee of 295 people.
<P>
	The bill suggests that Parliament use its authority, rather then 
just have vague political debates and vague political reviews, to 
set up a formal mechanism that properly evaluates the 
non-political aspects of major spending and that Parliament be 
provided with a formal way of reviewing the technical aspects. 
The inevitable political debates will accompany that.
<P>
	I cannot see how that will use a lot of resources. I cannot see 
how it can possibly be ineffective in some kind of cost way. It 
would seem to me it is just a logical development now that the 
major programs occupy such a large percentage of our spending.
<P>
	I know the hon. member for St. Albert is aware that adopting a 
bill such as this one would plug a very small hole in our boat. We 
have lots of holes. It is safe to say that we are not only taking in a 
lot of water. Our boat has been sitting at the bottom of the ocean 
for some time.
<P>
	Maybe a bill like this one and thinking a little more 
constructively and innovatively in this direction would help us 
eventually construct the giant crane we will need to pull the 
financial boat up from the bottom of the ocean and get it back to 
the surface where it needs to be.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
should like to participate in the debate from the perspective of a 
member of the House who is here to represent the constituents of 
Calgary Southeast.
<P>
	I know why I came to Parliament. I came here to look for 
accountability. I came here to look for responsibility. I came 
here to make a difference. Those elements of my life are 
extremely important to me.
<P>
	As I listened to my colleagues tonight I was absolutely 
astounded and amazed to realize how very little a part I can play 
in actually touching the heartbeat of government when I will not 
be able to make a difference in 71 per cent of its program 
spending.
<P>
	This was a tremendous surprise to me and I guess I would have 
to say a major disappointment. In everything I do as I represent 
constituents of Calgary Southeast I look at the questions that 
were asked by my colleague from St. Albert. Is what I am doing 
relevant? That would apply to anything I would be reviewing 
here. Certainly when I look at applications that come from the 
human resources department for grants and applications to help 
employment opportunities, I always ask a question of the 
submission: Is it relevant?
<P>
<B>(1820) </B>
<P>
	What kind of effect will that relevance have not only on the 
constituents I represent but on all Canadians? I get all kinds of 
letters as do all members from constituents who are extremely 
frustrated with the spending practices not only of the 
government but governments of the past. If it does not pass the 
test of relevancy then I have to ask the question: Why not? What 
can we do to make it better? What can we do to fix it?
<P>
	When looking at effectiveness and meeting its objectives I 
have to ask: Are the objectives even established? I cannot say 
the number of times I have looked at projects or proposals and 
there has been no long range planning.
<P>
	The minister of defence has been challenged many times in 
the last month on looking at meeting objectives and having 
objectives for spending. They have been missing. I was 
absolutely amazed and appalled that although short term goals 
were 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11225"> 11225 </A></B>
<P>
laid out in the budget that were to be met, the long range goal 
must have been missing. All kinds of changes to the budget 
came after the fact.
<P>
	The hon. Minister of Canadian Heritage has been challenged a 
number of times on changes made to budget statements and to 
program estimates. If we are not effective in establishing 
objectives, how can we possibly hope to meet them if they are 
missing from the documentation?
<P>
	I came here to vote on absolutely everything. On any piece of 
legislation that came before the House I wanted to give 
expression to what I felt was important. It disturbs me when 71 
per cent of the decisions we make in the House of Commons are 
non-votable items. Canadians must be absolutely appalled to be 
hearing that tonight. I certainly am stunned to hear of that kind 
of spending without any accountability to anybody.
<P>
	Where is the openness? Where is the effectiveness of the 
money I am giving to the government through my tax dollars? 
Where is the accountability?
<P>
	Another question I often put when I receive requests for 
assistance is: Is the delivery efficient? If it is not, how can we 
continue to go through the process over and over again of giving 
money to the same kinds of programs without even looking at 
the efficiencies?
<P>
	Once again we come back to objectives. Are their objectives 
in place? Are those objectives being met? In the corporate sector 
everybody always evaluates what they do. Business would not 
survive if it did not have that part of the expenditure process at 
the end of every year where an evaluation based on delivery is 
actually done.
<P>
	My husband works in the corporate sector. Believe me, he is 
accountable to his managers and they in turn are accountable to 
their superiors to look at efficient and effective delivery of 
product. If that does not happen, they are out of business.
<P>
	Then we come to the final question: Is there a better way? My 
colleagues from St. Albert in all good faith brought forward a 
non-votable bill. This is the place for rational and reasoned 
debate. This is where we should be able to talk about the issues 
of the day, to have a broad discussion with everyone 
participating.
<P>
	What do we have? We have a handful of people standing in the 
House tonight talking about a major concern for Canadians: 
accountability in terms of how we spend money. It is 
disappointing to hear that we are doing well enough and that we 
can defend the status quo because we truly are into new times 
that demand a different point of view, a different way of doing 
business. If we undertake to look at it honestly and directly from 
a different point of view, we will be able to hold government 
accountable. We as parliamentarians will be able to stand in 
front of our constituents and say that we made a difference in the 
35th Parliament.
<P>
<B>(1825) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> There being no further members rising 
to debate the bill and it not being designated as a votable item, 
the time provided for the consideration of Private Members' 
Business has now expired and the bill is dropped from the Order 
Paper.

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House, in light of the UN Security Council consideration of renewed 
mandates for UN forces in the former Yugoslavia, take note of the rotation of 
Canadian forces serving with UNPROFOR in Bosnia-Hercegovina and Croatia.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I welcome the opportunity this evening 
to have a debate before the government decides on yet another 
difficult position for Canada in terms of the deployment of its 
troops in the former Yugoslavia.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I would like to begin by drawing to the attention of the House 
the efforts of the international community to reach a diplomatic 
settlement of the conflict in the former Yugoslavia. The world 
community has made significant efforts to resolve the conflict 
in the Balkans and has used various means to do so, including 
crisis diplomacy, the imposition of sanctions, the establishment 
of prohibited air zones and, of course, the deployment of 
UNPROFOR.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Currently UNPROFOR is made up of 38 national contingents 
or specialized units, totalling about 39,000 military personnel. 
There are about 5,300 civilians also assigned to the particular 
force, making it the largest peacekeeping mission ever put 
together by the United Nations. Eleven NATO countries are 
providing about 44 per cent of the total personnel and Canada is 
foremost among those countries.
<P>
	UNPROFOR was created in February 1992 specifically to 
monitor the ceasefire between the Croatian and Krajina-Serb 
forces, to supervise this demilitarized UN protected area, and to 
try to bring some kind of semblance of normal life back to the 
people in the region.
<P>
	As the situation deteriorated to the south in 
Bosnia-Hercegovina in September 1992, UNPROFOR's 
mandate was expanded to provide security for humanitarian 
relief efforts in the region. As we know, an UNPROFOR element 
was deployed to the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11226"> 11226 </A></B>
<P>
former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to help deter possible 
aggression.
<P>
	In the brief time I have this evening I want to talk about the 
situation in Croatia because it is becoming much more relevant 
to Canada and the Canadian position in the former Yugoslavia.
<P>
	The conflict between Croatia and the Krajina-Serbs, as I said, 
has been at an impasse since 1992. At the root of the impasse is 
Croatia's determination to regain sovereignty over about 30 per 
cent of the territory held by the Krajina-Serbs who are reticent 
to disarm in the process.
<P>
	Talks have been held under the auspices of the international 
conference on the former Yugoslavia in November 1993. A 
three-part strategy was set out to help resolve the problem.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	First, a ceasefire had to be established, then discussions held 
on economic issues and, finally, agreement reached on a form of 
political reconciliation. This strategy permitted some progress.
<P>
	In December 1993, the Croatian government and 
representatives of the Serbs in the area reached an agreement on 
setting up a series of ceasefires. At the end of March 1994, a 
general ceasefire agreement had been signed between the 
Croatian government and the Krajina-Serb authorities. 
UNPROFOR succeeded in making sure the agreement held, one 
of its various achievements in Croatia.
<P>
<B>(1830) </B>
<P>
	At the same time, this agreement caused considerable concern 
among the Croatian population. These people were afraid they 
would be victims of a situation like that persisting in Cyprus and 
were concerned that the country would be permanently divided 
by UNPROFOR.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Nonetheless, the general ceasefire did raise expectations that 
an economic agreement and ultimately a political settlement 
were within reach. Efforts to reach a lasting settlement in 
Croatia were dealt a shocking blow on January 12, 1995 when 
the Croatian president, Dr. Franjo Tudjman, informed the UN 
secretary-general that his government would not renew the 
mandate of UNPROFOR in Croatia beyond March 31.
<P>
	President Tudjman said that Croatia's experience over the 
past two years had led him to conclude: ``Although UNPROFOR 
has played an important role in stopping violence and major 
conflicts in Croatia, it is an indisputable fact that the present 
character of the UNPROFOR mission does not provide 
conditions necessary for establishing lasting peace and order in 
the republic of Croatia''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Before looking at the events in Croatia and at the United 
Nations following the dramatic statement by Mr. Tudjman, I 
would like to consider the diplomatic situation in 
Bosnia-Hercegovina. The efforts that went into resolving the 
conflict there paralleled the war itself.
<P>
	At the start of 1994, Muslims and Croatians in Bosnia reached 
an agreement resulting in a ceasefire and constituting a major 
step in establishing a federation encompassing the two groups.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This ceasefire continues to hold. It is monitored by 
UNPROFOR. In central Bosnia, CANBAT 2 has tasks related to 
monitoring this ceasefire. Of course we have our troops also in 
the Krajina region, CANBAT 1. We also have a group largely in 
the service area located in Split.
<P>
	This three-part conflict in Bosnia-Hercegovina has been 
stabilized to some degree. The international community has 
turned its attention to finding a solution to the conflict between 
the Bosnian muslims and the Bosnian Serbs.
<P>
	As we know, to inject more life into this the contact group was 
established with Great Britain, France, the European Union, the 
United States and the Russian federation in April 1994. This 
group has worked particularly diligently in trying to get a 
solution.
<P>
	Its first proposition was to redraw the map in a post-conflict 
Bosnia whereby the Bosnian muslims and Croats would receive 
about 51 per cent of the territory and the Bosnian Serbs about 49 
per cent. The parties were also offered a number of incentives 
and disincentives to encourage their acceptance of the new plan.
<P>
	Like previous international offers, the plan was rejected in a 
Bosnian-Serb referendum by more than 90 per cent of the 
voters. Despite these setbacks, the contact group and the 
warring parties have continued.
<P>
	There was another development recently, before the year end. 
Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter met with officials in both 
Sarajevo and Pale and succeeded in negotiating an agreement 
for a countrywide ceasefire in Bosnia-Hercegovina and the 
opening of negotiations for an end to hostilities by January 1, 
1995.
<P>
	On December 31, 1994 the Government of 
Bosnia-Hercegovina and the Bosnian Serbs signed a cessation 
of hostilities agreement to take effect along the lines of 
confrontation for a four month period ending in April 1995.
<P>
	This agreement is being supervised and monitored by 
UNPROFOR, including our troops. The agreement calls for a 
separation of the forces, full freedom of movement, the opening 
of the Sarajevo airport, restoration of utilities, exchanges of 
prisoners of war and the withdrawal of all foreign troops.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11227"> 11227 </A></B>
<P>
	Throughout the first two months of 1995 the agreement held 
with only minor violations. By late February violations had 
increased and most observers do not expect a ceasefire to last 
beyond the next few weeks. We hope that common ground may 
be found between the parties whereby an agreement may be 
extended. One can only hope that these negotiations begin very 
quickly.
<P>
	On the current diplomatic situation on the UN mandate, it is 
useful to set the tone. This is the backdrop by which we will 
perhaps redeploy our troops starting next week.
<P>
<B>(1835 ) </B>
<P>
	President Tudjman, after considerable pressure, very 
courageously decided to re-evaluate his original thinking. He 
agreed to a continuation of an albeit smaller UN reformulated 
presence, a different kind of mandate. It is more along the 
traditional peacekeeping lines that Canada participated in 
during our years in Cyprus whereby we work the line between 
two hostile factions.
<P>
	President Tudjman envisages a new independent force to be 
established. This new mission should help to implement the 
ceasefire agreement and it should assist in the implementation 
of the economic agreement, the one I mentioned earlier. It 
should also put in place elements of the existing UN 
peacekeeping plan for Croatia. That continues to be accepted by 
both parties, including the maintenance of UN presence on 
international borders as well as confidence building and 
humanitarian measures such as assistance to refugees and 
displaced persons, protection of ethnic minorities, mine 
clearance, convoy assistance and the like.
<P>
	As the current UNPROFOR mandate expires in two days, the 
UN must reach some kind of agreement on the renewal of its 
presence. The United Nations is now working very closely with 
all the parties involved to reach a workable agreement on this 
continued UN presence. Canada has been a party to many of 
these discussions.
<P>
	The UN secretary-general has proposed three distinct 
missions in the region to meet the unique circumstances in 
Croatia, Bosnia and the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia.
<P>
	Canada's position is that we say to Canadians we know their 
feelings of pride in Canada in trying to assist in this very 
difficult situation in the heart of Europe. Canadians have been 
quite happy to do their part with their continued presence in both 
Croatia and Bosnia. We also understand that Canadians are 
becoming a little bit concerned that this deployment not be open 
ended and that we not continue ad infinitum.
<P>
	I think we were in Cyprus for about 29 years. We do not plan 
to be in Bosnia and Croatia for 29 years. We on the government's 
part are obviously re-evaluating our commitment to the region. 
We do not want to walk out on our allies, on the UN. We have all 
been in this together. We believe there can be a negotiated 
settlement.
<P>
	From a Canadian point of view, we hope that we can start to 
reduce our presence in the region somewhat but at the same time 
try to continue the good work we have been involved in. In other 
words, we believe that perhaps with a reformulated mandate in 
Croatia and a heightened Canadian presence there, we may be 
able to more effectively contribute in that area. That would be 
for the UN to decide whether or not it wants us to continue in 
both theatres, Bosnia-Hercegovina and Croatia, or whether or 
not it wants us to concentrate our efforts in Croatia.
<P>
	These are the questions with which we are grappling at this 
time. Canada certainly is willing to continue to do its part in the 
region. We feel it is incumbent upon the government to listen to 
the views of members of Parliament.
<P>
	As I said, two battalions of the Royal 22nd Regiment are 
ready to deploy. We have about 2,100 people in 
Bosnia-Hercegovina and in Croatia. We have another 400 to 500 
in the area generally, the UN observers, the people with 
Operation Sharp Guard on our ships, and the people who have 
been involved in the airlift operation of supplies to Sarajevo. We 
have quite a commitment in the region.
<P>
	Before I conclude, I want to underscore Canada's willingness 
to be flexible in helping the UN address the concerns. I also want 
to underscore the fact that Canada's commitment in this 
particular operation cannot last indefinitely.
<P>
<B>(1840 ) </B>
<P>
	We believe Canadians want us to review our participation. 
They welcome the views of parliamentarians to see whether we 
should continue with this particular rotation for another six 
months and perhaps talk about scaling down in the fall after we 
have further discussions. Perhaps the Croatian force itself, the 
idea of it, will become a bit more mature and well defined.
<P>
	Perhaps the best posture for us to take is to continue with this 
rotation. As I said in the House the other day, we do have 
flexibility. We could decide not to rotate. We could keep some of 
our troops there for a number of weeks while alternate 
arrangements are made. Obviously, getting so close to the wire 
with a number of scenarios unfolding, especially with the new 
force in Croatia, we feel that may be very difficult to do from the 
point of view of the UN. We do not want to let the UN down.
<P>
	However, we do believe we are coming very close to the point 
when Canada has to make some significant changes in its 
commitment in the region. We welcome any ideas the UN may 
have for continued Canadian presence which will demonstrate 
to Canadians that we are just not there indefinitely performing 
the same valuable functions, but that we are making progress 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11228"> 11228 </A></B>
<P>
toward a peaceful settlement and that Canadian participation is 
helping to move in that direction.
<P>
	I will be very interested to hear the views of members 
opposite. Unfortunately I will not be able to stay for the entire 
debate. My parliamentary secretary is here, as well as the 
Parliamentary Secretary for the Minister of Foreign Affairs, 
who will be taking notes and taking part in the debate.
<P>
	I want to assure hon. members that once we have the views of 
the members this evening, they certainly will be taken into 
account. The government will address the views expressed in 
the debate tomorrow morning. We will have something more to 
say on the matter of the deployment at some point tomorrow.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I think that we can all congratulate ourselves for 
the fine job our Canadian soldiers did in Bosnia and Croatia.
<P>
	Having said this, I do not think we can be so proud of what the 
Canadian government did and above all of what it failed to do 
during these peacekeeping missions, since the situation is far 
from rosy in Bosnia and Croatia as the UN's mandate expires 
and as we draw near to the end of a very important ceasefire in 
Bosnia.
<P>
	On the diplomatic level, the situation is at a standstill, the 
stalemate remains to be broken and the efforts of the contact 
group have been relatively unfruitful. Therefore, compared with 
last year, it is a dead-end situation which has dragged on. There 
is not even a hope on the horizon of resolving it peacefully.
<P>
	On the military level, the situation is hardly any better, it is 
even worse than it has ever been and, recently, the situation 
rapidly deteriorated once again. We know that over the past four 
days or so, there have been no fewer than a dozen confrontations 
in Bosnia, mostly orchestrated by the Bosnian government. It is 
attacking strategic positions in the hopes of gaining more 
leverage in negotiations, and of course the Serbs are retaliating. 
There have been 12 to 14 battles over the past four days.
<P>
	The Serbs, quite recently by the way, have opened up artillery 
fire on four positions in protected areas, in contravention of all 
of the existing agreements. Last Sunday, Bosnian Serbs called 
for a general mobilization, which will certainly not relieve any 
tension in the area. At the same time, the new general of 
UNPROFOR, Rupert Smith, who is from Britain, threatened air 
strikes against Serb positions if they shell neutral zones. The 
Serbs issued a reply, of course: they would consider all 
peacekeepers stationed there as enemies if NATO were to attack 
their positions.
<P>
<B>(1845) </B>
<P>
	We know that the Serbs are serious when they make threats of 
this kind, since they took and held hostages, around fifty 
Canadian peacekeepers, the last time we used air strikes.
<P>
	In reality, we are faced with, on the one hand, the Serbs, who 
have decided to wage a war of attrition, mostly against 
peacekeeping missions. The Serbs know that we are there 
temporarily, that it is costing us, that public support for a 
peacekeeping presence in the former Yugoslavia may wane, that 
one day we will have to leave, and that, from that moment on, 
they will have the Bosnians' blood. They, who have been 
fighting for centuries, know that they have all the time in the 
world and that it is essentially only a matter of time.
<P>
	So they say let the hands of time keep on turning, in the end, it 
is the Serbs who will prevail. After spending so much money, 
unfortunately also after wasting so many human lives, the Allied 
Forces of the UN will have to withdraw, probably in 
humiliation, and leave the area for the Serbs' taking. Their 
calculation is quite obvious. They do not negotiate or they 
negotiate only when threatened by an immediate air strike. As 
soon as the heat is off, before the coalition can regroup, they 
return to their former positions, they violate ceasefires, they 
attack protected zones. It is an never-ending cat and mouse 
game.
<P>
	As for the Croats, now that the mandate is about to expire, 
they have all kinds of demands: that the mandate be redefined; 
that units be split up-apparently, the UN is about to agree to 
this demand-so that, instead of a single UN force, there would 
be three contingents, one in Macedonia, one in Bosnia and one in 
Croatia, under a diversified command which could be a UN 
general co-ordinating operations. But they also have demands 
regarding the contingents. Although we are currently unable to 
carry out the missions entrusted to us, although there are not 
enough troops to do all the tasks that are assigned, they want to 
reduce contingents from 12,000 to 5,000 troops. We are 
negotiating with people who need our presence to keep the 
peace, who need enough people to achieve the desired results.
<P>
	All this after nearly two years of presence if not more and for 
us, Canadians, $314 million in expenditures, 10 soldiers killed 
during operations, not to mention those who have recently 
committed suicide-we do not know too much about this, but we 
can assume that some suicides are linked to the operations 
conducted over there or feared by those who do not want to go.
<P>
	This is the context in which the government is inviting the 
opposition parties to participate in a debate, but a debate on 
what? The motion calls for the House to take note of the April 
rotation of Canadian forces. What does that mean? Does it mean 
that it has already been decided that there will be a rotation? 
Will the government claim today that no decision had been made 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11229"> 11229 </A></B>
<P>
yet? Does this mean that tomorrow night, the government could 
move  to replace 1,600 troops, two 800 member contingents, and 
deal with aircraft, logistics, transportation, options? Are they 
trying to tell us that no decision has been made yet?
<P>
	The very wording of the motion shows that I am right. They 
are laughing at Parliament today. They are laughing at us.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> A debate on what? What kind of debate is 
this? How can we seriously debate this issue, when the 
government has not even taken stock of the situation over there, 
when there is no assessment, no information? All that we know, 
we have learned from reading the papers. The government never 
provided us with any significant, specific and clear information 
on anything that went on over there. It never told us how the 
operations were evaluated, or what it was prognosticating. We 
were never told whether our troops were there for the duration or 
only a certain length of time, and in which case, how long that 
would be. We know nothing. We are kept in the dark.
<P>
	We are expected do drink in the words of the Minister of 
National Defence and take leaps of faith, sign blank cheques and 
continue to send troops who operate in total frustration over 
there, not knowing what their mandate is, not being authorized 
by military authorities to conduct the operations that need to be 
conducted. They are helpless witnesses to revolting situations: 
children being tortured and killed, people being blown to pieces, 
civilians becoming live targets for blind fire from the hills. We 
are despatching our troops under very poor conditions. Are they 
there for the duration and under what conditions?
<P>
<B>(1850) </B>
<P>
	I think that the position the government finds itself today is 
such that it does not have much of a choice. The only argument it 
has left is to say: ``We do not have any choice; we have to 
maintain our presence over there''. The worst of it is that they 
are right: we do not have a choice.
<P>
	We do not have a choice because, by its failure to act, its 
negligence and its superficial commitments, the government has 
put itself in such a position that we do not have any choice any 
more. A government or state that bases its policies on arguments 
like: ``We do not have a choice'' is in big trouble.
<P>
	I think that this is the kind of action that has to be decided as a 
matter of choice, deliberately, for humanitarian reasons, on 
compassionate grounds, as a show of solidarity. In this case, the 
decision is based on an absence of policy. This government does 
not have a policy.
<P>
	I dare anyone to get a serious response from government to 
the questions: what is Canada's policy regarding peacekeeping 
missions, what are the guiding principles, on what basis are 
decisions made regarding these operations? These questions 
will remain unanswered because they do not know.
<P>
	We know for a fact that the government, through its members 
on the foreign affairs committee which reviewed Canada's 
foreign policy, agreed with the opposition that some criteria and 
standards were now required, and that we could no longer make 
individual commitments on a case-by-case basis in operations 
such as this one, where people die and where incredible amounts 
of money are spent in vain, without making a difference. The 
fact is that we did not make any progress whatsoever since last 
year. On the contrary, the issue is becoming more and more 
insoluble and it is increasingly obvious that we have reached a 
deadlock.
<P>
	We wanted to get information from the government. We 
wanted the government to table these documents and set up a 
House committee, but all we got was an advance notice of a few 
hours yesterday. Indeed, yesterday afternoon we suddenly 
received notice of a debate on Bosnia and Croatia. Earlier today, 
we managed to get a one-hour briefing from defence officials 
who were very co-operative in answering our questions. 
However, we did not get the necessary files, the basic 
information required.
<P>
	If the government is serious about this issue, it should allow a 
House committee to review the situation and hear witnesses, and 
it should also make these documents available. If we have to 
respect parliamentary secrecy, if the members of such a 
committee have to work in secrecy, they will do it. We are all 
responsible people, whether we belong to the Reform Party, the 
Bloc Quebecois or the Liberal Party. We could conduct an 
in-depth review of the situation in Bosnia and Croatia, because 
right now we do not know what is going on.
<P>
	Because the government let the events dictate its policy, we 
do have to remain there, since nothing was solved and the 
situation is still the same. From a humanitarian point of view, we 
are well aware that if, under the current conditions, UN troops 
were to withdraw, including the Canadian peacekeepers, the 
whole Sarajevo population could die of hunger.
<P>
	All the food that enters the city is airlifted by UN forces, 
along with water, gas, medication and so on. People barely 
survive in extremely harsh conditions and almost unacceptable 
sanitary conditions, but they do survive thanks to the 
humanitarian assistance provided by peacekeeping forces in 
Bosnia.
<P>
	We are well aware that the UN mission in Bosnia is essentially 
humanitarian in nature. It is a military one in Croatia, since 
there is a buffer zone that keeps the factions apart with, in the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11230"> 11230 </A></B>
<P>
middle, the UN forces. But in the case of Bosnia, it is far more 
than that. It is humanitarian. It is a matter of helping people to 
survive.
<P>
	So can we just decide to withdraw? Of course not. We know 
perfectly well we cannot. The government knew this. The 
government thought that by starting this debate, it would 
necessarily get the support of the opposition.
<P>
	However, although we cannot do otherwise, we are aware that 
the government has failed in several respects, in that it does not 
put its cards on the table and give us a chance to make informed 
decisions. In a democracy, people want to make informed 
decisions. They want to know why, because they want to choose 
the best option. In this case, we have no option.
<P>
	From the military point of view, we know what would happen 
if we left right away. We know that in Croatia, it would be a 
signal for all-out war. People are just waiting for a chance to 
attack each other. And of course in Bosnia, the Serbs would try, 
and they would probably succeed in settling their differences 
with the Bosnians, in ways we can well imagine.
<P>
<B>(1855) </B>
<P>
	Without the presence of tv cameras and without UN forces, we 
can imagine the kind of atrocities that would take place. It would 
be total war, a war that would not be contained, that would 
spread to the Balkan powder keg towards Greece. We know that 
the Greeks sympathize with the Serbs and have done so for 
centuries, and that the Serbs might depend on the support that 
the Greeks might be tempted to give them. The Turks support the 
Bosnians.
<P>
	Finally, there are any number of reasons why we would see an 
incredible explosion of hostilities with all the consequences this 
might have for relations between the major powers. What would 
be the position of the Soviet Union if there was an outbreak of 
armed conflict of this magnitude? We can assume this would 
make international tensions even worse tense. In other words, 
we are trapped.
<P>
	What we would like to see is for the government to commit 
itself, with the help of the opposition who would be glad to 
oblige, to identifying certain criteria before getting into this 
kind of trap, and second, to setting conditions for the renewal of 
the mandate. I think the government should set certain 
conditions. It has already said that it would not agree to have the 
arms embargo withdrawn. I think the government has already 
adopted this as its policy, and we support that policy. I think one 
of the conditions would have to be that the embargo must be 
maintained, because on the American side, there is a strong 
movement in favour of lifting the embargo.
<P>
	Second, it must ensure that ceasefires will last. Ceasefires 
tend to have a very short life expectancy in that part of the world. 
There have been dozens and dozens of cease-fire violations. We 
must be able to set certain conditions. The UN will have to agree 
to identify more specific mandates. We must have a better idea 
of what we are going to do. To what extent can we reciprocate 
and in what way?
<P>
	We have to know more about this, especially in connection 
with air strikes. For instance, does General Smith have the 
authority to carry out the threat he made recently without any 
input from Canada? Can they go ahead with air strikes without 
consulting the Canadian government? The answer would seem 
to be yes, in certain instances. It appears that, for reasons of 
defence, for example, General Smith is at liberty to launch air 
strikes. This is less clear in the case of offensive action, in which 
Canada apparently has some say, if only for reasons of defence, 
which we understand, in order to protect the lives of the 
peacekeeping force.
<P>
	This means that things can escalate. We know very well how 
the Serbs will react to air raids on their positions. It is the people 
in the area who will pay. Who is going to be there? Our soldiers. 
There is also the whole question of morale in the Canadian 
armed forces as a backdrop. We will talk about this again in the 
House.
<P>
	It seems to me the Canadian forces are going through a crisis. 
It seems to me that these peace missions have severely taxed 
their ability to meet these challenges. We might be tempted to 
think that, for the military, these missions are exotic tours of 
duty in faraway lands. Some might think that since apparently 
they do not have to engage the enemy, it is not an unpleasant 
business. We realize, however, that these missions are very hard 
and, perhaps, harder psychologically than traditional missions, 
because there is no clear objective, because these people often 
do not know why they are there and because they must remain 
impassive in the face of totally incomprehensible, uncivilized 
and unacceptable behaviour.
<P>
	I think the Minister of National Defence should say more in 
this respect to the House. I am sure he has reports on morale in 
the Canadian forces, and I believe it is in the interest of all of us 
in this House to be informed of the constraints and of the actions 
that need to be taken in this area.
<P>
	Therefore, the opposition's response, the one the government 
expected, the one it forces us to give, is yes. A very conditional 
yes. A yes that comes with lots of questions and doubts. Not a 
very happy yes.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
<B>(1900) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, at the outset I would like to advise you we will be 
splitting our times-
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11231"> 11231 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> There seems to be confusion about 
that. After the first three members, no member can speak for 
more than 10 minutes and so we will not have the dividing of 
time. This member has 20 minutes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Frazer:</B> Mr. Speaker, I hate to start on a complaining 
note, but I feel I must. The timing of this debate is the one I 
would like to address. I would much rather have risen to my feet 
to discuss our commitment to Bosnia and Croatia in December 
or I suppose we could have accepted January.
<P>
	To be rising two days before the commitment is to come to an 
end seems to me to be very late in the game. Moreover, until 
very late this afternoon there has been no consultation 
whatsoever or briefings presented by the government. This 
seems to be a very dramatic oversight on the part of the 
government.
<P>
	I think that the opposition parties, while we represent 
different philosophies, are certainly also trying to represent 
Canadians and present their views in this House.
<P>
	It strikes me that we have two committees, the Standing 
Committee on National Defence and Veterans Affairs and on 
foreign affairs, both of which would be appropriate forums to 
have discussed the possibilities of extension, the difficulties and 
the ramifications of extending the mandate in Bosnia.
<P>
	We have heard overtures that this might happen, but as yet it 
has not. I think it is a dramatic oversight on the part of the 
government. I request very strongly it reconsider this and in 
future involve the opposition parties more deeply in this type of 
negotiation.
<P>
	To move into the situation, the background on Croatia is that it 
is a true peacekeeping operation as the definition goes. It is 
basically a separation zone which keeps antagonists apart. Once 
again I would like to pay tribute to our troops not only in Croatia 
but in Bosnia. They have done superb work and unquestionably 
are, if not the most professional, among the most professional 
who are performing the duty in the UN mandate.
<P>
	Bosnia is a totally different mandate because, to use the 
official term, it is humanitarian assistance. It is to try to separate 
three different groups of people who are rather antagonistic 
toward each other. They are again doing very good work under 
extremely difficult conditions that have really constrained their 
activities to a tremendous degree.
<P>
	By virtue of their flexibility, their professionalism, they have 
managed to create homogeneous or friendly 
situations-friendly is probably going too far-but acceptable 
situations in areas by interceding on a personal level with the 
local leaders. By showing without any question they are totally 
unbiased, that they have no favouritism, they have performed 
very well.
<P>
	It could be fairly safely said that Canada and perhaps one or 
two other nations are the only ones that can make the claim of 
being completely and totally unbiased.
<P>
	The problem is there have been many violations of 
agreements. We have seen rapes, we have seen murders, we have 
seen atrocities that are unspeakable. These are conducted by 
people who are committed to hate each other. It seems such a 
shame. It is such a beautiful country and there is so much 
prospect for it to prosper. Unhappily, it is caught up in what is 
truly a war.
<P>
	We have seen hostages taken. This comes about as a result 
normally of NATO exerting influence to try to coerce or force 
people to abide by agreements that they have made but choose 
not to abide by.
<P>
<B>(1905 ) </B>
<P>
	Canadians I think are in a particularly vulnerable position in 
this case because we are the only ones, to my knowledge, who 
are actually occupying positions in Serb held territory. The other 
UN forces are not so deployed.
<P>
	As a result, if the UN calls on NATO air support to achieve a 
change of heart on the part of Serb aggression, the Serbs will in 
all likelihood do as they have done before and they will take 
Canadian hostages. This has happened twice now and I think it is 
pipe smoking opium if we do not think that it will happen again 
if the situation arises.
<P>
	UN patrols have been fired on in both Bosnia and Croatia. In 
Croatia at New Year's two of our Canadian UN peacekeepers 
were wounded and it was only by some extraordinary effort on 
the part of one of them and good hospital facilities that resulted 
in no Canadian fatalities in this instance.
<P>
	There were a total of nine soldiers killed in the UN 
commitment in the former Yugoslavia. I think it is likely that if 
the situation continues, and it does appear to be heating up, we 
could very well be in danger of having even more casualties.
<P>
	We have seen the lifeline of Bosnia put in extreme danger or 
even cut off completely. The Sarajevo airport was closed for an 
extensive time. As recently as a couple of days ago UN 
aeroplanes were being shot up as they went in and out of the 
airport. This impacts of course on the ability of the UN and 
UNPROFOR to perform the duties they are there for which is to 
provide humanitarian assistance by delivering supplies to the 
people concerned.
<P>
	The problem is that there does not seem to be any particular 
desire on the part of the antagonists there to abide by agreements 
that they have made. We have seen aggression in the form of UN 
declared safe zones which are totally ignored and in fact 
attacked in dramatic fashion by the opposing forces, particularly 
the Serbs in this case.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11232"> 11232 </A></B>
<P>
	It appears that the UN really is a toothless monster. It makes 
agreements, gets concurrence in those and then the antagonists 
decide which one they are going to adhere to. As I mentioned 
before, we have seen atrocities committed and even now we are 
seeing more battles between the ethnic groups in the area.
<P>
	As far as any cease fire agreement, and we are now in an realm 
where a cease fire was declared some time ago, there is no cease 
fire because as the hon. leader of the official opposition has said, 
in the past four days I believe there have been 14 different 
violations recorded. As I understand from the briefing we were 
given an hour ago, these are relatively major incidents that are 
recorded because the sniper who shoots at an individual in 
Sarajevo is not considered to be a reportable incident. I am told 
that on average there are between 80 and 200 incidents reported 
daily. That adds up to a pretty hot war situation.
<P>
	All this came about because of mandate deficiencies. First, 
we did not have agreement from all parties concerned to involve 
ourselves or the UN in the area. We decided to impose ourselves 
there and they said: ``You are here but we did not agree to you 
being here''. There is no indication that they have changed their 
mind on that at all. They will go along with things they agree 
with, but the instant that it does not suit their purpose they go 
back to doing what they want to do. There is without question a 
lack of desire to achieve a peaceful resolution.
<P>
	I must say that if there were any sort of a light at the end of the 
tunnel, a view on the horizon, that there could be an 
accommodation which would last it would be a very different 
solution than we are facing.
<P>
	We have seen that UN agreements are unenforceable. The UN 
makes an agreement, people come forward and sign off on them 
and then sometimes within hours or a few days the thing is 
violated and it is gone.
<P>
<B>(1910 ) </B>
<P>
	It is patently obvious that despite the embargo arms are 
getting through. Word has it that the Bosnians are now armed to 
the extent that they feel relatively capable of operating on an 
even footing against the Serb forces. There is a lot of question as 
to the capability of the various forces, but it seems without any 
question that there is every likelihood that there will be what is 
referred to as a spring offensive. I sincerely hope this is not the 
case, but certainly every indication is that the war or the fighting 
in the area is becoming worse rather than tailing off.
<P>
	I think there are some unique Canadian problems which 
should be discussed. I will start with equipment. The 
government and the chief of defence staff have said-the chief 
of course is required to say that-that the equipment in fact is 
functional and is adequate. I would call it obsolescent, if not 
obsolete. Certainly when we were on the ground in Bosnia and in 
Croatia, particularly in Croatia with the M-113 armoured 
personnel carriers, there was no question in the minds of the 
people who  were using them that this was not a piece of kit that 
they really enjoyed. They are unreliable. The tracks broke 
regularly and they were not sufficiently armoured to do the job 
they were intended to do.
<P>
	The solution to this of course was to add additional armour to 
them. The problem with adding additional armour is that it adds 
to the weight. Adding to the weight means that the drive train 
will be in trouble, the suspension will give up and the fuel 
consumption will rise tremendously. That is not an adequate 
solution.
<P>
	The radios are vitally important in that situation, with 
observation posts and troops deployed in various areas; to be 
able to talk to the guy you want to talk to when you want to talk 
to him. We heard time and again from people that their radios 
were broken down. Everyone has become a fixer of 
communications equipment. That is unacceptable.
<P>
	The flack jackets that our personnel wear there are 
cumbersome and uncomfortable. We saw in Croatia a new 
design which was being tried out, but the ones which were issued 
to our troops, in their opinion, are unacceptable.
<P>
	We have a very poor night vision device available. That is 
absolutely unacceptable again because a lot of our observation 
posts are involved in night observations and if they cannot see or 
use them properly this is not good.
<P>
	I think the business of helmets has been discussed a couple of 
times and I understand if it were not so tragic it would be 
humorous. When we got the Kevlar helmets they were not blue. 
We decided to paint them, so we went out and bought some 
paint. The only problem was that the paint reacted with the 
Kevlar and they became soft and basically useless. The other UN 
forces I think who use those helmets have put canvas covers on 
them. Again, I do not think we did our homework.
<P>
	We also have a problem, in my estimation, with our people. 
First of all, I want to pay tribute to the co-operation, the 
professionalism, the dedication and the sincere interest that our 
people have shown and the way they have conducted 
themselves. However, I think we are rotating them through the 
operational zone too often. We have people who have been there 
three times. Soon if we keep up the rate we are doing, if we 
renew the commitment, we will have people on their fourth tours 
of operation.
<P>
	Many of these people are volunteers, and I understand that. 
However, I still think that from a man management point of 
view, this is not the way we should go. It is fine for the troops 
who are in the zone, but their families are tremendously 
impacted by the fact that they are away. Dad is out of the picture 
or, in some cases, mom. The children suffer, the family suffers 
and therefore it has to impact to an extent on morale.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11233"> 11233 </A></B>
<P>
	There is an increase in the incidence of alcoholism in the units 
that have been deployed. There have been increased disciplinary 
problems. This is natural because people are under an awful lot 
of tension and it will unquestionably affect them.
<P>
<B>(1915 ) </B>
<P>
	The whole thing boils down to a morale problem which I think 
would be difficult to deal with at the best of times. Added on to 
other problems that the Canadian force are now experiencing I 
think it is somewhat devastating. Basically we are asking our 
troops to be burned out. I do not think we can afford to do that.
<P>
	With regard to the mandate in Bosnia and Croatia, Reform in 
December last year laid down what we thought were four 
reasonable conditions which Canada should demand or we 
should withdraw. First, peacekeepers should be left alone. They 
should not be taken hostage. They should not be interfered with. 
Second, we asked that the Sarajevo airport be opened and left 
open in order that humanitarian assistance could be brought in. 
Third, we asked that all aid convoys be able to proceed 
unimpeded. Finally, we asked that a ceasefire be in place and be 
holding and be seen to be holding.
<P>
	The only one of these four proposals that has been met, and 
that is only recently, is the one to leave the peacekeepers alone. 
The Sarajevo airport has been closed many times. Aircraft have 
been shot at. Aid convoys have been held up or refused passage. 
Of course it is obvious there is no ceasefire and it is not holding.
<P>
	The Reform Party believes the solution to this is that Canada 
should accept the situation is not now resolved, nor is it likely to 
be in the near future. This is a situation where there are no white 
hats. Every one of the ethnic people in that area are to some 
extent responsible for atrocities: the Croats, Muslims and the 
Serbs. Some may be more prone to it than others but everyone is 
guilty to an extent.
<P>
	As I said just a few moments ago, Canadian resources are 
stretched to the limit. We should be aware of this and we have to 
accept it. It can be safely said that Canada has done her share. 
We have now committed our troops there for three years. We 
have done exemplary work. I do not think that anyone can point 
at Canada and say that we are not pulling our weight.
<P>
	There are other UN forces committed there that are much less 
efficient. Some of them are not doing their job at all. One 
particular unit, which I will not mention by name, has brand new 
armoured personnel carriers bought by the UN, purchased in 
Korea, and it refuses to use them. It wants to keep the mileage 
low because the UN depreciates them and it is then going to take 
them home in almost brand new condition.
<P>
	Other contingents will not go to the front lines. They will 
support only one side or the other in the conflict. It is only 
Canada and a few other nations that are truly perceived by the 
antagonists to be unbiased and impartial.
<P>
	The Reform Party proposes that Canada should say: ``We have 
done our share. It is time to withdraw our forces from Bosnia 
and Croatia''. We should say to the United Nations that we 
understand that it will take them some time to find 
replacements. I suggest that an initial timeframe of three 
months' grace be given, after which time Canada would 
withdraw from the region.
<P>
	I believe this is possible in Croatia. It might be more difficult 
in Bosnia. I do not think that Canada would be unreasonable if 
the time has to be extended. It could be but I think it should be 
extended by very short increments.
<P>
	Finally, we should have learned a very dramatic lesson from 
our involvement in Bosnia and Croatia. All of us have at some 
time understood that we got in there with the thought that we 
were going there to do good. We have done well. The problem is 
that there was no agreement.
<P>
	Canada should insist for instance that there be a time limit on 
our involvement. There should be an insistence that the people 
who are there want us there and that they want to come to a 
peaceful solution, that they want to solve the thing.
<P>
	The matter of rules of engagement must be very clearly 
specified and they must be acceptable to Canada before we say 
yes we will go in. The financial aspect should be discussed and 
approved.
<P>
<B>(1920 ) </B>
<P>
	Unless we do this, Canada may once again wind up in a 
commitment such as we have here where our withdrawal, 
without question, will result in an accelerated conflict. I see no 
way of avoiding this. By Canadians staying there we are just 
extending it.
<P>
	As the Leader of the Opposition said, we were 29 years in 
Cyprus and we certainly cannot stand 29 years in Bosnia and 
Croatia.
<P>
	Therefore, the Reform Party advocates that Canada tell the 
UN that we would like our commitment to come to an end. We 
will give it a three-month period of grace after which time we 
will effectively withdraw.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jesse Flis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we are witnessing today 
the democratization of Canada's foreign policy. It began with 
the review by the joint committee of the Senate and the House of 
Commons with certain recommendations to the government. 
The government responded and in that response it said that it 
wanted to involve Parliament in future important defence and 
foreign policy decisions. Therefore, I am very pleased that we 
are having this debate tonight. I recommend that we have more 
such debates.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11234"> 11234 </A></B>
<P>
	Two weeks ago the Minister of Foreign Affairs appeared 
before the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and 
International Trade. At that point, the minister wanted to know 
the positions of the official opposition and of the Reform Party. I 
will come back to that.
<P>
	Although I am pleased we are having the debate, I was truly 
shocked and disappointed by the remarks of the Leader of the 
Opposition when he opened his remarks by stating that he 
cannot be proud of what Canada has done or has not done. We on 
this side are very proud of what Canada has done in this conflict 
and we continue to be proud and supportive of these people.
<P>
	He went on to blame Canada further. He said that Canada had 
not done anything. Does the Leader of the Opposition not realize 
that we are one of a team and we cannot act unilaterally? I guess 
the team approach to things is not in the leader's vocabulary.
<P>
	Does he not realize that presently there are about 35 countries 
with 43,000 troops involved here? If it was not for all the 
negotiations that have been going on over all these years and all 
the troops and countries participating, who knows if we would 
not be in the middle of world war three today?
<P>
	Yes, lives have been lost. Yes, it is expensive. However, thank 
God that countries like Canada are participating because we may 
have warded off another world war.
<P>
	The Leader of the Opposition went on to complain that all we 
were debating the rotation and that the rotation has been 
decided. I ask the Leader of the Opposition to read what it is we 
are debating. It states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House, in light of the UN Security Council consideration of 
renewed mandates for UN forces in the former Yugoslavia-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is what we are debating. We are debating whether 
Canada should continue to keep its forces there or not. The 
rotation comes automatically. After the troops have been there 
six months they are replaced. However, if after a month Canada 
decides to pull out its troops, it pulls out fresh and strong troops, 
not tired troops.
<P>
	It is the mandate we are debating. The rotation is automatic 
after six months. I was disappointed that the hon. member could 
not distinguish between that.
<P>
<B>(1925 ) </B>
<P>
	He went on to say that we have no choice. I thought he was 
going to say that we have no choice whether to stay or pull out. 
We do have a choice. That is why we are having this debate.
<P>
	The Prime Minister, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, and the 
Minister of National Defence said that before making an 
important decision like this one, whether or not to renew the 
mandate, Parliament would be consulted. That is what we are 
doing. To stand and say that we have no choice does not help the 
government. We are looking for some leadership from the 
opposition to help Canadians make an important decision.
<P>
	The Leader of the Opposition went on to say: ``What is 
Canada's policy in peacekeeping missions?'' I suggest he read a 
bit of history. By going back to when the Prime Minister of 
Canada, Lester B. Pearson, recommended the peacekeeping 
forces. That role continues. We are changing that role. We are 
looking more at preventive measures, but the peacekeeping role 
continues. That is why Canada holds such an enviable position 
around the world.
<P>
	The Leader of the Opposition does not seem to realize that 
conflicts since the end of the cold war are much different. In 
those days, one state attacked another state. Peace was made and 
we sent peacekeepers to keep the peace. Now it is internal 
conflicts. It is ethnocultural conflicts. It is tribal conflicts, wars, 
killings and genocide within a country. That is a totally different 
kind of challenge.
<P>
	I was pleased that the Leader of the Opposition ended by 
saying: ``Yes, we should renew the mandate''. However he puts 
certain conditions on it. I guess it was a conditional yes. To be 
honest his remarks did not help the government very much to 
decide whether we should continue our mandate and keep our 
peacekeepers there or not.
<P>
	The official spokesperson for the Reform Party complained 
that we had no consultations. We have had consultations through 
the whole foreign policy review. The government responds. The 
foreign affairs standing committee had the Minister of Foreign 
Affairs before it just two weeks ago. We discussed the 
Bosnia-Hercegovina conflict. The minister asked point blank 
the members of the official opposition what was their position. 
The answer was similar to what we got tonight.
<P>
	When the minister asked the Reform Party, what the position 
was, the response was that they are split 50:50 on the issue. I was 
pleased that today the Reform Party made it clear that its 
position is to withdraw our forces. At least we know what the 
stand is, the position of the Reform Party.
<P>
	To answer the Leader of the Opposition, I want to remind him 
that Canada remains one of the strongest advocates of 
reinforcing UN's conflict prevention and conflict resolution 
capability. We have been working with like-minded countries at 
the UN to bring about reforms that will provide the organization 
with the political, financial and military tools it needs to fulfil 
its growing responsibilities.
<P>
	Canada is conducting a study on a UN rapid reaction 
capability and will host an international conference on the 
subject next week. We are organizing with our partners 
peacekeeping semi-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11235"> 11235 </A></B>
<P>
nars in the context of PAC, Regional Forum and the 
Organization for American States.
<P>
	We are also working with the Organization of African Union 
to improve the capability of African countries to better 
contribute to peacekeeping operations and preventive 
diplomacy.
<P>
	I do not want to finish my speech on Bosnia-Hercegovina 
without mentioning to all members that we have gone beyond 
peacekeeping. We are looking at conflict prevention. We are 
looking at reforming the United Nations so that our 
peacekeepers can be sent with a much clearer mandate.
<P>
<B>(1930 ) </B>
<P>
	I appeal to all members who will be taking part in the debate 
tonight, to the independent members, to the members on our 
government side, to the members of the Bloc Quebecois, the 
members of the Reform Party, to help the government make this 
important decision. Let us put our partisan politics aside. Let us 
hear what our constituents are telling us. Then we can make a 
very knowledgeable, intelligent and the right decision for 
Canada and hopefully for bringing peace to that area.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
an honour and a privilege for me to participate in this debate 
today on the participation of Canada in peacekeeping 
operations, and the one under way in the former Yugoslavia in 
particular.
<P>
	However, before I go any further, allow me to share a few 
thoughts, as the Leader of the Opposition did, on how this 
emergency debate was called by the government.
<P>
	First of all, what does the motion before us say? It says: ``That 
this House, in the light of the UN Security Council 
consideration''-which, by the way, has not been done yet-``of 
renewed mandates for UN forces in the former Yugoslavia, take 
note of the rotation of Canadian Forces serving with 
UNPROFOR in Bosnia-Hercegovina and Croatia''.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, the deadline is March 31, two days from now. 
With a deadline days away, the government decides to call an 
emergency debate, with 24 hours notice, on this issue.
<P>
	We do not have the slightest idea of what the terms and 
conditions of this mandate will be that the UN Security Council 
will review. As I said, while the current mandate regarding 
Croatia is due to expire on March 31, the Security Council has 
yet to make a decision on a new mandate. We do not have the 
slightest idea what is involved here, if, for instance, there will be 
a reduction in forces, as the Croatian government has given to 
understand. We do not know whether troop rotation will take 
place. We do not know. What we do know, however, is that the 
necessary logistic arrangements have already been made for 
Canadian troops to be rotated on Monday. That much we know.
<P>
	In order to be able to prepare for this debate for which the 
government gave us very little time, with only a few hours 
notice, we managed to meet briefly, less than an hour actually, 
just two hours ago, with officials from the departments of 
National Defence and Foreign Affairs. And that was only 
possible because we had requested to meet with them; 
otherwise, I wonder if any information would have been made 
available to us. We were fortunate to receive, minutes ago, a 
number of backgrounders from DND.
<P>
	How do you expect us to be able to make any significant 
contribution to a fundamental debate like this one under the 
circumstances?
<P>
	This debate aimed at renewing-even if the motion talks of 
``taking note'' of-Canada's peacekeeping mandate in the 
former Yugoslavia is somewhat inconsistent with the 
conclusions of the Special Standing Committee Reviewing 
Canada's Defence Policy and especially the dissenting report 
drafted at that time by the Bloc, which defines a number of 
criteria to be met for our participation in peacekeeping 
operations instead of making decisions on a piecemeal basis, as 
the Leader of the Opposition said. Again, we are acting on a 
case-by-case basis and that is disgraceful, given the 
recommendations in the report.
<P>
	This shows the arrogance of this government, which took for 
granted that the opposition would give the motion its benevolent 
support. Why did it take this support for granted? Because, as 
the Leader of the Opposition said, we have no choice. How can 
we, at this stage, withdraw from the former Yugoslavia?
<P>
<B>(1935) </B>
<P>
	The government, riding the wave, decided to call a debate at 
the last minute, just before the end of the mandate, and force 
parliamentarians to settle this matter, thinking that it would 
obtain the benevolent and unanimous consent of this House.
<P>
	This debate is all the more surprising in that, on March 14, as 
the parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Foreign Affairs 
rightly pointed out, the Minister of Foreign Affairs appeared 
before the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and 
International Trade. As the parliamentary secretary rightly 
pointed out, the minister asked Reform and Bloc representatives 
to state their positions on the renewal of the mandate of 
Canadian peacekeepers in the former Yugoslavia.
<P>
	The minister said the purpose of his initiative was to avoid 
having to hold a debate in the House. We very spontaneously 
stated our position to the minister, without having had time to 
prepare. In spite of that co-operation, we find ourselves in a 
debate on this issue. I fail to understand the logic of this 
government.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11236"> 11236 </A></B>
<P>
	We of course supported the renewal of the mandate of 
Canadian peacekeepers in the former Yugoslavia, but with some 
reservations. We have to make sure that our presence is still 
required, and we must also ensure that our peacekeepers are safe 
in the theatres of operations.
<P>
	We also want to raise the issue of suicides. There is some 
extremely disturbing information to the effect that a number of 
soldiers committed suicide either after participating in 
peacekeeping operations in the former Yugoslavia, or because 
they did not want to take part in these operations. This is most 
disturbing. Some facts will have to be thoroughly reviewed.
<P>
	Given these considerations, I am somewhat surprised to find 
myself debating the presence of our troops in the former 
Yugoslavia, less than two days before the expiry of the UN 
forces mandate in that region, and particularly in Croatia.
<P>
	In any case, the previous debates on this issue provided us 
with an opportunity to express our views and to hear the views of 
others.
<P>
	I do not think that we should go back, today, and repeat 
everything that was already said on the issue. Instead, we should 
try to see why Canadian troops should withdraw from that 
region, or remain there.
<P>
	A primary concern, to which I briefly referred earlier, is the 
danger faced by our troops stationed in the former Yugoslavia. 
This issue, which was also raised in previous debates, must once 
again be considered now.
<P>
	Indeed, given the numerous violations of the cease-fire, our 
troops, on any day, could be dealing with a bloody war, as 
opposed to a conventional peacekeeping mission. Let us not 
forget that ten peacekeepers lost their lives and many others 
have been injured since the first Canadian peacekeepers arrived 
in the former Yugoslavia.
<P>
	Similarly, a truce signed by the Bosnian government with the 
various warning factions in Bosnia was violated repeatedly 
during the past few weeks. Furthermore, the Bosnian Serbs 
recently threatened the international community with 
retaliatory action against the peacekeepers if the Bosnian Serb 
forces were hit by NATO air strikes.
<P>
	In a way, and we see this in the media, since the beginning of 
the conflict in the former Yugoslavia, the situation has hardly 
improved, on the contrary. Today, battles are raging throughout 
the territories coveted by the various belligerents. Today, people 
are suffering from a lack of food and fuel, lack of medical drugs 
and health care, lack of adequate housing, peace and safety.
<P>
	On the other hand, we should also consider the excellent job 
being done by our troops within the UN theatres of operations. 
Our troops continue to provide the peoples of the former 
Yugoslavia with shelter, food, clothing, protection and moral 
support. Since the fall of 1991, nearly $60 million has been 
spent on the purchase and delivery of food, medicine and 
clothing, on shelter  for the homeless and on assistance to 
refugees, displaced persons and victims of violence.
<P>
<B>(1940) </B>
<P>
	I feel that as long as the presence of Canadian troops is 
required and useful, there is no doubt that its presence must be 
maintained. By sending troops to the former Yugoslavia, Canada 
has made an important choice. It cannot afford to ignore a 
situation where human beings are experiencing an unspeakable 
tragedy. Granted, the help provided by our soldiers is not a 
panacea but at least it can alleviate the suffering.
<P>
	To bring back our peacekeepers in these circumstances would 
not only mean abdicating our responsibilities and moral 
obligations as human beings, it would also extinguish that 
flicker of hope these people still have, people who for the most 
part are innocent victims of man's inhumanity to man. It would 
also mean leaving them to face a tragic escalation in the current 
conflict. No, we cannot go backward today, we have no choice, 
in the words of the Leader of the Opposition.
<P>
	However, we need some answers about the safety of our 
troops should the embargo be lifted and in the event of air 
strikes. We need to know about the willingness of local 
authorities to have our troops remain there. We need answers 
about the cases of suicide in current peacekeeping operations. 
We need to look deeper into this troubling situation. Of course, 
we are in favour of keeping Canadian troops in the former 
Yugoslavia, but, unlike last year, I do not think the government 
can assume each year that it has the opposition's support.
<P>
	The government must provide an assessment of the situation 
and explain to us how it has changed. We have had no 
assessment and no explanation of changes in the situation. We 
have no idea, apart from the bits of information we gleaned this 
afternoon. We have not had an opportunity to find out details of 
what is happening in the field, and I think that, if we are to have a 
serious debate in this House, the government must give us this 
information.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fred Mifflin (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to enter the debate this evening. I 
want to put into perspective what Canadian troops are doing.
<P>
	Right now we have in the former Yugoslavia, and I refer 
mostly to Croatia and Bosnia, roughly 40,000 United Nations 
troops from 35 countries participating in a variety of operations. 
We in Canada have the fifth largest operation and we have 
deployed roughly 2,100 troops. They are engaged in four main 
operations. There is the operation in Bosnia in which we have 
approximately 820 troops. They are mostly engaged in relief 
convoys and the protection of human beings, humanitarian 
protection.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11237"> 11237 </A></B>
<P>
	In Croatia we have 770 peacekeepers; combat troops engaged 
in traditional peacekeeping, looking at the ceasefire areas and 
preventing skirmishes.
<P>
	We have another operation in the southwest part of Croatia, on 
the coast, in Primosten, just north of the larger city of Split, 
where we have roughly 265 troops. They are logistics troops and 
represent the logistics battalion.
<P>
	We also have a separate operation, which is actually a fifth 
operation. It is an air operation that has Hercules flights from 
Italy to Sarajevo to keep the airport open. There have been 1,600 
flights. Roughly 11,500 people have been transported to and 
from the airport and 26,000 metric tonnes. That is an 
achievement in my mind.
<P>
	Last but not least we have in the Adriatic coast a Canadian 
destroyer with 265 Canadians as part of the 15 nation, 21 ship 
force enforcing the arms embargo. This operation is one of 
which, despite what the opposition parties say, we are very 
proud and will continue to be.
<P>
<B>(1945 ) </B>
<P>
	We have been involved in this operation, if we include its 
beginning, from September 21, 1991 as we have in most UN 
operations that have ever happened in the world. That we have a 
reputation that is enviable is an understatement. We have heard 
all of it before in the House.
<P>
	The question for debate tonight is whether we continue the 
mandate. Before I address the question I want to comment on 
something the hon. Leader of the Opposition said and something 
the hon. member for Saanich-Gulf Islands said.
<P>
	The Leader of the Opposition said that he deplored the fact 
that we were speaking so late, that it essentially gave no choice 
to Parliament. The hon. member for Verchères said that he 
would like some comment from this side of the House on why we 
are having the debate so late.
<P>
	I remind the House that the Leader of the Opposition was a 
member of a government that deployed troops and committed 
Canada to the gulf war without as much as a word of discussion 
in the House of Commons. That was absolutely despicable. All 
Canadians thought it was outrageous.
<P>
	To have the Leader of the Opposition criticize the government 
for having the fourth debate on peacekeeping in 18 months plus 
other debates, one of which took place last week on defence, is 
absolutely disgraceful, outrageous, misleading and intolerable.
<P>
	The hon. member for Saanich-Gulf Islands complains that 
we are not having a debate on this matter. When it was put 
forward at the meeting last night I understand there was some 
question in the Reform Party whether it wanted to debate it. 
Whether or not the Reformers are being childish because it was 
at this point in time I do not know. It was not until late in the 
evening that they  decided they would have the debate. I do not 
accept these complaints.
<P>
	I want to make another point with respect to the opposition. 
The hon. member for Saanich-Gulf Islands spoke about 
renewing the mandate. He did nothing but moan about the 
Canadian forces and talk about morale.
<P>
	If members of the opposition parties, particularly the third 
party, would refrain from taking brown envelopes from 
disgruntled people and using them on the government to reduce 
the credibility of the very credible actions that are taking place 
from day to day, I would suggest the morale of the Canadian 
forces, whatever state it is in now, would be a hell of a lot better.
<P>
	I do not mean for the hon. member from Saanich-Gulf 
Islands to be a target; in fact we are quite good friends. He 
debated and complained about the state of equipment in the 
Canadian forces. We just finished a 10-month discussion on 
defence where all these matters were brought out. They were 
part of the white paper. They were addressed in a report to 
Parliament and are being addressed in the white paper.
<P>
	I know he wants to be on record as to his knowledge of 
defence. He has made his point. I will make my point that we are 
aware of these deficiencies and the government is addressing 
them, including 3,000 more peacekeepers to make sure that the 
rotation is better than it was.
<P>
	The mandate is a hard judgment to make. The support for 
peacekeeping in my constituency and in those parts of Canada to 
which I travel, including 10 months on the standing committee's 
defence policy review, was very strong. I sense that today it is 
not as strong as it was six months ago. I suggest the reason for 
that is the perception that we are not making any headway.
<P>
	How can we expect significant progress to be made in a 
country where conflict has been ongoing for almost a thousand 
years? I do not pretend to understand all the politics. I doubt if 
all of us in the House, if we were put together, could understand 
what is happening there.
<P>
	Where does that leave us? Should we not renew our mandate 
as 1 of 35 countries because we feel progress has not been made 
in peace?
<P>
<B>(1950) </B>
<P>
	There is more to it than that. We are supplying humanitarian 
aid. We are supplying hope to a country where hope is hard to 
come by.
<P>
	I remind everybody in the House, particularly the members 
who were with me 10 months ago as we spent some time in 
Bosnia and Croatia, of a mental institution in a town called 
Bakovici where many inmates were murdered, raped, tortured 
and mutilated. The remaining inmates, the poor souls, we saw 
them. They were being protected by members of the Canadian 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11238"> 11238 </A></B>
<P>
forces. It would rend one's heart to see this place in operation. 
There are many other examples.
<P>
	The humanitarian aspect would be sorely missed. I fear, 
because of the Canadian reputation in peacekeeping, that our 
decision to exit would give a signal that perhaps would not be 
conducive to world stability, particularly world stability in the 
Balkans.
<P>
	I agree with my hon. friend from Saanich-Gulf Islands who 
says that ideally we should have a clear mandate. We should 
have a clear set of operating instructions. Ideally we should have 
acceptance from the countries we are participating in and a clear 
set of rules of engagement. These points and principles were 
included in the white paper. I fear they are not being totally 
regarded in our participation in the ex-Yugoslavia.
<P>
	We do not live in an ideal world. Is the contact group, the five 
countries that were formed last year to negotiate a settlement, 
making progress? I think it is but it is very slow. If we accept this 
mandate for another six months how much longer are we 
prepared to go? I cannot answer that. I would say, as the minister 
of defence said, that I do not believe it is the intention of anyone 
in Parliament to have a commitment in ex-Yugoslavia that 
would last for 29 years.
<P>
	We are a long way from 29 years. Yes, there are risks. Yes, 
there are many land mines. Yes, there are snipers. Yes, there are 
flareups. However the situation in ex-Yugoslavia now, despite 
the 14 ceasefire violations in the recent past, I am told by the 
operators is not much different from what it was three years ago.
<P>
	Let us stay the course for this round. Let us help in the 
humanitarian aspect. Let us contribute as much as we can to the 
peace negotiation. Let us go forward with hope that we will see 
an amelioration of the situation if not an end to the conflict.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is truly a 
pleasure to speak this evening on peacekeeping in the former 
Yugoslavia.
<P>
	I emphasize a few of our concerns regarding the lateness of 
the debate and how it is just two days away from the mandate 
ending. I discussed this point with the minister a month ago. It 
was felt that we could be part of briefings much earlier and that 
then we would look at whether we needed to have this debate. 
We felt that before a decision was made there could be all-party 
involvement. We would agree. We would work toward that. We 
would co-operate in every way possible.
<P>
	This last minute type of thing certainly makes us wonder how 
serious the government is and what is the real purpose of our 
being here. Let us take that it is for honest reasons and that the 
government really wants to hear what we have to say.
<P>
	To move to the issue itself, as the foreign affairs critic for the 
Reform Party I state very strongly and clearly, as did the last 
speaker, that Canada should not renew its peacekeeping 
commitment to Bosnia or Croatia.
<P>
	Canadians have served honourably for almost three years now 
but enough is enough. Canada has performed above and beyond 
the call of duty in all its commitments to the UN. No country can 
say that we did not try our utmost to re-establish peace and 
facilitate a long term negotiated settlement to the disputes.
<P>
<B>(1955) </B>
<P>
	The facts are sad but obvious. The warring parties have shown 
no serious commitment to peace negotiations. Over the winter 
many have rearmed and resupplied their soldiers so they can 
start fresh fighting in the spring. The mid to long term prospects 
for peace are bleak and no amount of Canadian peacekeepers can 
change that fact. If we could just see light at the end of the 
tunnel, possibly this speech could be quite different.
<P>
	The Reform Party believes the time to leave is now. If 
predictions about an increase in the level of fighting over the 
late spring and summer are true, we must act quickly to pull out 
our troops now. It may not be easy but now is our best chance to 
get them home without incident. If we wait and things get 
tougher, our troops will face an even greater unnecessary risk.
<P>
	Last fall we saw how increased levels of fighting led to a 
corresponding increase in hostage taking of UN soldiers. This 
could happen again if we fail to act decisively now. The 
conditions in Bosnia during high levels of fighting remind me of 
the Eagles song ``Hotel California''. I will not sing it because it 
would certainly clear the House. Basically the words are: ``You 
can check out any time you like but you can never leave''.
<P>
	If Parliament dithers we may find some time down the road 
that we want to check out but will not be allowed to leave 
without fighting our way out through militias and possibly even 
through civilians. If we are to act responsibly we must leave 
now.
<P>
	As far as Croatia is concerned its president does not want UN 
peacekeepers any more. Although he is no longer forcing the UN 
out, he has demanded that it scale down its operations 
dramatically. As the process is going on Canadian troops would 
have a perfect opportunity to end their tour there without 
disrupting the ability of the UN to fulfil its new and more modest 
mandate.
<P>
	Speaking in more general terms about Canada's role in 
peacekeeping around the world, it is high time that Parliament 
rethink how we can be most effective in our UN commitments 
and set clear criteria for our participation in future missions. We 
are not saying to get out of peacekeeping; we are saying to set 
the criteria.
<P>
	Canadians are not prepared to give up on their proud 
traditions of caring and intervention for the sake of peace. 
However these times cannot be seen from a purely international 
perspec-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11239"> 11239 </A></B>
<P>
tive. Our foreign commitments  must be in harmony with our 
domestic needs. Therefore we must be sure when we support 
peacekeeping that we are operating in Canada's best interests 
and within the very real financial constraint that must be the 
primary concern of any good government.
<P>
	We must pick our spots and we must choose wisely. Today's 
debate should be a step in that direction. One thing is clear. 
Canada can no longer be the 911 phone number for the world or 
for the UN. As much as we want to help others, this desire is 
tempered by the fact that we cannot be all things to all people. 
Therefore it is better that we help effectively in a few cases 
rather than spread ourselves too thin. In this way Canada can 
protect its own vital interests and provide the most effective 
help for the international community.
<P>
	As we examine the issue of peacekeeping it is worthy of note 
that since the end of the cold war the demand for peacekeepers 
around the world has sky-rocketed. If the past few years have 
taught us any lesson it is that instability will continue. New hot 
spots will continue to crop up and Canada must be ready.
<P>
	If more requests come from Africa, Southeast Asia or the 
former Soviet republics, how will Canada respond? Clearly 
Canada must establish criteria to test the importance of each 
request for our help. While this is a sensitive issue and I do not 
claim to have all the answers, I would argue the following could 
be considered by Parliament when deciding whether to approve 
of peacekeeping missions.
<P>
	First, the conflict's impact on the state of international 
stability is an obvious test of whether Canada should get 
involved. If the conflict has a serious potential to escalate or 
destabilize a whole region, we should consider it seriously when 
making our decision.
<P>
<B>(2000 ) </B>
<P>
	Second, geographical ties are very important. For reasons of 
regional stability, the world would be a better place if countries 
co-operated to make sure that their own part of the world 
remained stable. Where peace does break down, regional 
organizations should co-operate to make things right. After all, 
it will be the member nations of such regional groups that have 
the greatest interest in restoring stability. For logistical reasons 
as well, proximity is an important factor in determining whether 
a country can respond to a crisis in a timely and effective 
manner.
<P>
	Third, humanitarian considerations must also be taken into 
account. While Canadians want bang for the buck they also want 
Canada to maintain its tradition for compassion.
<P>
	Fourth, our prior commitments must be given more weight 
than is the current practice when determining what else we are 
going to do. We only have so many troops and a limited amount 
of high quality equipment. We owe it to our troops to be fair in 
our decisions where to send them and to make sure that we do 
not  overcommit our forces. They are the Canadian forces, not 
the Canadian foreign legion.
<P>
	Fifth, Canada's economic ties are an important factor in 
determining how willing Canadians should be to commit their 
resources.
<P>
	In conclusion, the time has come for us to take a step back to 
reorganize ourselves. The first thing we have to do is withdraw 
from the former Yugoslavia. Canadians have been looking for a 
negotiated peace there for three years but none is on the horizon.
<P>
	If the UN sees value in continuing the peacekeeping mission, 
then it is time for some other UN country to hold the fort that 
Canada has so admirably defended for so many years. Our 
troops should be congratulated and brought home to their 
families.
<P>
	Once we withdraw from Bosnia and Croatia and before we 
send our troops on yet another indefinite mission with uncertain 
dangers and at an unknown cost, let us establish a credible set of 
criteria upon which we can depend to make sure that we pick our 
spots wisely. Canada can still be an innovator and a leader in the 
area of peacekeeping, but we have to make some difficult 
choices and we have to make them now.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Graham (Rosedale, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is with a 
great sense of privilege and responsibility that I rise in the 
House to debate this extraordinarily important subject this 
evening.
<P>
	I feel particularly responsible, given the incredible role our 
troops are playing in the former Yugoslavia. I sense like every 
other member of Parliament the responsibility we have toward 
those marvellous men and women for what they are achieving in 
that difficult part of the world.
<P>
	In trying to understand this matter, I have asked myself four 
questions. I think we should consider them when we discuss 
whether it would be appropriate to withdraw our troops at this 
time or to continue the mandate until a more orderly type of 
withdrawal can be achieved with either the whole of the United 
Nations forces or of our own troops.
<P>
	The four questions are these: Are our troops performing an 
important role where they are? Is their contribution special? 
What would be the consequences of their withdrawal? How are 
our overall interests served by their presence there? Let me take 
the time to examine those issues.
<P>
	Is the role of our troops in the former Yugoslavia an important 
one? To that I think every member of this House would have to 
reply an unqualified yes. Looking at the area of peacekeeping, 
our troops have performed an exemplary service I would say at 
the core of the United Nations operation in the former 
Yugoslavia. They have had a great deal of success. Of course 
there have 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11240"> 11240 </A></B>
<P>
been problems, but overall we should look at the achievements 
on the peacekeeping side.
<P>
	Our troops are very close to Sarajevo. Our troops are in one 
part of the former Yugoslavia which covers all three belligerent 
areas. Our troops are the only ones covering that delicate and 
sensitive area. Our troops are playing a primordial and 
important role in terms of peacekeeping. They are performing a 
role of humanitarian aid which was so effectively described by 
the member for Bonavista-Trinity-Conception that I need not 
repeat it. However, we must bear that in mind.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The second question I asked myself was is our contribution 
significant? We are but one of 35 countries in the former 
Yugoslavia and have contributed 2,000 soldiers to the 43,000 
troops stationed there.
<P>
<B>(2005) </B>
<P>
	The Leader of the Opposition said that he was not proud of the 
contribution our troops have made. Like the parliamentary 
secretary to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, I personally am 
proud of our troops' accomplishments in the former Yugoslavia. 
I am proud of their humanity and proud of their professionalism.
<P>
	The other night I saw on television a young sergeant who had 
an enormous responsibility. Day in, day out, with unparalleled 
devotion, intelligence and professionalism, this peerless soldier 
resolved issues and extremely difficult problems.
<P>
	I am convinced that the regiments who will replace the troops 
there now, such as the 22nd Royal Regiment from Quebec, will 
serve in the tradition that it has maintained for the duration of its 
long and glorious history.
<P>
	Therefore, I reject the Leader of the Opposition's statements. 
I reject the statements of the hon. member for Verchères. I 
believe that this is not a partisan issue and that this debate 
should rise above any inappropriate partisanship. We should be 
examining these serious issues from the viewpoint of the 
well-being of our troops and our country.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Let me ask the question: What would the consequences be of a 
withdrawal at this time? We know this is a tense situation. We 
have read what Lord Owen has said about the difficult situation 
that prevails there at the moment. What would the effect be of 
our withdrawing our troops at this time? What would the effect 
be on the other UN troops there? Think of the demoralizing 
effect that would have on them. Think of the effect on the 
belligerents.
<P>
	We, along with our allies, took extreme umbrage at the 
suggestion by the leader of Croatia that UN troops should be 
removed from Croatia. We told him that UN troops must be kept 
there because it is a tinderbox which is likely to explode into 
uncontrolled war if UN troops are withdrawn.
<P>
	Having exercised that influence on the leader of Croatia, are 
we to withdraw those troops? Are we to create the very situation 
of ethnic cleansing and problems that we have seen in the past? I 
ask myself what the effect of withdrawal would be. I suggest that 
it would be a precipitating event in creating a crisis.
<P>
	The member for Red Deer does not seem to be taking that into 
account. He is suggesting that we can steal away in the night like 
a Turk with bag and baggage, that no one will miss us and there 
will be no consequence of that. There will be a consequence. If 
we try to steal away we may create the very situation of war 
which will make it impossible for us to withdraw in an orderly 
way. On top of that, we will leave exposed in the former 
Yugoslavia the magnificent Mounties who are serving there in a 
civilian way which is truly an extraordinary example of 
Canadian devotion.
<P>
	Last, is it in our global and general interests to be in the 
former Yugoslavia until a more orderly withdrawal may be 
organized? It is true, as the member for Red Deer may say, we 
have done our share. There is no one in the House who would say 
that we have not done our share. I dare to say there is nobody 
among our allies who would say we have not done our share. I 
am sure there is no one in the civilian population of the 
ex-Yugoslavia who would not say that the Canadian troops have 
done their share.
<P>
	The question is not that. The question is whether or not our 
general interests are served by our staying there and continuing 
to do our share, continuing to help the people of ex-Yugoslavia 
and continuing to help the cause of peace as it is to be developed. 
I would suggest that the effect on our allies would be extremely 
devastating if we were to leave at this time. Our European allies 
are counting on our being there.
<P>
	When we consider issues of global security and foreign policy 
we must never divorce one issue from another. Does anyone in 
this House not doubt the fact that one of the reasons we have 
been so successful in dealing with the Europeans over the issues 
on the Grand Banks is precisely because we are in Yugoslavia 
and because we are a force in Europe? Our European friends 
cannot turn to us and say: ``We can treat you the way we want 
to''.
<P>
<B>(2010 ) </B>
<P>
	We are making a contribution in Europe. We are helping the 
Europeans solve their problems. We are helping solve world 
peace in our own interests but in their interests as well. That 
makes us a force in world affairs. It gives us a force in dealing 
with them in every other sector. We must never forget that. That 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11241"> 11241 </A></B>
<P>
is what strategy is about. That is what foreign policy is about. 
We cannot ignore these larger issues.
<P>
	Furthermore, what about the Americans? If we withdraw on 
the ground, the United States at this moment is taking the 
attitude that it can stand above these frays. It can fly over at 
30,000 feet and not put troops on the ground. We have a moral 
superiority in dealing with our American colleagues at this time 
because of the tremendous contribution our forces are making. It 
establishes a credibility in dealing with the United States that we 
must never forget.
<P>
	We owe it to our forces on the ground. We owe it to those 
magnificent troops.
<P>
	Finally, we owe it to ourselves in terms of the United Nations. 
The House has often spoken about the need for the United 
Nations to be revitalized. This House has often spoken about the 
need for a more effective United Nations if Canada's interests 
and values are to be protected in the world. Those interests and 
those values will be protected by our continuing to be a reliable 
member of the United Nations forces and enabling the United 
Nations to improve its situation.
<P>
	I leave by suggesting that our interests require us to stay at 
this time. Furthermore, our troops there are enforcing Canadian 
values by performing a humanitarian and difficult task in 
terrible circumstances with a devotion and superb 
professionalism of which all of us may be very proud.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, before 
starting my speech, I would like to respond to my colleague 
from Rosedale. According to him, the Leader of the Opposition 
said that he was not proud of Canadian troops. I am sorry but the 
hon. member for Rosedale is distorting the comments made by 
the Leader of the Opposition.
<P>
	My colleagues and I heard the speech delivered by the hon. 
member for Lac-Saint-Jean. He is a responsible man. He is 
more concerned about the living conditions of Canadian troops 
on peacekeeping missions. He is also concerned about the 
measures taken after they return home. He is concerned about 
the problem of suicide among Canadian troops. I wish to set the 
record straight: he is an honest and responsible man whom we 
all hold in high esteem.
<P>
	It is with great sadness and emotion that I will, in this debate, 
try to paint a rather grim picture of the situation in the former 
Yugoslavia. Zvornik, Srebrenica, Bratunac and Grobnica were 
the sites of massacres in which up to 3,000 civilians were killed. 
The Omarska camp was the site of mass executions and torture. 
At the Celebici camp, at least 15 Serbs were beaten to death last 
August. An individual called Borislav Herak killed 230 
anonymous civilians. Last August, 50 Serbian women and 
children were killed by two Croatian members of paramilitary 
forces.
<P>
	In Varjanta, more than 200 Muslims were massacred by the 
Serbian police. In May and June, between 2,000 and 3,000 
Muslims were murdered by Serbian irregulars in a pig farm and 
factory near Brcko. Countless Muslim women were raped by 
Croatians.
<P>
	That is the other side of the conflict in the former Yugoslavia. 
That is the reality sometimes obscured by the rhetoric. That is, 
however, why our troops are serving with the UN.
<P>
	How did it come to that? How did the situation deteriorate to 
this extent, as is often the case in armed conflicts, with innocent 
civilians being massacred, women raped, ethnic cleansing? I 
have no desire to set myself as a strategy expert nor do I claim to 
be. My main concern this evening and the most serious aspect of 
this conflict, in my view, is the impact on civilians and on our 
troops.
<P>
	Coming back to the loss of human rights issue, here is some 
background information. It should be pointed out that all 
protagonists in the conflict have violated the rights of their 
minorities from the beginning. I would like to read from a 
document produced by the Canadian government. It reads:
<P>
<B>(2015) </B>
<P>
	``When the federal republic crumbled, the Serbs wanted to 
make sure that their people would remain together within the 
same territory. That is why they tried to spread their domination 
to regions where large ethnic minorities live as well as to new 
States run by non-Serbs. Other groups, such as the Croatians 
and the Muslims, wanted to consolidate their position in the new 
States by depriving other ethnic minorities, including the Serbs, 
of their rights''.
<P>
	The ethnic cleansing sought by both sides led to murders, 
rapes, torture and other forms of intimidation aimed at making 
the members of particular ethnic groups flee their homes and 
villages and take refuge in the zones claimed by other ethnic 
groups. Such attempts to achieve ethnic cleansing have had 
tragic consequences: over 100,000 people killed and hundreds 
of thousands injured; thousands of Muslim women raped; and 
three million people displaced or forced to take refuge in 
neighbouring countries, without mentionning the acts of torture, 
the illegal arrests and the arbitrary detentions.
<P>
	Let me discuss for a moment the impact of those rapes, 
particularly in the context of Muslim society. It has been 
reported in the media that women who are raped by men from 
other ethnic origins must often face reprisals from their own 
families. Almost a whole generation of women was sacrificed. 
Indeed, in addition to the physical and psychological trauma 
with which these women have to deal, their whole families and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11242"> 11242 </A></B>
<P>
social lives were shattered. The scope of this tragedy leaves us at 
a loss for words.
<P>
	It is to help the civilian population that the UN forces were 
deployed in that region. Peace is the most precious thing for any 
nation. The right to life and to one's physical integrity is the 
most treasured one. The international community, through the 
UN, felt an obligation to maintain peace, in spite of the 
enormous financial and military costs involved. Canada made a 
contribution from the very beginning and decided to pursue its 
commitment, although with some reservations and doubts. We 
agree and we have no choice. Indeed, the consequences of a 
withdrawal of the UN forces would be tragic for the population. 
The attacks would start all over again. We know that as recently 
as last week, there were 14 outbreaks of armed conflict in 
Bosnia.
<P>
	Genocide would resume, and help would no longer reach the 
various communities, with consequences one can well imagine. 
However, we must also consider the impact of these operations 
on each individual member of our peacekeeping forces. It seems 
that in some cases, the impact is considerable. Some problems 
have already been identified. There is of course the conditions in 
the field which may have an impact on physical health. And 
there are also conditions we could qualify as environmental, like 
bombings, hostage takings, the hostility of part of the 
population and armed attacks intended to threaten and humiliate 
the soldiers.
<P>
	What is most traumatic is being powerless to intervene 
pro-actively in the face of so much horror. There is also the 
daily confrontation with human misery, with the very visible 
impact of war on the civilian population. There is fear and 
boredom. That was also the point my leader, the leader of the 
opposition was trying to make.
<P>
	All these factors contribute, to a greater or lesser degree, to 
the deterioration of the physical, psychological and mental 
health of our peacekeepers. A number of questions come to 
mind. First of all, were they given adequate preparation and 
training before they left? Second, was there a proper evaluation 
of the tasks they would be given so they would have a better idea 
of what they could expect? When they return, do they have 
access to the support and services they need to resume a 
``normal'' life as members of their community? Apparently not, 
since it was found that among peacekeepers and their friends, 
the suicide rate was higher than average.
<P>
	These are all issues that must be addressed if we want our 
involvement in peacekeeping missions to be humanitarian for 
those who are on the receiving end and for those who go on these 
missions. I deplore the fact that this government failed to table a 
statement describing the conditions under which our soldiers 
have exercised their peacekeeping mandate so far. We are faced 
with a fait accompli. Our answer to the government's request to 
renew the peacekeeping mandate of the Canadian forces is yes, 
but.
<P>
<B>(2020) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this has been not merely a valuable debate but an 
innovatory debate in Constitutional law of Parliament terms.
<P>
	It was intended by the United Stated Constitution, to which 
some of the members of opposition parties referred, that 
questions of peace and war and commitment of armed forces be 
always submitted to Congress for decision.
<P>
	We know that historically American presidents evaded that in 
invoking presidential power. What is fascinating here today is 
that we have come to Parliament. We are consulting Parliament 
on the renewal of the mandate and we have established a 
parliamentary practice that will not likely be changed in the 
future.
<P>
	It will now be part of our constitutional law that where there is 
a commitment to be made of Canadian forces, it will be more 
than a telephone call at 5 a.m. from a foreign head of 
government and a Canadian Prime Minister replying yes sir, 
without any thought of the roles and missions of the forces to 
which he is committing Canada.
<P>
	There are mistakes here and we can identify them readily if 
we survey the history of peacekeeping in its classical form as 
developed by our then foreign minister, Lester Pearson, for 
which he won the Nobel prize for the interposition of unarmed 
UN forces between armed combatants who had decided to cease 
operations and were looking for a face saving way out of it.
<P>
	The classic situation was in Suez in 1956. It was muddied in 
the Congo in 1960-61 when the secretary-general of the United 
Nations in moves that ultimately brought his own destruction 
and death interjected political motives that had not been cleared 
in advance. Many of us would believe they were the correct 
political decisions but the political motive intervenes.
<P>
	If we look at the two operations in recent years in which we 
have been most involved, Croatia and Somalia, we find 
operations in which the political commitment was made to 
engage Canadian peacekeeping forces but without a prior 
adequate definition of goals and missions.
<P>
	This is the tragedy in Somalia. A classic peacekeeping 
operation was converted into a mission with political objectives, 
arguable and even questionable because they ignored the 
existing power structure there which was necessary to the 
effective operation of the UN forces.
<P>
	In Croatia conflicting political agendas had been set by 
European powers that were in some respects reviving their old 
quarrels of pre-1914. I would not wish to censor the government 
that made these decisions without prior discussion in 
Parliament, without prior examination of the roles and missions 
in which we are engaged, but it is clear there was a fault there.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11243"> 11243 </A></B>
<P>
	Our real issue today is that Canada entered into operations, 
engaged our forces, engaged our word as a nation and we are 
bound by that commitment in terms of consequences. We cannot 
lightly walk away. In other words, a new political situation is 
created by our act however much the present government and 
opposition parties might wish to question the original political 
premises on which the predecessor government engaged 
Canada.
<P>
	I have some suggestions to make in terms of the continued 
operation of the Canadian peace forces in Croatia. It is clear if 
we ought to be there it is to be in a classic peacekeeping sense. 
We are not there as a chapter seven of the charter, a peacemaking 
operation in which we have a defined political goal that involves 
the application of military force for its achievement.
<P>
	This was never our role. It is not our role today. It may well be 
the objective of some of the people presently engaged in the 
same operation. One of the problems here is the problem of state 
succession to the former communist republic of Yugoslavia. It 
was about to break up, as Turkey was in the 19th century. It 
created the predecessor of Yugoslavia, Serbia and Montenegro. 
It was a situation of state succession in which European powers 
met together and realized that one cannot have recognition of 
new states without a precise and equitable definition of 
frontiers.
<P>
<B>(2025 ) </B>
<P>
	That was not done here and in a very real sense it is a mistake 
to attempt it under the guise of a peacekeeping operation. 
Therefore our message to the government should be that the 
predecessor government engaged Canada in the operation. We 
cannot in good faith walk away. We are responsible in measure 
for what has happened since. We should limit our responsibility 
to the UN mandate, the maintenance of a political military 
situation created by the parties, agreed on by the parties as a 
cease fire and no more.
<P>
	If there is to be an issue of political goals to be established, we 
should call for another congress of Berlin. The treaty of 
Versailles to which we are signatory, our first international act, 
establishes just such a machinery.
<P>
	If it is to be a matter of defining frontiers, let us have a larger 
European conference of which we are part. Let us get those 
frontiers defined. Do not try to do this under cover of a military 
peacekeeping operation. Do not charge our soldiers with the 
responsibility of making political decisions. It is beyond their 
special competence. It is beyond their mandate. It is manifestly 
unfair to them.
<P>
	I say congratulations to the government for establishing what 
I hope will become a precedent that before Canadian forces are 
committed we will bring the matter to Parliament. Second, we 
will insist on maintaining respect for the UN charter and respect 
for UN peacekeeping operations as defined in chapter six.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to start by reiterating the motion:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House, in light of the UN Security Council consideration of renewed 
mandates for UN forces in the former Yugoslavia, take note of the rotation of 
Canadian forces serving with UNPROFOR in Bosnia-Hercegovina and Croatia.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	We are taking note and Canadians are taking note. Canadians 
are generally proud of the role of the Canadian forces in 
peacekeeping. They very much respect the humanitarian role 
that can be played. I do not think they are totally aware of both 
sides of the equation from a military point of view.
<P>
	On a very basic level if the troops are told, as they have been 
recently in Valcartier, they are next in the slot, the morale of the 
troops increases and they say: ``Good. We have a job to do, let us 
do it''. If they have been trained for it, as most of them have, 
they can do a very creditable job.
<P>
	The problem is that this has gone on for too long. While there 
is a momentary surge in morale, the piper must be paid after 
that. If the troops get rotated with too great a frequency, we have 
a problem. If the troops do not have the wherewithal in 
equipment to carry things out, there is a problem. If defects are 
perceived in leadership in the Department of National Defence 
or within the Canadian forces, there is a problem. If the terms of 
reference in the first place are inadequate, there is another 
problem.
<P>
	While it is good for the Canadian public to support its 
peacekeepers, as I do, I nevertheless have to sound a note of 
caution that all is not that well. There are many impediments, 
many problems to overcome. The longer we are in this business 
the more those problems are evident. I would like to agree to 
some extent with my colleague from Vancouver Quadra who was 
extolling the virtues of the government by saying that it was 
doing the right thing by consulting Parliament. I agree, it is a 
good thing to do.
<P>
<B>(2030) </B>
<P>
	The government made a start on this a year or more ago when 
this Parliament began. However, I have to question its sincerity 
when looking at the events of today. Although the mandate for 
our troops expires in two days' time, the government only 
yesterday announced the special debate of today. That is totally 
inadequate. However the intent may be correct. To put it in 
general terms, as the hon. member for Vancouver Quadra did, it 
is a good thing to consult Parliament. I wholeheartedly agree 
with that. It is a good thing to consult Parliament, but let us do it 
effectively, not in a cursory way.
<P>
	A good part of the reason for the Reform members' position is 
that we established in discussion among ourselves what we 
consider should be the conditions for sending troops on 
peacekeeping operations. One was that peacekeepers should be 
left alone to do their job in the Bosnia area. The second was that 
the Sarajevo airport should remain open. The third was that 
convoys 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11244"> 11244 </A></B>
<P>
should  be able to operate unimpeded. The fourth was that there 
should be a ceasefire in place and holding.
<P>
	All of those conditions have been violated. Atrocities are 
occurring, Canadian hostages have been taken, UN patrols have 
been fired on, so-called safe areas has been fired on, landings at 
Sarajevo have been stopped. We have ethnic quarrels going on 
all the while. In fact, the ethnic quarrels are at the very root of 
our objection to this whole situation. There will be no basis for 
peace in the former Yugoslavia until the residents decide they 
want peace. If it is going to be ethnic group against ethnic group, 
religion against religion. It is going to go on and on.
<P>
	Canadians found themselves as peacekeepers in Cyprus for 29 
years with no way out of it. We finally pulled out and the 
situation is no worse now than it was before. I am not trying to 
simplify this situation. It is fraught with danger.
<P>
	Let me speak to the other side of the coin. How much danger is 
there? I ran into Major-General Lewis MacKenzie of Yugoslav 
fame a week or so ago. He sent me an article which he had had 
published in the New York <I>Times</I>. I would like to read part of 
what he wrote. He was talking, by the way, in favour of the UN 
leaving, certainly in Croatia. He wrote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>If President Tudjman gets his way and the UN withdraws from Croatia, war 
will follow and it won't be a short, local war between Croatia and the Krajina 
Serbs. The Krajina Serbs have been ``assisting'' the Bosnian Serbs in the battle 
for the Bihac pocket and they have recently signed a co-operation agreement 
for common defence which includes provisions for a joint defence council.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	General MacKenzie's knowledge, having been on the ground 
there is far superior to me.
<P>
<B>(2035 ) </B>
<P>
	He concludes in favour of keeping troops there.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Surely this is the real litmus test for the UN in the new world order. It is up to 
the permanent five of the Security Council, led by the U.S.A., to make sure the 
UN is not found wanting on this issue. Failure to do so will sentence the Balkans 
to an even bloodier future.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This is a knowledgeable statement from a knowledgeable 
person. It says to me, why should Canada interpose itself to the 
degree we seem to be doing and saying we are responsible for 
the whole safekeeping of that area? It is a UN responsibility. I 
quite agree with General MacKenzie that pressure should be put 
on the UN, led by the U.S.A., to do something about the 
situation.
<P>
	I would go beyond that and ask what is NATO's role in this. 
NATO surely has a role to play. It must exercise its influence in 
the area. Going beyond that, I would ask about the contiguous 
countries, about Greece, Turkey, Albania and all those that are 
affected. Where are they? They must take some responsibility in 
this whole thing.
<P>
	We wind up with this problem. Unless the situation can be 
orchestrated by the UN, by NATO, by the countries in the area 
and by the ethnic groups in that troubled area saying ``we want 
peace'', Canadians cannot impose it on them.
<P>
	Our military situation is well known. Our troop rotation is too 
frequent; the equipment is inadequate; the troops are carrying 
too big a load for the resources they are being given. We have the 
Jeffries report out of Petawawa. We have the Oehring report out 
of FMC saying there are problems within the Canadian forces. 
These problems are of morale and leadership. We had better 
straighten up that situation on our own home ground.
<P>
	To conclude, if there is no chance for peace, if there is no 
desire for peace by the people who are there, we cannot impose 
it. It will do our country, NATO, the UN and the countries in that 
area a lot of good if we are seen to be stopping now. Blow the 
whistle and say: ``Whoa, let's start over. Let's see what it is we 
are doing. Let's give notice now and take it from there''.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Janko Peric (Cambridge, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise this evening to discuss once again the issue of Canada's role in peacekeeping operations in Croatia and Bosnia-Hercegovina.
<P>
	In preparing to speak today I reviewed my notes from two 
previous speeches on the same matter. I came to the realization 
that not much has changed. The United Nations is no closer 
today to implementing its mandate than it was on January 25, 
1994 when I first spoke in the House on the issue.
<P>
	One-quarter of a million displaced persons in Croatia alone 
are no closer to returning to their homes. Croatia's international 
borders remain unsecured. One-third of the nation's territory is 
currently occupied. I have been advised that since January 1995 
the army of Yugoslavia has moved in over 900 troops, 25 tanks 
and ground to ground missiles, all under the watchful eye of the 
United Nations.
<P>
	While all-out war did subside with the original arrival of the 
United Nations protection force in 1992, little else had changed. 
We must ask ourselves, is it any wonder that the Government of 
Croatia wanted to terminate the United Nations mandate? We 
must ask ourselves, are we accomplishing enough in Croatia to 
warrant our continued presence there and our continued 
expenditure of Canadian taxpayers' money?
<P>
<B>(2040) </B>
<P>
	I am certain that most members can understand Croatia's 
frustration. I am not so sure that we can answer the second of my 
questions quite so easy.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11245"> 11245 </A></B>
<P>
	Last month the members of the Canada-Croatia and 
Bosnia-Hercegovina parliamentary group hosted a visit by 
parliamentarians from the Republic of Croatia. During that visit 
it was made very clear to me and my colleagues that the Croatian 
government was adamant about not renewing the UN mandate. 
In fact, Mr. Ivica Racan, the leader of the opposition Social 
Democratic Party of Croatia indicated to me that the one thing 
all parliamentarians and citizens of Croatia were in agreement 
on was that it was time for UNPROFOR to leave.
<P>
	After the meetings with Mr. Racan and Drs. Domljan and 
Greguric I truly believe that the Canadian peacekeepers would 
be coming home. I can honestly say that I have very mixed 
feelings about that. While I could understand the frustration of 
the Croatian government and the Croatian people, I was worried 
that an escalation in fighting might occur, thus once again 
placing the safety of many innocent civilians in jeopardy.
<P>
	Then on March 12 came what appeared to be good news. The 
president of Croatia, Dr. Franjo Tudjman, held a joint press 
conference with U.S. Vice-President Al Gore where it was 
announced that Croatia would accept the further international 
presence on its territory if a new UN Security Council mandate 
could be agreed on and that certain conditions were met.
<P>
	Those conditions included: one, control of international 
borders between the Republic of Croatia and the Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia, between the Republic of Croatia and the 
Republic of Bosnia-Hercegovina and at principal crossing 
points not now controlled by Croatian authorities; two, control 
access and communications for UNPROFOR and other 
international humanitarian operations to Bosnia-Hercegovina 
through territory not currently under the control of the Croatian 
authorities; three, facilitate and continue implementation of a 
ceasefire agreement on March 29, 1994 and an economic 
agreement on December 7, 1994; four, facilitate implementation 
of future agreements aimed at reintegration of Croatia and 
facilitate implementation of relevant UN Security Council and 
general assembly resolutions.
<P>
	The Copenhagen agreement engineered by U.S. 
Vice-President Al Gore which showed so much promise is today 
in jeopardy. Last week UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros 
Ghali forwarded the proposed new UN mandate to the 
Government of Croatia. The problem is that this so-called new 
mandate is little more than a rehashing of the old Vance-Owen 
peace plan. This is not what the Republic of Croatia agreed to in 
Copenhagen.
<P>
	In a letter to UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros Ghali 
dated March 27, 1995, a couple of days ago, Dr. Mate Granic, 
Croatia's foreign minister stated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I have the duty to inform you and the Members of the Security Council that the 
Republic of Croatia shall not accept the new mandate of the new peacekeeping 
force on its territory after the present mandate of UNPROFOR in Croatia 
terminates unless the following conditions are met:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>One: The name of the new operations contains the word Croatia; explicitly 
confirming the fact that the new operation is to be carried in its entirety on the 
sovereign territory of the Republic of Croatia; and,</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Two: The mechanism of the active control of international borders of the 
Republic of Croatia in the parts that are not at this moment accessible to the 
Croatian authorities by the new force are negotiated in detail on the basis of 
relevant Security Council resolutions and have gained prior formal approval of 
the Government of Croatia; thus the mechanisms for active control of Croatia's 
international borders under the new mandate must be clearly established 
consistent with paragraph 12 of Resolution 820 (1993).</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(2045) </B>
<P>
	The words of the Croatian foreign minister make it very clear 
to me that Croatia means business. Either change the mandate to 
reflect the Copenhagen agreement or get out. If somehow, and I 
am hopeful, a new agreement can be reached, Canada must 
decide whether it is in our best interest to keep our peacekeepers 
in Croatia.
<P>
	If we decide to remain in Croatia it is imperative we play a 
role in negotiating a new mandate. This is one thing I have found 
extremely disturbing throughout this entire mission in Croatia 
and Bosnia-Hercegovina. Canada appears to have had very little 
influence in the overall decision making process. We have the 
fifth largest contingent of troops in Croatia and 
Bosnia-Hercegovina, 2,100, yet we have been completely shut 
out of the so-called contact group which has been making 
decisions on strategy in the region.
<P>
	Our neighbours to the south with only 890 troops and Russia 
with 1,400 peacekeepers have been playing chess with our men 
and women in this lengthy international conflict and we cannot 
allow this to continue. The safety and integrity of our troops rest 
solely on our shoulders. If we stay we must demand a more 
active role in negotiations that will ultimately affect the 
well-being of our peacekeepers.
<P>
	In addition to playing a more active role in the negotiating 
process, we should also be encouraging our southern neighbours 
to put their money where their mouth is by increasing their 
presence in the region.
<P>
	Canada is a proud peacekeeping nation. Our troops have done 
a good job in Croatia given what they have to work with. I 
believe the Croatian government can confirm that.
<P>
	However, if there is not a new mandate, if we will simply be 
helping to maintain the status quo and if the lives of our 
peacekeepers will be placed in greater jeopardy let us stop 
wasting the hard earned money of Canadian taxpayers and bring 
our troops home.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Philippe Paré (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
taking part in this debate on maintaining peacekeepers in Bosnia 
and Croatia more out of a sense of duty than of pleasure.
<P>
<B>(2050) </B>
<P>
	More out of a sense of duty, because it is impossible to remain 
indifferent to the drama taking place in the former Yugoslavia. It 
is not for pleasure, because the government is putting us in a 
very awkward situation. It is claiming to consult us, but we 
know that the UN mandate ends in 24 hours.
<P>
	Moreover, the government never really took steps to inform 
the House of the results of earlier peacekeeping missions. 
Finally, it probably made its decision to renew the mandate 
several weeks ago.
<P>
	They better not try to say that the Minister of Foreign Affairs 
consulted us seriously on March 14, asking us our opinion on the 
fly. They also better not say that our criticism of the government 
is criticism of Canadian peacekeepers.
<P>
	The Leader of the Opposition was very clear on this point. He 
paid hommage to Canadian peacekeepers for their courage, their 
devotion and their professionalism. I therefore ask the hon. 
Liberal member to distinguish between criticism of the 
government and criticism of the peacekeepers. In fact, there is 
no criticism of the peacekeepers.
<P>
	We have just reviewed Canadian foreign policy. Throughout 
our meetings, the former Chair of the Standing Committee on 
Foreign Affairs, now a senator, made light of Canada's situation 
describing Canada as the UN's emergency service. We have just 
issued a statement of policy. In the fall, the government issued 
its defence policy. Is there anything really different in the 
process we are starting today? Not a thing. It is the same as 
before.
<P>
	At the San Francisco conference, which led to the 
establishment of the UN on June 26, 1945, following the second 
world War, people wanted to ensure that history would not 
repeat itself. Unfortunately, we have to admit that history has 
repeated itself. The UN charter introduced a new idea of 
universal security, and it was a Canadian politician, Lester B. 
Pearson, who, in the end, created peace missions as we know 
them today.
<P>
	The new face of war and the increasing number of areas of 
conflict around the world require action by the international 
community. Finding ways to regulate and ensure international 
peace and security is one of Canada's responsibilities as well. 
Canada, a country renowned the world over as a leader in 
peacekeeping missions, can hardly run for cover now.
<P>
	This debate also allows us to reflect on a certain number of 
subjects more or less on the periphery of the issue at hand. I 
would like to begin by reflecting on the role that television plays 
on the international community's responsibility. As much as we 
denounce the  gratuitous violence typical of today's television 
shows, we must recognize that the journalists covering 
international issues heighten awareness in the international 
community, and in Canada, of the situation reigning in countries 
in conflict.
<P>
	On this issue, I think that MPs cannot simply follow public 
opinion. It would be too easy to conduct surveys and then to 
apply the decision corresponding exactly to what Canadians and 
Quebecers want to see. MPs have a role to play in shaping public 
opinion and they cannot hedge on this issue indefinitely.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois is in favour of renewing the 
peacekeeping mandate in Bosnia and Croatia, but I am in full 
agreement with the reservations which my colleagues have 
already expressed. I think that we should react to this situation 
in the way that we would if we were to see a person in distress.
<P>
<B>(2055) </B>
<P>
	If I were at home in my apartment and heard gunshots in the 
next apartment, I could not just shrug it off. Why should we then 
close our eyes and refuse to act when it comes to the 
international scene?
<P>
	The role of peacekeepers is extremely important. It is 
essential in Bosnia-Hercegovina. They bring food and medical 
supplies, among other things, to people who are undeniably the 
victims in the situation.
<P>
	They also ensure that some lines of communication remain 
open, without which life would become unbearable. They also 
logistically support NGOs like the Red Cross and the High 
Commissioner's Office for Refugees, which play a crucial role 
which could not possibly be undertaken without the 
peacekeepers.
<P>
	Finally, regarding the need for the mission, everybody 
recognizes that if we pulled out of Bosnia, we would leave 
behind a void which would be filled with massive fireworks, it 
would literally be hell on earth.
<P>
	I said earlier that we had begun to review Canadian foreign 
policy. We must realize that borders are a thing of the past. 
There is no denying the interdependencies between peoples. 
When someone pollutes the environment elsewhere, we in 
Canada are affected. Poverty in developing countries is also our 
problem because we all are responsible for what happens in the 
world. We cannot remain passive when we see human rights 
being violated. Population migrations always end up affecting 
us.
<P>
	Some 50 Bosnian refugees recently immigrated to my riding. 
We cannot close our eyes and say: ``It is none of our business. If 
they want to fight, let them fight among themselves''. No. We 
have a moral and ethical responsibility in these matters.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11247"> 11247 </A></B>
<P>
	Humanitarian action is one of the responsibilities of the 
international community. I recently attended a forum in 
Sainte-Adèle, north of Montreal, in which experts tried to link 
state sovereignty with the responsibility to take action against 
gross violations of human rights. We are moving toward the 
right to interfere, and the international community will have to 
come to terms with this in the future.
<P>
	Of course, we have a number of reservations about the 
presence of peacekeepers over there. My colleagues talked 
about the psychological trauma experienced by our soldiers 
after or before they return home. I suppose that the Canadian 
Forces could do a number of things, perhaps better choose the 
soldiers or prepare them better. However, I do not think we can 
base our refusal to get involved on this factor, as tragic as it may 
be.
<P>
	We often hear Canadians say that we cannot afford to 
intervene. May I remind this House that Canada spends $10 
billion on national defence. I think it is a false argument to say 
that we cannot afford it.
<P>
	The Canadian Forces should look for a new orientation. In the 
report on the policy statement, we suggested that the 
government review the make-up of the Canadian Armed Forces. 
Since peacekeeping is really what we are best at and are 
involved in on a regular basis, the whole National Defence 
structure should focus on this new make-up.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I am out of time. But I would just like to remind 
the House that, if people are able to fight and kill one another, it 
is because there are others out there who are manufacturing 
weapons. in that regard, I want to denounce the fact that four 
permanent members of the Security Council manufacture 80 per 
cent of all weapons produced in the world. We will never 
denounce enough this kind of hypocrisy.
<P>
	I will conclude with a quote from the Leader of the Opposition 
who stated on January 25, 1994: ``what matters for the moment 
is to bear in mind that we must continue, insofar as our 
capabilities allow it, to fulfil our fair part of the obligations that 
result from our allegiance to the values of democracy, peace and 
justice, values which, given their universality, deserve our 
efforts to further them abroad''.

<B>(2100) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Jean Augustine (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime 
Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to join in the 
debate tonight on a subject of utmost concern and importance, 
especially to the people of Etobicoke-Lakeshore and indeed to 
all Canada.
<P>
	In light of the UN Security Council consideration of renewed 
mandates for UN forces in the former Yugoslavia and of the 
coming rotation of Canadian forces serving with UNPROFOR in 
the region, it is important that we have the debate tonight.
<P>
	We live in a global village and very often the events that occur 
in the international community have a direct or indirect effect on 
Canada. We have seen evidence of this in the economy, in our 
social policy and in issues of security. We have a responsibility 
to the global village, especially when human rights are being 
violated.
<P>
	The importance of peacekeeping to Canadians is obvious 
from the three times since January 1994 that the government has 
called a special debate on Canada's role as a peacekeeper 
throughout the world. In the past year we have dealt specifically 
with our commitments to UN missions in Rwanda, in Haiti and 
in the former Yugoslavia.
<P>
	In the debates that took place members consistently referred 
with pride to previous Canadian participation in UN 
peacekeeping missions in Korea, Egypt, Vietnam, the Middle 
East and Latin America, to name a few.
<P>
	Numerous members of the Etobicoke-Lakeshore 
community have been involved in peacekeeping activities 
around the world since the inception of the UN peacekeeping 
force. Their contribution to the security of our country and to 
peace in the world is something that my constituents and I will 
always be grateful for.
<P>
	Described as an imaginative worker for peace, Lester B. 
Pearson received the Nobel Peace Prize for his leadership in 
bringing about the creation of the UN peacekeeping force. 
Canada has a proud history of participation in peacekeeping 
operations both under UN and non-UN auspices. Few if any 
countries have a more impressive record of dedicated and 
professional contribution to this essential activity.
<P>
	Nowhere have dedication and professionalism been more 
evident than with our Canadian peacekeepers currently 
providing relief to the victims of the war in the former 
Yugoslavia. Some 2,080 Canadian troops now monitor UN 
protected areas in Croatia, provide protection for relief convoys 
and refugees in Bosnia-Hercegovina, and monitor ceasefire 
agreements in both countries.
<P>
	Canada has supported the participation of its forces in this UN 
mission to promote peaceful settlement and to provide relief to 
its many victims. As one of the largest contingents to the UN 
protection force Canadians have selflessly put themselves in 
danger by undertaking difficult assignments. Service women 
and men have participated in the European community monitor 
mission and non-UN mission overseeing the ceasefire 
throughout the former Yugoslavia and were instrumental in 
opening Sarajevo airport for the delivery of humanitarian relief 
supplies.
<P>
	Canada has also provided a ship to sanction enforcement 
operations in the Adriatic Sea and has deployed a naval support 
ship and the Aurora maritime patrol aircraft to this effort. In 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11248"> 11248 </A></B>
<P>
addition, the NATO AWACS aircraft enforcing the no fly zone 
over Bosnia includes Canadians.
<P>
	One must always recognize the daily acts of courage of 
individual peacekeepers. The threat of danger the Canadian 
personnel might encounter during the course of a day is what 
many of us here at home can only imagine. Their presence in this 
war torn region presents a risk to their lives and is a constant 
worry to their families at home.
<P>
<B>(2105) </B>
<P>
	One must always ask whether we can continue to make a 
difference. We know our presence in the Balkans has made a 
difference to the children, the elderly, the women and all other 
innocent victims of this cruel war.
<P>
	Is the UN presence continuing to make a difference to the 
peace process? If the answer is yes, it is our responsibility to 
remain in the area. If little progress is being made toward peace, 
the government must seriously consider our current 
commitment.
<P>
	The service of Canadian peacekeepers in Bosnia and Croatia 
has not been without its ordeals. In the last six months the 
danger to our Canadian peacekeepers has increased daily. Many 
Canadians have been shot at by snipers and non-UN soldiers. 
Several of them have been seriously injured.
<P>
	In November, 55 Canadian soldiers were taken hostage and 
held against their will for over two weeks behind the 
confrontation lines of this war torn country. The time has now 
come to reconsider our commitment to the mission in Bosnia 
and Croatia. That is the purpose of the debate tonight.
<P>
	In light of the increase in risk to the lives of Canadians we 
must come to a decision on whether to send neutrals to the UN 
peacekeeping mission in the former Yugoslavia and we must 
consider our role.
<P>
	We have not stopped the fighting but we have prevented the 
war from spreading to other regions. We have made 
accomplishments in the region and have made a difference to the 
lives of many families living in the midst of a horrifying war.
<P>
	Canada's involvement is said to create the breathing space 
within which diplomats and political leaders can negotiate a 
peaceful solution to a bloody war. New developments have 
taken place since we last debated the subject in the House.
<P>
	As the defence minister recently mentioned, Croatian 
President Tudjman stated that he wanted all UNPROFOR to 
leave Croatia. An agreement was worked out, however, and the 
details of these terms and conditions are presently being 
negotiated.
<P>
	The dynamics are now changing and the UN forces are 
undergoing a restructuring process that will affect all 
participants in the UN mission. Under the new agreement 
Canada's role should be to continue to help implement a 
ceasefire agreement worked out with the maintenance of borders 
and the maintenance of the all important humanitarian 
measures.
<P>
	At the moment we have about 2,100 soldiers preparing to 
replace the personnel who have been in Bosnia and Croatia since 
their tour of duty began six months ago. We know they will 
continue the excellent work being accomplished in the region 
but it is dangerous work.
<P>
	We have also had excellent leadership on the issue from the 
Minister of National Defence and the Minister of Foreign 
Affairs. I commend their efforts. A good number of my 
constituents' comments on Canada's peacekeeping strength and 
their determination to ensure the promotion of international 
human rights and our humanitarian contribution in the Balkan 
region are on the record of the ministers.
<P>
	In closing, Canadians continue to see peacekeepers as an 
important contribution to the maintenance of international order 
and stability. The people of Etobicoke-Lakeshore will after 
careful consideration continue to support the involvement of the 
Canadian forces in this peacekeeping effort. After all, we are 
helping to ease the suffering of millions of innocent people.
<P>
	I am confident we will continue to fulfil our international 
obligations through negotiations and peacekeeping to bring 
about peace in the Balkan region.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to rise on behalf of my 
constituents in Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt to 
participate in the debate this evening.
<P>
	We on this side of the House realize that the final decision is 
the responsibility of the government. We appreciate that the 
government gave us the opportunity to be heard tonight on this 
very important issue.
<P>
	The government said it would like to hear what we had to say 
in order to help it make the decision whether or not we should 
continue to maintain our present commitment in the former 
Yugoslavia.
<P>
<B>(2110 ) </B>
<P>
	Interestingly this is a take note debate regarding the rotation 
of Canadian forces. The hon. member for Red Deer earlier used 
the words of an Eagles song, one of my favourite musical 
groups. I am not sure which group sang this song: ``Leaving on a 
Jet Plane''. In actual fact the troops' bags are packed. They are 
set to go. On Monday they leave for Bosnia and Croatia in this 
troop rotation.
<P>
	According to my calendar today's date is March 29. The 
commitment to the former Yugoslavia ends on April 1. Yet the 
government wants to consult Canadians by holding an 
emergency debate tonight at the 11th hour. We all know nothing 
can be done to stop that rotation from taking place.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11249"> 11249 </A></B>
<P>
	Members of the Reform Party have made very clear their 
position on the issue. We should announce and make very clear 
that Canada intends to withdraw from the former Yugoslavia. 
We should give the UN a three-month notice of that decision. 
The reason we are taking this position is that we know it would 
be very difficult for us to pull out immediately and leave a 
vacuum until another nation is able to step in and take over 
where we left off.
<P>
	I feel, therefore, that we should be debating whether Canada 
should commit continued peacekeepers to the former 
Yugoslavia in the long run. If we do not debate the issue now, 
when will the issue be debated?
<P>
	Recognizing the fact that the debate should have occurred 
weeks ago, I state unequivocally that we should pull out and give 
the UN three months notice. Many people on the other side of 
the House may be asking why we should pull out of the former 
Yugoslavia. There are numbers of reasons why we should leave.
<P>
	Despite our past history as peacekeepers to all the world's 
troubled regions, I feel strongly that in this new world order of 
regional, ethnic and tribal conflict running rampant and with 
Canada's own defence resources shrinking at an alarming rate 
the government must develop a commitment criterion to give us 
a guide for future deployments of our peacekeeping troops.
<P>
	On December 1, 1994 the Reform caucus issued a statement 
which outlined the four conditions that should be met to keep 
Canadian peacekeepers in the former Yugoslavia. We developed 
these criteria because of the numerous violations and because 
Canadian troops were being held hostage.
<P>
	At that time we said, first, that all UN detainees should be 
released immediately; second, that the warring factions should 
agree to cease all aggressive actions toward the UNPROFOR 
troops; third, that the Sarajevo airport should be immediately 
reopened and all humanitarian aid should be allowed to proceed 
without interference by any of the warring factions; and, fourth, 
that a ceasefire should be put in place and honoured by all sides.
<P>
	Let us look at each one of the points individually. Even though 
all UN detainees have been released there is still no guarantee 
that the warring factions would not undertake such activity 
again. As a matter of fact with the situation in Bosnia we are in 
close contact with Serbian troops on a daily basis. It is a very 
volatile situation. It is something that could possibly happen.
<P>
	There have been less aggressive acts toward UNPROFOR 
over the past couple of months but incidents do occur. There is 
no guarantee in place by the warring factions to prevent any 
future aggressive acts. All humanitarian aid is not getting 
through. Anyone who says it is, is simply not stating the truth.
<P>
	Two weeks ago the Montreal <I>Gazette</I> reported that there was a 
desperate food shortage in the Bihac pocket because of the 
heavy fighting between government troops and the alliance of 
Bosnia Serbs, Croatian Serbs and the renegade Bosnian 
Muslims. I would like to quote from the Associated Press report:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Serbs generally refuse to give the United Nations permission to move 
convoys into the region through Serb-held territory. The United Nations does not 
have a mandate to use force to get its humanitarian aid through.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The UN World Food Program, based in Rome, said only 5,000 people in the 
enclave get regular meals from public kitchens. Patients in hospitals eat only one 
meal a day.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Only an estimated 20 per cent of the people trapped in the region have received 
any donated food during the past six months, the agency said.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(2115) </B>
<P>
	The reason for the failure of the first three criteria is due to the 
failure of the fourth criterion which the Reform Party laid down. 
There is no ceasefire in place in Bosnia that is being honoured by 
all sides. Do the warring factions even actually want peace? Are 
they willing to make a lasting truce upon which a negotiated 
peaceful settlement will be found?
<P>
	In the case of Bosnia it appears the answer is a resounding no. 
The combatants do not want peace. Short-lived truces are only 
holding long enough for the combatants to reform and refit. As 
we can see, the latest truce between the Bosnian government and 
the rebel Serbs is crumbling. It is crumbling as we debate this 
issue tonight. As UN spokesman Alexander Ivanko said 
yesterday: ``It is our understanding both parties continue to opt 
for a military option''.
<P>
	We must consider the facts. Without a meaningful negotiation 
between the combatants, peace is only wishful thinking. The 
role of a peacekeeper is to keep the combatants apart while they 
negotiate peace. There is no peace and there is no negotiation. 
Canadian troops are more like pawns in a game of chess between 
the differing parties. The threat of interference by both Serbs 
and Bosnians has not been reduced.
<P>
	It is dangerous to train and equip our troops for traditional 
peacekeeping missions when we are putting them into a 
situation which cannot succeed, where there is no peace or a will 
for peace between the parties.
<P>
	Many in the House will defend our humanitarian role on 
grounds that the civilians would be worse off without the 
peacekeepers. I can sympathize with that because I travelled 
there. We should be very proud of our troops. They have done a 
good job.
<P>
	In the short term it may be true that the presence of UN 
peacekeepers in Bosnia may have prevented widespread 
starvation. However, at the same time the UN presence may 
have actually perpetuated division, squalor and low-level 
fighting for longer than would otherwise have been the case. We 
must 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11250"> 11250 </A></B>
<P>
ask: Is the present morass a  success or has the United Nations 
become part of the problem despite its best intentions?
<P>
	The fact remains that the UN's involvement in Bosnia is in 
limbo, with the very strong possibility that Canadians will be 
forced into a situation of peacemaking. If the international 
community is serious about making peace, then maybe the 
military role ought to be handed over to NATO with a mandate to 
end the fighting through military means. Yes, I know that 
solution is also problematic. It is again possible that nothing 
will be solved. The warring parties will not have settled their 
differences and fighting would resume once NATO withdrew.
<P>
	This House must recognize that we should only be sending 
troops on peacekeeping missions where the warring parties have 
fought their battles and are ready to negotiate and to sit down at 
the negotiating table to come to terms with a lasting peace.
<P>
	What we are doing is committing our soldiers and our nation 
to a moral dilemma. We must stay forever or else by leaving, 
become responsible for the resumption of hostilities. Canada 
cannot afford and has no moral authority to become not only the 
world's policeman but a permanent benevolent occupier in 
troubled areas.
<P>
<B>(2120 ) </B>
<P>
	Is this commitment going to turn into one of 29 years or more 
in the former Yugoslavia as we ended up committing ourselves 
to in Cyprus? Remember this is just another chapter in a 
centuries old conflict that appears to be without an end.
<P>
	As we debate this issue in the House tonight we can clearly see 
that none of the four criteria outlined by the Reform caucus has 
been met. Support for our continued presence in Bosnia is 
waning at home as well.
<P>
	I heard one of the members on the other side of the House ask: 
What are your constituents saying? In my riding we conducted a 
telephone poll and 68 per cent of the constituents told me they 
would like us to leave as quickly as possible.
<P>
	For just 30 seconds, Mr. Speaker, I would quickly like to turn 
to Croatia where President Tudjman would like to see UN 
peacekeepers, at least he did say he would like them out of-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am sorry, the member's time is up 
unless there is unanimous consent. There are at least six other 
members who were hoping to speak in this debate, as I 
understand it. Is there unanimous consent to give the member 
additional time beyond his 10 minutes?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Very well, the member has unanimous 
consent.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hart:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the members of the House.
<P>
	President Tudjman in Croatia has had a change of heart and 
said he would like to keep some peacekeepers in Croatia. The 
problem is that the only peacekeepers he would like to remain 
would be unarmed monitors. That is not satisfactory in this 
volatile situation. We should get our troops out before any 
further fighting begins. We should give the United Nations three 
months warning that we are planning to do that so it can fill the 
vacuum when we leave.
<P>
	Finally, all Canadians can be proud of the Canadian troops 
who have served their country valiantly and well in the former 
Yugoslavia.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leonard Hopkins (Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this has been a very good debate tonight. I 
congratulate all those who have spoken for their candour and 
openness and for putting their points forward.
<P>
	We have to remind ourselves that Canada was one of the key 
founders of the United Nations, one of the key partners in that 
formation.
<P>
	Today's problems are many and great, as has been pointed out. 
However they pale significantly when one recalls the world wars 
and catastrophes that have occurred over the history of mankind. 
The United Nations was founded to try to prevent that from 
happening again. It requires every responsible nation that 
belongs to the UN to pull its weight and to work toward the aim 
of peace, regardless of how frustrating and how crooked that 
road may seem.
<P>
	Many Canadian peacekeepers have served in the former 
Yugoslavia, particularly in Bosnia-Hercegovina and Croatia. 
Today some 2,080 are over there performing their role on behalf 
of Canada and the international community.
<P>
	It behoves each and every one of us in the House tonight to 
thank the people who have served there in the past and in other 
peacekeeping duties around the world. They have served Canada 
well and will continue to do so. It also behoves us tonight to 
thank the Canadian people at large for the support they have 
given our Canadian soldiers as they go about doing their great 
mission on behalf of international peace.
<P>
	Recently we heard that the Bosnian Serbs have called for a 
general mobilization. That is bad news. It almost seems as if 
when summertime comes the weather is better for fighting. It is 
a sad commentary on mankind.
<P>
<B>(2125 ) </B>
<P>
	Hatred is older than the hills, but it is there and it must be dealt 
with. It must be dealt with by responsible nations, those that 
maintain their calmness in duty and have very specific 
responsible aims in place as they look to the future.

	This has not only been a great challenge for the United 
Nations. It has created frustration for many as well. This is the 
largest UN operation to date. Therefore, it undoubtedly demands 
the greatest cohesion and togetherness we are going to see in a 
UN operation probably since the Korean war.
<P>
	We have had many fires to put out along the road of 
international history over the last half century since the 
founding of the United Nations, but this is not a time to let go of 
the traces. It is not a time to stop pulling for peace in the world 
for which we all strive.
<P>
	There is a Chinese proverb which says that fury is nothing but 
the energy of weakness. Nothing exemplifies this statement any 
better than the ongoing circumstances in the former Yugoslavia. 
There is another saying that ignorance never settles a question. 
It simply keeps the argument all stirred up.
<P>
	I love reading history. J. M. S. Careless wrote the book 
<I>Canada-A Story of Challenge</I>. The 19th chapter deals with a 
maturing nation. We must remember tonight that many people 
came from countries across Europe in the early days to settle in 
Canada. They came here to find peace, a place where they could 
make a life for their families. As we stand here tonight in the 
House we certainly can understand very well how many people 
in disturbed parts of the world must be looking forward to the 
days when they can see some peace.
<P>
	Canada has worked on behalf of refugees, the children's fund, 
humanitarian supplies. We have put troops into very difficult 
situations. We have had an international airlift from Italy in 
Sarajevo since July 1992. The Canadian forces Hercules 130 
transport planes have been busy with 1,600 flights, 11,300 
passengers and 26,600 tonnes of food and medical supplies into 
Sarajevo. That is a small part of what our Canadian forces have 
done.
<P>
	Tonight it behoves all of us to take into consideration the work 
that has been done to date. We must stand firm and work with our 
partners in the United Nations toward the goal of the UN for 
which it was founded half a century ago: to try to bring peace to 
mankind and some sanity to the world.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The time has expired for the three 
hours set aside for the debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. de Jong:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I seek 
unanimous consent of the House to extend the debate for myself 
and the member for Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca.
<P>
<B>(2130) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Flis:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. We also have 
two members who sat here all evening, participating and 
listening very carefully. I am wondering whether you could seek 
agreement to extend the debate to allow the remaining speakers 
time but limit the debate to maybe five minutes each, which 
would not go beyond 9.50 p.m. or 10 p.m.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Certain members have indicated they 
wish to speak. Is there unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simon de Jong (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is not with pleasure that I join the debate. I am certain 
all members present do not find much joy in debating this 
subject. We have debated the topic several times. Parliament has 
sat late to debate our role in the former Yugoslavia.
<P>
	This time as I listened to members from all political parties I 
sensed a sense of weariness with what our role has been. There is 
more weariness now than I heard in previous debates.
<P>
	The Reform Party is calling for our troops to be brought home. 
The minister of defence made it abundantly clear in his remarks 
that even if he recommits our troops it would only be for a 
limited period of time.
<P>
	The Leader of the Opposition talked in terms of renewing our 
mandate because there is not much choice. The views expressed 
by the members of the House really reflect the mood in the 
country from coast to coast.
<P>
	The lack of progress in ending hostilities, the ongoing 
flagrant denial of basic human rights while our troops under the 
UN command stand helplessly by, the incidents in which our 
troops were detained and humiliated as well as our budgetary 
problems have all added to the sense of weariness.
<P>
	What are we doing there is the basic fundamental question 
that gets asked. It is important for us and for Canadians to 
realize the tremendous job Canadian troops have done. There 
would have been a lot more death, destruction, carnage, rape and 
denial of basic civilized human rights had there not been the 
United Nations and the Canadian troops present.
<P>
	It is hard to quantify that but let there be no doubt Canadian 
troops have saved innocent lives. It is important that all 
Canadians tip their hats to the men and women both in the 
RCMP and in our military who have done a very professional 
job. Canada can be proud of them.
<P>
	The frustration we feel is also the frustration the Croatian 
people feel. I and two other members of the House visited 
Croatia in June 1994. We talked to its foreign minister as well as 
members of its Parliament. Overwhelmingly they talked in 
terms of ending the Vance peace agreement of 1994, the mandate 
by which UNPROFOR forces are in Croatia.
<P>
	The Croatians have the same fear the minister of defence 
expressed, that this becomes a permanent situation. Under the 
original agreement the local Serb groups were to be disarmed. 
There was to be UN monitoring and taking over heavy 
armaments. Non-Serbs were to be allowed back home. None of 
this has happened. The concern is this present occupation of 
almost 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11252"> 11252 </A></B>
<P>
one-third of Croatia by Serb forces will become a permanent 
situation.
<P>
	When one looks at a map for the areas controlled by the Serbs, 
one sees how it prevents north-south and east-west 
communications and transportation in Croatia. Croatia cannot 
economically develop as long as this situation continues. There 
is a tremendous sense of frustration.
<P>
	When President Tudjman called for an end to the mandate, he 
was not speaking for himself. It was a unanimous decision 
passed by the Parliament of Croatia. Because of international 
pressure the Croatian government has agreed to back down.
<P>
<B>(2135 ) </B>
<P>
	An agreement was reached with Mr. Tudjman and the Vice- 
President of the United States, Al Gore, in Copenhagen. That 
agreement has not been implemented in a mandate. There is no 
agreement as things stand now for a new mandate. That is why 
the government a bit amiss when it asks the House for advice to 
renew that mandate. Right now no mandate exists.
<P>
	The agreement reached in Copenhagen has not been finalized 
in an agreement that would allow a new mandate to be 
implemented in Croatia. In part what we are discussing here 
could very well be beside the point. The Croatian government 
has given until the end of May to reach this agreement. I 
understand the condition will continue as it is now until the end 
of May.
<P>
	No agreement exists right now that would allow Canadian 
troops to stay in Croatia. Hopefully something can be achieved 
by the end of May. If it can be achieved, I urge the Canadian 
government to allow our Canadian troops to remain there for 
humanitarian purposes in the hope and prayer we all share, that 
peace can be achieved in that part of the world. Our prayers are 
with them.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I trust colleagues will agree to let the 
pages leave.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. George Proud (Hillsborough, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I can 
safely say every member of the House respects and honours our 
peacekeepers serving around the world. We all know the story of 
Lester B. Pearson inventing the concept we now call 
peacekeeping. Not all of us know Canada has participated in 
every United Nations military effort since Korea.
<P>
	All this brings us to the debate at hand about the future of 
Canadian peacekeepers in the former Yugoslavia. Since the 
beginning of the conflict Canada has been an active participant 
helping end conflicts there. Through our partnerships in NATO, 
the organization for security and co-operation in Europe, and 
the international contact group in Yugoslavia we have sought 
ways to bring safety to that troubled land.
<P>
	Canada has contributed almost $60 million in humanitarian 
aid through various international and non-governmental 
organizations. Our presence in Bosnia and Croatia has helped 
save the lives of countless thousands of people. Our aid 
programs have helped to alleviate the sufferings of those 
trapped in these conflicts.
<P>
	Many Canadians are questioning our role in the former 
Yugoslavia, whether we are even needed there. I believe we are 
needed there. We must stay there.
<P>
	As has been said, 2,100 Canadians are serving as 
peacekeepers and monitors today in the former Yugoslavia. As 
part of our commitment to NATO, Canada is obligated to help 
protect the western European security. In keeping that 
commitment we are at the forefront of NATO expansion and we 
are helping prevent the Yugoslavian crisis from spilling over 
into other parts of Europe.
<P>
	There is always a potential for peace. There is still a potential 
for peace in the former Yugoslavia. However, for that peace to 
exist there must be an end to the continual fighting among the 
various factions. Our humanitarian efforts are helping people 
realize they can get along in the spirit of co-operation and 
mutual understanding.
<P>
	Our peacekeepers are there to prevent acts that might be 
destructive to any sense of understanding. After all, it was an 
assassin's bullets on the streets of Sarajevo that sparked the first 
world war.
<P>
<B>(2140) </B>
<P>
	If our peacekeepers can prevent such a pivotal action from 
taking place, they must remain there to make sure this peace 
comes eventually. Our presence is necessary.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the House for allowing us to continue the debate 
this evening.
<P>
	I would like to express my profound gratitude to the Canadian 
men and women who serve in our armed forces. They have 
received a lot of criticism of late, much of it unjustified. They 
have for many decades conducted themselves professionally, 
effectively and with bravery. Lest we forget, they have done us 
all proud. Some from the PPCLI come from my riding of 
Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, and I am deeply gratified to those 
people specifically.
<P>
	The views I am going to express are those of my own. They are 
not held by my caucus. Although there is much on which we 
agree, on the bottom line of whether we should pull out of 
Bosnia and Hercegovina and Croatia we disagree. I do not think 
we should and I will give the following explanation.
<P>
	Let us first understand what our troops are doing there. For 
over three years under UNPROFOR they have enabled the 
<P>

<B><A NAME="11253"> 11253 </A></B>
<P>
UNHCR to provide aid for those people who have nothing. 
Currently over six million people receive aid that would not 
have got to them had it not  been for the troops of UNPROFOR 
and for those people who work with the UNHCR.
<P>
	They diffuse situations on a daily basis which could blow up 
and cause death. They liaise between belligerents. They involve 
themselves in prisoner exchanges and their mere presence has 
prevented hundreds of thousands of people from being killed. 
Anybody who would like to disagree, who would allow this to 
occur, I would ask them to put themselves in the shoes of 
someone living in Srebrenica, Gorazde or Bihac and ask what 
they would like the international community to do if they were 
there.
<P>
	If we were to move out, our other allies would leave and we 
can be certain there would be carnage, torture and mass killings 
on a scale which we have not yet seen. It would be an orgy of 
blood letting. We would see this courtesy of CNN.
<P>
	Furthermore, we would see an expanded conflict. Not for a 
minute should we delude ourselves that the Croats will not to 
start to fight with the Krajina-Serbs. Let us not delude ourselves 
that the Bosnian Muslims and the Bosnian Serbs will not attack 
each other. Let us not delude ourselves that the Federal Republic 
of Yugoslavia would not get involved with the Krajina-Serbs or 
that Bosnia would not start to attack other people.
<P>
	Then what will happen, because of our responsibilities under 
NATO, is we would be dragged into that. We would be dragged 
into an enlarged conflict which would cost us in terms of men 
and women and also in terms of dollars. That is exactly what will 
happen if we pull out and allow this to occur. There is no 
contingency plan for a pull out right now.
<P>
	Therefore I propose, with my colleagues, that we put pressure 
on the belligerents to start keeping the Sarajevo airport open. 
Let us ensure our peacekeepers will be there to conduct and 
provide aid through the UNHCR. Let us also work with the 
United States to put pressure on the EU and the OSCE to find a 
regional solution to this problem because that is where it lies.
<P>
	The former Yugoslavia has been called the shame of the west. 
We have not done what was required through preventive 
diplomacy to prevent this tragedy. It should be a lesson for those 
countries that will blow up in the future.
<P>
	I do not think there will be a diplomatic solution to this 
problem. That is a tragedy. What will happen is the belligerents, 
the Serbs, the Croats and the Muslims, will fight it out and then 
diplomacy will occur. There is no way they want to solve this 
other than at the end of an assault rifle.
<P>
	My primary concern is for the civilians who bear the brunt of 
these civil conflicts time and time again. We must provide a safe 
zone for those individuals and allow an area that will be 
protected with force by international troops so that civilians 
who choose to go there will be protected and have their basic 
needs met. Tragically what is going to happen is that the 
belligerents are going to  fight. Rather than us actually being 
those troops, we should work now to remove our troops and have 
EU troops take our place.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Murphy (Annapolis Valley-Hants, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise tonight to participate in this 
important debate.
<P>
	I support, as does the government, a continued role for 
Canada's peacekeepers in the former Yugoslavia. Canada has an 
important role to play in finding solutions and in helping bring 
peace to the region.
<P>
	Canada has a proud and distinctive record in preserving world 
peace and fostering global security. Since the creation of the 
first UN emergency force in 1956 there have been 26 other UN 
peacekeeping missions. In every case Canada participated in 
some way. This record of excellence has been further enhanced 
by our presence in the former Yugoslavia. From the beginning 
Canada has participated fully in efforts to promote a peaceful 
settlement to the conflict and provide relief to its victims.
<P>
	In September 1991 we led the call for the UN security council 
to deal with the issue. However there are those who would argue 
that Canada should pull out. We do not think the problem is yet 
to be resolved. Despite our presence the conflict rages on with 
no end in sight.
<P>
	It is true that we have not been able to secure peace in the 
region. For the peacekeepers involved, for all members of 
Parliament and for all Canadians, this is a grave issue of 
concern. While it is frustrating to see the conflict continue, we 
must remember the many positive contributions that Canada and 
other countries have made to the region. These contributions, as 
has been said here numerous times, are the delivery of food, 
medical supplies, clothing, shelter and so on.
<P>
	Make no mistake about it. For those living in some of the war 
torn areas of the region, Canada's continued presence makes a 
difference. We have protected the lives of innocent victims of 
the conflict. We have a responsibility and a moral obligation to 
continue that help.
<P>
	Our efforts also continue on the diplomatic front. We continue 
to consult regularly with all countries contributing troops to the 
UN protection force. By extending our commitment to the UN 
protection force we are by no means committing ourselves to the 
status quo. The valuable work our troops continue to do in the 
region cannot be seen in isolation from our efforts to find 
innovative solutions for peace.
<P>
	Our experience over the past few years indicates that we need 
to explore more innovative options. Recent peacekeeping 
missions have shown that the traditional approach no longer 
applies. Clearly our long term commitment to international 
peace and security must be closely tied with efforts to make 
peacekeeping and, more important, peace building effective 
security mechanisms.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="11254"> 11254 </A></B>
<P>
	Given our longstanding commitment in international 
peacekeeping, Canada has a wealth of experience to contribute 
to future discussions. By renewing our commitment we are 
sending a strong signal that Canada's first priority is to help find 
a peaceful settlement to the dispute.
<P>
	In closing, I would like to read an excerpt from a letter I 
received from one of my constituents who was serving with the 
UN protection force. He writes: ``Hello from southern Croatia. I 
hope people back home realize how dedicated their soldiers are. 
From what I have seen so far, everybody down here realizes how 
professional we Canadians are''.
<P>
	I would like to acknowledge the excellent work of Canada's 
peacekeepers stationed in the former Yugoslavia.
<P>
