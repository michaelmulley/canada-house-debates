</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK22"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ)</B> moved: 
<A NAME="LINK23">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House urges the government to respect provincial 
jurisdiction over health care management, to increase transfers 
to the provinces for health care unconditionally, and to avoid 
using budget surpluses to encroach upon the health care field. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said: Mr. Speaker, today as we speak an important 
federal-provincial conference is being held on the social union. 
We are aware that at the very heart of this planned social union 
lies the issue of jurisdiction over health care management and 
health care services throughout Canada, and all the provinces, 
including Quebec, of course. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also aware that Canadians and Quebeckers want to see 
major investments in health.  There have been unprecedented 
federal cuts to social programs, half of those to health, and 
these have jeopardized the provinces' ability to deliver quality 
health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, it is the openly stated wish of nearly all 
stakeholders that health care management be restored to the 
provinces, that Quebec be the only one involved in its health 
sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The <I>Montreal Gazette</I>—not known for being pro-sovereignist—recently 
called on the federal government to unconditionally 
re-establish the health care transfer payments to the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, today the federal government's political visibility 
moves it to do something with the budget surplus, a surplus 
accumulated on the backs of the provinces, at an annual rate of 
$6.3 billion, and on the backs of the unemployed and businesses. 
I remind the House that $20 billion was taken—and that is the 
nice way of saying it—from the employment insurance fund by 
this government under false pretences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that surpluses have been accumulated on the backs of the 
provinces and the unemployed, this government is trying to set 
itself up as a saviour by saying to people “We will fix your 
health problems”.  And yet it is this government that created 
the current chaos and the problems the provinces are facing. 
This government wants to arrive and say “We have the solutions”. 
It has no solutions, it created the problems.  The solution is 
to return the money where it took it from, where it spirited it 
away, and I cannot say it any other way, it would be 
unparliamentary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is nothing surprising in the fact that this government has 
acted this way for years and today talks about transparency, 
especially in health care, when it spirited away $20 billion on 
the backs of the unemployed saying “We shall determine 
employment insurance contributions”. 
Yet this government does not put one red cent into the 
employment insurance system, which is wholly funded by 
businesses and employees. However, this government is taking 
this money assigned to employment insurance and spending it here 
and there to reduce the deficit, and is planning to give the 
wealthy a tax break at the expense of the unemployed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember the Prime Minister stating that he had been paying EI 
premiums for the past 35 years when in fact he never did. There 
is cause for concern when the number one decision maker does not 
even know how the system works. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like a studious seminarian, the Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs recites a litany of so-called federal responsibilities 
over health matters. 
What this pious Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs fails to 
mention, however, is that the federal government acquired these 
responsibilities in the area of health care over time by 
interfering in and encroaching on provincial jurisdictions with 
its spending power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This spending power is the crux of the political, constitutional 
and budgetary problem we are facing, which is the focus of the 
discussions, today, on social union. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1015"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This spending power is how the government has managed to intrude 
everywhere. In every attempt at constitutional reform, the issue 
of spending power has come up. The Liberal Party has always 
opposed these reforms and even sabotaged them, to preserve this 
spending power. And this is particularly true with this Prime 
Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members should remember 1982, when Quebec was isolated. Remember 
the smell in the kitchens of the Château Laurier. Remember that 
this Prime Minister also derailed the Meech Lake accord with 
Jean Charest. Remember who said “Thank you, Clyde” in Calgary, 
and Clyde has now been appointed to the Newfoundland supreme 
court. These people know how to reward their friends. It is this 
government and these same people who, for 35 years, have been 
using all the budget surpluses, while also generating deficits. 
We are not even talking about surpluses anymore. These people 
created major deficits by using their spending power to intrude 
on jurisdictions that are not theirs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of all this, we now have a $600 billion debt. It is 
costing us $45 billion annually to service a debt that was 
generated through unnecessary intrusions. The government created 
bureaucracies where there was no need for such structures, and 
it will create yet another by setting up a national health care 
monitoring system, by using statisticians and controllers such 
as those who are trying to cut EI benefits, in compliance with 
this minister's guidelines. Instead of writing books, the 
minister should start reading his mail and look at what is going 
on in his department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the same folks who were responsible for such a debt, 
who have built up an entire bureaucracy when what is needed are 
not statisticians and inspectors, but doctors, nurses, clinical 
workers and hospital support workers, because these people do 
their utmost to deliver good service.  We should be singing 
their praises.  They cannot do their jobs because people on the 
other side have cut $6.3 billion annually.  The amount has 
dropped from $19 billion to $12 billion or $12.5 billion.  The 
government wants us to believe these people added $7 billion. 
The truth is that the government cut $42 billion and not $49 
billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I should let you know that I will be sharing my 
time with the member for Drummondville.  Please let me know when 
I am nearing the end of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the government says it has to ensure the quality of health 
care, is that not telling the provinces that they are not 
responsible enough to manage their own affairs?  Are provincial 
leaders being told that they are irresponsible?  That they lack 
compassion?  These folks have been running health care in Canada 
for 132 years.  Everything was fine until transfer payments were 
cut. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now these people are being told they are not competent to look 
after their own affairs.  Ottawa will take care of it.  It is 
the old “Ottawa knows best” song.  We know it.  We know how this 
government likes to meddle in other people's business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government gives us the assurances line but the Minister of 
Finance tells us the reason he is unable to reinvest in health 
right now is because he does not have all the assurances.  Yet 
Saskatoon has given them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, all of the premiers have written recently to tell the 
Prime Minister what they will reiterate again today, which is 
that they are committed to scrupulously respect the health care 
principles underlying the health legislation. They are also 
committed to invest all of the money in health care. But they do 
not have to be told to invest it in this particular hospital or 
in this service. The health care issue cannot be left to 
bureaucrats or politicians set on gaining more visibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since we are talking about the principles guiding health care 
management and all health care services throughout Canada, I 
will conclude by saying that the government is trying to 
establish a sixth principle, which is visibility, just as they 
are trying to do with the millennium scholarship fund, another 
area upon which they should not be infringing. 
If the Prime Minister is so set on getting more visibility, he 
could replace the image of Queen Elizabeth II with his own on 
all $20 bills.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
take part in this debate on the opposition motion brought 
forward by the Bloc Quebecois, which reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House urges the government to respect provincial 
jurisdiction over health care management, to increase transfers 
to the provinces for health care unconditionally, and to avoid 
using budget surpluses to encroach upon the health care field. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is sad that we have to move heaven and earth to make the 
government understand things that should normally be obvious 
when we are just two weeks away from the tabling of the federal 
budget. Nevertheless, the poorly hidden agenda of the Prime 
Minister and his Liberal government makes such a debate 
necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion before us includes the following three elements: 
respecting provincial jurisdiction, increasing transfers 
unconditionally and using budget surpluses more efficiently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only thing to do is to restore transfer payments for health 
care and social services unconditionally. The provinces want 
more money put into health care and they want the federal 
government to let them manage the health care system according 
to their priorities, as stipulated in the Canada Health Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to quote from a short text which reminds us of the 
federal government's role in the area of health care: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The respective responsibilities of the federal government and 
the provincial governments with regard to health care are very 
different. 
Strictly speaking, the federal government cannot re-establish and 
maintain a national medicare system because it does not have the 
power to regulate delivery of health care to individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, under the Canadian Constitution and the interpretation 
courts have given of it, health is mainly a provincial 
jurisdiction. The only clauses in the Constitution which 
explicitly refer to health establish the federal's jurisdiction 
over navy hospitals and quarantine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government only 
maintains health services for groups which come under its 
jurisdiction, namely natives, the population of Yukon, Canadian 
armed forces, veterans as well as inmates in federal 
penitentiaries. Provincial governments are responsible for 
establishing the number of beds available in their respective 
territories, which categories of personnel will be hired and how 
the system will serve the population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well provinces approve 
hospital budgets, negotiate fee scales with medical associations 
and administer their health programs within their own 
territorial boundaries. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems quite clear to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The show of strength of 1982 confirmed the distribution of 
powers as established by the Constitution Act of 1867. This same 
act, in sections 92(13) and 92(16), gives jurisdiction to 
provinces over health matters except in a few precise areas. The 
role of the federal government regarding health care is to 
redistribute money. The federal government raises funds through 
taxation and redistributes that money unconditionally as 
transfers to provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, health is a provincial jurisdiction and the federal 
government has no right to interfere in any way, nor is it 
allowed to interfere in education with its millennium funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past, the finance minister seemed to be more mindful of 
provincial jurisdiction in health care. 
According to the minister himself the greater freedom of action 
of provinces in their own jurisdictions was even one of the 
reasons why he established the Canadian social transfer.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Elinor Caplan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on the opposition motion 
before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to address the role played by the federal 
government through the Canada Health Act which enshrines the 
principles and governs federal health transfer payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the Canadian Constitution the responsibility for health 
care delivery falls primarily under the jurisdiction of the 
provincial and territorial governments.  They have the primary 
responsibility for the provision and the delivery of health care 
services to the people of Canada. The provinces and the 
territories have responsibility to plan, manage and administer 
their own health care delivery systems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government for its part by law is responsible for 
the promotion and preservation of the health of all Canadians. 
Health Canada is responsible for bringing all jurisdictions 
together to tackle the health issues of national and 
interprovincial concern. The federal government assumes 
responsibility for setting national policies and for providing 
health care services to specific groups, for example treaty 
Indians and the Inuit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is appropriate when describing federal responsibilities in 
health care to note what the federal government cannot do.  It 
cannot interfere in provincial and territorial responsibilities 
as defined under our Constitution, nor can it be seen to be 
interfering in those responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is in this country a longstanding partnership between the 
federal and provincial and territorial governments with regard to 
health care. 
The enactment of the Hospital Insurance and Diagnostic Services 
Act of 1957 and the Medical Care Act of 1966 established the 
framework for this partnership between governments. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1035"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT8"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT8"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1035

<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this time the federal government provided cost sharing for 
medically necessary hospital and physician services in return for 
the adherence of provincial and territorial health insurance 
plans to the principles of a national program. Federal 
legislation, the Hospital Insurance and Diagnostic Services Act 
and the Medical Care Act, recognized the constitutional 
responsibility of the provincial and territorial governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Concerns over hospital user fees and extra billing by physicians 
led to the passage of the Canada Health Act in 1984.  After a 
very heated and historic debate, this was achieved with all-party 
support, a unanimous vote in this House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada Health Act establishes certain conditions that the 
provincial and territorial plans must meet in order to qualify 
for their full share of federal health care transfer payments. 
These criteria and conditions, pillars of Canada's health care 
system, are:  one, reasonable access to medically required 
services unimpeded by charges at the point of service or other 
barriers; two, comprehensive coverage for medically required 
services; three, universality of insured coverage for all 
provincial residents on equal terms and conditions; four, 
portability of benefits within Canada and abroad; and five, 
public administration of the health insurance plan on a 
non-profit basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to the above criteria, the conditions of the act 
require that the provinces provide information as required by the 
federal minister and give appropriate recognition to federal 
contributions toward health care services in order to qualify for 
the federal cash contributions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The act also discourages the application of extra billing or 
user charges through automatic dollar for dollar reductions or 
the withholding of federal cash contributions to a province or 
territory that permits such direct charges to patients. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, the threat that user charges and extra billing would 
erode accessibility to needed medical care was a major impetus in 
the development of the Canada Health Act. The Canada Health Act 
was enacted to protect the fundamental principles of our publicly 
financed, comprehensive, portable and universally accessible 
system of health insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provinces and territories retained the responsibility of 
administering their health insurance plans under the Canada 
Health Act and for planning and managing their respective 
systems. This means that they, the provinces and territories, 
have the responsibility for negotiating with physicians.  It 
means that they, the provinces and the territories, have the 
responsibility for establishing budgets for their hospitals, for 
the approval of their capital plans and for the management of 
health care personnel and all related delivery issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the Canada Health Act has afforded the provinces 
sufficient flexibility to manage, develop plans and change the 
structures within their own systems and jurisdictions. For 
example, provinces at their own discretion may insure the 
services of health professionals other than physicians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada Health Act does not interfere with the provincial or 
territorial efforts intended to renew and improve health care 
delivery to make it more effective or efficient and more 
accountable to Canadians. The variations within the provinces and 
territories as they deliver health care demonstrate that the 
necessary and desirable flexibility already exists to respond to 
the different needs of Canadians in the different regions of the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The evolution of federal, provincial and territorial relations 
in health care has maintained a distinction in the federal, 
provincial and territorial roles in health care which are 
consistent with the Constitution's definition of jurisdiction. 
This is clearly stated in the preamble of the Canada Health Act, 
“that it is not the intention of the Government of Canada that 
any of the powers, rights, privileges or authorities vested in 
Canada or the provinces under the provisions of the Constitution 
Act, 1867, formerly named the British North America Act, 1867, or 
any amendments thereto or otherwise, be by reason of this act 
abrogated or derogated from or in any way impaired”.

<A HREF="#LINKT8"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Provinces and territories have affirmed time after time their 
support for the principles of medicare.  The Canada Health Act is 
strongly supported by most Canadians and is regarded as the 
defining principles of medicare and the Canadian values of 
sharing and caring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Poll after poll indicates great public support for these 
national principles.  Even while discussions of health care 
structural reforms are taking place, the values which are 
reflected in each of these principles are still valid and are 
supported, I believe, by an overwhelming majority of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health care is a unifying factor in this country.  When asked to 
rate the importance of a number of symbols of Canadian identity, 
health care topped the list with 89% of Canadians agreeing that 
it was a very important symbol. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly the preservation of medicare is of concern to Canadians. 
Canadians, some 84% of them, rate medicare among the highest 
actions which makes them want to keep Canada together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I wish to underline that the federal government 
has had in the past and will have in the future a legitimate role 
to play in health.  The Canada Health Act is the foundation of 
medicare.  It is an act which respects the primary responsibility 
of the provinces and territories for health care delivery.  At 
the same time it binds this country together with its principles 
and has contributed to making Canadians among the healthiest 
people and the most envied people on this planet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I thank you and members of this House and 
particularly my constituents in the riding of Thornhill for 
giving me the opportunity to participate in this very important 
debate.

<P><A NAME="LINK34"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, when I hear the 
hon. member, it strengthens my convictions as a sovereignist or, 
as the members opposite like to say, as a separatist, and I will 
try to pass those on to my five children and to my neighbours, 
because this is absolutely outrageous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is totally unacceptable to confine the provinces to a merely 
administrative role, while the federal government imposes its 
whims and dictates in the health sector. The hon. member says 
the provinces are primarily responsible for the management side 
of things. This is a partisan interpretation of the 1867 
Constitution, and of the one the Liberals created for 
themselves, in 1981. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the constitutional division of powers, the provinces have 
exclusive jurisdiction over health, and the federal government 
has no business coming up with standards, concepts, principles 
and techniques. All these things come under the provinces' 
responsibility and this is what we are asking the government to 
recognize. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under a constitution that has been truncated, manipulated and 
tampered with by courts that have always been appointed by the 
federalist parties in office, the federal government now has a 
taxation power that is perhaps five times greater than what it 
needs to look after its exclusive constitutional jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is because the government is collecting too much money from 
taxpayers that it can brag and boast, set standards and 
principles, and subject the provinces to its dictates. This is 
what I find unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am asking the parliamentary secretary if she is sincerely 
convinced that she is working in the best interests of her 
country when she makes speeches such as the one she just 
delivered. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Elinor Caplan:</B>  Mr. Speaker, as I said in my remarks, 
health has been a shared jurisdiction in this country.  The 
federal government very clearly respects the role of the 
provincial and territorial governments to plan, to manage, to 
administer and to deliver health services within their 
jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada Health Act clearly defines the criteria, the 
principles and also the conditions upon which federal funds are 
transferred to the provinces. 
This partnership is one which I believe is supported 
overwhelmingly by a majority of Canadians across the country.  It 
binds the country together.  I think that any party in the House 
who attempted to scrap the Canada Health Act would be punished on 
election day by Canadians because we value Canadian medicare.  We 
value the Canadian approach to delivery of health services.  We 
value the foundation of the Canada Health Act which says that we 
share and we care for one another, that access to needed health 
services is not dependent upon one's financial status and that if 
one is sick in Canada we will care for them.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has a very clear and defined role and 
responsibility in the area of health promotion and disease 
prevention.  The federal government has a very clearly defined 
role in the delivery of services to specific groups of people 
whom I mentioned in my remarks.  Those people, as an example, are 
the Inuit, our first nations and other groups.  We also have a 
responsibility to bring together provincial and territorial 
leaders, as is occurring today, to discuss issues of national 
concern, national priority.  As we know, health care is a 
national priority for this government and health care and health 
care issues are a concern for people across this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, it is very appropriate for us in the House today to 
reaffirm our respect for provincial and territorial jurisdiction. 
We do that, but at the very same time we acknowledge the 
important role that the federal government has played through the 
Canada Health Act, and the acts before it, in establishing 
medicare, a model for health care delivery unique among the 
countries of the world and one which has helped to make Canadians 
among the healthiest and I believe among the most envied people 
on this planet. 
<P><A NAME="LINK35"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it was a 
fascinating discourse from my colleague across the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question that is being asked here is, should the government 
be able to put new conditions on health care spending.  The Bloc 
members have made it very plain.  They have asked: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House urges the government to respect provincial 
jurisdiction over health care management, to increase transfers 
to the provinces for health care unconditionally, and to avoid 
using budget surpluses to encroach upon the health care field. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say initially that the problems with medicare are not 
unique to Canada, they are worldwide.  They are actually a little 
worse here in Canada because of our debt problem and the interest 
on the debt which gobbles up a fair amount of funding that could 
go to social programs.  But worldwide we have aging populations. 
We have new technology and new procedures that are really quite 
expensive and were never dreamed of when medicare came into 
being. Here in Canada we have a medical legal system that 
requires defensive practice which increases the costs of 
medicare.  We really have fairly restrictive policies in Canada 
when it comes to a safety valve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although this has been done a host of times, I would like to 
recapture what has happened over the last few years with 
medicare.  The Liberals promised to protect and enhance medicare 
in the red book.  They very quickly thereafter went through some 
cuts which were substantial; $16.5 billion in cumulative cash 
which would have gone directly toward these social programs, so 
important they say to the public, since they took office.  They 
hid those cuts under the Canada health and social transfer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I give the Liberals a bit of respect on this issue.  They are 
crafty.  They are really quite sneaky in the way they did this. 
It escaped largely the public's attention because the reductions 
were not specific to health.  It has only been very lately that 
the public has become aware that the federal government pays less 
for medicare than do patients out of their own pockets. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1050"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT10"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those words came from the federal Minister of Health, that 
Canadians from their pockets or private insurance pay today more 
for health care than does the federal government.  I say, judge 
them not by what they said, but judge them by what they did.  In 
other words, their actions speak much louder than than their 
words. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is easy to compare Canada with other countries.  We dropped 
from second to fourth in the world in per capita spending on 
health care and that is directly related to those cuts.  It is 
also interesting that Canada is now the 23rd lowest out of 28 
countries in the OECD in terms of public spending for health 
care.  In the last two years 1,400 of our most useful health 
practitioners have left to go elsewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These statistics really do not tell the story.  The 200,000 
patients on the waiting line do not talk at all about the pain, 
the inability to work, the inability to function and the denial 
of timely care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I received a letter this morning from a Manitoba women.  She was 
diagnosed with possible bladder cancer.  She needed an MRI.  The 
waiting list for the MRI in her province was too long to be 
medically acceptable.  Her sister who lives in Burnaby, B.C. 
spent $2,500 of her money and the woman had her MRI a day later. 
The diagnosis was cancer.  The treatment was therefore available 
to her in a short period of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a question that I pose to my Liberal colleagues, who 
have escaped the criticism because the provinces received it: 
Did their cuts have anything to do with that woman's inability to 
get her MRI in a timely fashion?  She has figured it out.  She 
said plainly in her letter “I know that the federal government 
has a responsibility here”.  She also knows that Manitoba is 
spending more on health care today than it was in 1995, as is 
Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listen to my colleagues say “Those hackers in Ontario have 
ruined the health care system”.  Because of these cuts there 
have been significant changes.  But today Ontario spends $1.5 
billion more in health care than it did in 1995.  Liberal 
government cuts to Ontario alone have totalled $3 billion.  Every 
province in Canada, but for Quebec and New Brunswick, today is 
spending more on health care than in 1995, in spite of those 
cuts.  That is a fascinating indictment.  The provinces know 
where the important programs are.  I still do not know why they 
were cut. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary said that Canadians are comfortable 
with health care and that they value this program more than 
anything.  It is true.  But there is a very recent change in 
public attitude on health care.  This is a warning for my 
colleagues across the way.  There have been three polls conducted 
in the last five months since October 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Harvard School of Public Health and the Commonwealth Fund 
have being conducting polls in the Commonwealth now for a good 
length of time.  In their recent poll 20% of Canadians said that 
on the whole the system works pretty well and that only minor 
changes are needed to make it better and 56% said that there are 
some good things in our health care system, but fundamental 
changes are needed to make it work better.  This is the worrisome 
one:  23% of the Canadian public said “Our health care system 
has so much wrong with it that we must completely rebuild it”. 
Let us compare that with 10 years ago.  Ten years ago the exact 
same question was asked.  At that time 56% said minor changes, 
37% said major changes, and only 5% said it needed a complete 
rebuild.  Are they biased?  It is the Harvard School of Business. 
They are American.

<I>Chatelaine</I> poll say?  Seventy-three per cent of Canadians 
said that the health care system in our country has worsened over 
the last five years.  Most interesting was that they figured out 
the cause:  55% said the government was at fault. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One may say that the Angus Reid poll was biased and asked very 
skewed questions.  However, another poll was just done by 
Pollaro.  This was done for the Coalition of National Voluntary 
Organizations and Merck Frosst Canada.  The first question asked: 
Is medicare fine?  Four per cent of Canadians said it was fine. 
The second question asked:  Does it need a minor tune-up? 
Thirty-seven per cent said it needed a minor tune-up.  The third 
question asked:  Does it need major repairs?  Forty-five per cent 
of Canadians said that it needs major repairs.  The last question 
asked:  Does it need total rebuilding?  Twelve per cent said yes.

innovation or looking at fresh thinking we are called an enemy of

This will not be driven by politicians, by the medical profession 
or by the bureaucrats.  The patient will come first. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's solution is to put conditions on health care 
funding. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois says no to such conditions, as do Albertans 
and Reformers.  It has nothing to do with the Constitution. 
This is an issue that affects those who use health care 
services.  A change is needed in Canada.

as well.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish to 
thank my Reform Party colleague for his excellent speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am wondering about the government members.  Why are we not 
hearing more from them during the question and comment period? 
What I think is that they do not have it in them to defend their 
own system.  They would rather slip it past us, as my colleague 
said earlier, cloaked in the more palatable Canada social 
transfer, and tell us, as the Minister of Finance did, that the 
new transfer will give the provinces much greater flexibility in 
running their own health systems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes time to make cuts, they slash the Canada social 
transfer by $6 billion annually.  Then they tell us they will 
give some of the money back. 
They tell us that they can see that the provinces are perhaps 
having a little difficulty running the health care system.  They 
will be good guys and give some of the money back, instead of 
cutting $49 billion—for that is what it would have been in 2003. 
They have changed their minds because that is what the 
opposition parties, medical bodies and the National Health Forum 
want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They told us they were going to put some of the money back but 
that is simply not true.  I would like my Reform Party colleague 
to tell us what he thinks of the federal government's tactics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill:</B> Mr. Speaker, as far as I am concerned, the 
problem with the federal government cuts is that they were made 
unilaterally, that their impact was immediate and that the 
provinces were not consulted. 
This is why the provinces are putting up a united front on this 
issue.

agreement, but we did it in this area. There is also unanimous 
agreement among service providers, physicians, nurses and other 
health professionals. They all want clear, visible and 
unconditional funding for health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is up to the provinces to provide those services, and this is 
not why the federal government is involved in this area of 
jurisdiction. This statement is quite clear and I will be 
supporting it.

I am pleased to speak on behalf of my caucus today on the Bloc 
motion, which I will read for the record: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House urges the government to respect provincial 
jurisdiction over health care management, to increase transfers 
to the provinces for health care unconditionally, and to avoid 
using budget surpluses to encroach upon the health care field. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened very carefully to what my Bloc and Reform colleagues 
had to say.  I do not want to suggest that I did not listen 
carefully to what the government had to say.  In any event, there 
is much I agree with in what they had to say about the effect of 
federal cutbacks on health care services in the various 
provinces, and much that I agree with in the outrage and 
disapproval they expressed about those cutbacks and the way in 
which the Liberal government got away with doing severe damage to 
our health care system without really paying a price or even 
acknowledging or having acknowledged just what it is that it has 
done over the last few years through the removal of several 
billions of dollars from the health care system which 
cumulatively is well beyond several. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The figure used by my Reform colleague was something in the 
neighbourhood of $16 billion.  It is very large.  Any other 
government that had done the same thing would certainly have paid 
a higher price than this government has been asked to pay so far. 
I say “so far” because I think eventually the Canadian people 
will realize what is going on here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I differ with the Bloc on its motion.  It is not a motion that 
the NDP can support.  I differ with my Reform colleague in his 
expression of support for the motion.  The Reform spokesperson 
said that the Bloc motion talks about not having any new 
conditions on health care spending.  I am sorry, but that is not 
what the motion says. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion says “to increase transfers to the provinces for 
health care unconditionally”.  It does not say increase 
transfers to the province for health care without any new 
conditions.  It says “unconditionally”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Had the motion said what it says but nevertheless went on to 
affirm the Canada Health Act and the need for nationwide 
standards, national standards when it comes to health care, it 
might have been a motion that would be supportable.  However it 
does not do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened very carefully to both the Bloc spokespersons and my 
Reform colleague.  Neither one of them ever uttered the words 
Canada Health Act.  Neither one of them ever uttered the words 
national standards.  I do not think this is a coincidence.  I 
think we see here an alignment between—it is no secret—the Bloc 
and the Reform parties when it comes to matters of provincial 
jurisdiction, particularly with regard to health care and a 
position mutually held with respect to the role of the federal 
government in health care.  It is not a position that is held by 
the New Democratic Party. 
We could not bring ourselves to vote for a motion that in any way 
called into question implicitly or explicitly the continuing role 
of the Canada Health Act and the continuing need for national 
standards when it comes to medicare and health care.  We will 
vote against the motion.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It was interesting to listen to the government spokesperson on 
this matter going on and on about the Canada Health Act.  I 
support the Canada Health Act.  I was here at the time it was 
created.  I sat on the health and welfare committee when the bill 
went through and remember that whole process very well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two things I have to say to the Liberals in this 
regard.  First, they were dragged into the Canada Health Act 
kicking and screaming.  It took four years of work in parliament 
exposing the problem of extra billing by physicians and the 
proliferation of user fees in the health care system that was 
happening at that time to finally get the Liberal government to 
act on the eve of the federal election in 1984.  The Canada 
Health Act was passed in April 1984 and the election was called 
in July of that year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals were dragged into the Canada Health Act kicking and 
screaming by their own acknowledgement.  A memoir written by then 
Liberal Minister of Health Monique Bégin gives credit to the NDP 
for, in her words, waging guerrilla warfare against her in the 
House of Commons and forcing her to act.  Those were her own 
words in her own book about the role of the NDP at that time.  I 
will not go into who was the health critic at that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is one thing to listen to the Liberals go on about the Canada 
Health Act and how much they stand by it.  However Canadians 
should be reminded that this was something at the time that was 
not done wholeheartedly.  In the closing hours of that debate on 
the Canada Health Act I remember saying as the NDP health critic 
that no amount of principles, no amount of standards enshrined in 
the Canada Health Act or anywhere else, rhetorically, would save 
medicare if there were not sufficient funding and that without 
sufficient funding medicare would slowly fade away.  This is 
indeed what is happening.  This is the heinous political crime 
being visited upon Canadian history by the Liberals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a terrible irony when we think of how much credit they 
like to give themselves.  The other day I think it was the 
Minister of Finance who was saying how it was the Liberals who 
brought in medicare.  Actually the Liberals first promised 
medicare in their election platform of 1919 and by 1966, some 47 
years later, they had finally delivered on that promise in the 
context of a minority government where the NDP held the balance 
of power and after medicare had been pioneered and all the dirty 
work had been done in Saskatchewan by Tommy Douglas and the NDP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do not give us that hokum about the Liberals having anything to 
do with the beginnings of medicare or hospitalization for that 
matter which in my reading of Canadian history actually became 
law under a Conservative government and not a Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals are by their fiscal actions slowly, and in recent 
years not so slowly, starving medicare to death.  My Reform 
colleague pointed out polls that show Canadians are increasingly 
anxious about their health care system, that they have less and 
less confidence in Canada's health care system.  It is not 
surprising because there has been a deterioration in service. The 
evidence is there anecdotally, empirically and in every respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every one of us knows someone who has been in the hospital in 
recent years or months.  They all have stories to tell.  They all 
have stories about dedicated health care workers, about people 
working very hard, but they also have stories to tell about gaps 
in the system thanks in many ways to the cuts that have been 
visited upon our health care system.

</I></B></P><P align=left>If the quality of our health care system runs down, if we have 
waiting lists as we do and if people spend days on gurneys in 
emergency wards, sooner or later it is only a matter of time 
before enough Canadians say that they want to have some private 
alternative to this service and do not want to be completely 
dependent on a service that is going down, down and down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the crime the Liberals are visiting upon medicare and 
upon our country.  They are creating the conditions for the 
privatizers who have never gone away.  The big health care 
insurance industry is still out there and still licking its 
wounds from its defeat in the sixties.  It is not that long ago 
as politics go.  It sees its opportunity, and it is an 
opportunity being created by the federal Liberals.  They ought to 
be ashamed of themselves for creating that opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They certainly should not have the nerve to stand in the House 
as they do from time to time—the Prime Minister, the Minister of 
Finance, the Minister of Health and others—and pretend they are 
the great defenders and saviours of medicare.  If they do not do 
a complete turnaround in this regard, and if the Canadian people 
do not make them do so if they do not choose to, it will be the 
Liberals and no one else that go down as the political party that 
destroyed medicare.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gérard Asselin (Charlevoix, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have to say 
from the outset that I am very disappointed that the New 
Democratic Party has chosen not to joint the rest of the 
opposition to force the federal government to give back to the 
provinces the money it has taken from them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the present Liberal government decided to cut transfer 
payments, mainly for health care, it did not ask Quebec, Ontario 
or any other province what kind of cuts it should make. They 
were not consulted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government slashed transfer payments to the provinces, 
forcing Quebec, Ontario and the other provinces, still trying to 
achieve zero deficit, to impose radical health reforms, the 
results of which we see today. But, first and foremost, the 
primary responsibility belongs to the federal government. Quebec 
is still paying $28 billion in taxes to Ottawa, but receiving 
less and less services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course I am very disappointed that the NDP has decided not to 
support the Bloc Quebecois on this issue, especially since it 
claims to represent the extreme left wing in this House. That 
party claims to be the great democrat, to speak on behalf of 
workers. It has ties to the labour unions. As a matter of fact, 
the workers of Quebec and Canada are the ones who use our health 
care system more and more. The demands of the Bloc Quebecois are 
supported by central labour bodies. 
I think the extreme left wing is not a good place to be in 
Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ask my colleague from the NDP the following question: 
does he not think that the federal government should give back 
to the provinces, unconditionally, what it took from them, and 
let each province manage its own health care system? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The members of the National Assembly of Quebec are not a bunch 
of boy scouts. They are not a bunch of losers. They are capable 
of managing and they have a mandate to do so. I think 
responsibility for health care management belongs to the 
provinces, and the federal government should give them their 
money back so they can manage in a fair and equitable manner the 
health care services that Quebeckers and Canadians are asking 
for. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will resist the

</I></B></P><P align=left>I have made this argument before that its support of free trade 
agreements and other things like that in my view go against the 
interests of workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The nationalist movement in Quebec has always been a bit of an 
ideological grab bag.  We know that.  What unites it is its 
nationalism, in this case its view of the need for Quebec to 
separate from the rest of Canada. Having said that, I acknowledge 
there are many social Democrats in the Bloc Quebecois and we work 
with them when we can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To the question was raised by the member, we are opposed to 
unilateral cutbacks by the federal government in federal 
transfers to the provinces in respect of provincial jurisdiction. 
That is why we would have been in favour of a Bloc motion that 
talked about arriving at a social union with respect to health 
care that prevented unilateral cutbacks by the federal government 
and that perhaps even talked about the mutual setting and 
enforcement of national standards.  But there is nothing like 
that in the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead the Bloc member did not say anything about the Canada 
Health Act.  The member still did not talk about national 
standards pointing out, regrettably, the difference between 
ourselves and the Bloc when it comes to this question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For us medicare and its preservation and the idea of national 
standards is a bottom line.  That is all there is to it.  Any 
motion which calls that into question is unsupportable.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Bachand (Richmond—Arthabaska, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to talk about the motion put forward by the Bloc Quebecois. 
I will explain later on what led my colleagues in the Bloc to 
move this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have already told the Bloc critic, I am going to do a 
little bit of nit-picking. I get the impression this motion was 
prepared in some hurry, on the eve of the first ministers' 
meeting in Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion is not the best the Bloc has ever moved. It is 
incomplete. They use the word “unconditionally”, but what they 
say and what they mean is not the same thing. 
What they mean is this: without any new condition related to the 
social union. They should have spelled this out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The message we get is: without any new condition, but under the 
existing rules. The Bloc did not do its homework as well as it 
should have. There is something missing. They wrote the motion 
in a hurry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the budget will be brought down soon, Bloc members thought 
“Here, we should be dealing with health care”. However, they do 
not mention any amount. Do they want to have $6 billion more for 
the provinces or $2 billion? Should it be over two, three, or 
five years? Do they want to restore funding to its former level 
in one shot or over a five year period, as the health ministers 
said last year? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not know the answers to these questions, and the Bloc has 
nobody but itself to blame for that. 
They will have to say they will do a better job drafting a 
motion the next time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I think our New Democratic friend went a little far.  I 
do not know whether he got the order not to support the Bloc any 
more, but I think he went a bit far in saying “We cannot support 
the motion because it goes against this and that”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think my New Democratic colleague has gone a bit far in his 
analysis in an effort to justify his refusal to support the Bloc 
Quebecois motion.  We are going to support the Bloc Quebecois 
motion and we could perhaps help them write future motions for 
opposition days, if necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the future, I think the drafting could be a little more 
professional. 
Here again, I disagree with my New Democratic colleague, who 
said “We will not support that because it does not honour 
existing agreements”.  I think this is going a bit far too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to say why we are debating this today.  The budget 
is of course coming up in a few weeks.  The provinces, 
Quebeckers and Canadians have called for more money in the 
health care system.  The Liberal government has reduced its 
deficit by doing two things:  cutting transfers to the provinces 
and taxing people an additional $20 billion or $25 billion.  The 
federal government spent nearly $35 billion more than in 1993-94. 
It is spending more.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there are surpluses, somebody somewhere coughed up more 
money. As far as conditions are concerned, we agree with most 
Canadians that new conditions cannot be imposed on the provinces 
for health transfers. This is the federal government's idea. 
Just this morning I was telling one of my colleagues in the Bloc 
Quebecois that this did not make sense, especially since the 
government is not behaving properly on the EI issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If every new dollar transferred to the provinces has to go to 
health, by the same token could we say that every new dollar 
paid into the EI fund has to go to EI and not end up in the 
government's coffers? As you can see, this could backfire. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we know, and I think this was the main reason for the Bloc 
Quebecois' motion, is that there is a first ministers meeting in 
Ottawa today. This thing about conditions came up after the 
Saskatoon agreement. In a letter, the federal government said 
“Accountability now requires you to make a commitment to put 
every new dollar transferred toward health care and to publicly 
state how happy you are that the federal government is giving 
you money, and that all is well and the Prime Minister is a nice 
guy”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we suspect is that, thankfully, this letter will finally be 
taken out of the package put before the provincial premiers, the 
territorial leaders and the Prime Minister this morning. It 
called for a commitment from the provinces to agree that future 
transfer payments would be put toward health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is in that context that, today, they are discussing the 
conditional transfer of any new money that may be transferred. 
But we have to monitor what is going on right now, because—as I 
said earlier—we have reason to believe, based on what we heard 
here and there, that the issue of the social union, and more 
specifically health, will be discussed today. Will the amount of 
money be set today? I do not think so, because it would look 
very bad if the Minister of Finance were to officially allocate 
money for health before bringing down his budget, in a few 
weeks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems the federal government will be giving back between $2 
billion and $2.5 billion, over a period of two to three years. 
Whether it will be over two years or three, and whether the 
amount will be $2 billion or $2.5 billion is what is being 
negotiated right now. But, the decision will surely only be 
announced in the budget, not today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, negotiations are taking place today on the social union, and 
more specifically on health, on the Saskatoon agreement and on a 
new federal offer made yesterday. That offer provides, among 
other things, that rules would be set regarding the new 
transfers for health, but that there would also be a right to 
opt out, jointly funded programs, and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is dangerous though is that, in spite of what is going on 
in the four areas of the social union, namely social services, 
education, social assistance and health, the federal government 
is prepared to keep its sword of Damocles dangling over our 
heads, that is its direct spending power. This power means the 
federal government can spend directly when the money goes to 
individuals. If the money goes to the provinces, there is a 
right to opt out, as in the case of health, pharmacare or 
jointly funded programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where the danger lies in the health care field, and one of the 
reasons we are going to support the Bloc Quebecois motion, is 
that we do not want any new conditions.  We need to go further 
still and say that we are not in agreement with the federal 
government's having direct power to intervene in the daily lives 
of the people in health, education, social services and social 
assistance.  There is a danger of this becoming a stumbling 
block today.  I hope people will be able to agree that this 
administrative agreement, which is negotiable—not a 
constitutional change, merely an agreement that dates back only 
about five years, it would appear—will be something that can 
evolve and continue to be viable, so that we can avoid having a 
repetition of the millennium scholarship situation, or in other 
words direct federal programs in the areas of health, social 
assistance and education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to restrict the federal government, particularly 
a Liberal one, because the Liberals want to control everything, 
unless it gives them problems. 
Then they give it to the provinces, but they want to control the 
rest so that they can show the flag.  I have absolutely nothing 
against the Canadian flag, I am a federalist. However, 
propaganda does not serve the interests of the people, only 
those of one group.

situation so that a start can be made on simplifying the entire

for more health care dollars, without new conditions, and 
without delay. 
<P><A NAME="LINK40"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles-A. Perron (Rivière-des-Mille-Îles, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
perfection might be found in the way my friend from 
Richmond-Arthabasca speaks, but just like his NDP colleague from 
Winnipeg-Transcona he does not know how to listen and hear to 
perfection. He should have listened to the speech by the member 
for Drummond who said that the Bloc Quebecois had absolutely 
nothing against the five principles of medicare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague said we should get our money back without any 
precondition. I also would like to remind my learned colleague 
from Richmond-Arthabasca that in the late 1980s and up to the 
beginning of 1993, when his party was in office, on the other 
side, it was next to perfect. And then in 1993 perfection 
dropped to two members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I would like to say this: at no time in his 
speech did he mention the right of the government to interfere 
in, control or put its nose in the way Quebec manages its 
affairs. Whether he agrees or not, he did not say so and made no 
mention of their accomplishments. I would like him to elaborate 
further on this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Bachand:</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened carefully to what the 
hon. member for Drummond had to say and that is why we will be 
supporting the motion, because of the clarifications she 
provided about conditions. Therefore we will support the motion 
because of the explanations she gave us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of perfection, it is true that our government was 
almost perfect. People have a hard time believing in perfection. 
That is why they chose to teach us a lesson in 1993. Having said 
that, I simply want to remind the House that the then government 
started in 1984 to increase transfers to the provinces by 
$6 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hard times during the 90s forced the federal government to 
freeze its expenditures. However, between the election of the 
Mulroney government in 1984 and the freeze it had to establish 
during the 1990 crisis, $6 billion were added to provincial 
transfers for health and welfare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is near perfection. What is clear to us and what you can 
find out if you read our platform—and I am sure you have read it 
and learned it by heart—is that what we are proposing for the 
Canadian pact goes further than what is in the social union 
agreement. We are even more in favour of respecting provincial 
areas of jurisdiction than the current federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If your copy of our platform is a bit the worse for wear I would 
be quite happy to provide you with a new one.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, first I wish to 
congratulate my colleague from Richmond—Arthabaska for the 
quality of his presentation. He has restored the historical 
dimension of the issue and has also showed that he has a vision 
for the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one word which could have remedied not the weakness 
but, let us say, the imperfection of the motion. I am not afraid 
of the word imperfection because perfect people are always more 
disturbing than imperfect people. Maybe we should have used the 
word “re-establish” instead of  “increase” unconditionally 
because we are not asking for an increase but for the 
re-establishment of what was there previously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of having a theoretical debate, I would like to mention 
that in my own region, indeed in several other regions in 
Quebec, health care is an issue of concern for all people. There 
are not many people in Quebec who are not aware of the present 
situation in the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We obviously agree with the unconditional re-establishment of 
health care budgets, but I am concerned about transfers to 
provincial governments—let us say we speak here about the Quebec 
government—because regions don't always get the benefits they 
deserve. In my own region, in the area of social services 
including health care, we are still getting much less than we 
are entitled to given our population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take the opportunity of today's debate to point out to my 
colleagues in the Bloc Quebecois that while they are asking for 
everything to be transferred to Quebec, in the regions we have a 
problem not with the Government of Canada but with the 
Government of Quebec because of its unfair allocations between 
various regions of the province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very serious problem, and to show how serious it is, I 
will quote from a story published this morning, not two years 
ago, but this morning. One hundred and sixty doctors, dentists 
and pharmacists in my region have said: “Mr. Bouchard can push 
around his ministers, deputy ministers and experts, but he has 
no power over us. He should have thought about that before”. 
That is the reality we live in. In our region, we are not even 
able to get adequate health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why I am in favour of transfers. 
The Bloc Quebecois and the Conservative Party are often fighting 
here in Ottawa over matters of principle. In the area of 
employment, we were in favour of budget transfers, amounting to 
hundreds of millions. But go see what is going on now in that 
area since federal funds were transferred to be managed by the 
provincial government. We are getting less than 25 per cent of 
what we were getting before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for funds for regional development in my region, here is what 
some were saying this morning: “Those who believe that the new 
entity created by the government, the local development boards, 
the LDB, will remedy these shortcomings in leadership are sadly 
mistaken”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is not one area where the transfers to Quebec have 
benefited regions. I ask my colleague if he— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am sorry to tell the hon. member that the 
time allocated for questions and comments has expired. 
<P><A NAME="LINK42"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to speak today to this 
motion brought forward by the Bloc Quebecois, “that this House 
urges the government to respect provincial jurisdiction over 
health care management, to increase transfers to the provinces 
for health care unconditionally, and to avoid using budget 
surpluses to encroach upon the health care field”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a purely academic debate, nor is it a debate pitting 
sovereignists against federalists. This debate is to demonstrate 
that, in the kind of system we have in Canada, we have to let 
the experts do the work if we want the system to work. We are 
not having this debate to go after the Liberal government. 
We are having this debate so that, at the end of the day, there 
is a reasonable amount of money in our hospitals for equipment 
and emergency rooms, in CLSCs for front line care, as well as 
for long term care and palliative care. Federal MPs all received 
a document this week in their office regarding funding for 
palliative care.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are having this debate so there is money to address the 
problem of suicide, and we want this to be done within the 
existing framework, through the mechanisms that have been in 
place for a long time. Health care has been recognized as a 
provincial responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to avoid repeating the battles of the past. We want 
patients to spend the least amount of time possible in emergency 
rooms. To achieve that, the federal government must stop playing 
games, it must stop saying under what conditions it will put 
money into the system, how big the maple leaf will have to be 
for transfer payments. 
That is the reason behind this kind of motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give an example. It is a good illustration of what can 
happen when you do not mind your own business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Concerning the issue of the millennium scholarships, we have in 
Quebec our own loans and bursaries plan. All student 
associations and academics have acknowledged it is the best in 
Canada. We have opted out of the national plan in 1964 with full 
compensation, and we have outperformed everybody else. We may 
not be the best in every area, but in this case, we are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has decided to yield to the whims of the 
Prime Minister and create the millennium scholarship program. 
This program is at cross purposes with the Quebec loans and 
bursaries plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The basic principles are being changed. The federal government 
claims its loans and grants system will reward excellence. In 
Quebec, the whole plan is based on the concept that we should 
give the students what they need for their living expenses. We 
do not want to see in other areas a replication of the intrusion 
we have witnessed in education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the federal government made cuts in health care, it did not 
try to achieve some visibility for those budget cuts. It made 
the cuts and told the provinces they would have to make do with 
whatever they got. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pauline Picard:</B> Without condition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête:</B> Yes, indeed without any strings attached.  It 
let us deal with the cuts.  Now we are faced with a situation 
that makes it clear that the federal government must make up its 
mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are needs in all of the regions of Quebec.  The Bloc 
Quebecois tour, under the leadership of the hon. member for 
Drummond, clearly demonstrated what, if $1 billion in 
surplus—though more than that is needed—was returned to the 
transfer payments, that would represent for each region.  In our 
case, in the Lower St. Lawrence region, the figure would be $34 
million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am most anxious to see the federal government let go of its 
bone, put the money back into transfer payments, into the 
existing mechanism, so that the people in my riding who are in 
hospitals, CLSCs, extended care centres, in all types of 
services, may have the oxygen they need, that extra room to 
manoeuvre that is so lacking at the present time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must disagree with the hon. member for Chicoutimi.  I believe 
that both the present government of Quebec and the previous ones 
have done a number of good things for health care.  There is a 
model in place in Quebec.  There have been some accomplishments, 
the air ambulance for one, which allows people in the regions to 
be brought to major centres for the complex emergency surgery 
that may not be available elsewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>University experts in Quebec City and Montreal have helped 
develop a system for performing surgery by means of telemetry in 
the Magdalen Islands and the Gaspé.  This shows there are 
successes.  These are examples of things that are working. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been necessary to make cuts in the last few years.  That 
is clear.  But a large part of these cuts is the result of the 
federal government imposing cuts on the provinces.  We got 
through that.  Now the federal government has the money.  It has 
the necessary money, because of its revenues and its spending 
power, to put money back into transfer payments.  It is taking 
its time.  Now that more money is available, a way has to be 
found to show that this money comes from the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And how should that be done? 
All the provinces have already said that, if the federal 
government wants them to spend the money on health, that is 
where they will put it.  There is something wrong with the 
government's attitude.  I think the best example of this is the 
Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs.  This minister never 
misses a chance to set Quebec City and Ottawa at each other's 
throats.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again yesterday, on the CBC, he told the Quebec premier who was 
elected barely two or three months ago, that he was not 
legitimate, that he was not accountable to him in matters 
concerning Quebec, but to Quebeckers directly.  This double 
legitimacy argument has been dead since the Bloc Quebecois 
arrived in House. Since the Bloc Quebecois has been here, no one 
can say that the ministers know the absolute truth when they 
speak on behalf of Quebec.  No one can say that.  We are here to 
show that you do not have this double legitimacy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ultimate insult is that negotiations are going on with the 
leader of the opposition in Quebec City, who has just taken the 
political beating of his life, which he never expected, with the 
rejection of a significant majority of Quebec ridings.  When the 
federal government negotiates in this way, it forces us to 
present motions like the one today to encourage it to honour the 
responsibilities of the provinces in managing health care, to 
unconditionally increase transfers to the provinces.  Increasing 
them, means raising them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no argument any more on whether the government should 
be condemned for the cuts.  The people have understood that.  I 
think the 1997 election proved an interesting lesson for all 
members of the House, especially us.  Quebeckers had to 
understand where the cuts were coming from. Well we know that 
they are coming for the most part from the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that we have money come back to us, we are saying “Give us 
our share and use the mechanism already in place.” The Canada 
social transfer was meant to be unconditional. The Minister of 
Finance himself said, two years ago, that this was best because 
of the flexibility it afforded the provinces. Let them deal with 
the cuts. Now that there is money, we are saying “Let us deal 
with this money to be reinvested in health care.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By letting the provinces make their own decisions, the federal 
government would show it is upholding its own Constitution. 
There is a fundamental problem with this Parliament. We in the 
Bloc Quebecois are sovereignists and we insist that this 
government at least uphold its Constitution. The Government of 
Canada is flouting the Canadian Constitution and trying to 
interfere and micromanage, as if it were an expert in health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, the Minister of Health recently announced a 
subsidy in the Montreal area. No one can deny this served its 
purpose, but can you imagine how much duplication it is causing 
with all the health services and mechanisms already in place? 
There must be targeted consultations. Fear not, we in Quebec can 
do our homework, and so can the other provinces, to see what 
kinds of services are required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore urge the members of this House to vote in favour of 
the motion we have put forward to ensure that sufficient funding 
is made available as soon as possible for our hospitals—for 
equipment and emergency rooms—for local community service 
centres, for chronic and palliative care, for suicide 
prevention, for all those who are vulnerable in our society. It 
is not right to take them hostage. 
The federal government must take immediate action in this area. 
Hopefully, we will be heard on both sides of the House and a 
majority of Canadian members of Parliament will support our 
motion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK43"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
Bloc Quebecois colleague, whose riding I have trouble naming 
because the name is so long. I will begin by setting the record 
straight, before putting a question to the hon. member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the motion, the word “unconditionally” does not refer to the 
five tenets of the Canada Health Act. The Quebec government and 
all the other Canadian provinces have always cared about 
adhering to these five tenets in the Canada Health Act, as can 
be seen in the documents that we have. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1145"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT21"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada Health Act requires the provinces to adhere to these 
five principles. In return, the federal government pledges to 
transfer the necessary funds through the tax system. The federal 
government is not giving us anything. The money is provided by 
all Canadians who pay taxes. The federal government 
redistributes the money collected in taxes, so that the 
provinces can manage their health care sector. 
Indeed, the provinces are responsible for managing health, 
through the new Canada social transfer set up by the federal 
government to provide, according to the Minister of Finance, 
greater flexibility in the management of the health, education 
and social assistance sectors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion does not trivialize the five Canadian tenets. That is 
not its purpose. Its purpose is to urge the government to 
respect the division of powers, unconditionally restore 
transfers and make judicious use of budget surpluses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if my Bloc Quebecois colleague could tell us again what 
it means to respect the division of powers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very happy the record has been 
set straight because what our motion is asking is that things be 
done according to Canadian legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Quebec has never asked that legislation be set 
aside. The five principles of the Canada Health Act are part of 
the legal framework within which we must work. This government 
has not always done so. This may explain why those on the other 
side are so nit-picking. They behave differently themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two years ago, the Minister of Human Resources Development had 
to make a decision regarding a legal advice which indicated 
clearly that if the minister used database matching to identify 
the unemployed who broke the law by travelling abroad, this 
would contravene the Privacy Act. 
This does not mean we should legitimise cheating but it must be 
acknowledged that the government may have things to settle on 
the issue. It has happened, on occasion, that this government 
was not very respectful of legislation passed by the Canadian 
Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Respect of jurisdictions, that of Quebec as well as Canada, is 
the best way to make sure that money is spent in the right 
place. This is our main goal. We do not have money to burn in 
that area. We do not have money to burn these days. We cannot 
afford duplication. We cannot wait to invest in the right 
programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is also a cry from the heart. Money available from the 
federal government surplus could be invested in health care, 
using existing channels. If there is one single consensus in 
Quebec, it is that we do not want new programs. We want to 
strengthen existing programs. We want to be able to finance our 
hospitals, equipment, emergency services, CLSC's, or local 
community service centres, palliative care services and all our 
other support services, and we want to be able to pay our 
hard-working health care workers. We must be able to pay our 
workers decent salaries and to provide direct health services to 
the population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the meaning of the motion we introduced in the House 
today. It aims at bringing the government to abide by its own 
Constitution. 
<P><A NAME="LINK44"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I too want to 
express my support for the motion moved today by the Bloc 
Quebecois. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House urges the government to respect provincial 
jurisdiction over health care management, to increase transfers 
to the provinces for health care unconditionally, and to avoid 
using budget surpluses to encroach upon the health care field.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If one remembers what has happened since 1993, particularly in 
the earlier budgets that came out of this government and were 
tabled by the current finance minister, we have seen drastic 
cuts in many areas. Sure, we had a huge deficit, but what got 
hit the hardest were the cash transfers to the provinces. This 
budget item, which was around $18 billion, dropped to $11.5 
billion a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provinces lost over $6 billion in annual revenues which were 
used at the time to fund three types of programs: cost shared 
initiatives in health care, cost shared initiatives in 
education, and social assistance transfers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government, knowing it was about to make significant cuts—at 
the time we knew exactly what the government's contribution to 
health care, education, and social assistance was—decided to 
amalgamate all three programs into one now called the Canada 
social transfer. This same government, which now talks about 
transparency, accountability and visibility, and says that 
people need to know how much money it is contributing to health 
care, is the one that merged these programs to eliminate 
transparency. Why? The reason is rather obvious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were some massive cuts and the members on the other side 
of the House did not want to be blamed for cutting this much in 
education, and that much in health care or welfare. So they told 
the provinces: “We are cutting $6 billion. You can split that any 
which way you want between health care, education and welfare.” 
The federal government wanted to show what a good sport it was. 
They said: “The choice is yours, you get to determine what 
percentage of the cuts you want to apply to health care, 
education and welfare.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that the transfer payments are about to be increased, the 
federal government knows that the first priority of Canadians 
will be health care. They would want each additional dollar they 
put in, over and above the $12.5 billion currently paid in 
transfer payments, to be made highly visible and transparent, so 
that the people of Canada can see that the federal government is 
reinvesting in health care. 
However, they were not so worried about visibility a few years 
back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me make a suggestion. Maybe they could use billboards. They 
like them well enough since they have some Mediacom billboards 
set up permanently in Quebec. They practically own them. They 
could have huge billboards on the edge of towns and villages 
saying: “The federal government did not cut $6 billion in health 
care, but only $5 billion.” That way, Canadians would know that 
the government did not cut $6 billion a year. They would cut only 
$5 billion, since they are now talking about adding $1 billion, 
maybe a little bit more, to the current transfer payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Apparently this morning the Prime Minister found some more money 
and could put some more on the table. 
But the fact is that the level of transfer payments to the 
provinces has dropped from $18 billion to between $12.5 billion 
and $14 billion or $15 billion—a very optimistic scenario—in the 
next budget. The bottom line is that we still face significant 
cuts. This is something we should not forget, and I am somewhat 
annoyed by their new-found devotion to openness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On top of that, premiers have made a clear commitment. 
They wanted to reassure the Prime Minister, so they wrote to him 
that they were committed to putting back into the system any new 
CHST money allocated to health care. But perhaps the Prime 
Minister does not think written commitments are worth much, when 
we consider what happened with the promises in the 1993 red 
book, but for some people, a signed letter still means 
something. So the premiers have signed a commitment that any 
transfer of money will go to health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government keeps repeating that it wants to uphold the 
Canada Health Act. That piece of legislation is still in effect, 
and the premiers did not ask that it be repealed. It is still in 
effect. If the federal government puts money back into the 
transfer payments for health care, the Canada Health Act and its 
five central principles will continue to apply.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Where is this sudden fear that the provinces could violate the 
act coming from? There are very severe penalties for those 
provinces who do not respect the act. You know about that, 
Mr. Speaker. Alberta has had to pay the price for not living up 
to the conditions set out in the Canada Health Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know there is an ongoing dispute about that. Some provinces 
would like more flexibility, but we are not here to question the 
act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government wants to increase its role. After 
starving the provinces and giving out new money today, it is 
obvious that the federal government has a strong desire to play 
a role in the planning of future health care services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We understand why. The Liberals know full well that, with an 
ageing population, health care will become a very important 
issue in the future, a growing concern for Canadians. They say 
they want to play a role in this area to get closer to the 
people, ignoring the Constitution, ignoring traditions and also 
ignoring the fact that the provinces, including mine, Quebec, 
already have an infrastructure in place. We have a health 
department as well as regional health offices. We have developed 
an elaborate network of front line services, second line 
services, emergency services and CLSCs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The network is established according to a plan. Of course, 
occasionally some people may question its structure. But we have 
to look at the big picture because priorities vary from one 
region to the next. One region may have more specialists in one 
particular branch of medicine, and the situation may be 
different in another region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This planning is the responsibility of the Government of Quebec, 
which delivers health services.  Now the federal government 
would like to implement its own priorities, and influence the 
services provided by the provinces.  We would then find 
ourselves, if the federal proposal is implemented, with two 
governments, two types of priorities.  A lot of new committees 
will be struck, public servants will be needed to make 
evaluations, statisticians will make comparisons, a dreadful 
bureaucracy will be put in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not what we need.  What we need instead is people to do 
the hands-on work.  If money were put into the transfer payments 
tomorrow, it would mean bigger hospital budgets, better nursing 
care, more physicians and specialists to be increased, if money 
were put back into the transfer payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If they start creating policies or implementing all sorts of 
mechanisms, we will end up with a new bureaucracy—and the federal 
government bureaucracy is already getting way out of hand—that 
will keep on imposing its will and trying to play a role in this 
area. This strikes me as contrary to what the public wants in 
the way of services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now I will draw a parallel with another matter, the millennium 
scholarships.  Speaking of unconditional transfers, the federal 
government has decided to play a bigger role in education by 
allowing students to accumulate fewer debts, by offering them 
scholarships and so forth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government came up with a wall-to-wall solution, good 
coast to coast, by offering scholarships to post-secondary 
students.  In Quebec the student debt load is far lower than 
elsewhere because tuition fees are lower.  Of course we would 
like it be lower still, but compared to the other provinces it 
is far lower. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first priority of our system would probably have been to put 
the money where it would have helped all students, not just a 
small group.  The educational system is overseen and planned by 
the Government of Quebec.  Citizens can pressure it, the 
government being answerable to its citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has now decided that its priority was to 
reduce student debt.  It plays a significant role with our taxes 
in order to show that its priority lies there.  There is, 
perhaps, another priority to be considered for the moment.  It 
may be the priority in the rest of Canada, but is not the 
priority of Quebec.  We have not even enough flexibility to 
exercise the right to opt out, to take this money and assign it 
to other priorities in the educational system.  There is 
something wrong when a government insists on defining 
everything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We recognize the obsession with visibility behind all that, this 
obsession with appearing to be closer to the people so they 
would stop criticizing the government and become less 
sovereignist perhaps.  I really do not know what is their 
underlying motive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But it is wrong because it does not work. People want effective 
services.  They pay taxes not to have governments and 
bureaucracies quarrel, but to obtain quality services. It is not 
so the federal government can fight for control of certain 
jurisdictions it gave up at the time the Constitution was drawn 
up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I hope Liberal members will be less silent than 
they have been up to know in today's debate, that they will 
stand up a little and that they will be lucid and understand 
that the most effective solution in health matters is to pay out 
unconditionally the money intended for transfer payments in 
order to repair the error they themselves made.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, first of all, I 
want to reiterate our party's support for this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire:</B> You are on the right track. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Harvey:</B> We are indeed on the right track. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our colleague just spoke of the obsession with visibility. 
Reference was also made to absolute truth. Here we have the 
President of the Treasury Board. With respect to visibility, I 
do not think that the PQ can point the finger at anyone in 
Quebec in that respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Think back to the floods, and the ice storm. This obsession with 
visibility was such that one wondered if the federal government 
had any involvement, yet it was footing 90% of the bill. 
Objectivity is required in a debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a concern. Support is expressed for the Bloc Quebecois 
motion, but there is all this squabbling on principle. For the 
most part, members of the Bloc represent outlying areas of 
Quebec. I do too. While squabbling on principle may have its 
merits, reality is catching up to us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning is a case in point. An editorialist from my region, 
Rénald Boily, wrote “It is demonstrated on a daily basis in our 
region that the Bouchard government's move toward ambulatory 
care is becoming a move toward confusion.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Richard Brantford, another editorialist, said “Ours is a region 
with a moribund economy.” That is the result of 25 years of PQ 
government in my region. That is what we have to show for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have no objection to squabbling on principle, here in Ottawa, 
with the Bloc Quebecois. Let us transfer the funding for 
employment, regional development and health. But is my colleague 
not concerned about his region? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is that, when funds are transferred to Quebec, they 
do not get to the regions. There are statistics to back this up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am extremely surprised to hear 
the member for Chicoutimi make such a charge against the 
Government of Quebec when he himself had an opportunity to make 
his views known during the Quebec election campaign a few months 
back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone knows he was asked to run.  If the Parti Quebecois is 
as bad as all that in his region, he had a chance to run for the 
provincial Liberal Party and to participate in this debate.  I 
assume that he did not do so because he thought he had a better 
chance of hanging on here than running as a Liberal MLA in 
Chicoutimi.  I will leave him to ponder that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The shift toward ambulatory care has been mentioned because it 
is a very important reform.  I do not want to go into this in 
any great detail because this is not the appropriate place for 
such a debate. 
Carrying out a large-scale and important reform in the midst of 
cutbacks is a very difficult thing to do and it is true that 
many regions of Quebec are suffering, his and mine both. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But I would remind him that the impact, in my region alone, of 
the federal government's health cuts amounts to $20 million 
annually.  For us, an additional $20 million for health care 
would mean a stronger health care system and more services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However much we want reforms, if one of our sources of revenue 
dries up, if it all but disappears, it is difficult to be 
completely successful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They did the best they could with the resources they had at the 
time, but improvements have to be made. 
One of the ways to improve the situation would be for the 
federal government to correct the mistake it made by reducing 
health care funding. Do I think health services are managed 
perfectly in Quebec? No, there will never be a perfect system. 
However, I do believe that people are acting in good faith and 
we are headed in the right direction. Our first need is 
additional financial resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To conclude on the issue of the ice storm and federal 
visibility, I have no problem saying that the federal government 
paid 90 per cent of the bills. Nor do I have any problem saying 
that Quebeckers send more than $30 billion in taxes to Ottawa 
every year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien:</B> The President of the Treasury Board is using 
figures from the year when the deficit reached $45 billion. 
These figures are no longer valid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We pay taxes to Ottawa. It is our money that is being used when 
there is a crisis in western Canada's agricultural sector. We 
also pay when there is flooding in Winnipeg. It is not just in 
Quebec. This is a kind of insurance policy: one year we benefit 
from it, while in another year we put money into the fund. But 
it is our taxes. I have no problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as I am concerned, there is no such thing as federal or 
provincial money. There is only taxpayers' money.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for 
Waterloo—Wellington. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the orators who have already spoken in the debate.  It 
has been fruitful.  It does occur of course at a time when some 
of the issues here may be resolved consensually by a meeting 
several blocks away of the Prime Minister and the first ministers 
I have benefited by the discussion by the members of the Bloc. It 
is good to remind ourselves that the Constitution is more than a 
discussion of sovereignty in the abstract, that there are larger 
issues of reform and modernization which can be addressed and 
to which members of the Bloc opposite can contribute usefully. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take this opportunity as a diversion for paying compliment to 
the statement made on behalf of the Bloc two days ago in the 
debate on the notwithstanding clause by the hon. member for 
Beauharnois—Salaberry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I heard the statement I thought that is a statement I could 
have written myself.  It was a very sensible statement.  It was 
wise.  The illogic of it of course was that it pointed not to two 
negative votes, but somehow in the mysterious ways a vote for 
one, a vote against the other, I do not think Decartes would have 
approved of this display of logic.  Nevertheless the reasoning is 
good and it takes us back to the position that federalism is not 
some frozen system of rules and regulations developed in a bygone 
century and to be applied immutably to changed social conditions 
today.  Federalism is essentially a very flexible system.  It is 
sometimes forgotten by Canadians, English speaking Canadians 
perhaps more than others, that the Westminster model which was 
developed by the British imperial power, which was not noticeably 
federal at the time it developed it, the theory in practice was 
developed for its overseas colonies. Look at the problems 
the English have in encompassing decentralization for Scotland 
and Wales. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the Westminster model is not the only model of 
federalism.  I refer again to the Pepin-Roberts commission, 
perhaps the most imaginative of the expert commissions of study 
on our Constitution in the last 50 years. It essentially 
proclaimed the truth that there are many roads to Rome and there 
are many different models of federalism.  It introduced an 
interesting notion which did not need an obscure terminology to 
render it, asymmetrical federalism, simply saying that in any 
mature federal system the sociological conditions are crucial. We 
treat equal things equally but unequal things may have a 
differentiation of constitutional treatment.  Why not?  It is 
ordinary common sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of applications of the new approach, a flexible approach of 
the Pepin-Roberts style to federalism, is the concept of the 
social union which is being discussed, as least the practical 
implementation of an abstract concept, by the Prime Minister and 
the first ministers at this moment.  As a term of art it is 
post-war German federalism.  There is nothing wrong with that. 
The post-war German federal system is what the Americans might 
have if they had lost the war and had to rebuild their 
constitution from the ground up.  It is very modern federalism 
but in its very intelligent, pragmatic allocation and transfer of 
powers between three levels of government it does necessitate, if 
it is to be applied to Canada, a constitutional amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of our problems with the patriation package in 1982 was 
whatever it did in other areas it put the Constitution in a 
straight-jacket in terms of amendments.  It is very hard to amend 
the Constitution by the front door.  This is an admirable feature 
I think Canadians have developed. This is one part of their English 
heritage but it is also part of the French heritage 
because it is also occurred in France, the development by 
constitutional glosses, custom convention, changes made by 
practice which last because they are common sense.  They are 
sensible.  They respond to new problems and nobody is going to 
say nay to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at the social union in terms of medical payments, 
partnership and financing medicare, there is so much that can be 
done by accommodations between governments.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Special arrangements can be made for different regions 
corresponding to demonstrated special societal facts or special 
needs.  Uniformity is not a sine qua non, and this is where 
Pepin-Robarts in reminding us of the opting in and opting out 
facilities and raising the compensation in opting out provided 
the opportunity if there is a spirit of goodwill and of pragmatic 
compromise for working out arrangements to accommodate the 
increasing pluralism in our federal society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If these arrangements being discussed today do not work out we 
can assure the House that we will as a national government and 
uphold our principle that there are national norms in medicare, 
in medical treatment and in medical research that we will in 
fulfilment of our mandate and our duty to the country seek to 
effectuate within our power.  But there is nothing to prevent 
administrative devolution in the spirit of co-operative 
federalism.  The message from the Prime Minister is that we would 
like to work with you. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Co-operative federalism, Lester Pearson style social union and 
the new trendy word of today, borrowed as I say somewhat 
inexactly from West German federalism, these are all ways of 
achieving socially useful results within an accommodatingly 
flexible federal system. The principle of subsidiarity, the 
notion from the European Union that each level of government 
should be allowed to do what it does best in terms of a 
functional reallocation of powers on a basis of co-operative 
federalism and customary adjustment of the constitution, it is 
all there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We wish the Prime Minister and the first ministers every success 
in their efforts.  If they do not succeed we will do our duty as 
the federal government to the Canadian people to deliver on a 
21st century medical insurance system properly financed.  We want 
the co-operation of the provincial governments.  We welcome the 
element of pragmatism I saw in the Bloc motion, the Bloc attitude 
two days ago on the notwithstanding clause.  I wish its logic 
could have been more in the Cartesian sense and the two votes 
would have been identical in terms of its party, but the progress 
is there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has been a good debate.  It has been intelligent.  There is 
the going backwards and forwards in terms of the give and take 
that is the essential of any mature federal system.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles-A. Perron (Rivière-des-Mille-Îles, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the philosophical speech of the member opposite. He 
spoke of a flexible federalist government but that government 
actually appears dictatorial to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know what the hon. member thinks of this 
government which, after cutting billions of dollars in 
provincial transfers, now says it wants to put some money back 
into those transfers, but not unconditionally. Indeed, this 
government wants to interfere to the point of dictating to the 
provinces how to administer billions of dollars, how to become 
part of Canada-wide programs, while the Canada Health Act already 
provides for five conditions to which all provincial governments 
in Canada have already agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why should the federal government interfere even further? Why? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney:</B> Mr. Speaker, the policy of our government is 
to ensure each Canadian has equal access to the health care 
system. If necessary, our government will act alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we prefer to have a system of which all provinces are 
part, a system based on equal involvement by both levels of 
government. This is what co-operative federalism is all about. 
This is the guiding principle the Prime Minister is discussing 
this very day with provincial premiers.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians place a very high premium on their health and the 
health of their families.  It is a fundamental element of our 
individual quality of life in Canada. 
It is more than just the absence of disease.  It is a resource 
for every day living.  At a population level we know that a 
healthy population contributes immeasurably to the social 
well-being and economic productivity of the country.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians as a population compared to citizens of other 
countries enjoy very excellent health.  Canadians are remarkably 
healthy by every standard around the world in terms of health 
such as life expectancy and self-reported health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our enviable health status is due in no small part to our 
commitment to health promotion.  That is something of which we an 
all be very proud because Canada is internationally respected as 
a world leader in health promotion.  The world looks to Canada 
for leadership in health research, policy and practices that will 
help all countries make progress in achieving health for all 
their citizens as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, Canada was the site of the first world conference 
on health promotion.  We can be proud of this leadership we took 
in developing a charter for the World Health Organization which 
set out the prerequisites for a healthy population based on a 
health promotion approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government plays a key role in health promotion. The 
federal government supports initiatives to help Canadians adopt 
healthy behaviours: for example, to quit smoking, to achieve a 
better level of physical fitness, and to have a healthy and 
nutritious diet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The results of this work have been truly remarkable.  Deaths due 
to heart disease have declined.  Canadians are much more fit than 
they were even a generation ago.  Their eating habits have 
improved and smoking rates have gone down.  We know that by 
getting Canadians to adopt a healthier lifestyle we can add years 
of life and health to their lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All this is not to say that all Canadians lead a healthy 
lifestyle.  There is much more to be done.  The federal 
government will continue to play a key role in helping Canadians 
through public education, through education of health 
professionals such as doctors and nurses, and through supporting 
action to make our communities healthy and safe places in which 
to live and to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health is much more than a product of individual choice.  We 
must create the conditions that allow and encourage individuals 
to make healthy choices:  for example, opportunities for healthy 
child development, for educational and employment opportunities, 
and safe and healthy workplaces.  Most of all we must foster 
community action which encourages all members of all ages and all 
levels of ability to contribute to and partake in the benefits of 
a healthy social, economic and physical environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government helps to create the conditions which 
foster health and healthy choices by all Canadian citizens.  How 
does it do this?  It does it by working in partnership with 
provincial and territorial governments, with the voluntary and 
community sectors and with the private sector on national 
strategies to address pressing health issues such as HIV and 
AIDS, tobacco use, substance abuse, and chronic disease such as 
heart disease, diabetes and cancer.  Time and time again the 
federal government has through its work in partnership with 
others helped Canadians gain an upper hand on the disease and 
health problems that concern them most. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A good example of Health Canada's partnership work is the heart 
health initiative.  This initiative since its inception eight 
years ago has created an extensive network involving the federal 
government, 10 provincial departments of health, the Heart and 
Stroke Foundation of Canada, and over 1,000 organizations in the 
public, private and voluntary sectors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The objective of the initiative is the reduction of 
cardiovascular disease by addressing the risk factors and 
socioeconomic conditions that underlie it.   While good progress 
has been made Canada still ranks in the middle of industrialized 
countries with respect to heart disease mortality.  Federal 
leadership in this area will help continue this progress, and 
this we must do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another example of Health Canada's partnership work is in the 
community action program for children.  Health Canada has 
developed partnership arrangements with all provinces for this 
very important initiative which helps ensure optimal 
opportunities for healthy childhood development.  Through this 
program Health Canada works with its partners to support 
community programs and groups to establish and deliver services 
that address the developmental needs of our children from birth 
to six years of age who are at risk of poor health or live in 
conditions likely to give rise to poor health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This program has been successful in building community capacity. 
Health Canada works with the provinces and territories toward a 
strategy for healthy child development through the federal, 
provincial and territorial advisory committee on population 
health.  The shared vision of this work is the belief that 
healthy child development is the foundation of lifelong health 
and that by working together we can achieve optimal health for 
all Canadian children.

</I></B></P><P align=left>At the other end of the life course Health Canada works in 
partnership with the provinces and territories to promote healthy 
aging.  It is well known, for example, that a society which 
encourages and supports independence, autonomy and a good quality 
of life for its senior citizens is a society that is 
characterized by the health, vitality and longevity of its 
seniors population.  Health Canada has developed a framework for 
aging in partnership with the provinces and territories to help 
all levels of government see our programs policies and services 
through a seniors lens, something which is very important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At no time has this been more important than now.  After all, 
this is the international year of the older person.  In the years 
to come our senior population will grow tremendously.  The 
federal government is committed to continue its work in 
partnership with others to ensure that as a society our seniors 
have optimal opportunities for health and good quality life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government is working on many other fronts in 
collaboration to support health promotion and disease prevention. 
One of the most important ways is to track and report on progress 
on the health of Canadians.  Together federal, provincial and 
territorial governments developed a report on the health of 
Canadians.  The first edition was issued by ministers jointly in 
1996.  The second edition will be released in the fall of this 
year updating the trends in health status reported in 1996 and 
giving us an opportunity to celebrate improvements and to 
recommit ourselves to work on persistent health problems and 
inequalities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has and will continue to play an 
important role in the health of all Canadians, and rightfully so. 
Canadians count on us to work in partnership with others and to 
promote and protect their health wherever they may live in 
Canada.  The achievements in health status over the last century 
can be attributed in large part to the efforts of the federal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can be justly proud of our record and our respected place on 
the world stage.  It is second to none in terms of health 
promotion and in other areas.  Our health care system is a core 
fundamental value for Canadians.  Accordingly we at the federal 
level will continue to work very hard to ensure that our health 
care system remains one of the best in the world. Canadians 
expect this.  Canadians want this.  Canadians need this.  Quite 
frankly, Canadians deserve this.  We will continue to do this at 
the federal level and we will do it well.

opposite for the question.  I cannot speak for Premier Tobin in 
terms of what he may or may not want.  What I can do is speak on 
behalf of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to health care for Canadians we have over the past 
number of years worked out a very strong partnership among the 
federal, provincial and territorial governments to ensure quality 
care for Canadians wherever they may live in Canada.  That is 
precisely what Canadians want.  They want us to work in this kind 
of partnership to ensure that a health care system is in place 
for themselves and their families.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Serge Cardin (Sherbrooke, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the member 
opposite referred in his speech to principles that all 
provinces, including Quebec, share in the area of health, 
improvement of care, equipment, and education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is there something new here? When his government decided to cut 
transfers, in health among others, did those principles not 
already exist? Now that this government has the financial means 
to act, is its main concern not to get involved in health care, 
to gain overall control of this area and to promote its 
visibility? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I would like to come back to the question he did not 
answer. With regard to health, is hepatitis C a concern for the 
government? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member opposite 
for the question.  I reiterate that we at the federal level have 
worked very hard to ensure there are partnerships in place to 
deal with all health related matters including the issue of 
hepatitis C.  As members know we have put in place a fund of $1.1 
billion relative to that issue.  With our provincial and 
territorial partners we will continue to do the right thing on 
behalf of all Canadians including those who suffer from hepatitis 
C. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that we at the federal level continue to do that 
to ensure that health care as we know it continues as the core 
fundamental value that it is to Canadians wherever they may live 
in this great land of ours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member of the 
Liberal Party talks about partnership and co-operation among the 
various parties.  He should back that up with resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He knows that the federal government has taken $2.5 billion out 
of health care services for the last three years.  He now talks 
about the ability of partnering and co-operation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What would he have to say about the lack of funds and resources 
behind his statements? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the government has committed 
and will continue to commit the funds necessary for the health 
care system in Canada.  We have done so in the past and we will 
continue to do so in the future in the best interest of Canadians 
wherever they may live in Canada.

very pleased to speak today to the Bloc motion asking the 
government to respect provincial jurisdiction over health care 
management, to increase transfers to the provinces for health 
care unconditionally, and to avoid using budget surpluses to 
encroach upon the health care field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we speak, the premiers and the prime minister are 
gathered—they may be having lunch right now—to discuss the federal 
presence in the health care field. This meeting was called due 
to Ottawa's centralizing drive; it would never have had to 
happen if only the federal government knew how to respect the 
sharing of responsibilities as outlined in the Constitution.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, I will state again for the benefit of our fellow 
citizens that under subsections 7 and 16 of section 92 of the 
1867 Constitutional Act, and their interpretation by the courts, 
it is clearly established and recognized that the management of 
health care and social services is a provincial responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government for its part often uses its spending 
power to skirt the spirit of the Constitution and spend money in 
areas under provincial jurisdiction. Whether we approve or not 
of this spending power, we cannot but acknowledge the fact that 
the federal government has not made a wise use of it since, more 
often that not, the money thus spent is borrowed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Successive governments have made such a use of this spending 
power to guarantee their visibility, their re-election or their 
supremacy or simply to flatter their own vanity, that Canada's 
credit card balance reached more than $600 billion, putting 
future generations of Canada into debt for many years to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The very same government who imposed drastic cuts in social 
programs, mainly in the health programs, wants to do the same 
thing again by imposing new standards, a new bureaucracy and new 
duplications. We have to put an end to this at all costs, non 
only in the interest of the people of Quebec, but of all 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government would like to be recognised as the great 
saviour of health care when in fact it is the cause of all the 
problems experienced in the provinces. We must be very careful. 
I would like people to hear clearly what I am saying. At the 
present time, the federal government is playing with words. When 
the Prime Minister comes out and says he will generously put $2 
billion back into health care, we are led to believe that he 
will take $2 billion out of the surpluses and put it back into 
health care. How generous! 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But what the government really wants to do—we have forgotten a 
bit that there are still $40 billion to be cut before 2003—the 
government very generously says that because of our sound 
economic situation, it will only cut $38 billion between now and 
2003. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So let us not be deceived. Some will say that $2 billion is 
still a significant amount. 
It is obviously very important that the $38 billion in cuts be 
reduced. We do not need any more cuts, but we should not cling 
to the hope that the government will be overly generous with the 
money it is digging out of our pockets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should also be mindful that under the transfer payment 
legislation, transfers are set by the government unilaterally, 
without consultation. Since 1977, those payments have been 
reduced, frozen or cut, and their adjustment has no relation 
whatsoever with the real cost of implementing provincial 
programs. It can be said that the federal commitment to health 
care has been broken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By a strange coincidence, the debates that took place under 
Prime Minister Pearson on a Canadian health care system were 
made public yesterday. Surprisingly enough, there is another 
meeting today on the same issue. 
I hope the Liberal Party will return to its roots and seek 
inspiration from that great Canadian, Lester B. Pearson, and 
advocate policies that are more liberal, and less conservative 
and right wing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1994, the present Liberal government has cut $6.3 billion 
dollars in transfer payments to the provinces for health care, 
education and social assistance. Therefore, it is hardly in a 
position to lecture the provinces.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the federal government's wanting to impose a whole series 
of new conditions for maintaining and increasing its financial 
contribution to health care, let met remind the House that the 
National Council of Welfare, an organization whose role is to 
advise the health minister, warned against such action and said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be extremely hypocritical to reduce contributions to 
the provinces... while raising the standards required of them. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the federal government chose to take the very position 
the National Council of Welfare called hypocritical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only thing the federal government has to do in the next 
budget is to listen to the wishes of the people and the 
unanimous requests of the provinces, take billions of dollars 
from its surplus and massively reinvest in health care. The 
provinces will know how to use this money most effectively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should entertain absolutely no doubt about the capacity of 
the provincial governments to spend carefully, in the best 
interests of the population, the billions of dollars the federal 
government is transferring to them for health care. All the 
federal government has to do is trust the elected 
representatives. The public is the best watchdog there is to 
prevent any abuses the governments could be tempted to make. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government members across the way do not start to take 
into account the real interests of the people, if they remain 
insensitive to what is going on in this country for too long, 
they will soon find out how bitter the pill is, since they will 
end up in opposition. That is what I wish for with all my heart. 
<P><A NAME="LINK53"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
colleague from Rimouski—Mitis for an excellent speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to question her on a matter which is a concern for every 
member of the Bloc Quebecois, the federal government's 
infringement on provincial jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before asking my question, I remind members that the Prime 
Minister has questioned in this very House the provinces' will 
to reinvest in health. He said that it might be necessary to 
reach an agreement for increased funding and that there might be 
certain conditions, such as requiring reports on the use of 
funds, reports on the various medical services offered, and 
imposing federal priorities and policies on the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it not, according to my colleague, an infringement on 
provincial jurisdiction, something that is not mentioned in the 
Canadian constitution? 
Under the Canada Health Act, provinces have to abide by five 
major principles. The federal government, for its part, commits 
to using our taxes to redistribute the money to provinces to 
manage health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from 
Drummond for her excellent question and her very relevant 
comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, government or at least cabinet members seem to be 
making conflicting speeches. They do not always say the same 
thing. The Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs is boasting 
throughout Canada that the government is decentralized, the most 
decentralized in the world. We can see that, as a political 
science student, he did not study very hard in his course on the 
decentralization of powers. It may even have been his worst 
subject. He is also telling us that his government totally 
abides by the Constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The way this government is behaving is unacceptable. From the 
moment the federal government wants to sign an administrative 
agreement or to do something that would add to the five 
conditions agreed upon in the beginning by Canada and the 
provinces, at the time the health system was created, it is 
flouting the Constitution and mocking the provincial 
jurisdiction with respect to health and social services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question in my mind that the federal government 
infringes on our jurisdictions.

Speaker, I wish to thank the Bloc for bringing this very 
important debate to the House of Commons where it should be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Bloc member believes the money should be handed over 
unconditionally so that the province can dictate to itself what 
it would like to do with that health care money, what about the 
aboriginal communities in her province? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, aboriginal communities across this country are 
suffering greater than non-native people when it comes to health 
care concerns, various diseases and the crises they face.  What 
would her province be able to do to improve the lot of the 
aboriginal people as compared to other provinces and the rest of 
the country? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay:</B> Mr. Speaker, I may be wrong, and I stand 
to be corrected, as I am always prepared to learn something, but 
I believe aboriginal health care is one of the responsibilities 
of the federal government, because it has the responsibility for 
aboriginal people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite this responsibility I believe to be federal, it is 
clearly understood that, in Quebec, one need only look around to 
see that there is an absolutely excellent relationship with the 
Indians, the Inuit, with all the tribes, all the nations we have 
within the territory of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no doubt whatsoever that we do everything in our power 
to assist them, in education, in social services, in health 
care.  I believe that we will always be able to do our part in 
these areas.  Unless I am again mistaken, I believe that the 
aboriginal communities and nations in Quebec enjoy the best 
standard of living in Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to take part this morning in the Bloc Quebecois 
opposition day on health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is truly distressing to see that we, the Bloc Quebecois, we 
in the opposition, are being forced to introduce a motion 
calling upon the federal government to respect its own 
Constitution.  To have come to this is totally abnormal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe, however, that this reflects the state of the Canadian 
federation, the state in which the Prime Minister of Canada, the 
Liberal party of Canada, has plunged us, particularly in the 
last four years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is especially sad to hear the Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs and the Prime Minister tell us to stop our 
constitutional squabbling, that there is no point in getting 
into constitutional discussions again when there are people 
waiting for federal transfer payments, that there is no point 
messing up the system as we, the evil separatists, do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One has to be unbelievably hypocritical to make such a 
statement. Any debate or friction with respect to jurisdiction 
originates with the Prime Minister of Canada and member for 
Shawinigan or with the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs. 
Under the Constitution, health is undeniably an exclusive 
provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are now telling us that, in the future, the federal 
government will not only have a say in the matter but will 
actually manage transfer payments to the provinces for health. 
It will also monitor results. Such departure from the Canadian 
Constitution is pure heresy. They are not even complying with 
their own Constitution. It also makes for great theatrics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government is passing itself off as this great 
saviour of the health system, when in fact it is largely 
responsible for all the problems currently faced from coast to 
coast. The crowded emergency rooms and closed hospitals are the 
doing of the finance minister and the Prime Minister.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the 1995 budget, one of the most hypocritical budgets in 
the history of Canadian taxation, the Minister of Finance has 
decided that, every year until 2003, systematic cuts would be 
made in federal transfers for the funding of health care, 
post-secondary education and social assistance. But these cuts 
hit health care, which accounts for about half the transfers, 
the hardest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the year 2003, federal transfers to provinces for the funding 
of health care will have been cut by $40 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is today's reality. 
But the Prime Minister, the Minister of Finance and the Minister 
of Intergovernmental Affairs constantly distort reality in order 
to have us believe—and at the same time to increase their 
visibility—that the federal government is the great saviour. The 
federal government is the great destroyer of the health system 
in Canada. Every year, the provinces have $6.3 billion less in 
their coffers, almost half of that amount for health care in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Negotiations are now ongoing, and I hope they will be 
successful. But if it were not for the action taken in the 1995 
budget and the disarray of people who are waiting in hospital 
emergency wards, which are in bad shape because of the federal 
government, this conference would not have been necessary. 
The federal transfers for health care would have increased 
automatically because, since last year, the federal government 
has managed to create a surplus thanks to its horrible cuts, a 
surplus that, normally, should have been given back 
automatically to the people those who really paid for putting 
our fiscal house in order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This year, the Minister of Finance and the Prime Minister should 
have said that, because of the surpluses resulting from the fact 
that some $6 billion have been cut each year from transfers to 
the provinces, in particular for health care, they would give 
back this year's surplus to the provinces, unconditionally and 
in accordance with the Canadian Constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But that is not what was done. 
With great fanfare, the federal government wanted to ensure its 
visibility and show that it is the saviour of the health care 
system. This is a monumental farce. It is sad that the provinces 
should be forced, with a knife at their throats because they are 
struggling and suffering from yearly shortfalls, to take part in 
last minute federal-provincial conferences to agree to certain 
transfer arrangements. Six billion dollars every year, this is 
not peanuts. I think it is sad and tragic that we have come to 
this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will explain to you how we have come to this. The Prime 
Minister did not make any bones of it. When he was in France, he 
said that everything was fine in Canada, that the federal 
government made the cuts and that the provinces did the dirty 
work. The Prime Minister made no bones of it. 
The president of the Treasury Board did not either when he said: 
“When the provinces make cuts, after our own cuts, we will 
appear as saviours”. He said it just two years ago, and that is 
what was brewing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Coming back to the 1995 budget, the finance minister said to 
himself: “It is not a very popular thing to make cuts in social 
programs and health care, I will do it only once, I will 
announce it only once, and it will continue until 2003”. That is 
what he did. That is why I underlined earlier the hypocritical 
aspect of the budget, because it will cause a disaster— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Coderre:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. This 
House is an appropriate forum for presenting arguments. But the 
member for Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot has repeatedly used the words 
hypocrite and hypocritical. I think this is not helping the 
debate. 
I would ask the member to stick to his arguments and to refrain 
from making personal attacks because that is not helping the 
debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am sure that the hon. member for 
Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot is quite familiar with the rules of this 
House. He knows that it is against the rules to refer to other 
members as hypocrites. I am sure that was not his intention.

<A HREF="#LINKT34"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Bourassa is right when he says that using 
this word in that way is unparliamentary, and I hope that the 
hon. member for Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot will examine the Standing 
Orders closely in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have fully complied with the 
rules. Perhaps the hon. member should clean his ears, because I 
did not mention anyone when I talked about hypocrisy. I referred 
to a budget that is hypocritical. Perhaps the member feels that 
a budget is a person. There seems to be a problem of 
understanding, perhaps a problem of conceptual learning. I have 
never made a personal attack. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, I was saying that this was the most hypocritical budget, 
because, in one fell swoop, the government decided to impose 
cuts that will exceed $40 billion by the year 2003, money that 
is largely used by the provinces to finance health services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since it is the national health care system, which is 
administered by the provinces, that was the victim of the 
government's attempt to put its fiscal house in order, one would 
have expected the government to use part of that money according 
to the previous provisions. In other words, the federal 
government should have given that money back to the provinces, 
without making a big show of it to promote its visibility. It 
should have given part, not all of what was asked based on the 
Saskatoon agreement, that is the agreement reached by the 
premiers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it totally unacceptable to be at this point, where the 
government has huge surpluses that help promote the personality 
of the year, namely the Minister of Finance and future leader of 
the Liberal Party of Canada, at the expense of ordinary 
Canadians. The government is even resorting to despicable 
methods—as we saw with the employment insurance program—to 
deprive the unemployed of hundreds of millions of dollars. 
They create a surplus in the employment insurance fund of $6 
billion annually, a real public vendetta.  That is where we are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government is setting itself up as the great saviour 
of the health care system when in fact it is responsible for 
entire mess we have been in since 1995.  Then there are the 
unemployed, who continue to pay and will do so forever, if we 
are to believe the offhand and arrogant remarks of the Prime 
Minister, the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Human 
Resources Development, at the rate of $6 billion annually. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They keep pressuring them so they can draw off every cent that 
will enable the federal government to increase its surplus and 
fund initiatives such as the millennium scholarship fund that 
move the Prime Minister's face, the federal government and the 
Canadian flag into the foreground. 
They are threatening the unemployed who are considering 
appealing a decision that is totally unacceptable and 
unjustified.  They are even threatening the officials carrying 
out this vendetta with the loss of their jobs should they not 
meet the objectives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is not much difference between that and the mafia.  There 
is not much difference between that and an organized vendetta. 
It is as if the idea in the little brain of the Minister of 
Finance is to have the biggest surplus possible in order to 
impress as many as possible so he appears to be the best manager 
in the world and swell his popularity in the near future at the 
head of the Liberal Party of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But is he creating social problems in his efforts to score 
political points?  Is he dragging down the health care sector? 
Is he creating hardship for families in Quebec and in Canada, so 
that he can look good and keep Bay Street happy? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The humanity has all but gone out of the system when visibility 
is more important than people's health, when misinformation is 
more important than hard facts, the truth and democracy, and 
when vendettas are more important than unemployed workers in 
need of assistance.  This is a terrible way to treat people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that one day the government will come to its senses.  We 
should not have to get down on our knees for what is rightly 
ours.  Quebeckers pay $30 billion in taxes annually. 
It is only right that part of this money, a good part of it, 
should come back to us without our having to negotiate a deal 
that would guarantee visibility for a power-hungry Prime Minister.

have heard from the other side since this morning is absolutely 
appalling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been said that the federal government is cutting left, 
right and centre. I would like to point out to my colleagues 
opposite that the major cuts were made here in Ottawa. The 
provinces were asked, two years in advance, to put their house 
in order. The only thing the Quebec government came up with was 
to cut municipal budgets even more than we cut its transfer 
payments, with about 4 months' notice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Quebec government decided to do a major cleanup in health 
care in three years. Nobody asked the Quebec government to cut 
the health care budget to eliminate the deficit and to try to 
bring about a winning referendum in the year 2000 on the backs 
of the people. 
Now they point the finger at the Government of Canada. They 
should be ashamed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We eliminated the $42 billion deficit in five years. We can now 
start to think about lowering taxes for low income earners. We 
improved the system but we are still being blamed for 
everything. They should take a look in the mirror. It is really 
appalling to hear things like that today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about the millennium scholarship fund, do we say 
that we will be asking teachers to teach more English than 
French or do we pretend that two plus two will now equal five? 
No. What we say is that we want to help talented young Canadians 
to keep on studying, even if their parents do not have the 
financial means to help them. We want to set up a scholarship 
program in concert with governments. It will be up to them to 
choose the recipients. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With a little bit of planing and co-operation, there should be no 
problem. 
The reason our visibility is resented is that people who want to 
separate do not want to reveal what the Government of Canada is 
doing for Quebeckers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we hear that $29 billion in taxes is sent to Ottawa, nobody 
mentions that $42 billion also comes from Ottawa. People should 
know that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about equalization: $4.7 billion is sent back to 
Quebec. Quebec receives 47 per cent of Canada's total 
equalization payments. The members opposite do not talk about 
that. They just talk about the bad things. If they want to be 
honest, they must tell both sides of the story. Quebeckers must 
know the truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What would the member do things? How would he improve health 
care? In Quebec City, nurses are laid off and then rehired with 
severance pay. Talk about good management! 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot should explain the solutions 
he is advocating. All he does is criticize. He never has a 
solution to suggest. He should suggest something. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> Mr. Speaker, this is because he does not 
often listen to what we have to say. We have a great solution, 
and that is to run our own show and stop arguing with this gang 
that understands nothing. We call it Quebec sovereignty. This is 
our great solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we run our onw show, we will no longer have to 
come to Ottawa to discuss how to redistribute our own money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For his information, it is urgent that we put some order in the 
Quebec government's finances. I remind him that in 1994, when 
the Parti Quebecois came to power, his gang, his gang of 
Liberals, Bourbeau and company, left us with a $6 billion 
deficit, making it urgent to get our financial house in order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If he does not think this is important, I remind him that 
federal cuts mean a $2 billion shortfall every year for Quebec. 
If he believes this does not hurt the people he is supposed to 
represent, he has one helluva problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If he thinks the millennium scholarships are a good deal he 
should run somewhere else in Canada because in Quebec we have a 
consensus against the millennium scholarships— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Coderre:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the hon. member for Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot needs to be taught a 
lesson, I will do so today. Helluva is blasphemous. I urge him 
to use appropriate language when he speaks. The people I 
represent like to hear speeches of substance rather than 
constant personal attacks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My grandmother used to would wash out our mouth with soap. I 
will send the member a full box of soap. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I have no doubt the point raised by the hon. 
member for Bourassa is a point of view. I may get a little 
distracted at times during debates, but nevertheless I would say 
that the hon. member for Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot has the floor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> Mr. Speaker, I admit I should not have used 
that word. Sometimes, one gets wound up.

“ helluva problem ”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Coderre:</B> Ah, that's better.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, when one has the honour of representing 
Quebeckers, as my colleague does and we do, we have to report 
the truth. The problem we had during the last 30 years, before 
the Bloc Quebecois came on the federal scene, is that there was 
a double legitimacy: there were those in the National Assembly 
in Quebec City who said one thing, quite often the right thing, 
and there were the federalist representatives of Quebec in the 
House of Commons who said the opposite because they had to 
follow Mr. Trudeau, because there had to be a balance between 
the east and the west, and so on. There were often 
contradictions between what was said here in Ottawa and what was 
said in Quebec City. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For once, one can say that the Bloc Quebecois here is defending 
the true interests of Quebeckers, interests that are based on a 
consensus. I challenge the member to say that his position on 
the millennium scholarships fund reflects the position of 
Quebeckers. We debated the issue for weeks, there were 
representations from all the legitimate representatives of 
Quebec, namely organisations that really count in Quebec, 
students federations, workers unions and business people. They 
are all against the millennium scholarships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member should stop saying things that are not correct. It is 
not true that the millennium scholarships fund will help needy 
students. This fund will actually be useful to an elite because 
the scholarships will be granted on the basis of merit, not 
need.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I find it rather ironic, interesting to say the least, to listen 
to someone from the Bloc quoting our Constitution.  It is 
somewhat ironic to listen to someone who would destroy the 
Constitution, who would simply tear the country apart to lecture 
the government on the interpretation that we have to live by the 
rules that that member would like to destroy.  The irony is 
palpable when we listen to that kind of debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are talking about here is respect for a Constitution 
that lays out partnerships and does not take an issue as 
important as health care—and I will get to the Reform Party in a 
minute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  We thought you would. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not intend to 
disappoint them now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It really is ironic.  Maybe the Bloc would help me out a little. 
I was originally scheduled to be in my French class between 1 
p.m. and 2 p.m.  The whip's office called and asked me if I would 
like to speak on the opposition day motion. I said I sure would. 
Maybe the Bloc can replace my French lesson by helping me with a 
few words in French. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does one say “myopic” in French? How does one say “double 
standard” in French? How does one say “parochialism” in French? 
How does one say “provincialism” in French? How does one say 
“hypocrisy” in French? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, perhaps the Bloc could help me by giving me a brief 
French lesson on those five words.  I would replace those five 
words with one word in English, which would be Bloc. The Bloc 
would meet the standard and the definition of all those words 
with regard to this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for 
Lac-Saint-Louis today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the motion put forward by the Bloc meets the standard or 
test of all five of those words, it does not address five other 
issues.  Those are the issues that fundamentally are the 
cornerstones of our health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other day I was taken to task by some of the hon. members 
opposite when I said in this place that Canadians are 
fundamentally proud of their health care system.  Of course they 
realize there are problems, just as I realized when I and a 
member of my family arrived at the Mississauga hospital by 
ambulance a couple of weeks ago.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They realize there are problems when there are three patients in 
beds in the hall with ambulance attendants required to wait with 
those patients until they can be transferred to a specific bed in 
a room.  We are tying up three crews of ambulance workers.  We 
are making people who are in some cases extremely ill sit in a 
public hallway on a gurney or a bed waiting to get proper 
attention. There is something wrong with that.  This government 
knows that. The Canadian people know that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would members opposite expect us to sit back and allow a 
provincial government, such as in my province, to hand back a 30% 
tax cut which benefits the wealthiest members of society in 
Ontario, while it cuts health care?  They can blame the federal 
government if they wish. And politically, heading toward an 
election this spring or next fall, I am not at all surprised that 
they would do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that the partnership spoken about in our 
Constitution, the partnership that is being negotiated as we 
speak in this place, the social union that is being negotiated is 
all about establishing some fundamental principles.  This party 
and this government believe in those principles and will never 
transfer any kind of responsibility or ability to the provincial 
level to negate those principles of public administration, 
accessibility, portability, universality and comprehensiveness. 
That is the foundation of medicare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it truly amusing when I listen to the member from the 
Bloc claiming that she would like to see this party sitting in 
opposition.  I would like her to tell us what that solution would 
be.  Would she like the Reform Party with its two tier system to 
be in charge of health care in this country?  I highly doubt it. 
She would recognize that representing a party that is based on 
provincial values only that the Bloc is incapable of forming a 
national government.  Obviously it goes without saying the Bloc 
would have some slight difficulty electing members outside la 
belle province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member recognize that the Tory government under Brian 
Mulroney left a legacy of $42 billion which required the serious 
attention by this government to the deficit and that took every 
ounce of effort and courage by the Canadian people to eliminate 
it?  Would she like to see the party of Brian Mulroney back in 
power?  Or is she naive enough to believe it would be the New 
Democrats? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The New Democrats had their crack at governing in the province 
of Ontario at a time when I was in opposition to Mr. Rae and 
company. They had their crack at showing the country what they 
could do with a reasonably sized government, and the damage that 
occurred under their stewardship.  Would she really believe the 
New Democrats are going to form a national government? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not hear the other side of the issue. She would like to 
stand and say get rid of the Liberals.  I understand that. That 
is the opposition.  That is the best thought she has had today. 
She does not know what to counter it with or what to replace it 
with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is this federation works.  In spite of the 
utterances of members of the Bloc, in spite of the fact that they 
would destroy this country, it works because the federal 
government is committed to working with the provinces, with the 
private sector, with the local community.  That is very 
important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I assume that by this motion the Bloc would have us abdicate our 
responsibility.  This is not about respect.  It is about 
abdication. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a section of the federal government called the federal 
health protection program.  Would the Bloc wish that this 
government should simply walk away from that program?  It is a 
program that monitors disease and tells us about the best ways to 
prevent or control illness or injury for Canadians throughout the 
country. 
They prevent and they respond to public health emergencies.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a tragedy in my own community not long ago when a 
teenager came down with a case of meningitis and died.  Imagine 
the panic, the sense of fear in the community, the demands to the 
regional municipality, not to the province and not to the federal 
government, but to the community's medical officer to immunize 
everyone in the community. We have to balance that fear.  Is it 
realistic?  It sure seems so when we have a teenager at home who 
might contract that deadly disease. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government through the federal health protection 
program can work with local health delivery agencies to deal with 
that kind of emergency.  I do not think what the Bloc is talking 
about takes into account the extremely important work that is 
done in working with local health authorities who really deliver 
it on the ground. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know I have a just a few seconds left so in closing, I want to 
say that this could be a historic day.  As the Prime Minister 
meets with the premiers it is my hope on behalf of my 
constituents and all Canadians that calm will prevail, that some 
intelligence will come around that table to understand that the 
federal government cannot do what the Bloc would like us to do 
which is to wash our hands of our responsibility in health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government will, I believe on the 16th, make a major 
commitment to the Canadian people in the area of health care 
funding.  Canadians can continue to feel confident that Canada 
has one of the finest health care systems in the world, a system 
which is portable, accessible and affordable for all.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron (Fundy—Royal, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to make some comments in order to set the record straight 
in terms of the fiscal leadership of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government claims that all of a sudden it balanced the 
budget. I point out quite clearly that it was Canadians who 
sacrificed themselves in paying high taxes who balanced the 
budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to point out that it was the Progressive 
Conservative government of Ralph Klein that actually led this 
country with respect to fiscal responsibility and debt reduction. 
Things like the balanced budget legislation of the Progressive 
Conservative government of Gary Filmon actually set that road as 
well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will say one thing quite clearly, nobody would have balanced a 
budget, including this finance minister, if Mike Harris and Ernie 
Eves did not actually get the economic engine of this country 
going again, that being Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to point out that because of a tax cut of Mike 
Harris and Ernie Eves, the province of Ontario is taking in more 
money, not less money, so that the province of Ontario has a 
chance to reinvest in health care.  They are going to be giving 
some money back in health care.  I would point out that by giving 
some of the money back to health care, I would equate that with 
taking away a loaf and only giving back a slice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, if the hon. member cares 
to check the record in <I>Hansard</I>, he would see that my 
comments did reflect that it was the courage, the dedication and 
the hard work of Canadians that allowed us to balance the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He wants to give great credit to Mike and Ernie, the golf pros. 
He wants to tell us that they figured out how to solve this. On 
the one hand he says to give the credit to the Canadian people, 
but on the other hand he wants to ignore the hard work of the 
people of Ontario.  It was through the sacrifices of the citizens 
of Ontario, as a result of Mike the Knife and Ernie the Golfer 
who took the money out of the health care system in the province 
of Ontario, and that member should understand that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK59"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am sure

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like him to stand in his place and admit that between 
1995 and today the money for medicare has gone up by $1.5 
billion.  During that period the federal cuts to health for 
Ontario totalled $3 billion.  Maybe he would admit that.  I am 
sure it was an inadvertent mistake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ontarians did in fact recognize health was so important that the 
funding for health in Ontario went up even while they cut taxes. 
I am certain it was inadvertent.  I would like to give him the 
opportunity to right this wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to give the member 
some sense of confidence that very little of what I say is 
inadvertent.  I can assure him of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to make a point with reference to the comment that 
it was the Conservative government of Ralph Klein that did these 
wonderful things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the same government in the province of Alberta that 
imposed user fees on its own citizens until this government said 
no, we will not transfer the money to you.  You cannot violate 
the terms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the province, the member has obviously been 
watching the advertising machine of the Progressive Conservative 
Party which is filling the airwaves full of twisted untruths. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Costs have been driven through the roof, no question about that. 
This requires more money in health care.  This government is 
committed to that and the member, in spite of his rhetoric, will 
see that commitment very soon.

to ask the member a short and straightforward question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does he find it normal that the Bloc Quebecois, a sovereignist 
party from Quebec, should be the one to defend the Canadian 
Constitution and provincial jurisdictions? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is truly the irony of 
all ironies that the Bloc would find itself supposedly in its 
somewhat twisted myopic view of this situation to be the defender 
of the Canadian Constitution.  It leaves me almost speechless, 
something that does not happen to me very often. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is what the Bloc is doing is playing parochial, 
provincial politics, nothing more.  As the premiers talk with the 
Prime Minister, it is deathly afraid that they might come out of 
that meeting with some kind of agreement which the people of 
Quebec will say is a good agreement, that they might actually 
make a deal that they will be able to go back to the people of 
Quebec and indeed all people in Canada and say we have done what 
is right for all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what the Bloc does not like.  Anything its members can 
do to undermine the credibility of this place, the credibility of 
this great country, is what they are about.  It is truly 
shameful.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Lac-Saint-Louis, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, today 
we are debating a motion on health care that has everything to 
do with jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois does not want the federal government to touch 
anything that is under provincial jurisdiction, and I agree with 
this. It also says that the budget surplus should not be used in 
the area of health care. I think this motion shows the huge gap 
that separates the Liberal Party from the Bloc Quebecois. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Jurisdictional issues are important indeed. There is no denying 
that. We have a constitution that must be respected. However, we 
should make it our top priority to explore every possible avenue 
to find common solutions to problems in areas of shared 
jurisdiction, as is the case here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, it is clear that the federal government has 
jurisdiction over everything that has to do with social 
programs. Under the Canada Health Act, the federal government is 
responsible for the application of the five basic principles 
adopted by this House.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I am amazed that we are here today, talking once again about the 
Constitution and whether or not surpluses should go to health 
care, instead of looking together for common solutions to help 
patients who are waiting days and days for a hospital bed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My vision of public service is that people and their concerns 
are much more important than the endless jurisdictional quarrels 
that are the delight of the Bloc, that are its raison d'être, 
that are the reason why these people defending Quebec's 
sovereignty come to Ottawa. They love discussing the 
Constitution and jurisdictional matters, instead of talking 
about— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles-A. Perron:</B> If we relied on people such as you, Quebec 
would not be defended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln:</B> Obviously it still bothers them. They are 
yelling. They yell because it bothers them. All they like to 
discuss about is the Constitution, jurisdictional quarrels, and 
they can talk about that endlessly, day in, day out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet, what concerns us all, wherever we live, and this is the 
fundamental reason why we are in politics, are people and their 
social and economic concerns. Of all areas, none is as important 
as health care. While we are debating this motion in the great 
comfort of this House, the irony is that hundreds of people 
across Canada, whether in Quebec or elsewhere, are waiting on 
stretchers, sometimes for entire days and entire nights, to 
receive medical treatment. This is the reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many patients even wait months before being admitted to a 
hospital. 
Some of them, and newspapers have documented such incidents 
repeatedly, even die while waiting for a chance to be 
hospitalized and to receive some care. Meanwhile, in the great 
comfort of this House, in our nice suits and ties and nice 
dresses, we discuss whether the Constitution should be protected 
for Quebec. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the great comfort of this House are we discussing how the 
federal government and provincial governments alike should give 
us a more effective, more human health care system?  Are we 
discussing how we can get rid of the long lines outside our 
hospitals?  Are we discussing how so many hundreds of patients 
are waiting to reach the hospital, waiting to be served, 
sometimes months at a time? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know.  I have three doctors in my family, two of whom work in 
Quebec. We have a shortage of anaesthetists.  We have a chronic 
shortage of radiologists. Hospital emergency care is in dire 
straits in so many provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are we discussing how we are to better implement the five great 
principles of health care, one of which is reasonable access to 
hospitals? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why this budget will be geared to health care. This is 
why the federal government has decided, because it is the 
overwhelming desire of Canadians, to put jurisdictional quarrels 
aside and say we have to get into matters that affect people 
first and stop the silly quarrels where we spend days on end 
discussing whether this is provincial, that is federal and this 
is municipal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are asking us to quit quarrelling and get together and 
decide together that we will make these systems work better for 
all of us.  This imperative is even louder in the case of 
patients and people who are sick. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are telling us in poll after poll that they are fed up 
with our quarrels and our nonsense.  They are fed up when the 
Bloc Quebecois stands up in the House day in and day out and 
starts talking about the sovereignty of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard the member from Saint-Hyacinthe say a few minutes ago

question of money, that given the money that exists globally in 
the Canadian health care system, if our system was more 
efficient and better organized and controlled, then we would be 
in a position to offer Canadians a much better health care 
system than the one we have now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do we discuss ways to deal with all these problems together, to 
bring about common solutions to crises that call for common 
solutions? No. What do we do? We talk about the Constitution, 
about petty squabbles, once again. And things are not about to 
change because now we do not only have the Bloc Quebecois to 
deal with. We also have the united alternative, which is going 
to  solve all of our problems. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party, completely to the right of the spectrum, that 
believes in a free economy and a double tier system of medicare, 
is joining in with the Bloc Quebecois that wants a sovereign 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How will they sew their mishmash together?  How will they form 
this so-called united alternative? It is really wonderful.  They 
are joining all these motions together.  The Bloc Quebecois 
presents a motion and Reform joins in. Reform presents a motion 
and the Bloc Quebecois joins in. Meanwhile people are waiting for 
solutions.  They are waiting for beds in hospitals.  They are 
waiting for access to hospitals.  They are waiting for the 
federal government to make this truly a health budget.  We will 
do this despite the Bloc Quebecois and the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget will put the accent on health care and it will be a 
positive budget which Canadians will welcome.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Mercier (Terrebonne—Blainville, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I can 
hardly believe what I have just heard. My colleague opposite was 
lamenting the fate of sick people waiting on stretchers. He has 
the gall to do that after his government has made deep cuts in 
transfer payments to the provinces, which had no choice but to 
cut services. He dares to cry over their fate. That takes the 
cake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But that is not what I want to talk about. Let me get back to 
the issue at hand. We are being presented with a motion 
requesting three things. Here is the first one: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House urges the government to respect provincial 
jurisdiction over health care management— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, we want the government to uphold the 
Constitution, which is its sworn duty. Here is the second 
request: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—to increase transfers to the provinces for health care 
unconditionally— 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means the government should restore the level of transfer 
payments to the provinces. With this second point, we are asking 
the federal government to be honest. Here is the third point: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—to avoid using budget surpluses to encroach upon the health care 
field. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With that third point, we are urging the federal government to 
abide by the Constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am flabbergasted that we should even need to move such a 
motion, as if it were not just natural for a government to be 
honest and uphold the Constitution, which is its sworn duty. I 
am surprised that any political party in the House should have 
to move a motion urging the government to be honest and uphold 
the Constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This really takes the cake. I am really anxious to see how our 
motion will fare with members opposite. If they oppose a motion 
urging the government to be honest and uphold the Constitution, 
our system is even more rotten than I thought.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln:</B> Mr. Speaker, our colleague from the Bloc 
Quebecois has as a premise that his motion is true in every 
respect. He takes for granted that the federal government does 
not respect jurisdictions in the area of health, which is 
completely false. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second premise is that the cuts in transfer payments is the 
sole cause of problems affecting health care in Quebec and 
elsewhere in Canada. Reports show that collectively speaking 
there is enough money in all the provinces, including Quebec, to 
have a system which is more efficient than it currently is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The answer is clear. One only has to look at the mess— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Oh, oh! 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have let the hon. member 
speak so I will ask him to keep his cool. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One only has to look at the mess created by Minister Rochon. He 
made such a mess of things that he almost lost his seat. He was 
elected by a very narrow margin. The first thing the premier did 
was to push him aside immediately. If that minister had done 
such a good job, if he had used the money he had to make the 
system efficient, I think he would have kept his job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not the fault of the federal government. Instead of 
being happy that the federal government talks about a budget 
which will put more money in health care, they prefer to conjure 
up another red herring by claiming that the government should 
not invest in health because it is a provincial jurisdiction. 
Money is the only thing they are interested in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We only want the people to know that we will transfer their 
money, the money of the people of British Columbia, Ontario and 
Alberta, who do not benefit from equalization payments but still 
send a lot of money to Quebec on top of what it already spends. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we want is a way to make sure that the equalization money 
transferred to the provinces by the federal government for 
health care will actually be used for health care. It seems 
quite straightforward. If the money is intended for health care, 
I see no reason why the provinces should object.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey—White Rock—Langley, 
Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thought I was immune to the drivel 
coming from the government side, but I cannot believe what I am 
listening to today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What they do not seem to understand is that the problem remains 
the same.  The federal government is using its spending powers to 
get into provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday in debate the Minister of Justice said that we should 
respect our Constitution.  Maybe the Liberals should read it. 
Maybe they would find out that under section 92.7 it is very 
clear that health is a provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They can talk about quibbling over jurisdiction, but it is quite 
clear to me that most of the problems we have had in this country 
were caused by a breakdown in the partnership between the federal 
government and the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Mississauga West talked about working with the 
provinces.  I do not know how to say it politely, but that is a 
pile.  There is no indication that this federal government is 
working with the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Talking with the provinces was another reference made by the 
member for Mississauga West.  The Prime Minister is not talking 
with the premiers, he is talking to the premiers.  He is giving 
them an alternative: “Agree with my position or you don't get 
any money”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It really ticks me off when it is all over an issue of the 
federal government wanting to maintain control over health care. 
It is the problem.  Members across the way are blaming the 
provinces when their government has cut $16.5 billion since 1995. 
Yet they have the audacity to blame the province of Quebec and 
the province of Ontario. 
I do not know how they can possibly think that Canadians are 
going to believe it is somebody else who cut $16.5 billion from 
transfer payments to the provinces.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, the Liberals brought in national health care.  Yes, they 
are responsible for it.  However, at that time they promised 50% 
funding.  What happened?  Now they are funding it at 11%.  It is 
no wonder there is a crisis in this country.  To say that they 
want to be in control of health care is like putting the fox in 
charge of security in the chicken coop. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They want a report card for the provinces.  That is a bloody 
joke.  Here they are— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I know the debate is very lively this 
afternoon and I know the hon. member for South Surrey—White 
Rock—Langley would not want to use words that are at least 
borderline if not downright out of order.  I would encourage her 
to refrain from using that word.  I know it has been ruled out of 
order before and I know it has been allowed on other occasions. 
However, given the temper of the House and the rather 
good-spirited debate that is going on today perhaps she could 
avoid using that word. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith:</B>  I will call it a bleeding joke, Mr. 
Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government cut $16.5 billion out of health care and it 
wants to be in charge.  It gives itself a perfect rating.  It is 
laughable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about the feds wanting to get into big cheque 
policies where they will give the provinces more money if they 
agree to certain conditions, there is another unparliamentary 
word that covers that.  I understand that it is actually a 
criminal conviction.  The Prime Minister is using this threat of 
not receiving billions of dollars to get the premiers to agree to 
his conditions.  It is disgusting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also interesting that part of the agreement is that the 
federal government will get credit for spending the money and 
writing the cheque.  Do these people not realize that it is not 
their money?  It is the taxpayers' money, the people who pay the 
bills.  What difference does it make where the money comes from? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know where they get off saying that money for 
health care is tied to a social union contract.  We had promises 
for months from the minister sitting on the government side that 
there would be money for health care in the budget.  We heard 
that commitment from this government.  Now we hear “It 
depends”.  The government is now saying that the money will only 
be there if the premiers agree to the Prime Minister's conditions 
for a social union contract. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think Canadians want to hear that the Liberals are 
playing with health care dollars.  I do not think Canadians want 
to hear that the federal government is holding these health care 
dollars over the heads of the provinces to get its way. 
Canadians want to hear that this government, as it has been 
saying for months and months, is committed to restoring funding 
to health care.  However, that is not what we are hearing.  What 
we are hearing is that it is conditional on the provinces bowing 
down to the Prime Minister of our country.  Shame on the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government says that opting out cannot be allowed.  I think 
Canadians should take a really good look at what opting out 
means.  We have the example of a province which opted out of a 
pension plan.  That did not split up the country.  It is not an 
issue on the street that there is a Canada pension plan and a 
Quebec pension plan.  I do not think people really care.  What is 
interesting is that the Canada pension plan has over $150 billion 
in unfunded liabilities and the Quebec pension plan has a $70 
billion cash flow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think there is anything wrong with opting out of 
something if the provinces feel they are more able to do it. 
I do not understand why the other provinces do not see this 
opportunity to have the same kind of system as the province of 
Quebec has with its pension plan.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Part of the problem is egos, which politicians in this country 
have.  I do not deny it because I have an ego myself.  The 
government has an ego.  It wants to be the biggest, it wants to 
be in charge, it wants to be seen as being responsible for 
spending the money, but it is putting our country at risk.  It is 
putting the health of our citizens at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot believe that the Prime Minister and his government are 
so small minded that they cannot see the bigger picture.  The 
bigger picture is that in this country we had better find a 
better way of working with our partners.  We had better find a 
more open forum for discussion and debate over jurisdiction, and 
we had better have a better system of listening to what the 
issues really are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As long as we continue the way we are going with the federal 
government holding the heavy hand of dollars over the heads of 
the provinces, with the government making provinces do things 
they would normally not do because they cannot refuse additional 
sources of funding, we will continue to have the same problems 
year after year.  There will be a lack of trust and a lack of 
respect for the other partner.  The partnership will not work. If 
this government cannot see that, then there is something terribly 
wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will go back to a definition of insanity that I have used over 
the past few days.  It is the government thinking, not only on 
this issue but on other issues as well, that it can continue to 
do things the same way again and again and get a different 
result.  It will not look at another way of doing things, nor 
will it respect the Constitution to which it and four provinces 
were signators.  The Constitution clearly outlines federal and 
provincial jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nowhere in that Constitution does it talk about health being a 
shared responsibility.  Nowhere in 1867 was health ever 
considered to be a shared responsibility.  If the federal 
government wants to get into provincial jurisdiction, then it 
should do so with their agreement.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gérard Asselin (Charlevoix, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, first I want 
to congratulate the previous speaker for her excellent speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to take this opportunity to remind the Liberal 
members opposite, who think that members of the Bloc Quebecois 
are here this morning to cry over spilled milk, that 74 Liberal 
members voted for the Constitution in this House in 1982, even 
if it was to the detriment of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also remind them that, in 1993, Quebeckers sent enough Bloc 
members to Ottawa to form the official opposition, even if we 
are sovereignist. The same thing happened again in 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I find the most surprising is that, in 1995, Canadians from 
Vancouver to Montreal came to tell us how much they love us. 
What I hear today is not exactly what those people told us. They 
came to tell us. They came to tell Quebec's members to go on 
because they needed us in Ottawa, since we are the only ones to 
speak for the unemployed and the have-nots and to promote social 
programs. We are the only ones to move motions like the one 
today to protect our health care system and ask the government 
to put money back into social transfers. We are the only ones to 
protect them regarding transfers for education.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the Minister of Finance to rise and tell me what is wrong 
in what I said. The Minister of Finance and member for 
LaSalle—Émard is solely responsible for this situation, which has 
forced ten premiers to come to Ottawa today and get down on 
their knees to the Prime Minister to beg for money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question I want to ask the member— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The member must address his questions and 
comments to the member for South Surrey—White Rock—Langley, who 
made the speech, and not to the Minister of Finance. I invite 
him to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gérard Asselin:</B> Mr. Speaker, my question to the member is the 
following: does she find it normal that the Canadian premiers 
Canada have to come to Ottawa and get down on their knees to the 
Prime Minister to beg for money that is owed to them? That money 
belongs to us; it was taken from us by the federal government. 
We are asking the federal government to give us what is coming 
to us and to trust us with health care management. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for his question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is quite clear how I feel about it, that the federal 
government, the Prime Minister and the finance minister would 
even make funding returned to health care conditional is abhorrent 
to me.  I cannot believe the government which has promised a 
return of funding to health care would use it as tool, would use 
it as a way of forcing the premiers to agree with a position on 
the social union talks.  I cannot say enough how bothered I am 
that it would use this tactic.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Eastern Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr.

community in Canada in her speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With a motion of this nature, with medical concerns and care for 
our aboriginal people across the country would the member believe 
that it should fall under provincial control or under federal 
control? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith:</B>  Mr. Speaker, having worked in an 
aboriginal community for many years it was the provincial 
government that provided health care facilities for that 
community, not the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to think aboriginal communities should be given 
better health care with facilities and services like every other

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I compliment les députés du Bloc québécois pour avoir 
introduit cette motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This situation is felt by members from across the country. All 
constituents will tell them that one of the greatest concerns 
they have is the state of affairs of our health care system. 
Every member in the House knows that and every member wants to 
fix the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where we disagree perhaps is in how we want to do that.  We have 
seen tragically played out under the parliamentary playground 
that exists a system where politics is taking precedence over 
reason and facts and where politics is taking precedence over 
trying to solve the problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this were a petty problem were people's lives were not at 
stake this could continue with very little problem.  The longer 
we wait to fix the problems within our health care system, the 
more Canadians will suffer and die.  Members know this and also 
people in the public know it, sometimes from very personal 
experience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The scope of the problem is massive.  Across the country in 
hospitals, in clinics, in homes and in families we see that 
individuals who require essential health care services are not 
being provided with these services.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give some specific examples.  In emergency rooms, 12 out 
of 14 bays where I have worked will be held up with patients 
waiting to get a bed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of these patients need to get in the intensive care unit. 
Intensive care units have been blocked off because the hospital 
does not have enough money to pay for the nurses and the beds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have patients needing acute care services waiting in a busy 
emergency room for a bed. If a tragedy took place at that time, a 
motor vehicle accident, people would die because the services 
would not be there for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have situations where children are put into the same rooms as 
dying adults.  We have situations where men and women are put 
into large rooms with the only thing separating them being a thin 
sheet.  All these people are sick. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have people being discharged from hospital sick who need to 
be in hospital not because the health care personnel want to 
release them but because they do not have a choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We established that we have a problem with what we are asking 
for in terms of medical care and the resources we have.  The 
government has money to put into health care.  Understandably the 
government wants credit for doing that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my hon. colleague, the health care critic for the Reform 
Party, has mentioned, it serves the public not one advantage to 
have the political turf wars taking place preventing that money 
getting into the hands of the caregivers who desperately need it 
provide for Canadians in their moment of greatest need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a turf war.  It is not only taking place in health care. 
It is taking place in education and in areas across the country 
where problems are not being solved because the feds and the 
provinces cannot get their act together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government is in a unique leadership position.  For 
the first time in recent memory it has an opportunity.  It can 
call together the provincial ministers and their areas of 
jurisdiction to come together and say “what are you guys doing 
and what are we doing?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us make sure the feds do what the feds do best and the 
provinces do what the provinces do best.  Let us have a 
co-ordinated system where the left hand knows what the right hand 
is doing, not what is taking place now where there are so many 
levels of bureaucracy that the left hand does not know what the 
right hand is doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, that system is leading to political inefficiencies 
and therefore inefficiencies in the way we get those services to 
the Canadian public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Money is being sucked out of the management of health care 
instead of getting to patient care in the trenches.  That is a 
profound tragedy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When there is somebody who needs bypass surgery, when there is 
an elderly lady who has been waiting over 12 months and is in 
severe pain, waiting to get a hip replacement, it cannot be said 
to that person that we are doing our job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can only implore, as my colleagues have done from across party 
lines, the federal government to work with and not against the 
provinces in making this happen and also to make sure the 
provinces put the money they will get directly into health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health care is a provincial responsibility.  That is in our 
Constitution.  It does not preclude the government from funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government, we have seen, has taken away money to balance 
its budget.  It has taken money away from health care.  The 
government now has money to put back into health care.  The 
government should do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, we should be making sure that money goes into the 
meat and potatoes, into the muscle and bone of health care. In 
the process of cutting budgets we have cut the fat but we have 
also cut the meat, the muscle and the bone of health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result, we are seeing a very compromised health care 
system.  That is why under our current system people are leaving 
this country, the rich, to get health care elsewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to speak personally and not on behalf of the Reform 
Party.  If we are to solve this problem of limited resources and 
an increasing demand for health care in the future, and it will 
increase as our population ages and medical technology becomes 
more expensive, we have to think out of the box.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a Canada Health Act that was constructed in the 1960s 
and 1970s.  That system was fine under the economic circumstances 
of that era.  In 1999 we have a very different set of 
circumstances and we better realize that.  We need to look at 
other models in other parts of the world such as Australia and in 
certain parts of Norway where they have managed to utilize their 
resources in such a way to ensure that people's needs are being 
met. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This entails getting away from the notion that the Canada Health 
Act has all the answers for us.  Above all else we must ensure 
our health care system will be there for those who need it the 
most, the poor and underprivileged.  They are the ones who are 
being compromised in the system today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By preventing private services from taking place where private 
moneys are exchanged only in the private setting we deprive 
people from getting health care.  Furthermore, we deprive the 
health care system of money without raising taxes.  A private 
system completely independent of the public system where only 
private money is exchanged and no public money put into it would 
enable resources to get into the health care system without 
raising taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this system the rich would be subsidizing the poor.  As it 
stands, people in the poor and middle class who are dependent on 
the public system would have services quicker and in a more 
efficient fashion because more public resources could be poured 
into the public system as individuals went into the private 
system.  That solution benefits the poor and middle class and 
would seek to strengthen a publicly funded health care system 
that desperately needs fixing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not want any kind of system that prevents the poor and 
middle class from getting health care services when they need 
them. The system we have now is preventing the poor and middle 
class from getting health care services when they need them. The 
government is rationing health care services to the public.  We 
have created restrictions preventing people from getting the 
services when they need them, furthermore preventing the system 
from developing so it can be strengthened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we adhere to the current system and do not think we can make 
a made in Canada health care system, we are not only deluding 
ourselves but we are compromising the health and welfare of 
Canadians across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All members, especially in the Reform Party, want to make sure 
we have a strong, publicly funded health care system for 
Canadians in the future.  We are committed to doing that and 
working with whomever else wants to do the same.

was tested, supplementary tested, as did the Americans.  They got 
their vaccine from the same source. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We made sure doctors in the Canadian military approved it.  We 
made sure that Health Canada was very much in the picture and

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
that is a really nice try but I just do not think the minister's 
answer is true for these reasons. He just said that it was tested 
and retested— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Please be very judicious in the way you 
phrase your question, especially with the word true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey:</B>  Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  Yesterday in 
the House the minister said they are fully tested, it is our 
medical people, the doctors, who determine that it is safe to 
give them when they are given. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He just said they were tested and retested but not by Canadian 
doctors. In the scrum yesterday afternoon he said exactly the 
opposite to what he said in here yesterday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did he say that our doctors had tested the vaccine when he 
knew that was not the case? 
<P><A NAME="LINK107"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I said our doctors had approved the use 
of the vaccine and they have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have discussed this matter with them.  They have thoroughly 
gone over this matter with the testing company, an independent 
testing firm hired by the United States department of defence. 
We also had that same company do very thorough testing.  Our 
doctors consulted with it. Health Canada has been part of this 
picture.  They have all been consulted.  They all approved the 
vaccine. 
<P><A NAME="LINK108"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
that same company and manufacturer is in fact being sued by the 
American FDA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister stood in the House in April and said he had taken 
the vaccine himself, the retested version. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health Canada could have approved it but it did not have its 
tests done on it and it should not have approved anything it did 
not test itself, and the minister has admitted this right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister knew the vaccines were stale.  He knew that the 
labels had been tampered with.  He knew that they had not been 
independently tested and he knew that the company was in trouble 
with the FDA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did he order our troops to be human guinea pigs for this 
vaccine? 
<P><A NAME="LINK109"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it was not stale.  The labels were not 
changed.  It was all tested.  It was all found to be safe. I 
visited the HMCS <I>Toronto</I> in Kuwait harbour.  I took the 
vaccine and I have never felt better. 
<P><A NAME="LINK110"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
wish we could be so confident for our Canadian troops. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health Canada may have approved this but Health Canada certainly 
never tested it.  Today we learned that General Kinsman, 
commander of the air force, said he would never have approved 
administering this vaccine if he had known that it had already 
been stale dated and that the stuff was out of date.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The medical profession in the Canadian military has looked at 
this closely.  The United States has also looked at it.  The same

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the

knows full well that not a single Canadian doctor tested one vial 
of vaccine.  He knows that to be true and yet tells the House, 
the Canadian people and our Canadian soldiers rest easy, take 
your chances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The air force general has said he would never have asked for 
that to be administered.  This minister somehow seems to think it 
is okay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I would like to know is does he just make up these stories 
as he goes along or does he just not care that this vaccine is 
harmful?  Has he even asked for a test to see if this vaccine is 
harmful to our Canadian soldiers? 
<P><A NAME="LINK113"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence,

staff, none of us would ever recommend anything that was not safe 
and not effective.  The vaccine was tested very thoroughly at the 
laboratory by an independent company. It was not tested in 
Canada.  We do not make the vaccine in Canada and it is not 
licensed in Canada.  It was tested at the laboratory, the best 
place for it to be done.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday, the Minister of Human Resources Development made 
reference to fraud investigation in order to defend the 
indefensible and justify the quotas on cuts.  How can the 
minister hide behind the investigation of fraud, when the quotas 
for cuts are $612 million, while his Web site indicates that 
frauds and penalties total under $200 million? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are the cuts three times the figure for fraud? 
<P><A NAME="LINK116"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my department is attempting to 
ensure that the program is administered fairly for all 
recipients.  This is our duty to all those who trust us with 
their funds.  It is perfectly normal practice from an 
administrative point of view to administer the funds entrusted 
to us in an equitable manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we are told that there are quotas, that people's jobs 
depend on them, I can tell you that no individual job is linked 
to such practices, that in a department the size of Human 
Resources Development where employees are covered by collective 
agreements, if tasks were reassigned because there was less work 
in a given area, workers would be given other duties within the 
department. 
<P><A NAME="LINK117"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, what 
a lot of words just to cover up reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bottom line is that public servants have been told “If you 
do not cut off enough people, if you do not cut three times more 
than the figure for fraud, you are going to lose your job”. 
That is what has been said, and this makes the public servants 
victims as well because, instead of being there to serve the 
unemployed, they are being made to persecute them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does this minister-author realize this, this man who bemoans the 
fate of the excluded, who champions their cause, but who is 
without a heart? 
<P><A NAME="LINK118"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have enough heart to ensure 
that people, including those who contribute to the fund, are 
protected against abuse, against fraud, against the overpayments 
which occasionally occur because of administrative error, so 
that the money will go to those who need it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But I would point out to the head of the Ottawa branch of the 
Parti Quebecois that he ought to have a look at what is 
happening at the social services department in Quebec, which had 
to recover $100 million, and did recover $112 million, in 
1996-97.  They have the same kind of administrative practices 
over there.

Human Resources Development accused us of defending cheaters. 
However, considering that a knife is put to the throats of the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
my question arises out of the concern many Canadians have about 
the action brought pursuant to article 11 of NAFTA with respect 
to water exports.  My question is for the Minister of Foreign 
Affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the government immediately declare a Canada-wide moratorium 
on the export of bulk freshwater shipments and interbasin 
transfers?  Will the government be bringing in legislation to 
permanently ban bulk freshwater exports and interbasin transfers 
in order to assert Canada's sovereign right to protect, preserve 
and conserve our freshwater resources for future generations? 
<P><A NAME="LINK125"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, there is no question that we are deeply engaged in a 
process to ensure Canadian water resources are protected.  Over 
the past year my colleague, the Minister of the Environment, has 
engaged in a number of discussions with the provinces.  We have 
been in discussion with U.S. authorities on border water issues. 
Once we are able to bring those two separate tracks together we 
will come up with a common policy which I am sure the hon. member 
will support. 
<P><A NAME="LINK126"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, surely the minister sees the danger in allowing this to 
drag on as if it were something NAFTA has some effect on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So I repeat, do the minister and the government not see the 
wisdom of at least immediately bringing in a moratorium on any 
bulk freshwater exports at this time in order that we may make 
absolutely clear our long term intention with respect to this 
issue? 
<P><A NAME="LINK127"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member knows from past debates that the 
issue debated in the House was whether Canada is obliged under 
NAFTA to export water.  Of course it is not.  We now have to 
determine the most effective means and mechanisms for ensuring 
Canada can effectively manage its water resources.  That includes 
the very active involvement of the provinces because within their 
own jurisdictions they have full authority over water resources. 
We want to make sure we do this in full collaboration.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister 
returned to the House at the earliest opportunity and even 
answered a question only moments after the agreement was 
concluded.  I will inquire and report to the House hopefully as 
early as tomorrow about the availability of such a document to be 
tabled in the House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK202"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
my intention was to ask the same question.  It seems that the 
occasion of the Prime Minister and the first ministers having 
reached an agreement would be more than appropriate for the Prime 
Minister or the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs or the 
Minister of Justice or someone either today or tomorrow or early 
next week to make a ministerial statement that would lay out the 
government's rationale for this, to take parliament seriously and 
into the confidence of the government on this and have an 
opportunity for opposition parties to comment.  I cannot think of 
anything more appropriate and respectful of the House of Commons 
than such a process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for the very serious suggestion he has brought to the attention 
of the House.  The time provided for ministerial statements today 
was prior to the time of this request.  The hon. member 
recognized that in the tone of his question.  I will inquire 
about that as well.  I take this very constructive suggestion 
under advisement and will report to the House as early as 
possible.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>HEALTH CANADA 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK205"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, Health 
Canada issued a press release on January 22 announcing a national 
Liberal caucus committee on health priorities initiative. The 
release is on Health Canada letterhead and the contact numbers on 
the release are Health Canada numbers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The use of the resources of the Department of Health by the 
Minister of Health to promote Liberal Party activities is 
contempt of parliament for two reasons.  First, this action 
deliberately ignores and omits the House of Commons to which the 
minister and his department are responsible.  This omission in my 
submission makes a mockery of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, department funds are not meant to be used to promote 
political party activities.  As parliamentarians we are free to 
use our office funds to develop party policy.  We are also free 
to use parliamentary committees and their funds.  Departments are 
free to use their funds to serve the public, their ministers and 
parliament.  With respect to political parties departments have 
absolutely no right to get involved and promote their activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the minister and his department want to use public funds to 
promote and encourage members of parliament to develop policy 
then they ought to do that through parliament by working with the 
Standing Committee on Health.  To deliberately go around the 
parliament to which they are responsible and promote a political 
party activity is wrong.  It makes a mockery of parliament and is 
a contempt of parliament. 
<P><A NAME="LINK206"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
here we go once again on an issue that is very similar in nature 
to other issues that have been brought before you over the past 
five and a half years I have been in this House.  I can refer to 
the many times we have stood in the House and talked about 
ministers making announcements outside of the House with no 
consideration given to this side or in many cases even to the 
government side. Statements have been made through press releases 
in other countries when the House of Commons had not even dealt 
with the issue.  We recently referred one of those cases to the 
board of internal economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rights of members in the House are being ignored on a 
consistent basis.  I watched the Prime Minister come in today and 
make an announcement that is critical to our country.  Yet 
members of the House are virtually not part of it, as was 
mentioned earlier.  Now we see a minister's department working 
with the Liberal caucus making press announcements. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1510"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT62"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask that Mr. Speaker take all this in the larger context 
this time and perhaps look at the possibility of a legislative 
committee or some other process that actually steps aside and 
looks at the rights and privileges of members of parliament and 
how they are in effect being eroded by ministers, and even now 
the Prime Minister, completely ignoring us in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will only get worse.  We can step up the heat on this and 
make things bad for the other side I suppose but it is time now 
that Mr. Speaker looked at this on a global basis and maybe took 
another approach to it and set some better standards in the House 
so as not to degradate what we have here. 
<P><A NAME="LINK207"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
believe this is a point of privilege, particularly in the case of 
our health critic who opened this issue up. He is currently 
taking part in a Reform caucus task force on health care.  He is 
spearheading that attempt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To read from the original health department's announcement, if 
our health critic's name were inserted it could be said that the 
Health Minister today announced that the national Reform caucus, 
chaired by a person from our caucus, has been asked to look at 
options for enhancing the government's tobacco public education 
initiatives, something he is working on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform committee will canvass the views of Canadians for 
strategies to address youth smoking.  The Reform caucus committee 
he is chairing is looking into the entire potential reform of the 
health system in Canada.  That news release with just a few name 
changes would be a great one for the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the privilege end of it, if we allow the department to 
promote the Liberal caucus not only through its news release but 
through its telephone numbers and through its website then at the 
very least it should be promoting each of the parties in the 
House, giving their views and visions of health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It cannot be that one caucus gets to use departmental assets and 
the rest of us will read what the Liberals do and just be out of 
luck.  The department of course should promote its vision of 
Canada, what is happening, the programs for youth and all that 
stuff.  But it should not be promoting one political party in 
this place.  That is what has happened with this news release. 
The privileges of our health critic have been compromised. The 
department cannot select one political party only to receive an 
endorsation and publicity and the resources of the department. 
That is not right and it contravenes privileges of the rest of 
us. 
<P><A NAME="LINK208"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Glengarry—Prescott—Russell, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have not had an opportunity to see a copy of this 
document and because I had not been warned ahead of time 
unfortunately it is not possible for me to have the Minister of 
Health comment on it.  I am sorry about that and I am sure that 
once the document in question is made available to the Minister 
of Health he will want to respond. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is a document of a department which somehow is seen as 
supporting a task force of members of parliament of a particular 
political party, that is a political question which could be the 
subject of something asked at question period.  In other words, 
the opposition member could be, if that is true, entitled to ask 
did the minister do something correct or incorrect and so on. 
That is a political question, not necessarily an issue of 
privilege.  That is a different story all together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said, neither I nor the minister in question, because 
I am sure he would have told me, was made aware that this 
question was to be raised today. I am sure the minister will want 
to respond to this at some point.

considered in this point. I have asked, when possible, that it is 
always better to make announcements in the House rather than 
outside.  In this case, if I heard the member correctly, he 
mentioned this statement was released on January 22.  The House 
was not sitting at that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Matters of privilege should be raised as soon as possible.  I 
urge all hon. members to do that, especially that we have been 
sitting for four days and this is the first time it has come up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He raises another point which does interest the Chair and I 
believe will interest the House.  I would like the hon. member to 
submit to the table the document he has with regard to this 
issue.  I would like to hold a decision on my part in abeyance. I 
would like to satisfy myself with some of the information 
referred to in the document and the substance of what is in those 
speeches. I will come back to the House if necessary.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbinière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to rise today to pay tribute to Mr. James Baskin, a former 
member of the House, who died on January 8 at the age of 79.  He 
sat in the House from 1957 to 1963. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was seen as a populist who defended the interests of his 
community.  Although he held office for only seven years, Mr. 
Baskin had to face the constituents of Renfrew-South on three 
occasions and served under Progressive Conservative Prime 
Minister John Diefenbaker in two minority governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was first elected in 1957 and re-elected in 1958 in the 
Progressive Conservative landslide that sent John Diefenbaker 
and his team back to power with a strong majority.  He was again 
elected in 1962, only to lose his seat when Lester B. Pearson 
won the 1963 election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This businessman turned politician, who came from a small town 
near Peterborough, was an energetic politician close to the 
people and attuned to his constituents' needs.  Mr. Baskin's 
second passion in life, after politics, was horses.  He was one 
of those responsible for the construction of the Rideau Carleton 
Raceway here in Ottawa.  That was not all this former 
Progressive Conservative member did.  He also bought the Carling 
Avenue Bar, which became a watering hole for regional 
politicians.

on behalf of myself and my colleagues in the NDP I would like to 
join with others who have spoken in tribute to the late Mr. James 
Baskin, a former member of this House, who served from 1957 to 
1963 and certainly had the privilege of one who was involved in 
politics and service in this House in a very interesting time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I notice from what I have been able to read about Mr. Baskin 
since his death that he was the kind of person I would like to 
have known.  I did not know him and very few of us here would 
know him, given that it was so long ago that he served in this 
place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously people who did not know him as colleagues in the House 
of Commons but who come from the area he lived and worked in as a 
member of parliament and as a businessman think very highly of 
him.  I certainly regret that I did not have the privilege of 
knowing him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We pay tribute to his career in the House and to the quality of 
his life and the obvious good impression he made on many people. 
We join with others in extending our sincere condolences to his 
family.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I believe the 
motion we have introduced today is still timely, even if we have 
just learned that the government is ready to spend money—we still 
do not know the exact amount—on the provinces' health care 
systems through transfer payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know from a reliable source that the financing could reach 
$2.5 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion we introduced asked for the unconditional restoration 
of transfer payments to the 1993-94 level when the Liberal 
government was elected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know that, in 1993-94, transfer payments amounted to $18.8 
billion. Those payments were brought back to $11 billion, 
following enormous pressure from opposition parties and from all 
stakeholders, even the National Forum on Health. The government 
allegedly did us a favour by reinvesting money in the 
administration of the provinces' health care systems, but this 
is no favour. Initially, the government was supposed to cut $49 
billion over the next five years, but that amount was reduced to 
$42 billion. The federal government has done us no favour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government now tells us that it will spend $2.5 billion. In 
Quebec's case, this means that funding will be cut by $1 billion 
a year— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I am sorry to interrupt 
the hon. member, but does he have a question for the hon. member 
for Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms Pauline Picard:</B> Mr. Speaker, do I not have a choice between 
asking a question and making a comment? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sorry but I only remember the gist of the hon. member's 
speech. That is why I wanted to make a comment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> Very well, but the member's 
time is over. The member for Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca may give a 
short response. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member from the 
Bloc Quebecois. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have an enormous opportunity to take a leadership role in 
something that has never been done before, something that the 
Minister of Human Resources Development, something that the 
Minister of Health and the Minister of Justice can participate 
in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If these ministers were to get their colleagues in the 
provincial government to come together at one point to deal with 
the precursors affecting the health care of Canadians, the work 
that has been done by members across the way such as the member 
from Moncton who played a leadership role would address the 
precursors of conflict by dealing with children in the first 
eight years of life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can use the available data in a utilized program based on 
previous experience around the world that has demonstrated 
profound impacts upon poverty, upon teen pregnancies, upon 
keeping kids in school longer, and upon the health and welfare of 
children.  It will only happen if the federal government takes a 
leadership role.  It will only happen if the federal ministers 
call their provincial counterparts together anywhere in the 
country to form an integrated approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This would have the most profound cost saving and humanitarian 
effect on children based on facts and on existing programs and 
would save the lives of a lot of people.  It is rooted in 
preventing these problems rather than managing them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of my colleagues and I would be very happy to work with 
members on the other side to make this a reality. The head start 
program exemplifies a program which can and should be employed 
across the country using existing resources.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Claudette Bradshaw (Moncton—Riverview—Dieppe, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will share my time with the member for Winnipeg 
South. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very pleased to take part in today's debate. This dialogue 
is very timely. The member for Laurier—Sainte-Marie gave his views 
on the health care debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In line with the traditional thinking of his party, he is asking 
our government to pretend it has no role to play in the health 
care field. He himself has decided that the federal government 
could not contribute to improving the health of Canadians in any 
way other than simply signing cheques. He is mistaken. 
The fact is, today the Prime Minister is meeting with his 
provincial and territorial counterparts to look at the social 
union issue. Indeed reality is quite different from what the 
member perceives it to be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Governments know Canadians expect their elected representatives 
to co-operate. They expect them to present a common front on 
issues related to the health and the social well-being of 
Canadians. Today the first ministers' concern is to find the 
best way to translate their common commitment into action. If 
there is a single issue that demands a common commitment, it is 
indeed health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Contrary to the figments of the Bloc Quebecois' imagination, in 
the real world, federal, provincial and territorial governments 
carry on their respective roles in health care while working 
together to deal with issues demanding co-ordination and 
leadership at the national level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To make it easier for my colleagues in the opposition to 
understand the situation, I should probably name some concrete 
measures in the health care field and remind them of 
intergovernmental co-operation in this area. As we all know, the 
provinces and territories are responsible for providing day to 
day health care to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This level of government plans its own health care delivery and 
decides, usually in co-operation with physicians, which services 
and procedures will be covered by provincial health insurance 
plan. 
It sets its priorities, draws up its budgets and negotiates on a 
wide range of issues with hospitals, physicians, nurses and 
other stakeholders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What role is left for the federal government? We all know the 
position of the Bloc Quebecois, but let us take a look at 
reality. The federal government has very clear responsibilities 
in the area of health. And I am not talking about interference 
in areas of provincial jurisdiction that is recent or that is 
forthcoming. I am talking about responsibilities that go back to 
Confederation and that are enshrined in our Constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take health programs for First Nations and for the Inuit 
for example. The federal government has a clear responsibility 
to provide health services to the status Indians who live on 
reserves and to the Inuit. 
It provides health products and services to those groups and to 
other eligible individuals. Is that done entirely outside the 
provincial framework that provides health services to the rest 
of the population? Of course not. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, the federal government works closely with its 
provincial and territorial partners.  Programs and services are 
integrated as much as possible to ensure the greatest 
effectiveness.  Effectiveness both at the health outcome and the 
use of health care resources depends on a knowledge base that is 
constantly being renewed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the reality of the federal role in health 
research.  That reality is one of a very clear acceptance of the 
respective roles of both orders of government and a very long 
history of co-operation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the most soundly conceived provincial research programs 
in the country is the Fonds de la recherche en santé du Québec. 
It was designed from the ground up to complement the Medical 
Research Council of Canada and Health Canada's national health 
research and development program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec's program focuses its investment on the development of 
competitive expertise enabling Quebec researchers to compete 
successfully for federal research grants. 
It works and it works to everyone's advantage.

<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another example is the needs of children from low income 
families. The community action program for children and the 
Canada prenatal nutrition program actively support local 
initiatives. These initiatives benefit parents, young children 
and pregnant women who could give birth to underweight babies. 
Are these examples of federal interference, as the Bloc thinks 
they are? Of course not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These initiatives provide financial assistance for community 
programs and for partnerships with provinces, territories and 
other interested groups. 
They are the concrete manifestations of the type of co-operation 
Canadians expect from their governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1957, the federal government has provided funds to the 
provinces and territories to support health insurance, through a 
variety of mechanisms over the years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, as we know, the mechanism is the Canada health and social 
transfer.  Contrary to what the Bloc thinks, however, this 
transfer is not just a cheque sent from Ottawa to the provincial 
capitals.  These funds continue to be governed by the Canada 
Health Act.  Underlying them are a broad range of principles 
which protect the rights of Canadians as far as health care is 
concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to remind all hon. members that parliament passed 
the Canada Health Act in 1984, with the support of all political 
parties.  The principles listed in this act were supported by 
all parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first principle is accessibility.  Canadians can count on 
reasonable access to medically required care and services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second is comprehensiveness.  Canadians are entitled to 
payment of all medically required services provided by 
physicians and hospitals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third principle is universality.  All inhabitants of a 
province or territory are entitled to services, regardless of 
external factors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fourth principle is portability.  Canadians are entitled to 
health care regardless of where in Canada they happened to be 
when they become ill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the fifth principle is public administration, which 
ensures that only public bodies may administer our health 
insurance program within a not-for-profit context. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada Health Act has laid down the basic rules for our 
health insurance program, but we must not be so naive as to 
believe that harmonization means that there is a single highly 
rigid system administered by the federal government.  The act 
provides the provinces and territories with great flexibility. 
It is not a straitjacket. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It says that a province or territory wishing assistance from the 
federal government must comply with the five principles in the 
system it chooses.  However, the provinces are free to decide 
how they will provide health care to their citizens. 
<P><A NAME="LINK224"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia—Matane, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
to my colleague, and one would think that everything in the area 
of health care has been fine in Canada for the past five years. 
Cuts of $6 billion and more have been made annually and 
hospitals are closed.  The sick are waiting everywhere in 
Canada, not just in Quebec, and things are very difficult. 
Nurses are exhausted, and yet the member says things are fine.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sorry, but in Quebec, as elsewhere, we are living a drama, 
if not a tragedy.  The federal government's cuts were 
unreasonable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, the 10 provinces have just signed an agreement, and the 
Prime Minister is puffing out his chest and saying “We are 
generous”.  Busting one's britches is not generosity, or 
recognition, it is simply indecency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Coderre:</B> Does that hurt you? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Canuel:</B> Yes it does, and it hurts the nurses 
especially. 
It hurts my fellow citizens who are sick and have to wait 
because of government cuts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, all the members on the other side were busy 
congratulating themselves, including the members from Quebec.  A 
year or two ago, they closed their eyes.  I was ready to vote 
zero in my riding.  There are other things besides a zero 
deficit.  We should manage a vote for zero in Canada, but we 
would not have the courage to hold it.  My colleagues on the 
other side would not have the courage to support me on that. 
Given that there are 1.5 million children not properly fed and 
there are children in my riding who go without supper, that 
hurts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the minister if she has some compassion in the area 
of health, and for children who do not get enough to eat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Claudette Bradshaw:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am familiar with the 
health issue and with child poverty as well. I joined the 
Liberal Party because I knew that, as a government, having put 
its fiscal house in order by eliminating the $43 billion 
deficit, it would immediately start investing in health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, the second budget to be brought down by this federal 
government after its fiscal house has been put in order will be 
a health budget. I am proud to be on the Liberal team. We hear 
our colleagues from the Bloc Quebecois talk about unemployment. 
We will be dealing with health, and the federal government will 
be looking after the needs of Canadians in this area.

<P><A NAME="LINK225"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
this is a very important day for Canada as a result of the 
agreements that were reached a couple of hours ago and on which I 
will be providing a bit of detail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion put forward by the opposition today reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House urges the government to respect provincial 
jurisdiction over health care management, to increase transfers 
to the provinces for health care unconditionally, and to avoid 
using budget surpluses to encroach upon the health care field. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have had enough.  They have had quite enough 
finger-pointing, fed-bashing and arguing about CHST and block 
funding.  Canadians care about their health care system. 
Canadians care about a sustainable, secure, quality health care 
system to meet the needs of our families.

<A HREF="#LINKT70"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Constitution of our country prescribes that the primary 
responsibility for the delivery of health care is that of the 
provinces and the territories.  That is not in dispute.  They 
have to plan, manage and administer health care.  The federal 
government by law is responsible for the promotion and 
preservation of the health care of all Canadians and for setting 
national policies and standards.  The federal government by the 
Constitution and by our laws cannot interfere with provincial 
responsibilities under the Constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite all the rhetoric Canadians have had enough.  Our laws 
are clear.  The division of responsibilities is clear and indeed 
there are some guidelines.  It is not just one or another level 
of government that is a player in health care.  The federal, 
provincial and territorial governments have certain 
responsibilities to the extent that some overlap. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Back in 1984 when we had some difficulties in the country with 
regard to user fees and extra billing it was necessary for us to 
address them.  They were causing some concern about whether or 
not our not for profit, accessible, portable, universal, 
comprehensive health care system was suddenly being dismantled 
and becoming a two tier health care system where those who had 
money were able to get the services they wanted and needed at the 
expense of pushing back others and taking away resources 
available to Canadians at large. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then the Canada Health Act came in and the federal government 
has responsibility to enforce national standards through the 
Canada Health Act.  There are five national standards: reasonable 
access to all medically necessary services, a comprehensive 
health care system, universality for all provincial residents, 
portability throughout Canada, and publicly administered on a not 
for profit basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians value our health care system because not only is it an 
international model but it has worked for Canadians.  It has 
worked for us because it provides all Canadians with the security 
of a quality health care system.  We want to maintain that health 
care system for other reasons as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most Canadians will say that the health care system is one of 
the most powerful unifying factors in our country.  It is our 
common bond of association.  It is what provides us with the 
security of knowing it is there for all Canadians regardless of 
their means, that health care is there not because one has money 
but because one is sick and needs health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These important principles have been reaffirmed.  Today we have 
seen an extraordinary accomplishment in terms of federal, 
provincial and territorial co-operation and partnership.  We have 
decided today to stop the bickering.  All 10 provinces and 
territories are signatories including Quebec.  The Premier of 
Quebec signed this health agreement because it is important for 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a very powerful message to Canadians knowing that there is 
unanimity among the provinces, territories and the federal 
government.  They have reached an accord that will ensure 
Canadians will not continue to hear the rhetoric and see the 
finger pointing of the past.  They will hear about the 
co-operative plans in terms of how all levels will work together 
to continue to support our health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have just received the framework of these talks.  One of the 
most important elements is the dispute avoidance and resolution 
provision. 
This is the crux of the issue.   Earlier today when working on my 
speech I had ample evidence to show finger-pointing and arguments 
based on insufficient or incorrect information.  These are the 
kinds of things that were driving Canadians to be frustrated by 
what was going on.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not raise those arguments.  It is time to put them away. 
It is time to stop talking about federal-provincial bickering. It 
is time to start talking about the important things in Canada, 
the important things in our health care system like prenatal 
nutrition; the problem of FAS, fetal alcohol syndrome and fetal 
alcohol effects; early childhood development issues; the aged; 
and the people with diseases and medically necessary illnesses 
that we have to address.  Canadians should have the comfort level 
that these issues will be addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my remaining time I will review a few of the elements of the 
dispute avoidance and resolution provisions of the historic 
agreement that was reached today.  I believe it should give 
Canadians the assurance that we will never go back to bickering 
about who is responsible.  There will be an accountability 
mechanism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The governments are now committed to working collaboratively to 
avoid and resolve intergovernmental disputes respecting existing 
legislative provisions and mechanisms to avoid and resolve 
disputes.  Their mechanism will be simple, timely, efficient, 
effective and transparent.  It will allow flexibility for the 
governments to resolve disputes in a non-adversarial way, which 
is important to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The governments are committed to working together and avoiding 
disputes through information sharing, joint planning, 
collaboration, advance notice, early consultation and flexibility 
in implementation.  There will be sectoral negotiations to 
resolve disputes based on fact finding.  It will be a public fact 
finding issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If issues should arise where there is some question on whether 
or not funding was applied in the areas agreed or whether the 
parties did what they were to do, there will be a public fact 
finding process to ensure that whatever occurred will be known by 
all parties.  That is very important.  It will ensure and put the 
onus on all parties to do their share because it will be a public 
accountability process for all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debate we are having today is important but not in terms of 
federal-provincial bickering. Today we should celebrate the fact 
that Canadians can rest assured that moneys will be made 
available to protect Canada's health care system from coast to 
coast to coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We congratulate the Minister of Health, the Minister of Justice 
and the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs for their work on 
behalf of the federal government to achieve this health accord 
and the social union contract which was settled today.  We thank 
them not only on behalf of the members of this place but 
appropriately on behalf of all Canadians.

that is going on with the federal government, and that is 
sovereignty for Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us have a sovereign Quebec, with full powers in health, 
education, welfare and all the problems will be resolved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I see my colleague opposite boasting about this agreement 
today, when we are only getting what was ours to begin with, 
this is not a gift. Since 1993, we have sustained massive cuts. 
This government has yielded to pressure from the public and all 
the provinces. At least it has had the courage to put a little 
money back into health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the social union, I would like to ask the hon. 
member to pledge that his government will never interfere in 
health, education and social programs again. The reason for this 
request is that Quebec could not be a part of this social union 
because the document put forward by the Prime Minister of Canada

that Canada is unified on the importance of our health care 
system to all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second matter the member made a query about was with regard 
to dollars.  Possibly when the member sees the press conference 
that was given some two hours ago and reads the reports he will 
find out that the premiers had the best meeting they have ever 
had with the Prime Minister.  They agreed upon dollar commitments 
and timeframes and they are unified in their position to defend 
our health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, about interfering in health, the member will well know 
that the federal government has a role to play in enforcing 
national standards.  The transfer of any moneys from the federal 
government under the laws of Canada are only to be applied for 
hospitals and for physician services on the ratio of two-thirds 
to one-third.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the hon. member agree that Quebec was not only deprived of 
money that it should have received, but that it is totally 
unacceptable for the federal government to get involved in 
health? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the hon. member send me, through you Mr. Speaker, 
the part of the Canadian Constitution where it says that the 
federal government has the power to do that? I would appreciate 
it if he could show me where it is provided in the Canadian 
Constitution that the federal government can get involved in the 
health sector. Have him send us a copy of the Constitution

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the simple fact is that the 
premier of Quebec on behalf of all of the people of Quebec 
entered into and signed the agreement today supporting, along 
with all of the provinces and territories, the principles of that 
health accord. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question about the interference matter raised.  The 
premier is not concerned about interference.  The premier 
understands that the roles of the provincial governments and the 
federal government are established under our Constitution and 
that the Canada Health Act prescribes the role of the federal 
government in terms of national standards and national policies 
in protecting the principles of the Canada Health Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec is in.  Get used to it.

<P><A NAME="LINK228"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Hélène Alarie (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the provinces 
have had exclusive jurisdiction and authority over health since 
the 1867 Constitution Act was passed, leaving the federal 
government with the responsibility to legislate in the areas of 
food and drugs, criminal law, quarantine and marine hospitals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provinces have been vested with the legislative powers 
relating to hospitals, the medical profession and the practice 
of medicine, including costs and effectiveness, the nature of 
the health care system and the privatization of medical 
services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet, even though the Constitution Act, 1867 is clear on this, 
particularly sections 92(7), (13) and (16), the federal lawmaker 
has been using its inherent spending power to set national 
standards for provincial medicare programs. 
It is thus imperative to limit this federal spending power, 
hence today's motion: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House urges the government to respect provincial 
jurisdiction over health care management, to increase transfers 
to the provinces for health care unconditionally, and to avoid 
using budget surpluses to encroach upon the health care field. 
</UL>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the premiers at the meeting in Saskatoon last August called 
on the federal government to restore the transfer payments it 
had taken for itself since 1994 so that they could do something 
about the widespread needs making themselves felt in the health 
care system.  They called for $6.3 billion, of which $1.8 
billion, and therefore over $1 billion for health alone, is 
Quebec's share. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has now balanced its budget and is even 
getting ready to build up a huge surplus estimated at between 
$12 billion and $15 billion, largely through provincial cuts, to 
health in particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the beginning, the Bloc Quebecois has been fighting to have 
the money cut from Quebec's transfer payments restored. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, all the premiers were told that they would get back a 
small portion of what they were asking for to help them with 
health care costs.  This is a far cry from the initial demand of 
last August, but we are running out of steam and have agreed to 
accept this paltry amount, which is our due, because it has been 
offered without any conditions, and Quebec has defended the 
interests of Quebeckers well on this score.  It will be in a 
better position than anyone else to know which parts of its 
health care system are most in need of funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would now like to go back to the federal government's 
interference in provincial affairs, because the Constitution 
Act, 1867, clearly sets out which are federal and which are 
provincial areas of jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government is returning to the provinces only part 
of the billions it cut but, in its constant quest for 
visibility, apparently has millions to spend on new programs, 
such as a national home care program. 
The Liberal government is denying the provinces the right to opt 
out with full financial compensation for home care. This is a 
bit like what is happening with the millennium scholarships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But there is more: in its 1997 budget, the federal government 
announced that it would spend $150 million over three years on 
the health services adjustment fund to help the provinces set up 
pilot projects to provide home care or pharmacare, even though 
Quebec, well ahead in this area as in many others, already has 
its own programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the Constitution prevents the Liberal government from 
opening federal CLSCs in Quebec, it goes through the back door 
so it can interfere in areas under provincial jurisdiction, as 
it did in education with the millennium scholarships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, the health minister is going to spend $50 million over 
three years to set up a national health information system, as 
planned in the 1997 budget, and $100 million over three years to 
improve two existing programs: the community action program for 
children and the Canada prenatal nutrition program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it going to offer the right to opt out with full compensation 
to the provinces that do not want those programs? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, on June 18, the federal government renewed its 
commitment to the fight against breast cancer. The renewed 
federal contribution is set at $45 million for the first five 
years. The Minister of Health announced that the Canadian breast 
cancer initiative would be renewed and enjoy stable, ongoing 
funding of $7 million per year, as well as a whole series of 
measures in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the breast cancer initiative of the federal government 
is duplicating Quebec's cancer control program that the former 
health minister, Mr. Rochon, and the president of the cancer 
advisory council made public last April. This innovative tool 
will be used throughout the province of Quebec and has become 
Quebec's cancer control program, whose theme is it takes a team 
to beat cancer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through its spending power, the federal government is getting 
involved in cancer control, which demonstrates once again that 
the Liberal government always finds money to duplicate the work 
of the provinces. And what about the national report card the 
health minister has announced?

<A HREF="#LINKT74"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, the minister seems to forget that, since the provinces 
manage health care services, they are in the best position to 
know what the health care situation is in their respective 
jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, we urge the federal government not to use this annual report 
to penalize the provinces that do not want any part in it. Will 
we have the right to opt out? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our political party will always defend the interests of Quebec. 
It seems to me that all the other Canadian provinces are not 
close to their people, since they are willing to accept the 
central government's interference in their area of jurisdiction. 
The health issue should have been an eye-opener. But what if it 
were a question of pride? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To be proud, one has to identify with one's people, which is 
quite easy for Quebeckers. 
<P><A NAME="LINK229"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
take part in this debate, which I had the opportunity to do on 
several occasions today. Since the hon. member gave such a well 
thought out speech, I would like to convey my concerns to her. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unless one is extremely doctrinaire, it is always possible to 
agree on a question of principle. The member just said that the 
Bloc Quebecois will defend the interests of Quebec. I am 
beginning to make a distinction between defending the interests 
of the Government of Quebec and defending the interests of 
citizens, in particular those I represent and the interests of 
outlying areas of Quebec, which an overwhelming majority of Bloc 
Quebecois members, people of quality, do defend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My concern is that when there are requests for transfers for 
health, for instance, my past experiences in other areas make me 
wonder a little. 
For instance, in areas like employment where there have been 
massive transfers, the effects are still not felt in various 
regions in Quebec. There is almost no programming left relating 
to employment activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem we deal with in our region is also present 
elsewhere. If health funds are transferred to the Government of 
Quebec, I would like assurance from the hon. member that those 
funds will be distributed equitably among the various regions of 
Quebec. Based on the statistics, the region of 
Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean, among others, has a very serious 
deficit compared to other regions in Quebec, namely central 
regions like the Montreal area. The accumulated deficit is about 
$75 million. That explains why we face such serious problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my region, we are no longer able to provide good quality 
health care to our citizens. 
There is cause for major concern when the population of a region 
can no longer obtain health care. Health care is a priority. We 
have to defend our fellow citizens on practical issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with transfers to Quebec, but what concerns me is the 
way the Government of Quebec will transfer the money to regions. 
This is the concern I wanted to raise during this debate. I am 
grateful to my colleague from the Bloc Quebecois for having 
introduced this motion in the House and I hope that this will 
contribute to improving the way Quebec transfers funds to 
regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Hélène Alarie:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think the hon. member is 
hinting at interference in his question, since, once the funds 
have been transferred to the provinces, it is their job to 
manage and administer the money. I think the whole of Quebec is 
on the leading edge in several programs such as medicare, 
pharmacare and health care in local community service centres. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> They are closing down hospitals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Hélène Alarie:</B> As someone back there said, they are closing 
down hospitals. They are reorganizing, because provinces have 
suffered drastic cuts for many years. One cannot help but feel 
it when the health budget is cut by $1 billion a year in a 
province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we would have been poor managers if we had not been 
careful to manage in the best way possible the little money we 
had left. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I represent a city riding, but I come from the Lower St. 
Lawrence, a region even more remote than the region represented 
by the hon. member for Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean. We will not argue 
about the regions. There too, there were organizational problems 
in health. 
Still, I think every region in Quebec has been well served with 
what we had at our disposal.

have been made for to the transfer of funds to provinces. So, 
every province knows its own needs, glaring needs. We are 
reminded of them every day and they will be met, I am sure of 
that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK230"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to take part in this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I too would like to say a few words to the member for 
Chicoutimi, who just spoke, even though the member for 
Louis-Hébert has responded very well to his comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to remind my colleague from Chicoutimi of the words 
spoken by his former leader, who is now leader of the Quebec 
Liberal Party. On May 7, 1997, he said, and I quote from <I>Le 
Devoir</I> “Forget Lucien Bouchard and Jean Rochon; the person who 
is really responsible for hospital closures and the 
deterioration of our health care system is—”. I cannot mention 
his name in this House, but he is the present Prime Minister of 
Canada. Those were the words of the former leader, of my 
colleague for Chicoutime, and I think he still has respect for 
him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Jean Charest went on to say: “Mr. Bouchard, Mr. Harris, Mr. 
Filmon, Mr. Klein and all the other premiers are forced to 
manage the federal government's unilateral cuts”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the member said about the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean region may 
be true. It is true that cuts were made everywhere. He also said 
that it is a matter of transfers, but I think—and I am sure he 
will agree—it is an issue that should be discussed in the 
Quebec National Assembly. I wanted to remind him that the cuts 
were decided upon there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, the federal government agreed to give back some of the 
transfer payments, but apparently the amount given back does not 
even come close to what was taken away. Since 1994, the Liberal 
government slashed transfer payments to the provinces for 
health, education and welfare by $6.3 billion a year. If we 
split that amount among the three areas, it means $1 billion a 
year for Quebec alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will see the figures within hours or days, but we are far 
from the final count.  One step has, however, been made in the 
right direction, or in other words a small step back toward the 
way things used to be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Transfers to the provinces are at their lowest level—pending 
adjustment—in 20 years.  Cash social transfers from the federal 
government are today where they were 15 years ago, or in other 
words $12.5 billion.  At the time of the federal election in 
1993, the level was $18.8 billion.  This means a unilateral 
reduction of $6.3 billion yearly, or 33% in less than 4 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Taking population growth and the cost of living increase into 
account, social transfers have not been this low for decades. 
That is why I say that, in 1996, social transfers amounted to 
$386 per head.  That figure is 45% lower than the 1985 record 
level of $706, and 43% lower than the 1994 level of $678. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An illustration of the concrete meaning of $1 billion to Quebec 
is necessary here.  One billion dollars is 20% of the cost of 
all Quebec hospitals.  It means closure of half the hospitals in 
the Montreal region.  It is the cost of 370,000 
hospitalizations.  It is the pay of half of the nurses in 
Quebec.   It is the cost of all of Quebec's CLSCs, which is $924 
million.  It is twice the cost of all services to youth, which 
is $500 million.  It is a sizeable amount.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that a number of members are making reference, but I 
would like to speak of the impact that will have on the Quebec 
City and Chaudière—Appalaches regions.  I may be using the same 
figures my colleague from Lotbinière will be citing shortly, 
but, for example, the cuts amount to $103 million for the 
Robert-Giffard hospital.  They represent $76.4 million for 
Quebec City's Hôtel-Dieu hospital; $12.3 million for the 
Saint-Joseph-de-la-Malbaie hospital; $72.1 million for the Laval 
University hospital; $29.5 million for the Charlevoix hospital; 
$54.2 million for the Saint-Sacrement hospital; $66.4 for the 
Laval hospital and 
$71.7 million for the Saint-Fançois-d'Assise hospital. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other side of the river, in the beautiful region of 
Chaudière-Appalaches, there are a few examples.  There will be a 
shortfall of $63.7 million for the Lévis Hôtel-Dieu hospital; 
$31 million for the Amiante region hospital; $14.7 million for 
the Montmagny Hôtel-Dieu hospital and $30.1 million for the 
Beauce-Etchemin hospital.  That is a lot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Often, when billions of dollars are bandied about people do not 
understand the whole impact, but I know that people currently 
working in the hospitals—the doctors, nurses, technicians, 
those looking after the patients—realize what the cuts mean in 
day to day terms and have known this for a number of years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On this opposition day, the motion put forward by the Bloc 
Quebecois is basically asking that transfer payments to the 
provinces be restored. I take this opportunity to commend the 
hon. member for Drummond, who has been our health critic since 
the 1993 election. I am qualified to do so, especially since I 
worked with her for 18 months before being reassigned to 
industry and regional development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Time and time again I witnessed attempts by the federal 
government and the health department to interfere, not only 
through the funding cuts we are condemning today, but also with 
unacceptable bills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will recall for example Bill C-47 on new reproductive 
technologies. We could mention other areas and the broad area of 
health, with bills like C-14 on drinking water. 
We all know what happened on the hepatitis C issue. I think it is 
good to remind the House of the facts. At the insistence of the 
hon. member for Drummond and Bloc Quebecois members, settlements 
were made, although they are still incomplete. As we know, those 
infected before 1986 are not eligible for compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the health committee, the hon. member for Drummond and myself 
could see this sort of thing happening almost on a weekly basis. 
And it went on. There was this foundation that funds health 
research, to which payments were made directly, but efforts are 
made to go over the heads of provincial governments and deal 
directly with universities and even private scholars. As I said, 
this is still going on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been attending every meeting of the Standing Committee on 
Industry and, because some proceedings are held in camera, I am 
not at liberty to mention specific issues; a report is to be 
tabled on Monday. 
In recent days, we saw all the attempts made by the federal 
government to invade the health sector, allegedly to protect the 
interests and health of all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why I think the Bloc Quebecois did a good thing today. 
Its motion came at a most appropriate time, when the premiers 
and the Prime Minister are negotiating on this issue and others, 
including social union. Indeed, an agreement was reached 
regarding the recovery of part of the transfers. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1625"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT77"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of social union was also discussed. An agreement was 
reached to recover transfers. It is still acceptable for health, 
and I know that my colleagues discussed this issue, but attempts 
have been made to set new standards, new conditions, again in an 
effort to get involved in what is—as we know—essentially a 
provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I used to sit on the human resources development committee. This 
experience makes me say that there are two different mentalities 
in our country. Today's agreement, the so-called agreeement on 
social union, was ratified by nine anglophone provinces. It does 
not bother them to see the federal government get involved in 
their affairs, as long as they get the money. In Quebec, we 
think differently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a consensus in our province, and I hope the leader of 
the opposition in Quebec City will act in a manner consistent 
with what he said when he was here, and that he will support the 
position defended today by the Premier of Quebec, Mr. Bouchard. 
<P><A NAME="LINK231"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to take this opportunity to join my colleague, the member 
for Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière, in thanking our colleague from 
Drummond for all the information and support she has been 
providing the Bloc Quebecois. She has helped us improve every 
piece of legislation dealing with health care we have debated in 
this House over the years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we had not had people like the Bloc Quebecois members here in 
the House of Commons, Quebec would have been penalized ten times 
more. We are dealing with people who do not consult, take money 
that does not belong to them out of people's pocket, and use it 
to reduce their deficit and drive us further into poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our colleague from Chicoutimi keeps on saying “With this deal it 
has just signed, I am not sure the Quebec government is going to 
reinvest this money in health care and redistribute it among the 
regions”. The cuts the federal government made to health care 
transfer payments to the provinces created a $38 million 
shortfall in the Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean area. This is a lot of 
money, $38 million, this is not peanuts. This is money it took 
out of our own pockets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It said “We do not want to know, you deal with it”. We in Quebec 
had made the move toward ambulatory care. We were going to get 
health care under control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the federal government would not let Quebec do its own 
thing. It said “Let us play a dirty trick on them and cut 
$38 million”, which is what it did in my area alone. 
This was a contemptible move on the part of the federal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was not a gift from the Government of Canada to the 
Government of Quebec.  It represented only a third of what they 
owed it.  I think they should give us back the two thirds they 
still owe.  Since 1993, the federal government has cut 
provincial transfer payments by $6.3 billion. This affects the 
Government of Quebec. The battle is not over.  Quebeckers are 
proud.  We listen to our people.  We are attuned to what every 
member of Quebec society thinks.  We are proud of what we are 
and we are proud of our desire to become a sovereign nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask my colleague, the member for 
Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière, if he too, in his region, has heard 
equally contemptible examples of what the federal government has 
done to the Government of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have heard similar comments. In 
our riding offices, we hear all kinds of horror stories, people 
talking about personal experiences with regard to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to go back to the issue of difference. I still say 
there are two countries within this country. In our work and in 
our discussions with members on the other side of the House and 
from other parties on this subject, we can see how important it 
is for Quebeckers to maintain jurisdiction over health, 
education, and so on. We feel this is important. We are always 
faced with a perception that we can respect because they may not 
have read the same history books as we have, and vice versa.

After achieving surpluses, as mentioned by the member for 
Jonquière, the federal government can now rectify the situation. 
However, those billions of dollars that were taken away from 
Quebec and the other provinces have resulted in unthinkable 
situations, including the one in the Chaudière-Appalaches region. 
That is the example that always comes to mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a difference in perception to think, as my colleagues from 
the other parties do, that the federal government is the 
superior government, the big government, with the provincial 
governments being inferior governments.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Carolyn Bennett (St. Paul's, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is a pleasure to talk today about health care but I am saddened 
that yet again we seem to be talking about turf. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion is filled with words about turf and not about the 
welfare of Canadians.  Words like jurisdiction, unconditionally, 
encroach and health care field actually mean that we refuse to 
discuss what is most important to Canadians individually but also 
to Canadians' role in the international field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to talk to this motion from two perspectives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada on the international stage when sitting at a meeting with 
other countries with the Canadian flag in front, needs the 
ability to be responsible for the kind of health care delivered 
across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I forgot to mention that I will be sharing my time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians across the land need to know that when they are 
represented internationally they will not be embarrassed. 
Canadians hold their health care system with huge pride.  They 
have expressed that medicare is their badge of honour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians feel that fairness in the delivery of health care 
across the country is the most important thing to them.  They do 
not think the size of somebody's wallet should determine where 
one stands in line for a required procedure.  It is extremely 
important to remember that the provincial responsibility has been 
for the management and the delivery of health care, but the 
federal government has always had a role in health care promotion 
and prevention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prevention is the most important thing we can do for our health 
care system. It must not and can never be separated from actually 
what is the vision and values of health care for the country.  It 
is integral to doing a good job in health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has always had an important fiscal 
component in health care. The central vehicle of this has been 
the CHST.  The CHST has been an important lever in terms of a 
cash transfer.  Up until now it has been our only way of 
insisting on the provisions of the Canada Health Act which are 
actually essential to the security and confidence that Canadians 
have in the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Public administration, comprehensiveness, universality, 
portability and accessibility are important aspects to Canadians 
but as I have said before, unfortunately the Canada Health Act 
says nothing about quality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians risk losing confidence in their health care system. It 
is imperative that the federal government has a way of ensuring 
high quality care. That begins with an understanding and 
co-operation in terms of measurement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is thrilling that today with the social union talks we have 
begun discussing things like accountability. 
I remember last summer when the Minister for Intergovernmental 
Affairs first mentioned in terms of the social union talks the 
word accountability.  A lot of us were thrilled that there was 
the beginning of a discussion on how we ensure to Canadians that 
it is not the federal government checking up on the provinces but 
it is a matter of both levels of government being able to report 
to Canadians on how these outcomes are being done.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we see in the document things like achieving and measuring 
results, monitoring and measuring outcomes of social programs, 
sharing information and best practices, something we know we need 
to do in order to find the savings.  Just giving money is never 
going to be enough, unless we can ensure that health care is 
delivered in a collaborative way where all the provinces get to 
share their good ideas with one another and professionals get to 
determine what are best practices and a cost effective way of 
spending the money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we have publicly recognized the respective roles and 
contributions of all levels of government.  But we also know that 
when funds are transferred from one government to another for the 
purposes agreed upon it is extraordinarily important that this 
not be passed on to the residents in some other way.  We need to 
make sure that the dollars for health care are spent on health 
care and that they are spent wisely on health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Involving Canadians in some sort of vision exercise is going to 
be the most important thing we do.  We have to ensure that there 
are effective measures for Canadians to participate in what it is 
they want and the ability of the federal government to make sure 
that it happens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are certain places within the provinces that do 
extraordinarily good things.  The kind of standard that is now in 
Quebec in terms of home care is a model for the country.  We 
should share that information across the country and talk about 
how we get that for all Canadians. Recently when we saw the B.C. 
outcomes in cancer, we were all a bit jealous and wanted to know 
what was being done. It is up to the federal government to be the 
clearing house to make sure those good ideas happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether it is waiting lists or outcomes or how people are doing 
in early discharge, we have to measure the readmission rates, if 
we are going to boast about early discharge in terms of maternity 
for example.  We need to know about hysterectomy rates and 
Caesarean section rates and birth weight. We are judged 
internationally as to how we are doing on things such as birth 
weight.  It is not good enough that we leave the accountability 
for the provision of health care without holding our own valued 
responsibility to Canadians in terms of how the dollars are 
spent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Traditionally the federal government has had some small direct 
spending ability.  Today in the talks it was again articulated. 
Federal spending power should be used in making transfers to 
individuals and organizations in order to promote equality of 
opportunity, mobility and other Canada-wide objectives.  When the 
federal government introduces new Canada-wide initiatives funded 
through direct transfers to individuals and organizations, it is 
going to give notice and co-operate with the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Look at our CAPC program.  There are a lot of areas in Quebec 
where that is hugely welcomed and gratefully received. It is that 
kind of initiative Canadians have benefited from again 
irrespective of turf. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I implore my colleagues across the way to help us decide.  There 
were social union discussions today.  The next step must be to 
move to a proper vision exercise to decide together what kind of 
country this is and what are the values and the vision for this 
country.  Then we must continue to co-operate in a way that is 
good for Canadians and accountable to Canadians.

acknowledge that my hon. colleague has put a great deal of 
sincerity in her speech, but there seems also to be fair bit of 
inconsistency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, for those who believe in this country called 
Canada—we are not among them, at least not as it operates now, 
and as we know it—it seems to me there ought to be an underlying 
principle behind their actions and their statements. 
That would be a minimal respect for the founding legislation of 
Canada, that is its constitution.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not because we are going to the offices of a charitable 
organization that we can get away with driving at 140 kilometers 
an hour on the highway, nor is it because it wants to help 
people that the federal government is entitled to interfere in 
any and all areas of jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is paradoxical that the hon. member tells us in her speech 
that she wants to be proud of her health system when she goes 
abroad. 
This caucus reminds me of the movie <I>The Silence of the Lambs</I>, 
because it is quite docile and it does not offer much resistance 
to policies that deserve greater criticism and challenges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the member cares about other people, and I am sure she does 
because she is a good person, there are three things that she 
could promote in her caucus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, she could talk about the Canadian Human Rights Act 
abroad, because it is her duty to do so. Our country is one of 
the few that does not prohibit discrimination based on social 
status. 
So, if the member wants to talk about social justice and if she 
cares about other people, she can campaign, inside her own 
ranks, to get a real debate that would allow the inclusion of 
social status among the prohibited grounds of discrimination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, should the member not pressure the Minister of Human 
Resources Development who just found out that there are people 
who are exploited in our society? Should she not press for 
improvements to the EI system? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, should she not press the government to give back to the 
Canadian provinces the money that it brutally stole from them? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are three areas where the member could use her talents, 
her intelligence and her convictions to work in the best 
interests of other people. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Carolyn Bennett:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is interesting again 
that some of my colleague's suggestions are things that would be 
a national standard.  We need to be on the international stage 
showing that we are sticking up for these kinds of things, 
whether it is child poverty or accessibility to university. One 
of my constituents has seen McGill University documents courting 
Americans who will pay more but she cannot get her son into 
McGill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are national standards we want to see throughout this 
country.  It is a matter of our sticking together and saying that 
it should not matter where we live in this country, that we are 
entitled to have good health care, good access to post-secondary 
education and good social programs.  We are going to figure out 
how we measure that so that every Canadian, regardless of their 
postal code gets the same kind of care. 
<P><A NAME="LINK234"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, unlike my colleague who just spoke, I have little 
objection to this motion.  For the most part, it is an excellent 
motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point out that it says that this House urges the government to 
respect provincial jurisdiction in health care management.  I 
heartily endorse that.  That is precisely what is in the 
Constitution.  I am sure that given the right conditions, all the 
provinces would certainly endeavour to manage health care in a 
proper fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On increased transfers to the provinces for health care, I think 
I can speak for just about every member on this side that we 
would want to see more money go toward the health of Canadians. I 
am hoping in the budget that is coming out very shortly that the 
government in its wisdom will find more money for health care in 
the provinces.  We must remember it is a provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, regarding using budget surpluses to encroach upon the 
health field, quite honestly I do not really know what that 
means.  I certainly would not want to see the federal government 
encroach in any improper way on provincial jurisdiction.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only word I have difficulty with in the motion is the word 
unconditionally.  The motion suggests that the federal government 
should transfer billions and billions of dollars to the provinces 
for unconditional spending in health care.  I have difficulty 
with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently the total cash and tax point transfer for health and 
social spending from the federal government to the provinces is 
about $26 billion.  The difficulty is that any time any 
government, person or organization gives money to another 
organization to provide services there has to be some level of 
transparency and accountability.  We have to know we are getting 
a return on the money we put out to an organization, a province 
or whatever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give an example in my own province.  I hope the Bloc 
members are listening.  I cannot speak for the experience in 
Quebec because I do not live in Quebec; but I do live in Ontario 
and can say that there is a general feeling in Ontario that the 
transfer money coming from the federal government for social 
spending will not get to where it ought to be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are indications of this suspicion.  A person came to my 
riding and described a billboard in Mexico which read “Invest in 
Ontario—Low Personal Income Taxes”.  I do not know for certain 
but it leads to the suspicion that perhaps the Government of 
Ontario is using some of the money that is supposed to go to 
health care and other social fields for something else, which 
enables it to cut personal income taxes as indeed it has done. 
That is only anecdotal, but I have actual evidence that this 
general opinion is held by people in Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every fall at fairs in my riding I hold opinion polls.  I have 
four jars on a table.  People are given four coloured beans and 
asked to pretend they are the Minister of Finance and have a $4 
billion surplus.  Each jar is separately labelled.  One is 
labelled “Reduce the Debt”; the second is “Increase Social 
Spending”, the third is “Cut Taxes” and the last one is 
“Reduce the GST”, because I am still very opposed to the GST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just in passing, the results among 494 players at the Rockton 
Fair in my riding last October was 36% for reducing the debt, 30% 
for increasing social spending, 23% for tax cuts and 11% for 
reducing the GST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will notice that the figure for increasing social 
spending is only 30% which seems to be very low, but I have to 
explain the context in which the question was put to the people 
who participated in the poll.  I should also say that fall fair, 
one of the biggest in the country, attracts people from all over 
the province, from Toronto and the Hamilton area; it is a very 
large catchment area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I gave the four beans to persons who were to participate in 
the poll and said social spending, they would advance the bean 
toward social spending.  However, if I said to them “Oh, just 
one moment.  Remember that the federal government does not 
control social spending.  If you put that bean into the jar for 
social spending, health and all the rest of it, remember that it 
is the Government of Ontario that will actually decide how that 
billion dollars will be used”, people would dart back as if they 
had touched something hot and would put the bean in another jar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I watched the poll all the way through.  I stayed there for the 
three days that it was carried out.  Roughly half the people who 
would have put money into social spending changed their minds 
when they realized that social spending was an area entirely 
under provincial jurisdiction.

<A HREF="#LINKT82"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That raises the whole matter of what is wrong.  If the public 
gives money to any organization and is uncertain about whether 
the organization will actually spend the money where it is 
supposed to, we have a problem.  It is a problem that is easily 
fixed.  The way to fix it is to require an agreement of the 
provincial government in which it assures the federal government 
that it will spend the money it receives from Ottawa on health 
care and agrees to demonstrate that it is spending the money in 
that way.  In other words, there has to be some form of 
accountability.  There has to be some form of transparency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the social union talks which concluded today I notice that 
one item agreed upon by the provinces—and I believe it also 
applies in the health care field—was the consent to a third 
party audit of money being received from the federal government 
and used by the provinces for health care.  In other words, the 
actual spending on health care by a province would be audited. I 
will say, for example, Alberta keeps very careful track of how 
its health care dollar is spent.  Why should all the provinces 
not do precisely that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about unconditional we talk about no transparency 
and no accountability.  However if we all agree that the money 
coming from the federal government is to be used on health, there 
should be no barrier by any province to disclosing in detail how 
the money is spent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec has one of the best freedom of information laws among the 
provinces.  I hope the federal government would revise its own 
access to information law so that the provinces can look into the 
financial affairs of the federal government in the same way as we 
would hope the people of Canada and the people of Quebec can look 
into how money is spent by the province of Quebec on health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not see much problem with the motion.  If I thought there 
was even a distant chance of getting unanimous consent I would 
move an amendment suggesting that we drop the word unconditional. 
If that were agreeable to the opposition I am sure we on this 
side would support the motion whole-heartedly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not feel I should give my party whip a heart attack by 
moving a motion at this time so I will pass and ask the Bloc 
Quebecois to seriously consider amending the motion by taking out 
the word unconditional and I am sure it will get overwhelming 
support on this side for its motion.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank him for his information and his speech, but I was a 
little surprised, because he was initially almost in favour of 
the motion. But I am not surprised about how his speech ended, 
because I do not think his party would allow him to vote in 
favour of this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would simply like to set the record straight, because Liberals 
often try to minimize the importance of drastic cuts in the 
Canadian social transfer by telling us about tax points which 
have supposedly increased. This is totally false and I am 
pleased to set the record straight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have here a document that was produced by an economist, a tax 
expert, who knows how to set the record straight. As I am not an 
economist or a tax expert, I cannot go into the complex 
mechanics of federal transfers. 
But I can tell members that this claim is unfounded.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government always brings back the argument of 
increased tax points. This is unfounded for two reasons: first, 
there is no relation between the value of tax points and the 
value of cash transfers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But Liberals would really like the give the impression they have 
compensated for their cash cuts by giving more generous tax 
points. In fact, they have no merit, because the value of tax 
points is linked to the changing economic situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the level of cash transfers is determined only by the 
federal government. It is these transfers that have been cut. An 
important fact is that the value of tax points would have been 
increased by the same amount if the federal government had not 
slashed cash transfers, because there is no direct link between 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, and I will conclude on this, tax point transfers 
are not transfers, they are simply tax revenues like any others 
for the provinces. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Mr. Speaker, if I had it my way no tax 
points would be transferred to provinces for any consideration. 
By assigning tax points to the provinces we have in effect lost 
control over federal spending on health care.  With the tax 
points it is absolutely unconditional how provinces spend federal 
dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If members opposite were to move an amendment to their motion to 
remove the word unconditional, I guarantee them absolutely that I 
would vote for their motion.  I look forward to the time when 
they actually take out the word unconditional.

always strange to hear a Liberal member say such things. We 
heard a lot today about accountability, about being responsible 
for expenditures, about the agreement, the fine print saying 
that from now on provinces are taking responsibility for 
spending the additional funds they receive, or will receive in 
the next budget, for health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He spoke about fairs in his riding and about how the money in 
the budget should be spent. They should do the same for 
employment insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the member ready to make the same commitment that the 
provinces made for health care, and apply it to employment 
insurance, that every dollar paid into employment insurance stay 
in the employment insurance fund? It will be the workers who 
will benefit from it. Could the same philosophy not apply to 
programs that have an effect on the everyday life of Canadians? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his 
question.  We have to recall that it was the Conservative 
government which managed to transfer these tax points to the 
provinces and essentially created the situation where the federal 
government lost control of federal spending in health care. That 
is very sad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as employment insurance is concerned, we are talking 
about apples and oranges, as the member well knows, because we 
are talking about a situation in which the demand on the 
employment insurance fund is met by the money that is there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know what the member actually means.  Would he increase 
the amount?  Perhaps he is suggesting that we should cut 
employment insurance premiums.  Perhaps that is what he is

this.  The speech by the hon. member for Winnipeg North Centre

of the question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask her to clarify if it was to 5.30 p.m., assuming the debate 
would go to 5.30 p.m.  If it ends at 5.25 p.m. after these two 
speeches is it the intention to end then?  Perhaps the member 
could clarify what he is trying to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan:</B>  Mr. Speaker, if they end up shorter than 
20 and 10, we would like to end it at that point and not bring a 
new speaker into the mix who would be cut off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Is there unanimous consent to allow 
the hon. member for Winnipeg North Centre and the hon. member for 
Churchill River to make remarks in accordance with the guidelines

comments, then the debate would terminate? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pauline Picard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like some 
clarification. Are you asking for the debate to continue after 
5.30 p.m.? If the NDP members want to use the time provided and 
speak from 5 p.m. to 5.15 p.m. and you assure me that the debate 
will end at 5.30 p.m., I agree. I, however, would not want us to 
continue after 5.30 p.m. The NDP members had the whole day to 
take part in today's debate. But if you assure me that the 
debate will end at 5.30 p.m., I agree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Fine, I can give the assurance to the House 
that the debate will end no later than 5.30 p.m. Is there 
unanimous consent to proceed in this fashion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to make a 
comment about the discussions around social union since we are 
awaiting the full details of today's developments but I know full 
well Canadians have clearly indicated that they have felt left in 
the dark on these very substantive and serious developments 
pertaining to the future of national programs in the country 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let it be clearly put on the record that once again Canadians 
feel decisions are being made at the level of executive 
federalism away from parliament and beyond the ability of 
Canadians to participate actively and fully in the debate.  I 
want it to be clear and on the record that we call once again for 
this discussion of social union to go from this day forward into 
the public domain where all parliamentarians can debate the 
issues and where all Canadians can be fully involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although this point will be further elaborated by my colleague 
from Churchill River, aboriginal peoples remain concerned that 
they have been excluded from fundamental decision making around 
the future of national social programs and once again we are left 
without the adequate input and advice to deal with what is 
clearly a most horrific problem in terms of health care on 
reserves and outside reserves among aboriginal peoples. It is a 
matter of serious concern to all of us that in a country as 
wealthy as Canada we have third world conditions all around us 
and we see deplorable conditions pertaining to the health and 
well-being of first nation communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some delicious ironies in this debate.  It is clear we 
are talking about the future of a national health care plan.  We 
are talking about the ability of the federal and provincial 
governments to co-operate with participation from Canadian 
citizens on the future of our health care system.  At the same 
time we have a federal government that is so hung up and 
preoccupied with this notion of taking political credit and 
demanding report cards about provincial activities although it is 
this government that took the $6 billion away from taxpayers that 
was going toward the health and social programs of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is certainly ironic especially since it was this government 
in 1995 that brought in the Canada health and social transfer 
which not only took the biggest chunk out of health care spending 
in the history of this country but which also removed conditions 
by which provinces would be required to adhere to certain 
standards and principles.  That is one delicious irony of this 
debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the flip side another irony comes from a province like 
Manitoba with a provincial government that has cut so deeply into 
its provincial health care system, all the while sitting on a 
significant surplus.  And it has the gall to issue a petition 
calling on the federal government to increase its share of 
transfer payments.  That is the kind of ridiculous situation we 
enter into when we do not as a country recognize the serious 
problems at hand and work together to build for the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is absolutely clear that what is at hand today and hopefully 
is being resolved as a result of developments today is a 
commitment on the part of the federal government to reverse the 
decisions it made a number of years ago which in effect put us on 
the road to the death of medicare.  It is absolutely clear that 
today we are are trying to put our health care system on some 
kind of stable footing out of a crisis mode of operation so we 
can move forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any kind of contribution from members, including those from the 
Bloc who have brought us this motion today, is most welcome.  But 
let us be clear that what is fundamentally at stake is the 
question of medicare, the question of a national, publicly 
administered, universally accessible health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we take some encouragement from today's developments, we 
are also very worried given the past history of the federal 
Liberal government on this issue.  Let us keep in mind why we are 
in such a mess today and learn from the lessons of the past and 
correct those errors.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to put on the record a brief statement by a well known 
former policy adviser to the Liberal government, Mr. Tom Kent, 
who recently released his own paper on social policy reform: “It 
is not in the stars, not because of forces beyond our control 
that we have faltered in national purposes, that our pursuit of 
the public interest has lagged.  It is in ourselves, in the 
atrophy of national policies”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me also put on record the words of a well known former 
Conservative, Mr. Dalton Camp, who recently very clearly 
described the problems we are facing: “It is simply folly to 
believe that we do not have the means to provide for a national 
health care system. Means and ends no longer converge. The idea 
of government as a custodian of the national interests has become 
a shibboleth and self-government a myth.  We are now looked 
after, if at all, by the World Bank, the International Monetary 
Fund, the North American Free Trade Agreement, the World Trade 
Organization, America's trade and competitiveness act and the 
promoters of the pending multilateral agreement on investment. 
We are looked upon by other members of the new world club as 
compliant to the point of docility”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That quote coupled with Mr. Kent's observations points to the 
very critical issues at hand.  What is the true intention of the 
federal government in terms of health care from a national 
perspective?  It is more than about money on the table.  It is 
more than claiming political credit.  It is truly about 
direction, about standards and about leadership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most graphic way one can refer to the concerns we have is to 
look at the way our public system has fallen into private hands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question, we have had report after, that a good part 
of our health care spending today is from the private sector.  We 
are rapidly losing hold of a sound publicly administered system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our biggest worry is that we are very much on a slide to a two 
tier American style health care system.  That is the last thing 
Canadians want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge all members today to look to this point as the beginning 
of a new era where we can actually recognize the importance of a 
national health care program; the principles of the Canada Health 
Act, the need to stop offloading and deregulation by the federal 
government in the area of health protection, the need to find 
ways to stop this slide into a privatized American style health 
care system and to find ways where we can truly work at the 
federal-provincial level with citizens participating at building 
for the future. 
<P><A NAME="LINK238"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
I am a little disappointed that the member continues to point 
fingers and use the rhetoric of the death of the health care 
system, the advancing of a two tier health care system, et 
cetera. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the kind of rhetoric Canadians do not want to hear.  The 
issues at hand are the fact that the provinces, the territories 
and the federal government today have resolved all the bickering 
and have come up with a plan to assure all Canadians about our 
secure, sustainable health care system and that the funding will 
be there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member will also know that the responsibilities of the 
federal government are defined in that they are transfers for 
hospitals and for doctor fees, which is acute care, not the whole 
health care system, so there is some joint responsibility with 
regard to funding.  On the member's numbers of $6 billion, et 
cetera,  we are talking about health but now she rolls in 
post-secondary education and social programs and starts to muddy 
the waters.  She is talking only about cash and not about tax 
points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is all the stuff Canadians want to stop hearing about. 
What they want to start hearing is that all levels of government 
are working together to ensure that Canada's health care system 
and the principles of the Canada Health Act continue to be 
supported and sustained for a long time to come.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a question for the member regarding some derogatory 
comments she made about report cards, et cetera.  Canadians do 
want accountability.  Yesterday I received the report of the 
advisory council on health infrastructure.  One of its principal 
recommendations in the final report was to develop the analyses 
and the information gathering to be able to do report cards for 
Canadians so that Canadians will know how to assess the quality 
and the efficiency of our health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the member saying reporting and being accountable to 
Canadians by some mechanism which may be referred to as report 
cards is inappropriate? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will answer the 
last question first. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member is not prepared to hear the irony I pointed to and 
also misses the point.  It is absolutely clear that Canadians 
want accountability but they want all governments to be held 
accountable starting with the federal Liberal government.  That 
is why we have proposed a mechanism by which we could try to have 
such accountability, to have a watchdog function to ensure the 
federal government and the provincial governments are living up 
to their responsibilities to preserve a quality health care 
system and build for the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting for the member to suggest I am only being 
negative when he is missing the point.  We are here today trying 
to encourage members across the way to look beyond today, to look 
beyond the question of dealing with the reinvestment issues and 
to address what is actually happening to our health care system 
in terms of privatized health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member only has to talk to folks in Alberta who are deeply 
worried about the possibility of a private hospital, on which the 
government has maintained absolute silence.  I suggest he talk to 
people who are waiting in line for cataract surgery in a province 
like Alberta and are told if they want to wait many months they 
can get it in the public system.  If they want to pay $4,800 now 
they can get it at a private clinic.  That is exactly the kind of 
deterioration and damage that has happened to our public system 
that we have to be vigilant about.  I would impress on the member 
to look to the future and to try to work to ensure that we 
maintain those fundamental principles of a publicly administered, 
universally accessible system. 
<P><A NAME="LINK239"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the opportunity to speak today is very crucial because it is sort 
of a celebration in terms of highlighting the responsibility of 
health to the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I first came to the House and when debating the health 
issue back in our communities it was deemed a provincial 
jurisdiction. Today we are in the House of Commons debating 
health issues and the future of health care and the 
responsibility of the federal government.  It is a major 
responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call on my colleagues to continue to support it because if we 
look at health care and talk about the millions of budget 
allocations that are needed to replenish the cutbacks that we 
have faced in the hospitals, home care, elderly care, maternity 
wards and emergency wards, all these cutbacks we have realized 
over the years, with a surplus in sight we have an opportunity to 
create a health system in the new millennium. It will be a 
collective effort and the federal government has to play a major 
role in this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I looked at health care issues specifically in my area. There is 
a recent statement I highlight because there are many concerns 
over the state of our health care. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1720"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT89"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT89"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1720

<A HREF="#LINKT88"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding I have a majority of aboriginal people who live in 
northern Saskatchewan where we border the Northwest Territories, 
the boreal forest and the barren grounds.  Here is what it says 
about the state of our health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It says we are compared to developing countries because diseases 
such as tuberculosis and hepatitis A do not exist or run rampant 
in developed countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My riding in northern Saskatchewan has the highest count of 
tuberculosis in the country.  Imagine that in 1999.  We will step 
into the year 2000 and my constituents have the highest rate of 
acquiring TB right now.  Let us address that issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How do you address that issue?  What causes TB?  Here is another 
statement:  “Increased suffering from developing country 
diseases such as diabetes, cancer and cardiovascular disease”. 
Diabetes is a major issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few years ago I had an opportunity to work with a colleague of 
mine, an Inuit lady from Inukjuak.  She was sharing stories about 
her people when we talked about our homes.  Jokingly she said her 
people in northern Quebec were addicted to Coca-Cola. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next day the <I>Globe and Mail</I> printed a headline saying 
they had to fly in a load of Coca-Cola to their communities 
because the winter supply to be delivered by ship could not make 
it before spring break-up.  It was an emergency that they had to 
fly in sweetened soda pop.  Our people's diets that are causing 
health problems are a major cause of concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the status of our environment, the state of our air and 
water, doing to our health? There is a study dealing with the 
toxicology of contaminants and its relationship to neurological 
disorders, reproductive effects, immunosuppression and cancer. 
PCBs were a part of that study. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A study of Inuit boys in Canada showed that their birth weights 
were a lot lower if the mothers had high levels of PCBs in their 
breast milk.  These studies were conducted in our own 
neighbourhood.  This was a very recent study and recently the 
federal government cut the study program on northern 
contaminants.  This did not go beyond the water and air flows in 
the immediate Arctic region.  This study needs to be expanded 
into the lower boreal forest as well, into the Cree and Dene 
regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only Inuit live off the traditional lands.  Contaminants are 
impacting all our northern communities.  This is a national 
program because the northern half of all provinces feel the 
impact of transboundary pollutants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The industries in northern Alberta all spew their pollutants 
into northern Saskatchewan and carry on to northern Manitoba. The 
industries from Ontario and Quebec carry on to the Atlantic 
provinces and our northern regions.  The Arctic polar regions get 
theirs from Europe and Asia.  It is circulating all over the 
north and into our regions of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is having an impact on our health.  I have another health 
statistic which is a predominate number.  Of our northern 
population 37% is under 15 years of age.  Almost 50% of our 
population consists of children.  They will be middle aged, 
seeking employment, housing and family support in their 
communities.  They are not moving out.  They are not moving away 
from the northern communities because that is home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The development of the north is very crucial to this.  We share 
this all the way from British Columbia to Labrador.  That is 
where the intrajurisdictional issue of federal responsibility is 
very important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our situation in the north was highlighted by the United Nations 
recently.  Examples of death rates, infant deaths, premature 
deaths, low birth rates, cancer, teen pregnancy and diabetes are 
of international concern.  Canada is a major highlight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We just talked about the social union and health accord 
gathering that took place. 
The aboriginal people were missing from there.  They did not have 
a chance to be heard.  Provincial jurisdictions are providing 
services to those communities but the federal responsibility is 
crucial.  The medical services branch has a role with the treaty 
obligations with the treaty Indians.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our communities are mixed.  There are not only treaty 
obligations but there are non-treaty obligations.  Then there are 
Metis obligations and the Inuit obligations.  These obligations 
of health jurisdictions between the federal government and 
provincial governments is very crucial.  I applaud our members 
today who have brought that responsibility back to the federal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health is crucial.  It needs national leadership.  It needs 
provincial leadership.  It needs community leadership.  But the 
federal government has to be accountable because it inflicted the 
cutbacks in transfers to the provinces and inflicted the cutbacks 
in the environmental departments for analysis of the impacts of 
our health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other situation which is a major crisis in health in this 
jurisdiction is accessibility of doctors.  In my community we 
have a group of doctors who came from South Africa because the 
jurisdiction of other countries cannot readily access employment 
in this country.  But the South African doctors found employment 
and were readily recruited by our communities because we need a 
stable supply of doctors.  Because of immigration they have to 
get their working visas authorized outside Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to raise this in terms of a doctor's story.  We want them 
in our clinics and in our hospitals. When they visit their 
families on holidays, let us say Easter or Christmas break, some 
of our immigration offices or embassies are closed during the 
holidays. They cannot get their working visas to come back into 
Canada to serve the clinics and serve the patients in our 
communities.  It was an atrocity to see that. They had to 
backtrack and call people for five days before this specific 
process was completed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the whole issue of doctors and the training of doctors in 
terms of the north we need northern doctors.  We need access to 
community health and good home care.  Not everyone can come to 
the large urban centres for major care.  So health care and 
budgeting of home care units throughout the country and to supply 
our remote and rural communities is in dire need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I applaud the federal leadership that is taking place and the 
provinces which are committed to working together. Finally health 
care is on the federal agenda. 
<P><A NAME="LINK240"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Sheila Finestone (Mount Royal, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I assure my hon. colleague that on the very serious concerns he 
expressed about aboriginal peoples, and there are many issues of 
concerned to all Canadians, I believe that if he reads the 
framework to improve the social union for Canadians he will note 
that aboriginal peoples of Canada are included under the 
fundamental principles of a social union in the country. It 
indicates clearly that for greater certainty nothing in this 
agreement abrogates or derogates from any aboriginal treaties or 
other rights of aboriginal peoples, including self-government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, under working in partnership for Canadians there is 
a section under aboriginal peoples and it is absolutely vital 
that they not be excluded and that they are an important and 
integral part of Canada and Canadians, that we would put 
jurisdictional issues aside in this instance and we must address 
their pressing needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the member will find that this issue has been 
discussed with Mr. Fontaine.  There is nothing that is perfect 
but I do believe— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I have to give the 
hon. member for Churchill the last word. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Laliberte:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I believe in talking 
especially about the aboriginal community because that was the 
perspective of my speech.  We have to look at health care.  Is it 
a top down initiative?  Does the doctor have the power to deliver 
health care to any individual? I do not think so.

be brief since time is of the essence. I will not take all the 
time allotted to me and humbly heed your request. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Compton—Stanstead already discussed Motion M-380 
in this House. He made a brilliant speech. Above all, he 
generated interest in this matter in the House because, 
unfortunately, the government does not notify us ahead of time 
and consult us on a regular basis on the whole issue of a 
Canadian military presence abroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At any rate, to know what is going on with our troops, we are 
generally better off phoning the U.S. secretary of state, who 
will provide us with information before our own government tells 
us about our troops' involvement in various missions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was such an instance one year ago, when things were 
starting to heat up in Iraq, and the Americans and the British 
were preparing to intervene. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1735"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT91"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister announced that the House would be asked to 
take note of the fact that Canada might support action against 
Iraq. However, before this announcement was made, we learned 
that the American secretary of state knew that Canada had 
already given its consent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is somewhat frustrating. The government does not seem to 
want to consult Parliament. More specifically, the Minister of 
External Affairs does not seem to give a damn about what 
parliamentarians think on a number of matters, including the 
deployment of Canadian troops abroad to provide either 
humanitarian or military assistance, although the motion focuses 
on the military aspect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion does not specify under which authority the mission 
would be placed. Would it be under the UN? Under NATO? Under the 
Americans? This might make for an interesting debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Foreign Affairs is not listening, as he showed 
us today on the issue of plutonium imports. The Standing 
Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade heard 
witnesses on this issue. In the report on plutonium, all 
parliamentarians—we always wonder about the Reformers—asked 
that absolutely no plutonium be imported into the country. The 
minister says “We will see, we are not sure”. He did not read 
the report. We submitted a report to him and he did not even 
read it. He does not care about us one bit. When it comes to 
deciding whether we should send military personnel, it is the 
Americans who make the decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can understand the frustration behind the motion moved by the 
member for Red Deer. Unfortunately, that motion is flawed. It is 
incorrect. It is difficult to defend because it is incomplete. 
It creates a process which may not be necessary, but that motion 
is the product of frustration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is meant by “a significant contingent”? As the hon. member 
for Compton—Stanstead pointed out, if we send one soldier to 
Cyprus, does that mean we must have a debate in the House? We 
already have aircraft stationed in Italy that are ready for 
action in Kosovo. Must we have a debate about that? The minister 
said we would have a debate in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All too often the debate is short and its purpose is primarily 
to inform the House that Canada has already told the United 
States, England, France, NATO, the UN, the Pope and everyone 
else that it would take part in a mission. Everyone has been 
told except us parliamentarians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion is incomplete, and we will have a lot of trouble 
supporting it.  At the same time, we must also recognize the 
government's executive power to make decisions.  It is 
ineffective from a governmental point of view.  However, minimum 
respect for the men and women in this House would dictate that 
the government inform them of its intentions and allow them to 
play their role as parliamentarians.  It is so important for a 
government to have the support of parliament when taking action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Take the humanitarian missions, for example.  There was no 
debate in the House in the case of Hurricane Mitch. There were 
questions about what Canada was contributing in the way of 
money, troops, and human and material resources.  Not one member 
of the House rose to say that they were not in favour of sending 
our troops to help out in the case of Hurricane Mitch. 
What we are talking about here is military missions that are a 
much greater risk to Canada's credibility but above all to the 
lives of our men and women in the armed forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Red Deer means well.  However, the motion perhaps 
conveys more frustration than credibility.  We are very open to 
improved consultation of parliament in the case of a decision 
involving Canadian military personnel outside Canada's 
boundaries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hope that the government will listen for once and, contrary 
to what it did in the case of the nuclear bomb tests, Iraq, 
Kosovo, and all sorts of other situations, will want to share 
information and probably hear a few arguments from all four 
opposition parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate people for being interested in the military 
question.  It is an important one.  However, a message needs to 
be sent as well. 
If there is going to be a debate before troops are sent overseas 
on an official mission, we should perhaps also make sure they 
are well equipped.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the subject of the planes, the minister was saying there was 
no problem with the ejectable seat, that it was the parachute 
that did not work.  That makes no sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year, they were short of boots in the Canadian armed 
forces.  They want to cut another 5,000 people, men and women, 
the staff of the Canadian armed forces.  What do they want?  A 
scout troop with hard hats?  If that is it, let them say so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, the government should discuss more with 
parliamentarians and make them allies. 
There is often talk of American, French and British allies, but 
the greatest allies of the Canadian armed forces are to be found 
here.  Our military needs support when it goes on foreign 
missions, let the government consult the opposition.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Robert Bertrand (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise 
today to speak to this motion on the role of parliament with 
respect to defence and external affairs policy matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, let me make it perfectly clear that we are against 
having to take a vote before any Canadian troops can be deployed 
abroad. This motion was debated for the first time in June, and 
again in October. Both times, we opposed this motion to make a 
vote mandatory before Canadian military personnel can be 
deployed abroad. Our position has not changed. We continue to 
believe not only that timely and effective action is required in 
times of international crisis but also that this position is 
consistent with what the people of Canada want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also continue to believe that it is important to consult 
parliament on the deployment of military personnel, and we have 
demonstrated on many occasions. Canada has made a name for 
itself internationally, and it is proud of it. Our involvement 
in the two world wars, the Korean War and various peacekeeping 
missions as well as the fact that we belong to many 
international organizations reflects that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This tradition lives 
on today, the same way Canadians continue to depend on 
multiculturalism. The people of Canada continue to pay attention 
to what is happening internationally and to support a Canadian 
presence in hot spots around the world. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me draw attention to a public opinion poll conducted by 
Pollara in November of last year.  In that poll Canadians 
responded overwhelmingly that Canada needed the Canadian forces. 
They supported UN peacekeeping, peace making missions requiring 
the use of force, NATO out of area operations and NORAD. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We recently reaffirmed Canada's international role by winning a 
seat on the United Nations Security Council.  Three-quarters of 
the votes cast were in favour of Canada's bid, a clear 
endorsement of our international credentials, a recognition of 
our longstanding commitment to the United Nations and our 
commitment to a better world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With our commitment to multilateralism and our position as one 
of Canada's wealthier countries and a G-7 member Canada has the 
means and a responsibility to maintain and deploy high quality 
armed forces.  When crises arise that threaten peace and security 
we need to be able to respond quickly and effectively. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government usually submits to the attention of the House 
those issues that involve major deployments abroad to maintain 
peace or to achieve other purposes, and this is precisely what 
we have done. The debates have focused on specific operations as 
well as on the principles and the thrust of Canada's 
peacekeeping policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, last year, parliament discussed several highly 
visible international events. In October, the House focused its 
attention on the situation in Kosovo. It discussed the 
possibility of Canada's participation in the settlement of that 
terrible conflict. All the political parties were in favour of 
an intervention if no diplomatic solution could be applied to 
this very serious humanitarian crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In April, the House discussed the renewal of Canada's 
participation in the NATO led stabilization force in Bosnia. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1745"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT93"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the parties agreed that Canadian troops should remain in 
Bosnia to continue to bring their valuable support in that poor 
country. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, in April the House of Commons defence and foreign affairs 
committee met to discuss Canada's participation in a peacekeeping 
force in the central African republic with both ministers and the 
media in attendance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The joint meeting unanimously resolved that Canada should 
participate.  These are just a few examples of public discussion, 
but there are many others.  This House debated long into the 
night in February 1998 the participation of the Canadian forces 
in a possible military action in the Persian Gulf. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In February 1997 members debated Canada's role in international 
efforts to sustain a secure and stable environment in Haiti.  We 
also had numerous debates in 1994 and in 1995 on our 
participation in the former Yugoslavia. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, a special joint committee of the House and the Senate 
made a major contribution to the development of our current 
defence policy, which gives the Minister of National Defence and 
the Canadian forces the mandate to defend Canada and to protect 
its interests, while helping restore peace and security in the 
world. All this shows the great importance given by the 
government to parliamentary debates on these issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the end of the cold war, the number and the complexity of 
peacekeeping missions and other peace operations has constantly 
increased and these activities also last longer. In this era of 
ethnic cleansing, genocide, and indescribable human suffering, 
we must react quickly to emerging crises. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thanks to its rapid reaction, Canada has been able to make a 
true contribution on the international scene. One of the lessons 
learned from experiences such as Rwanda, for example, is that 
the success of humanitarian relief operations depends on rapid 
deployment. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have taken these lessons to heart by improving our ability to 
react very quickly.  In 1996, for example, the Department of 
National Defence worked with foreign affairs and international 
trade and the Canadian International Development Agency to create 
a plan for responding quickly to humanitarian disasters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The result of this co-operative effort was the Canadian forces 
disaster assistance response team, DART.  DART is capable of 
responding to a crisis in Canada or almost anywhere in the world 
and we can begin deploying within 48 hours of a government 
decision to send assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was deployed to Honduras in November and in December 1998 as 
part of the international humanitarian response to hurricane 
Mitch.  DART reflects the Canadian forces unique capabilities and 
resources to meet these challenges. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also tried to improve the UN's ability to react in the event 
of a crisis.  We feel this is important because, in our opinion, 
international peacekeeping operations should preferably be the 
result of a multilateral response from the UN. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our government and the Canadian people are proud of the role 
played by Canada as a world leader in peacekeeping operations 
and a faithful partner in times of crisis.  We will continue to 
consult parliament, either by holding debates in the House, or 
by having ministers or other spokespersons appear before 
standing committees.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, indeed it is a pleasure today to speak on Motion No. 
380.  I compliment my colleague from Red Deer on pursuing this 
important issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an issue of accountability and an issue of democracy. 
The United States is even obligated to bring its requests for 
international military involvement in front of Congress.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people's representatives must have the ability to analyse 
whether a group of our soldiers should be going abroad. This 
should not be left as an executive decision.  There is an element 
of accountability and an element of democracy. Many things need 
to be done and we need to illustrate a very important problem. 
The hon. government member mentioned there were debates taking 
place in this House.  The hon. member knows very well that in 
spite of the fact that the debates on a foreign affair took place 
in this House, the decision as to whether troops would be 
deployed were made prior to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a visit to Davos, Switzerland, the Prime Minister made a side 
agreement and publicly stated that somehow he is going to send 
troops to Kosovo.  Was anybody consulted?  Not when the foreign 
affairs minister is saying something completely different. 
Apparently not.  Motion No. 380 would prevent that from 
happening.  It would enable parliament and the people's 
representatives to decide whether troops should be sent for the 
good of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will get to the heart of the matter, that we have a big 
problem in our country.  We have a huge discrepancy between the 
demands placed on our defence department, which is really the 
muscle of our foreign affairs department, the commitments being 
made by our foreign affairs department and the international 
needs being placed on us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not forget our individual security as nations is 
intimately entwined with our collective security. Right now in 
1999 our allies do not look at us as a player, as the hon. 
parliamentary secretary mentioned.  We are not a player anymore 
in international security because our military does not have the 
capability to do the good job it has historically done.  The 
individuals in the military are capable of doing that and they 
are very competent but they are not equipped and tasked to do the 
job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The SCONDVA report that just came out articulately mentioned the 
wide and deep problems affecting our military.  It also gave very 
pragmatic solutions to address those problems.   The minister of 
defence needs to listen to that report.  He needs to enact its 
solutions and resolutions immediately.  If the minister does that 
we can start to fulfil our international obligations and get back 
the international respect we have had for so long. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can we send our troops on so-called peacekeeping missions, 
which is really war by another name, without giving them the 
tools to do the job?  For example, our helicopters are 30 years 
old, towed artillery is 45 years old, nearly going back to World 
War II, and our other artillery is 30 years old.  Our CF-18 
fighters are having so much strain in their superstructures that 
they are breaking down and our 30 year old helicopters are 
falling out of the sky.  Our navy's anti-submarine warfare 
obligations are being severely compromised as are our search and 
rescue capabilities.  Our country desperately needs those 
capabilities. Not only are those capabilities compromised but the 
men and women in our military who put their lives on the line 
every day for our security are put on the line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have an obligation to those men and women in uniform to fund 
them to do the job, to task them to do the job and to ensure the 
leadership is there to do the job.  But as the SCONDVA report 
very articulately mentioned, that is not there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The foreign affairs department has to work hand in glove with 
the defence department.  They cannot work as two entities.  They 
are two halves of the same whole.  I commend the Minister of 
Foreign Affairs for doing a very good job on some of his 
initiatives over the last few years which have brought peace and 
security internationally.  However, he must work with the 
minister of defence and vice versa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From a foreign affairs perspective we must engage in initiatives 
to prevent conflict from happening.  What we see internationally 
is a global impotence in dealing with conflict.  Many meetings 
have taken place.  The Kosovo example is just one or we could go 
back to Rwanda or any number of conflicts in recent years. 
The former Yugoslavia is another example.  We hear a lot of talk, 
a lot of babble and a lot of hot air but we see individuals who 
are sometimes willing flaunt their power in the face of 
international law against their own people causing the death, 
destruction and maiming of hundreds of thousands of people.  In 
the face of that the international community wags its finger 
impotently in their face.  What to they get back? They get no 
response.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Kosovo is a perfect example.  The bottom line is from a foreign 
affairs perspective if we are to face up to tyranny then we 
better have the muscle to back up what we demand of those 
draconian rulers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From a non-military perspective there are foreign affairs 
initiatives that can take place.  Our foreign affairs department 
has the capability of dealing with preventive measures.  We need 
to use our personnel, particularly in the IMF, World Bank and the 
UN, to have an integrated, preventive approach to conflict. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>War needs money.  Choke off the money supply and the ability of 
individuals to engage in war is choked off.  Whether we are 
looking at conflicts that are on the horizon or the many 
conflicts that are taking place right now, they put demands on 
our military.  From Angola, which is about ready to blow up right 
now, to Sierra Leon, which is in a state of complete disarray, to 
central Africa, which is a conflict that threatens to expand and 
involve many countries, a war the likes of which we have not seen 
in decades, to the caucuses, to Kosovo and the former Yugoslavia, 
Indonesia, all these are just some of the hot spots we will 
potentially be asked to participate in. If we are to ask our 
people to participate, we have to fund them properly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask that the foreign affairs minister be wise in his decisions 
concerning involvement.  That is the root of the motion from the 
member for Red Deer. This decision should not be placed in the 
hands of a few but it should be placed in the hands of this 
House, the representative of the people, for it is Canadian 
people who are putting their lives on the line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Returning to our military solutions and looking at the SCONDVA 
report, they require funding back to what they were in 1994. 
Military personnel now are 60,000 less than our capability. Bring 
them back to a fighting force of perhaps 70,000 to 75,000 or at 
least integrate the demands of our defence department with the 
number of personnel available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the pay and allowance issue, there are important concerns 
that need to be addressed.  How can we ask men and women to 
travel half a world away if they are worried about whether their 
wives or husbands have enough food to put on the table to feed 
their children?  That is how serious this issue is and that in 
part is eroding the morale of our forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The power of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank 
to engage in non-military initiatives to prevent conflict has not 
been examined properly.  Those groups need to look at the 
economic power and use that against despots who are willing to 
use their power against individuals for the sake of the pursuit 
of power in the most heinous ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the foreign affairs minister to pursue that with our 
competent people in these organizations and offer the foreign 
affairs minister and the defence minister our help in pursuing 
the effective, pragmatic solutions that we can engage in to make 
Canada an effective contributor to peace internationally, to keep 
our troops safe and also to bring peace and security to a world 
in turmoil.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the motion by the 
member for Red Deer invokes the principle of respect for all 
parliamentarians when the time comes to decide whether or not to 
send an active military mission to another country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It appears that all the opposition parties are prepared to 
support this motion, and the Bloc Quebecois has already said 
that that is what it will do.  Unfortunately, the only arguments 
we have heard against have come from the government, the Liberal 
Party, which is getting ready to vote no for one reason alone. 
The main reason mentioned is that of wanting to retain room to 
manoeuvre so as to be able to act quickly.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion gives us an opportunity to solve a serious problem, 
which is that of asking Canadians and Quebeckers who are 
soldiers, who are members of a military force, to go overseas to 
defend the freedoms in which we believe, to defend democracy. 
We are asking them to put their lives on the line.  These 
troops, who have partners, children, and families, are being 
asked to risk their lives, in most cases, to protect ours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me it is important for these people to know that 
they have the support of not only a small number of people 
sitting at the cabinet table, but of all parliamentarians, 
regardless of their political stripes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the principle behind the Reform Party's motion. Instead 
of attacking that motion, as the Liberal Party is about to do, 
we should support it and refer it to a committee for a more 
thorough review. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sure, this is a motion which can be improved, but the only way 
to do so is to support it so that it can be referred to a 
committee which will conduct a more thorough review and which 
will suggest ways and solutions so that the motion, which would 
become a bill, would address the objections raised by the 
government and allow it to maintain some flexibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To show that this is possible, let me refer to a dissenting 
opinion expressed by the Bloc Quebecois in the report that 
followed the review of Canada's foreign policy by a joint 
special committee. The suggestions made by our party would help 
improve the motion of the Reform Party member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We wrote, among other things, that Canada should encourage the 
setting up of a permanent contingent available to the UN for its 
peacekeeping missions abroad. We also said that there should be 
a limit on the number of troops in that contingent. We thought 
it might be reasonable to have 2,000 or 2,500 troops available 
to the UN for peacekeeping missions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Canada were in favour of the establishment of such a 
contingent, we would not have to come before the House every 
time to ask “Do we use the permanent contingent for this or that 
mission abroad?”  No.  There would be a permanent mandate from 
the House indicating to the UN “You can use these 2,000 or 2,500 
armed service personnel people as you see fit, in peacekeeping 
missions anywhere in the world where freedom and democracy are 
being threatened'?. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having this contingent would give the government the necessary 
latitude to respond to additional requests in specific cases. 
If there were a particular need for more than 2,000 or 2,500 
Canadian military personnel, the government could then come 
before the House and hold a debate, in order to determine 
whether it had the support of the House for Canada's sending 
more than its regular contingent in order to resolve a problem. 
This would be one way of responding to the desire expressed in 
the motion, while at the same time allowing the government to 
maintain this necessary latitude. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With a permanent contingent there could be a response to need at 
all times, without the House having to make a decision, while 
specific additional requirements could be discussed in advance 
in the House, in order to give the Prime Minister a mandate as 
follows: “Mr. Prime Minister, in such and such a country on 
which there has just been a debate in the House, we will agree 
to Canada's having a supplementary contingent in addition to its 
permanent contingent”.  The Prime Minister would then have the 
responsibility to decide the timing for Canada to send this 
additional contingent.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Then all the recognized principles would be in place, principles 
like making the system more democratic and involving all the 
members of this House in the decision to play an active role in 
maintaining world peace. The government would then have a 
perfectly legitimate right to enjoy some leeway when the time 
comes to make a decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More importantly, we want to prevent the government from having 
to side with the United States simply because the President of 
the United States picked up the phone one evening and worked out 
an agreement or discussed some other matter with the Prime 
Minister of Canada. 
We want to make sure that the decisions or arrangements will not 
be made by a select few with a hidden agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When asking our military personnel to put their lives on the 
line to protect us, we ought to make sure that they have a 
mandate that has been given to them in the most democratic 
manner possible, involving as many people as possible. This kind 
of support is essential. Our troops must feel that they have the 
entire nation behind them, and not only the ruling party. In 
terms of quality of life in the military, this is certainly one 
way of showing respect for our troops and to let them know that 
they are emissaries, sent out with the unanimous consent of 
Parliament to protect and defend our lives. That is what this 
motion is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government really wanted to uphold this principle, 
instead of tossing out this motion, it could support it or say 
that it will refer it to committee for further study and we 
could come back to it later, thus respecting the wishes of both 
the opposition and the government.  It is in this spirit that we 
are going to support the motion and we hope that the government 
will give it more serious thought before rejecting it out of 
hand.  This is a unique opportunity to improve our 
decision-making process when world peace is threatened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For Canada, it would represent an opportunity to transcend the 
role of peacekeeper.  That is our international reputation. 
Canadians are viewed as the best peacekeepers in the world but, 
with this sort of solution, we could become the architects of 
peace, and not just its keepers. 
We could create conditions favourable to peacekeeping 
operations, to the advent of international peace.  There is a 
world of difference between keeping the peace and actually 
creating it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that the government will think about what I and my 
colleagues have said and that it will support the motion when it 
is put to a vote next Tuesday.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I 
seek unanimous consent to close off the debate on my motion with 
about a two or three minute presentation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The time for Private 
Members' Business would expire at 6.15 p.m., just for 
clarification, and we have one more speaker at least. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the Chair have it correctly that the hon. member for Red 
Deer would like to have the time extended to 6.18 p.m. to allow 
no more than three minutes for the member who moved the motion to 
sum up? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is correct. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Robert Bertrand:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would simply like to 
clarify something.  If I understand correctly, we have only one 
speaker, which will take us to 6.15 p.m. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> Yes, approximately. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No later than 6.20 p.m. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House has heard the suggestion of the hon. member.  Is that 
agreed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  We will go to the 
hon. member for Churchill for seven minutes and then to the hon.

<P><A NAME="LINK249"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
extend my support and speak in favour of the private member's 
motion that has been brought forward by the hon. member for Red 
Deer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion speaks to our democratic right as members of 
parliament who represent the constituents of the country.  All 
301 duly elected members of the House represent Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My first experience was the debate on the deployment of troops 
to the Persian Gulf.  As a young member of parliament coming to 
the House I was not struck by the immense responsibility I had as 
an individual in voting to deploy our young men and women to a 
war zone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Entering a war zone is a very unique situation.  A lot of us 
have never experienced it.  We have never taken up arms.  We have 
never sacrificed our lives or have been ready to take somebody 
else's life.  These are the issues we are talking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member has highlighted active military mission.  That 
is a confrontation where anybody's life could be taken at any 
time.  Other missions are not active military missions. Cleaning 
up the storm struck regions of South America or an ice storm or a 
snow storm are not active military missions but can be done 
world-wide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take this responsibility further and share with members a 
vision of Canada that I have been generously sharing for the last 
while.  I refer to the unity, the symbolism and the design of 
this democratic structure.  The House was designed so that both 
sides were two sword lengths apart.  The symbolism of war 
designed the architecture of this room.  There is no unity in 
this room.  We are designed to fight, the government and the 
opposition.  Even the words are antagonistic and protagonistic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a budget to renovate this room over the next 15 years. 
Why do we not renovate the library?  The building is a circular 
one.  We could take the books off the shelves and store them in a 
safe place on the Hill.  If we cleared out that room we would 
have a circular room in which to make decisions in a non-partisan 
way on sending our men and women to war.  We could shed our 
political stripes.  As a member representing the people of 
Churchill River I could cast my vote on whether to send troops to 
an active military front.  It would be not as a New Democrat, a 
Reform member or a Liberal member.  We could shed that at the 
door.  A crucial issue of calling our men and women to war should 
be done in a united Canadian way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our system of government was adopted from Britain.  A symbol of 
the circle has been held sacred by the aboriginal people for 
generations on the land that we occupy now.  Why can we not adopt 
a symbol of that unity to unify the country to collectively make 
a conscious decision when we send members of armed forces to 
active military missions?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other decisions could be made in that room.  I want to draw 
attention to one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new millennium is coming.  Our young men and women, our 
children and the generations to come, for the youth who might 
take their rightful place here, let us design structures of 
governance that involve them without any strings or preconditions 
attached. We must make decisions in that way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My support for the motion comes from our making decisions as 
members of parliament to send our people to war.  Let us envision 
ourselves in our places of decision making and maybe that is a 
rightful place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By using the wooden mace yesterday we acknowledged that this 
place burned down and only the library was left standing.  It 
persevered a test on the Hill.  For that strength of collective 
unity in this country, let us consider it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK250"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think all 
of us were certainly touched by the comments of the member for 
Churchill River. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is fitting to end the debate on that tone when we are talking 
about the lives of Canadian men and women and active military 
missions.  We should not mix it up. We are all proud of our 
forces.  We should not mix up the ice storms and various other 
disasters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about going to war and we are saying that the 
Canadian parliament should decide that.  We owe that to our 
troops.  We owe that to the morale of our troops.  We should let 
them know that 301 of us are behind them when they go on a 
mission like this.  That is the purpose of this motion.  To 
change it in any other way is simply wrong and misleading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support peacekeeping missions.  We support peacemaking 
missions.  We believe that our troops do exceptionally well at 
them. We are simply asking that when lives are being threatened, 
bring it to the House so we can debate it here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I go back to the foreign affairs minister and remind members 
across the way that prior to 1993, as the foreign affairs critic, 
he made the point over and over again that the previous 
government did not bring the decision to parliament when we 
decided to send troops into war.  He condemned the government for 
that.  I have read those speeches over and over again.  I thought 
he meant it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, last week when the Prime Minister said we were sending 
troops to Kosovo, our foreign affairs minister contradicted him 
by saying “No, we should go to parliament”.  I still believe he 
has that mission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that on Tuesday when we vote I at least see the foreign 
affairs minister stand on what he has said so many times and as 
recently as last week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  It being 6.19 p.m., 
pursuant to order made earlier today, all questions necessary to 
dispose of Motion No. 380 are deemed to have been put and the 
recorded division deemed demanded and deferred until Tuesday, 
February 9, 1999 at the expiry of the time provided for 
Government Orders.
