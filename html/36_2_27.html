</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cannis (Scarborough Centre, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
November is diabetes month in Canada and last Thursday was 
diabetes day on Parliament Hill.  On this day representatives of 
the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation met with members of parliament 
to inform them of the facts surrounding diabetes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was alarming to learn of the seriousness of the disease and I 
feel it is imperative that we educate ourselves and the public on 
the impact this debilitating disease has on our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Diabetes is a chronic, genetically determined disease that 
affects every organ system in the body.  The disease affects over 
two million Canadians.  It is diagnosed in an estimated 60,000 
Canadians every year and it is the fastest growing preventable 
disease in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recognizing the critical impact of diabetes the government 
recently announced a five year $115 million Canadian diabetes 
strategy to help prevent and control the disease. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Representatives of the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation have asked 
that members of parliament join them in support of finding a cure 
by committing to stay informed and informing others of the 
devastating health, social and economic impacts of diabetes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I pledge my support to help in this major public health issue 
and encourage others to do the same.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
half of the respondents to my Surrey Central survey said they 
were not satisfied with the federal government's efforts to 
prevent Canadian children and youth from smoking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While speaking to many students at schools I have seen 12 and 13 
year olds smoking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our youth have been targeted by tobacco companies and still this 
government is not doing enough to prevent smoking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians do not trust the Liberal government to deal with 
previously secret information from tobacco companies about 
efforts to sell tobacco and get Canadians hooked.  The health 
minister is using smoke and mirrors by hiring the tobacco 
insider.  Canadians are not fooled for a minute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian tobacco prices are below those of the United States and 
that causes cigarette smuggling.  But Canadians know that this 
government refuses to combat cigarette smuggling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals are not serious about preventing 45,000 deaths a 
year caused by smoking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals talk the talk, but they do not walk the walk.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Harvard (Charleswood St. James—Assiniboia,

hours in training sessions and competitions, working to represent 
our country at the Olympics, only to have their dreams dashed by 
what one commentator described as dirty politics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am referring to the five young women from the Winnipeg based 
Canadian Rhythmic Gymnastics Team. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The team was recently denied a well earned Olympic berth by the 
International Gymnastics Federation.  The position was awarded to 
Brazil, despite the fact that the Canadian team finished fourth 
at the Four Continents Competition in June.  Brazil finished 
sixth.  Canada won the bronze at this summer's Pan Am Games in 
Winnipeg and placed 13th at last month's World Championships, 
while Brazil finished a distant 20th. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Rhythmic Gymnastics Association has launched an 
appeal of this unfair decision.  I urge the federal government to 
throw its full weight behind that appeal.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the week of November 22 to 29 is National AIDS Awareness Week in 
Canada.  By the end of 1997 Health Canada had reported a total of 
15,528 AIDS cases since the beginning of the epidemic. 
Approximately 70% of those cases have ended in death.  Whether by 
direct or indirect contact, many Canadians have either been 
affected by the disease or are close to someone who has.  It is a 
reality that far too many people have to deal with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is important, especially during this week, to 
emphasize the risks and dangers of this horrible disease.  Only 
through public education and awareness can we even attempt to 
solve this problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In recent years the level of reported cases has dropped, but 
there is still much work to do and ground to cover.

<P><A NAME="LINK11"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Raymonde Folco (Laval West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Quebec 
Minister of Education made a priceless comment yesterday: that 
the millennium scholarship system was a two-tier system.  Really 
now.  The students themselves are criticizing the Government of 
Quebec for the way it has been handling this matter in recent 
months.  They are demanding a solution that will be in their 
best interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The PQ government, finding itself backed into a corner, is 
trying to pass the buck back to the Canadian government, but the 
students' response is to tell it to stop digging in its heels 
needlessly.  The Quebec Minister of Education must take this 
matter seriously, and quit trying to score political points at 
the expense of the students of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, the Government of Quebec must make its true intentions 
clear on the use to which it will be putting the money we will 
be paying to Quebecers in the years to come.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard M. Harris (Prince George—Bulkley Valley, 
Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, what a difference a few years and a 
promotion make.  Not too long ago the hon. member for Mississauga 
Centre was portraying herself as a great defender of free speech. 
No one in this place was about to muzzle her.  No, siree, Bob. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now she aims her broadsides at her own colleagues, members of 
the so-called Italian caucus, MPs she believes are guilty of 
treason against the government for daring to do their job, 
Liberal backbenchers who from time to time slip into committees 
actually intent on asking ministers a tough question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Shame on the hon. member for Mississauga Centre for denigrating 
fellow MPs by attacking those who speak for their constituents 
and shame on this government for once again making it clear that 
loyalty to cabinet ministers is far more important than MPs 
accurately representing their own constituents.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Godfrey (Don Valley West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
today we recognize the 10th anniversary of the all-party 
resolution to work toward the elimination of child poverty by the 
year 2000.  Today is no day for celebration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Campaign 2000 noted in a report made public today—and I 
recognize the presence of some of the members of Campaign 2000 in 
the gallery this afternoon—as a country we have collectively 
failed to reduce child poverty rates over the last decade. 
Indeed the number of poor children in Canada has increased. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But nor should today be a day of mourning or condemnation.  As 
the recent Speech from the Throne indicated, children have become 
the top priority of this government.  Let today rather be a day 
of reflection and rededication; reflection on our failure 
certainly, but also a recommitment to our national mission of 
improving the lives of all of our children.

metro, the choir has given more than 750 concerts.  It have just

TFO, so long as Quebec subscribers did not have to pay extra. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A fine mess in order to actually say no to the arrival of TFO in

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
province-wide referendum in British Columbia on the Nisga'a 
agreement should have been supported by all opposition members in 
parliament.  It was the federal Progressive Conservative 
government which brought in the federal Referendum Act, 1992 and 
sought the views of Canadians on the precedent setting 
Charlottetown accord.  For its part, the New Democratic Party 
professes to have a special commitment to democracy since it was 
its predecessor, the CCF, that supported such measures as 
referenda, citizens' initiatives and recall.  And of course the 
Bloc Quebecois is constantly lecturing the House about the 
democratic rights of the people of Quebec to decide their own 
future on constitutional issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet yesterday when the Reform Party presented a motion to hold a 
referendum in British Columbia on the precedent setting Nisga'a 
treaty, where were the opposition parties?  Make no mistake, 
their hypocrisy will not be forgotten.  Shame on them all.

Quebecers promising distinct society and anything else that would

</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that Quebecers show signs of weariness with constitutional

not respect the judgment of the supreme court. The Prime Minister 
of Canada heard last week that the premier of Quebec said that 
there will be a referendum during this mandate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister of Canada has the responsibility and, I hope,

B.C.  That was very important and the Reform Party voted against 
that at that moment.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister's personal reputation has always been lowest 
in the province that knows him best, in Quebec.  He has been 
dismissed by the sovereignists as Trudeau's lackey; and he has

referendum in 1995.  Now the Prime Minister is trying to salvage 
that reputation by this misguided initiative.

followed what members of the Reform Party wanted?  Doreen would 
have had to pay higher employment insurance premiums because they 
were not going to cut them for anybody except employers.  Doreen 
would have had to pay higher personal taxes because their cuts 
would not have come in until the year 2000.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is obvious 
that the Prime Minister intends to change the rules of the game 
in Quebec's next referendum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the evening of the 1995 referendum, the Prime Minister of 
Canada said, and I quote: “In a democracy the people are always 
right. Tonight there is only one winner: the people”.  On that 
evening, he recognized that 50.5% was a democratic result. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is for the Prime Minister. 
How does he square what he said on the evening of the last

<P><A NAME="LINK70"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
is not my wish to change the rules of the referendum.  The 
Government of Quebec can ask whatever question it wishes.  But 
we have an obligation to negotiate and we want the question to 
be clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A clear question would be:  “Do you want Quebec to become a 
country?”  That is clear.  And I think I would agree with the 
person who suggested it.  This was the question suggested by 
Bloc Quebecois adviser Jacques Parizeau in the September 3, 
1998, issue of <I>Le Devoir</I>.  I have no problem with a clear 
question like that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Prime

his suggestion is a very good one.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

that they are also abandoning Anna because Anna would not have 
got anything out of the Reform Party.

tax cuts from the Reform Party.  Her EI premiums would have gone 
up because she would not have received satisfaction from the

Speaker, the Canadian people are entitled to an enlightened 
debate on the issue of taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What they have heard from the Reform Party is a tax plan that 
would call for a $52 billion surplus in three years.  That is $40 
billion more than private sector economists said the country 
would have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What that means is that the Reform Party is saying there will be 
$40 billion in cuts to our social programs.  What will Anna do 
without a decent education system and without a decent health 
care system?  What will Anna do when the social fabric of the 
country is gutted by the Reform Party?  That is basic issue 
confronting Canadians.

this because she received a petition with 6,500 signatures.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member will be pleased to know 
that the replacement of the Sea King helicopter is our number one 
priority.  We are in fact in the midst of a procurement strategy 
development so that we can replace them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Meanwhile, we will make sure that those Sea Kings, as long as 
they have to fly, will be safe for our people to fly.  We have a 
very high maintenance and inspection standard in this country 
with our Canadian military.  As soon as we can, we will get those 
new helicopters. 
<P><A NAME="LINK107"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland—Colchester, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is certainly appropriate that the minister talked about safety 
inspections, because yesterday we talked about the worn out Sea 
Kings, the rusty Auroras and today we find out that both of the 
Hercules planes failed when they went to East Timor.  Hon. 
members should listen to the problems:  faulty brakes, damaged 
windows, cracked tailpipes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I sold used cars for 18 years and this plane would not pass a 
highway inspection.  If a plane cannot pass a highway safety 
inspection, how can we expect it to fly in the air? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When will the minister stop making a laughing stock of the 
Canadian air force and put money into the airplanes? 
<P><A NAME="LINK108"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think the hon. member should stop 
making a laughing stock of the Canadian air force because our 
personnel performed very well in East Timor.  Our personnel 
delivered over 2 million pounds of goods.  They delivered over 
2,000 people into East Timor to help the people of East Timor. 
They actually engaged in some 35% to 40% of all of the transport 
missions in that area of operation.  That is a big achievement.

animated question period. We had a minister using a word which 
was withdrawn, and we had another member who, in exuberance, made 
a comment.  I understand how these things happen, but this

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Before we get into any kind of

to listen to whatever any member has to say.  However, at this

words? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to appeal to

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  What the minister or anyone else said in the 
House, for this particular matter, is irrelevant.  I will be 
happy to hear what the hon. member has to say as soon as I settle 
this point.  This is simply an appeal to the hon. member to 
withdraw those words and then I will hear whatever the hon. 
member has to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will withdraw and I

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I take it that the hon. member is requesting 
a question of privilege arising from question period.  I will 
hear the hon. member for Langley—Abbotsford. 
<P><A NAME="LINK115"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
many times during question period ministers seriously 
misrepresent the positions of parties in the House, not just the 
Reform Party but other parties, in their responses.  I think you 
will find today that what the Minister of Justice said concerning 
pedophilia was directed at the Reform Party.  It was intended to 
be negative in connotation.  It was intended to embarrass 
nationally the party that has fought time and time and time again 
against such things as sexual exploitation, pedophilia and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to get the transcript from today's question period.  I 
want to table it in the House and if, Mr. Speaker, you find that 
is so, I want a national public apology from a person who has 
acted totally irresponsibly in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  If there was something that 
was said in the House of Commons which is in <I>Hansard</I>, we 
will have a look at it.  It is at that time that we will bring up 
whether there is a question of privilege or a point of order.

</I></B></P><P align=left>From what I have heard here today, we have had strong debate on

at another time when we have the information in front of us, I 
will be happy to hear him.  For the time being, I prefer to let 
this point sit exactly where it is until we get some kind of 
written evidence in front of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member have another point of order? 
<P><A NAME="LINK116"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise on a point of order.  I ask for the Speaker's guidance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the position of a party is misrepresented in the House to 
the point where any honest evaluation of the situation is that 
the misrepresentation amounts to a lie— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl:</B>  I am just talking in theory.  If we ask 
that something be done because of that, what we are left 
with—and this is the dilemma—is that to allege that someone has 
lied is a contempt of the House, but to actually lie is not. 
Look at the dilemma it puts us in.  When we say “But that is a 
lie”, you, Mr. Speaker, say that is unparliamentary.  Yet, the 
lie occurred over there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  When it comes to debate, on one 
side or the other, we are going to have various sides put out. 
This is a matter of debate.  I am not here, surely, to judge on 
the quality of a question or an answer or a debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I do not expect to be interrupted.  Please give 
me a chance to explain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think what we have is a matter of debate.  Words were said.  I 
would like to hear or read what the words are before I go any 
further with this matter. 
<P><A NAME="LINK117"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a 
point of order.  I sat and listened very carefully to the back 
and forth which took place during question period.  I heard the 
Minister of Justice point across the way at members of the Reform 
Party and say “This is the party that supports pedophilia in 
this country”.  That is what I heard.  That is on the record.  I 
would suggest that those words are not a matter of debate.  That 
is slander and liable.  If those words were repeated outside— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Order, please.  The hon. member has made an 
allegation that another member has said “This is the party of 
pedophilia”.  Is that correct? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have just received the transcript. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will wait for the official transcript of these words, but I 
want to deal with another matter.

reported back to the Chair were that the minister looked at the 
Reform Party, pointed her finger and said “This is the party 
that supports pedophilia in this country”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  We could deal with this when we get the

said these words, then I would ask her to withdraw those words if 
she said them.  She is here now.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>NATIONAL DEFENCE 
</H4><P align=left>

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I am in receipt of four 
applications for an emergency debate.  The four of them are about 
the maritime helicopter replacement program.  They are marked as 
to the time I received them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first one I received was from the member for 
Compton—Stanstead.  I will hear him and then I will make my 
ruling on it.  I have a copy of his letter here which I have 
already read.  Therefore, I would ask him to be quite succinct in 
his presentation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK158"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Price (Compton—Stanstead, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
think it is rather straight forward just from hearing what the 
minister had to say today.  As usual, he was skating around the 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point is that through the Access to Information Act we 
received the actual briefing notes of the minister. In those 
notes it is stated quite clearly that there is an eight year time 
slot from the time of ordering the helicopters and the time that 
they will be delivered.  At the present time, the Sea King 
helicopters with their life expansion program only go to the year 
2005.  Therefore we have a three year window with no maritime 
helicopters.  That is what we are getting at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a huge safety matter with our armed forces and the 
Canadian people.  That is the main reason we would like to have 
it debated in the House, but there is a lot more to it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK159"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Basically from what the 
four members have said and what you basically have here, it seems 
to me at this point at least that they do not meet the proper 
criteria for an emergency debate. 
<P><A NAME="LINK160"></A></P>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>CHILD POVERTY 
</H4><P align=left>

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I am in receipt of a notice of motion under 
Standing Order 52 from the hon. member for Vancouver East.  I 
received her letter earlier today.  I have read it so I would ask 
her to be quite succinct in putting forth her point. 
<P><A NAME="LINK161"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
will try to be very brief.  I rise on a very solemn and serious 
matter.  As you know I wrote you a letter to seek leave to have 
an emergency debate under Standing Order 52(2). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today is the 10th anniversary of the unanimous resolution that 
was passed in the House of Commons to seek to eliminate child 
poverty by the year 2000.  Maybe the Speaker himself was present 
in the House that day.  It was an honourable resolution that was 
made 10 years ago. Regrettably, today we are in a situation where 
not only have we not made any progress in this regard, a goal 
that was put together by all members of the House, but the 
situation has become much worse, to the extent that there are now 
1.4 million children living in poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must not forget that those children are not alone.  They are 
attached to families. Tens of thousands of families are living in 
poverty in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the 1.4 million children living in poverty this is 
definitely an emergency.  For the 90% of single mothers of young 
children, it is an emergency.  For the 300,000 children who make 
use of food banks, it is definitely an emergency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the past two days, citizens right across the country have 
been holding vigils and meetings to address the emergency. Today, 
as the leader of the NDP pointed out, bells were ringing across 
the country at noon to draw to the attention of all members of 
the House the fact that the resolution has not met its goal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that members of parliament need an opportunity to 
report on the scale of the problem in our own communities, to 
question the government on why this emergency now exists and to 
set out some recommendations about what actions need to be taken 
to help poor kids in the country.

<A HREF="#LINKT18"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I urge that you grant the emergency 
debate because this did come from parliament and from all of us 
working together.  Here we are 10 years later in a very sorry 
state of affairs.  I think this is something that really 
necessitates an emergency debate.  I would ask you to consider 
that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK162"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  When I received the letter today I 
thought about it quite well.  It is basically what you have said 
in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, according to our criteria, at least at this time, it 
does not meet the criteria for an emergency debate today.  This 
does not mean that it could not be considered at some other time.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said: Mr. Speaker, Bill C-8 is entitled, as hon. members will 
remember, “an act respecting marine conservation areas”. It was 
introduced by the Minister of Canadian Heritage and its purpose 
is to provide a legal framework for the creation of 28 marine 
conservation areas representative of each of the Canadian 
ecosystems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Saguenay—St. Lawrence marine park is the 29th marine 
conservation area, but is not governed by this legislation since 
it has its own legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois supports measures to protect the environment. 
More particularly, the Bloc Quebecois reminds the government of 
its support for the government when it proposed passing 
legislation to create the Saguenay—St. Lawrence marine park. 
Moreover, the Bloc Quebecois knows that the Quebec government is 
launching initiatives aimed at protecting the environment, 
particularly the marine floor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Quebec government is also open to working in co-operation 
with the federal government, as evidenced by the third phase of 
the St. Lawrence action plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the Bloc Quebecois is opposed to this bill for two 
reasons: first, instead of relying on dialogue, as in the case 
of the Saguenay—St. Lawrence marine park, the federal government 
wants to create marine conservation areas, regardless of the 
fact that Quebec has jurisdiction over the protection of its 
territory and of the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second reason is the fact that Heritage Canada is proposing 
to establish a new structure, the marine conservation areas, 
which will duplicate Fisheries and Oceans Canada's marine 
protected areas and Environment Canada's marine protection 
zones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As you know, committee hearings were held on this bill, and many 
witnesses were heard. After hearing these witnesses and looking 
at the amendments put forward by the government and the other 
opposition parties, the Bloc Quebecois wants to tell the House 
that its position has not changed with regard to this bill. We 
are still opposed 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, there is duplication of responsibilities between 
Fisheries and Oceans and Heritage Canada. Also, it is unclear 
whether marine conservation areas could be established based on 
the same principle that guided the creation of the 
Saguenay—St. Lawrence marine park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support the spirit of the bill, which is to preserve sample 
marine areas for future generations, and we believe this should 
be the responsibility of the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind members that, in his testimony, the director general of 
Parks Canada, Mr. Tom Lee, in response to a question asked by a 
government member last February, stated that, in Canada, oceans 
are the responsibility of the Department of Fisheries and 
Oceans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To date, every coastal community group that has come before the 
committee spoke out against this bill. These people, whether 
they were fishermen or natives, all said in their own way that 
this bill duplicates the work of Fisheries and Oceans Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently, the advisory committee responsible for conducting the 
feasibility study on the establishment of a marine conservation 
area in Bonavista Bay and Notre Dame Bay, in Newfoundland, ended 
its work because, and I quote from the news release issued by 
Heritage Canada in March, “a large number of residents, 
particularly fishermen, are concerned about the impact of the 
establishment of a marine conservation area on their way of 
life”. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1540"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT20"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps what would be necessary in order to achieve the 
objectives of creating marine conservation areas would be to 
broaden the concept of marine protected areas as currently 
defined by the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to us today, as it did when all this began, that this 
avenue would be far preferable to bringing in new legislation, a 
new structure, new regulations, which to all intents and 
purposes have been rejected by all population groups affected 
who came to speak at the committee hearings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that a Reform Party colleague is proposing an amendment 
to restore to the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans the 
responsibility for these marine conservation areas.  Alas, his 
amendment to make the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans 
responsible for marine conservation areas would not be enough, 
on its own, to avoid the duplication between marine protected 
areas and marine conservation areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What would have to be amended to include the concept underlying 
marine conservation areas would be the Oceans Act.  The Reform 
member's amendment does not integrate the two responsibilities. 
It keeps them distinct from one another, and merely gives them 
both to the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans.  Members must 
understand that we do not find this sufficient. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, there is no provision, in either the bill or the 
amendments moved by the government, to guarantee the territorial 
integrity of Quebec will be respected, once the bill has been 
passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, the federal and Quebec governments do not 
see eye to eye on the ownership of certain sea floors, 
particularly in the estuary and the Gulf of St. Lawrence Gulf. 
It is therefore quite obvious that this bill will end up in a 
collision of jurisdictions between the interests of the federal 
government and the clearly legitimate ones of the government of 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all these reasons, the Bloc Quebecois is opposed to Bill C-8, 
because it does not give explicit recognition to the territorial 
integrity of Quebec and because it constitutes duplication of 
what is already being done with the marine protected areas by 
the Department of Fisheries and Oceans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois in opposing Bill C-8 is clearly giving 
expression to what the people of Quebec indicated as their best 
interests and to what the many witnesses appearing before the 
heritage committee indicated as their best interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to add a personal note.  All too often, as it has 
done in the past and still does now, the federal government, 
with the best intentions in the world, decides it has exclusive 
knowledge and authority to put forward bills that have merit, 
but that do not meet the expectations and needs of the people 
concerned.  Worse, the government tends often to duplicate 
efforts, structures and responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are once again facing a similar situation. 
It is unfortunate that the government, once again with good 
intentions, has failed to realize that the opposition to this 
bill is not on the merit of things but rather on the way they 
are treated.  It is often said that approach is all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government could, in the light of what went on in 
committee, reorganize the bill to reorient it toward the proper 
authority, especially, to combine two concepts, by extending the 
prerogatives of the Department of Fisheries and Oceans.  At the 
same time, the government should make specific provision in this 
bill for the respect of Quebec's territorial integrity and its 
authority in a certain number of jurisdictions including that of 
the floor of the Gulf of St. Lawrence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that the government will understand my remarks and take 
them into account.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin—Swan River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to take part in the debate at report stage of Bill 
C-8, which is really the old Bill C-48, the Marine Conservation 
Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the Reform Party oppose the amendments put forth by the 
Bloc Quebecois in terms of deleting numerous parts of the bill. 
In fact this bill has the right idea.  There is no doubt about 
it, but the government takes the wrong approach.  Reform should 
support this bill only if its amendments would be approved.  I 
would certainly think at this time that this bill, if unamended, 
is better to be defeated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In an age when everyone in the world is becoming more aware of 
the environment, it makes sense to have good legislation in place 
to preserve and to take care of our environment.  I said good 
legislation.  To create good legislation requires a lot of work 
on the part of legislators.  It means gathering good data.  It 
means consulting all the stakeholders.  It means having many 
meetings throughout the country.  It means keeping people 
informed.  Above all, it means being honest and upfront with 
everyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Good legislation does not isolate parts of the country.  Good 
legislation creates good debate and usually brings people 
together to resolve conflicts.  Good legislation does not leave 
groups out on the edge hanging on for dear life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately Bill C-8 is not a good example of good 
legislation.  It leaves too many stakeholders hanging.  Bill C-8 
leaves too many stakeholders at risk and Bill C-8 does not have 
any balance.  It is too favourable to environmentalists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, on the whole issue of consultation, the government 
brags about the way it consults people.  Unfortunately, sending 
out a letter at the initial stage of the discussion documents is 
not the whole process.  It may be a good beginning, but there is 
no follow through on the government's consultation process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The one principal question that was not answered was whether 
this legislation was really necessary, considering that Canada 
already has at least 36 federal acts and 20 provincial and 
territorial acts, together with numerous international 
conventions and accords that relate to the protection and use of 
the marine environment and marine resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As recent as the Oceans Act of 1996, under the provisions of 
part 2, section 35(2) the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans is 
mandated to: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—lead and co-ordinate the development and implementation of a 
national system of marine protected areas on behalf of the 
Government of Canada. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This allows the minister to make regulations, first, designating 
marine protected areas and, second, prescribing measures that may 
include but not be limited to the zoning of marine protected 
areas, the prohibition of classes of activities within marine 
protected areas and any other matters consistent with the purpose 
of the designation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further to that a clear process is laid out for the minister to 
develop and implement a national strategy for the management of 
estuarine coastal and marine ecosystems in water that belongs to 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I go back to the time when this bill was called the Marine Parks 
Protection Act.  Actually that is more accurate because this 
piece of legislation is about protection.  It is beyond 
conservation.  In other words the legislation is that basically 
once an area is designated that is it; hands off forever. 
No one can deal with it.  It becomes a protected area for the 
rest of the time we are on the face of the earth.  Of course 
there is always a chance the government can make regulations and 
change them as well.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party supports good legislation in environmental 
protection.  It believes in sustainable development.  It believes 
in balanced legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill affects five other ministries and yet not once did we 
hear from any of the other ministries when it was at committee 
stage.  The bill directly impacts the ministries of the 
environment, natural resources, Indian and northern affairs, 
oceans and fisheries, and transport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unfortunate that we do not have a lot of time to say much 
about the bill.  I guess I will have to wait until third reading 
stage.  There are many concerns that the Canadian people need to 
hear about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I indicated, there are at least 36 pieces of federal acts 
that already look after conservation areas.  This point is taken 
from the discussion paper of August 1998 called <I>Our Marine 
Protection Areas: A Strategy for Canada's Pacific Coast</I>.  In 
it there is an appendix which lists all federal and provincial 
statutory powers for protecting marine areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government realizes there are so many acts and 
regulations already in place, why would we need another one?  I 
believe we do not really need another one because of the ones 
already in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill impacts the Department of Fisheries and Oceans and 
Environment Canada.  The mandate of Environment Canada is to 
protect coastal marine habitats regarding marine migratory bird 
sanctuaries that are heavily used by birds for breeding, feeding, 
migration and overwintering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill goes beyond just protecting what is on the water and 
underneath the water but also what is above the water.  It is 
unfortunate that we do not have time to discuss the impact that 
has on the aviation traffic in the country.  Imagine having a no 
fly zone in designated protection areas along the west coast 
where mountains come right up to the water's edge.  I think that 
would be a little dangerous for aircraft travel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>May I close by saying that this is not properly a parks bill. As 
I indicated originally it was a parks bill under the marine parks 
protection act but people perceive parks in a very different 
fashion than they do protected conservation areas.  The bill is 
really an environmental bill.  The official opposition believes 
in sustainable development and the management of the environment 
to both preserve biodiversity and conserve the environment of 
Canadians present and future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this bill the heritage minister expands her domain and 
encroaches on what is more properly the responsibility of the 
Minister of Environment, her old portfolio.  The minister wants 
to sidestep the proper role of parliament with the insertion of 
the Henry VIII clauses that allow cabinet to amend the act more 
or less at will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The act requires provincial governments to obey it, and 
enforcement officers may arrest without warrant and enter private 
property without permission.  To conclude, the bill gives 
superintendents of parks way too much power and too much 
authority to make decisions for which they are not really 
accountable.

former Bill C-48, introduced by the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage, has now reached the report stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before going any further, I think it would be appropriate to 
explain briefly to the public what Bill C-8 is all about.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-8, an act respecting marine conservation areas, seeks to 
define the legal framework for the establishment of 28 marine 
conservation areas, so as to protect and preserve natural marine 
areas that are representative of the oceans and of the Great 
Lakes, to promote public knowledge, appreciation and enjoyment 
of this marine heritage, and to pass it on to future 
generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Saguenay—St. Lawrence marine park is the 29th marine 
conservation area. It was officially established on June 12  and 
it has its own legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois totally supports the spirit of conservation 
of this bill. Both Quebec and Canada have marine areas that need 
to be protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, in November 1998 I spoke to this same bill, 
then known as Bill C-48. In light of all the criticism, both by 
the opposition parties and at the heritage committee hearings, 
where almost every coastal group spoke out against Bill C-48, we 
could have expected some major changes in Bill C-8. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite all the criticism, no changes were made to Bill C-48. 
Again, the government opposite has decided to act alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take a closer look at this bill, in order to uncover the 
trickery, centralizing tendencies and total confusion that it 
will help this government unleash. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, there are the usual problems of jurisdiction.  One would 
think this government had never heard of the constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-8 will give the federal government authority to establish 
marine conservation areas with no regard for the jurisdictions 
of Quebec and the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But one of the prerequisites to the federal government's setting 
up a marine conservation area is that it own the proposed site. 
Clause 5(2) of Bill C-8 reads as follows: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—the Governor in Council is satisfied that Her Majesty in right 
of Canada has clear title to or an unencumbered right of 
ownership in the lands to be included in the marine conservation 
area, other than such lands situated within the exclusive 
economic zone of Canada. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is hard to be clearer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Paradoxically, it is expressly written in the Constitution, 
1867, that the management and sale of public lands come under 
the exclusive jurisdiction of the provinces.  Section 92, 
subsections (5), (13) and (16) of the British North America Act, 
1867, provides, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In each Province the Legislature may exclusively make Laws in 
relation to Matters coming within the Classes of Subjects next 
herein-after enumerated; that is to say,— 
</I></B></P><P align=left>5. The Management and Sale of the Public Lands belonging to the 
Province and of the Timber and Wood thereon; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>13. Property and Civil Rights in the Province; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>16. Generally all Matters of a merely local or private Nature in 
the Province. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, section 92A of the BNA Act provides, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(1) In each province, the legislature may exclusively make laws 
in relation to 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(<I>a</I>) exploration for non-renewable natural resources in the 
province; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(<I>b</I>) development, conservation and management of non-renewable 
natural resources and forestry resources in the province, 
including laws in relation to the rate of primary production 
therefrom. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we can see, the Constitution clearly recognizes that the 
management and sale of crown land are matters of exclusive 
provincial jurisdiction. It falls under exclusive provincial 
jurisdiction. That is all there is to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, how do you explain this clear and voluntary violation of the 
Constitution by the federal government? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is even harder to understand given that the Government of 
Quebec and the federal government have already signed a 
co-operation agreement in this respect. Under the agreement 
entitled “St. Lawrence action plan, phase III”, which they both 
signed, both levels of government agreed to co-operate in order 
to protect ecosystems in the Saguenay—St. Lawrence marine park and 
in the St. Lawrence River.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the federal government all of a sudden trying to 
unilaterally create marine conservation areas in Quebec? Why is 
the federal government refusing to use the same model of 
co-operation as the one designed by both levels of government for 
the Saguenay—St. Lawrence marine park? This is another example of 
co-operation between the federal government and Quebec to create 
a marine park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Saguenay—St. Lawrence marine park was created in 1997, 
pursuant to mirror legislation allowing both the federal and the 
provincial governments to carry out their duties, without any 
transfer of land. 
So, why not use these two examples, which work very well?  The 
federal government is taking wicked pleasure from meddling in 
the jurisdictions of the provinces.  This is intolerable and 
unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the Minister of Canadian Heritage wants to do is 
destructive.  What she wants is to appropriate Quebec territory 
by circumventing Quebec's jurisdictions over the environment. 
She wants carte blanche to create marine conservation areas on 
marine floors, knowing full well that she is blatantly 
contravening the Canadian constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to contravening the constitution, the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage and the entire government are busy creating a 
real bureaucratic nightmare in which overlap among the various 
federal departments will create a real mess of red tape. 
Let us take a long look at this real mess. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government wants to create marine conservation areas 
through Canadian Heritage.  However, the marine protection zones 
are managed by Fisheries and Oceans, and the marine and wildlife 
reserves are managed by Environment Canada.  I think this 
government definitely needs a quick update on organizational 
structures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me quote the remarks of Patrick McGuinness, the 
vice-president of the Fisheries Council of Canada, which he made 
when he appeared before the Standing Committee on Canadian 
Heritage, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there's a need for legislation to establish marine 
conservation areas, it is our view that such legislation should 
be incorporated into the recently passed Oceans Act under the 
responsibility of the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans and 
administered by the Department of Fisheries and Oceans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is 
simply inefficient, cumbersome public administration to bring 
forward this MCA initiative in its own act under the 
responsibility of a separate minister and a separate department. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. McGuinness even proposed the bill be simply withdrawn. 
Naturally, however, in the view of the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage and the government, Mr. McGuinness knows absolutely 
nothing about marine areas.  In fact, as far as the Liberals are 
concerned, Mr. McGuinness is a real dolt. 
We know that most witnesses who appeared before the committee 
were opposed to Bill C-8.  Why then does the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage not simply withdraw it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all of these reasons, it is my responsibility as a 
parliamentarian to vote against this bill.  Bill C-8 is a real 
violation of provincial jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well as violating provincial authority, the majority of the 
Quebec and Canadian public has also spoken out against this 
bill.  As a democrat, and the member of parliament for the 
Quebec riding of Laurentides, I cannot support this bill. 
Moreover, Bill C-8 will create a real bureaucratic nightmare of 
duplications and overlaps between three departments, namely 
Canadian Heritage, Fisheries and Oceans Canada, and Environment 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I reject this bill outright, and I want the minister to go back 
and do her homework over again, because this bill is totally 
unacceptable.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak today to the report stage of Bill C-8, an act 
respecting marine conservation areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The group one motions for the Bloc Quebecois are to delete in 
full the reference clauses in Bill C-8.  We agree with the Bloc 
that the bill cannot be supported in its current form, but for 
differing reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The New Democratic Party spokesman for parks, the member for 
Churchill River, Saskatchewan, is in his constituency today and 
asked that I present the following remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP supports in principle the marine conservation area 
concept.  There is a definite need to preserve representative 
marine areas similar to the terrestrial national parks program.

<A HREF="#LINKT25"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, it became obvious throughout the committee 
hearings on Bill C-8 that the proposed bill requires further 
work.  We regret that the NDP cannot support Bill C-8 in its 
present form. We believe that we cannot support weak legislation 
just for the sake of enacting legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The following points were raised in committee and through New 
Democratic Party meetings and correspondence with stakeholders. 
Questions were raised repeatedly in relation to the proposed 
interdepartmental structure of the national marine conservation 
areas and the roles of Environment Canada, Heritage Canada and 
the Department of Fisheries and Oceans.  These concerns include a 
lack of clarity between the Department of Fisheries and Oceans 
marine protected areas, MPAs, and the proposed marine 
conservation areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Concerns on the siting and size parameters necessary to protect 
and conserve marine biological diversity in national marine 
conservation areas remain unanswered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also a deficiency in prohibitions.  The NDP continues 
to support prohibitions to ensure the long time preservation of 
marine areas, efforts that were denied through the committee 
process.  These deficiencies include no prohibitions on bottom 
trawling or dragging or fin fish aquaculture in national marine 
conservation areas.  By refusing to prohibit such destructive 
activities, the national marine conservation areas cannot be 
sufficiently protected.  We beg the question, what is being 
conserved? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will address the issue of the maintenance of ecological 
integrity.  The Liberals refused to include this NDP amendment as 
a primary consideration for management plans, although the NDP 
was successful with the same amendment in Bill C-29, the Parks 
Canada Agency.  This refusal in Bill C-8 demonstrates an 
inconsistency between Heritage and Parks Canada legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP is also concerned about the departure from the Bill C-7 
Saguenay—St. Lawrence marine park model.  Bill C-8 will 
establish near exclusivity for federal powers in proposed 
national marine conservation areas, a concern raised by our 
opposition colleagues and thus an imposition on provincial and 
community participation in national marine conservation areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-7 was based on better co-operation between all government 
levels, especially in matters related to subsurface seabed 
rights, and therefore enjoyed all-party support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of off-site impacts, the government continues to 
ignore ecosystem impacts from areas adjacent to the national 
marine conservation areas, such as pollution sources from land or 
waters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This repeated NDP concern for marine areas has been proven 
correct on numerous occasions, the most recent being the series 
of fish killed in Prince Edward Island this summer from 
agricultural runoff. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP has also been proven correct about off-site impacts with 
the recent discovery that a key source for the continuing 
contamination of the St. Lawrence beluga population is found 
adjacent to the Saguenay Park, a beluga food source.  We have 
seen the spectacle there of eels feeding on contaminated sediment 
in identified toxic hot spots, which the Liberal government 
continues to delay cleaning up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My Churchill River colleague will be pleased to explain further 
our position on Bill C-8 and its deficiencies at greater length 
during third reading.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I begin my comments on the first group of amendments, let 
me say that my hon. colleague, the member for West Nova and our 
Progressive Conservative heritage critic, unfortunately is not 
able to be here today.  He is travelling with the fisheries 
committee and is obviously dealing with things that are close and 
dear to his heart.  He will be able to speak at future times to

</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleagues in the House are well aware, the Progressive 
Conservative Party has always been concerned with protecting our 
fragile ecosystem for our future generations.  One needs only to 
look back at our first Canadian prime minister, the Right Hon. 
Sir John A. Macdonald, to understand the deep-rooted affection 
and appreciation we had and we continue to have for our 
environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sir John A. Macdonald created Canada's first national park when 
in 1885 his Conservative government designated 26 square miles 
around the hot mineral springs near what is now known as the town 
of Banff, declaring it a national treasurer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By creating Canada's first national park, Sir John A. Macdonald 
began a legacy that successive governments have continued to 
build upon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned, the Progressive Conservative Party has long been 
concerned with preserving our ecosystem.  In 1986, the PC 
government approved the National Marine Park policy.  In 1987, 
the country's first national marine conservation area, known as 
Fathom Five in Georgian Bay, was established. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1988, the government signed a federal-provincial agreement 
with the province of British Columbia to create a national marine 
conservation area in the Queen Charlotte Islands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On April 6, 1990, the Progressive Conservative government signed 
an historic and unique agreement between Canada and Quebec to 
create a marine park at the confluence of the Saguenay Estuary 
and the St. Lawrence River. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In December 1996, we gave our support to Bill C-78, an act to 
establish the Saguenay—St. Lawrence Marine Park that culminated 
with the proclamation of the Saguenay—St. Lawrence Marine Park on 
June 8 of that year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me note that this marine park was created without the need 
for any marine conservation legislation like the one that is 
being debated today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our party has continued to support measures that would 
effectively protect our unique and wonderful ecosystem.  We stood 
firm with this government as we passed legislation that sought 
the establishment of the Tuktut Nogait National Park.  We also 
showed our support for the establishment of the new Canada Parks 
Agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is precisely because of our historical commitment toward 
protecting and preserving our environment that we find it so 
difficult to oppose Bill C-8.  Yet, we must oppose this bill 
because we believe that it is fundamentally flawed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation has the potential for creating far greater 
problems than it purports to eliminate.  I am convinced that Bill 
C-8, as amended, is simply going to add another confusing level 
of bureaucracy to an already nightmarish regulatory process for 
our fishers and others who make use of marine waters to earn 
their livelihoods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our party supported sending Bill C-48 to committee for review. 
We did this not only because we are committed to the creation of 
more national parks, but also because we wanted to give Canadians 
another opportunity to voice their opposition to this piece of 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Time and time again we heard about the lack of consultation that 
took place prior to the drafting of the bill.  Members of the 
Canadian heritage committee, along with many witnesses who made 
presentations to the committee, helped identify a number of 
glaring weaknesses within the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Trying to solve its flawed piece of legislation, the government 
introduced over 40 amendments to the bill prior to being 
reprinted for report stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite these many changes, the Minister of Canadian Heritage 
has seen fit to introduce even further amendments that we will be 
discussing later.  It is no wonder that my colleague for 
Portneuf, representing the Bloc Quebecois, has introduced 
amendments that would see the deletion of every aspect of the 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite our many philosophical differences we have with the 
Bloc, we nevertheless do agree that Bill C-8 is a flawed piece of 
legislation that deserves to be defeated in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather than introduce amendments that would completely alter the 
nature of the bill, as our friends from the Reform Party have 
done, the Bloc has decided to simply introduce amendments that 
would totally eradicate the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During our committee hearings, the member for Rimouski—Mitis 
asked for an explanation as to why we needed this particular 
piece of legislation.  After all, the federal government and its 
provincial counterparts created the Saguenay—St. Lawrence Marine 
Park without the need of legislation.  It is obvious by its 
amendments that a satisfactory answer was not forthcoming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While doing research on another piece of legislation, I came 
across British Columbia's ministry of environment, lands and 
parks website. 
I was pleasantly surprised to hear that they already claimed to 
have more than 80 marine parks protecting wildlife and their 
scenic coastline.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I seem to recollect that a marine park was created in Nova 
Scotia.  If I am not mistaken, Canada's military sank the 
decommissioned HMCS <I>Saguenay</I> off Lunenburg County, 
providing sanctuary for a large variety of very interesting sea 
life.  This area has subsequently become a major tourist 
attraction for undersea adventurers.  This further proves that 
creating marine parks is possible without this piece of 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think many people can be found who are fundamentally 
opposed to the idea of creating marine parks.  However, these 
parks must be identified following extensive consultation with 
local stakeholders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of our major concerns with the bill is centred on the lack 
of consultation which took place within our local communities. 
Yes, the minister can declare that they sent out 3,000 
information packages to various organizations.  However, they 
have come to the conclusion that the lack of response they 
received from the stakeholders was a sign of acceptance.  They 
have based this belief on a false premise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many fishers to whom we have talked had no idea that such a bill 
had been introduced, much less any knowledge of its contents.  Is 
that what is meant by the government's extensive consultations? 
It is not good enough.  The legislation could seriously impact 
the livelihoods of fishers.  Therefore we feel they deserve 
greater input into any new marine policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is already anxiety within fishing communities.  Fishers 
are being asked to show blind faith in the government.  The 
government wants them to believe that it will look after their 
interests when history clearly shows that this has not been the 
case. Obviously what is happening in the fisheries industry right 
now proves and points to the mismanagement of the government and 
certainly a lack of confidence on the part of not only the 
stakeholders, the fishers, but also the communities which depend 
upon the fisheries as their livelihood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fishers have no idea how their fishery will be impacted by the 
supreme court decision in the Donald Marshall, Jr., case.  The 
government is now asking them to believe that the legislation 
will not seriously impact their livelihoods.  I think the 
government is asking a little too much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government already has some tools available to it to protect 
the fragile ecosystem.  Under the Oceans Act the minister can 
designate areas for closure if he feels the resource is being 
threatened.  Evidence of this occurred in Nova Scotia when the 
minister unilaterally made the decision to close the Sable Gully 
just east of Sable Island. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are concerned that Bill C-8 will add another confusing level 
of bureaucracy to the regulatory process.  Fishers have to 
contend with DFO regulations, environmental laws, coast guard 
approvals, Transport Canada guidelines, and now Canada Heritage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois believes that Bill C-8 is an infringement 
upon provincial responsibilities.  Although we do not agree with 
this position, we do agree that substantial provincial government 
input is necessary for helping to identify future marine 
conservation areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a lot more to say about Bill C-8.  However at this time 
we will hold most of those comments until we debate the Group No. 
2 amendments.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is 
a bit of a challenge to debate the Group No. 1 amendments simply 
because they appear to be a measure by the Bloc Quebecois to 
delete every clause of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In view of that I will address the bill more generally, simply 
because I have not had the opportunity to do so.  I will address 
some of the specific amendments in other upcoming groups.  In 
view of what the Group No. 1 amendments represent and that the 
government does not appear to be engaging in the debate at all 
today, I will address some of my general concerns about the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has both a national and international obligation to 
ensure the viability of our east, west and Arctic coasts.  All 
members of the House would probably agree that it is crucially 
important for us to protect our marine areas. Many clauses in the 
bill merit consideration and support.  We would certainly 
consider supporting many of them if we could agree on amending 
some of the other ones.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the Minister of Canadian Heritage that we must 
protect our 29 marine regions.  There are many ways in which 
these areas could be neglected or, in a worst case scenario, even 
destroyed.  Conservation efforts are necessary to ensure the 
future existence and prosperity of our marine areas and with this 
in mind I support the concept behind the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also believe strongly in the principle of polluter pay.  It 
has great merit and it makes sense to anybody that those who 
pollute should pay to fix the damage they cause.  Unfortunately 
sometimes that damage is unfixable and it is difficult to impose 
just compensation on those who would cause that kind of 
destruction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately I have many serious concerns that make it 
impossible for me or my party to support the bill in its current 
form.  The bill appears to fulfil preservationist environmental 
objectives instead of the usual objectives of national parks, 
historic or heritage sites.  For this reason the bill belongs 
squarely in the portfolio of the Minister of the Environment. 
Lacking that, the portfolio of the Minister of Fisheries and 
Oceans would better fit the bill than that of the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The efforts of the Minister of Canadian Heritage to expand her 
domain make my uncomfortable.  Not only would the bill allow the 
heritage minister's domain over decisions regarding marine 
conservation areas.  She could do so with increased discretionary 
powers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-8 proposes that the establishment of marine conservation 
areas would be ruled by three Henry VIII clauses. The minister 
could designate new areas under the act without having to steer 
an amending act through parliament.  The usual legislative 
process would be sidestepped completely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are all too aware how the government likes to sidestep 
proper legislative process.  However, in matters as important as 
marine conservation, I would hope that the government would forgo 
its usual policies of sleight of hand legislation and instead 
adopt due process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To the government due process means that the legislation goes 
immediately to a government ruled committee.  If that committee 
has any objections, which is highly unlikely due to the Liberal 
majority, the entire House of Commons must confirm the 
objections.  Should the committee not raise any objections within 
21 days the amendment is passed by order in council. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not see a great deal of general MP involvement in the 
process.  If a Liberal dominated committee does not come up with 
any objections, the amendment goes forward as is.  Where is the 
debate?  Where is the careful consideration?  Where is the public 
consultation?  The Liberals are truly masters of illusion, that 
is the illusion of the democratic process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is only fair and right that Canadians affected by these 
changes be given the opportunity to take part in the process.  At 
the very least, Canadians should be involved so that the changes 
to their communities and businesses can have minimal negative 
effects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Aboriginal communities across the country have expressed their 
opposition to the bill as have many resource based industries. 
The overwhelming negative public response we have seen has been 
completely ignored by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The intent of Bill C-8 is to protect marine environments.  No 
one would disagree that such an effort is very important. However 
it is unreasonable and impracticable to forge ahead without 
taking into consideration the effects such efforts will have on 
communities that rely on the oceans for food and economic 
sustainability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have all heard what drastic effects the cod fishing 
moratorium had on countless communities in Newfoundland.  Many 
communities were literally wiped out because people simply had no 
way of maintaining their lives without the cod fishery. 
Generations have grown up with cod fishing as their primary 
source of food and income.  However that heritage was banned and 
communities all over Newfoundland suffered terribly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now the heritage minister is looking to destroy Newfoundland's 
remaining fishing heritage by banning all fishing activities in 
protected areas.  No fishing would be allowed unless a special 
discretionary minister's permit has been given to the individual. 
I can only imagine how difficult it will be for the ordinary 
citizen to get one of those permits.  Certainly we have 
experience with the abuses of ministerial permits in other areas 
and other sectors in which the government is involved.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>After the cod moratorium many fishermen managed to transfer 
their skills to other fisheries and are trying to eke out a 
living.  However the bill will quickly put an end to those 
efforts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee heard from the Canadian Aquaculture Industry 
Alliance on one proposed marine conservation area.  I understand 
that since the time of the hearing, because the bill has dragged 
on for so long, that the creation of the particular proposed 
marine conservation area has been dropped.  However at that time 
it certainly was not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The area extends from Cape Bonavista to North Head in Notre Dame 
Bay.  It contains approximately 25,000 to 30,000 square miles of 
coastline.  Within the area there is a large inshore fishery with 
approximately 2,000 fishing licence holders, 35 aquaculture 
licence holders, and many fine cod farming sites. The total value 
of fishing and aquaculture industries in the area is almost $600 
million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously this area is crucially important to those who rely on 
fishing and agriculture opportunities.  Yet this zoning has a 
potential which still remains today to permanently shut down much 
of the fishery in Newfoundland, displacing thousands of 
Newfoundlanders who desperately need the industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the cod moratorium was brought into place many 
Newfoundlanders saw hope in the growing interest in exploration 
and production possibilities in the Grand Banks.  Since then many 
people have had their hopes realized because projects like 
Hibernia, Terra Nova and Sable Island have brought jobs, training 
and foreign investment to Newfoundlanders and all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Bill C-8 goes ahead, a rich potential for future development 
within the Grand Banks will never be realized.  To declare the 
Grand Banks a marine conservation area ignores the fact that 
drilling projects such as Hibernia and Terra Nova have very 
strict environmental protectionist guidelines to make sure the 
surrounding marine ecosystems are not damaged.  It is a perfect 
example of what we call sustainable development in Canada.  It is 
a far more desirable goal than the protectionism we are talking 
about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion it has not been the development of our natural 
resources offshore that has endangered the marine habitat in 
Canada's oceans.  It has simply been poor management and 
overfishing, not resource development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Grand Banks are closed to industry the government will 
make sure, although the marine area continues to flourish, that 
the economy and well-being of Newfoundlanders will suffer 
terrible damages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another consideration must be what effect Bill C-8 will have on 
Canada's mining industry.  There are indications that vast 
amounts of mineral deposits might be found under the floor of the 
Pacific Ocean off the coast of Canada.  According to committee 
testimony these deposits could be worth several billions of 
dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should the Canadian government investigate these sources there 
will be vast revenues from the deposits.  Exploration will ensure 
that Canada stays on the cutting edge of mining and marine 
technology.  Yet Bill C-8 will put an end to all future mining 
exploration in our oceans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the bill goes forward, Canada will lag behind the rest of the 
world in mining production and related technologies.  The mining 
industry in Canada will suffer serious damages and thousands of 
skilled, trained workers will be displaced.  The closure of the 
Devco mine has already shown us how devastating the failure of an 
industry can be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will close on this part of my presentation and readdress some 
of my further concerns when we get to some of the other upcoming 
groups.  I will continue this debate as we go along.

be routine in this country, under the present government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the blessing—as required by social union—of nine out of ten

places where it has no business being: our classrooms, our 
hospital rooms, our universities and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Up until now, there was one area in which the power-hungry 
government had not interfered: the bottom of our waterways.  No 
doubt that was an oversight.  Now it has been remedied.

<A HREF="#LINKT30"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill before us corrects this surprising oversight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In its principle and purposes, Bill C-8 meets laudable 
objectives, that is the conservation of animal and plant life in 
marine areas. We would have liked to be able to support it but, 
unfortunately, it seems that this government is incapable of 
coming up with bills that do not include clauses that I liken to 
worms in a nice apple, which encroach on provincial 
jurisdictions. It makes it impossible for any member who wants 
to uphold the Constitution to vote in favour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois is opposed to Bill C-8 because it does not 
explicitly recognize the territorial integrity of Quebec, and 
also because it will duplicate the marine protected areas of the 
Department of Fisheries and Oceans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the Canadian heritage committee hearings, almost all coastal 
groups who appeared before the committee spoke out against this 
bill, arguing that the Canadian heritage initiative would 
duplicate what is already being done by the Department of 
Fisheries and Oceans, create confusion, and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is what my colleague for Longueuil said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is nothing in the bill or in the government's amendments 
that guarantees that, once the bill is passed, the territorial 
integrity of Quebec will be respected. 
In fact, we know that the federal and the Quebec governments do 
not agree about the ownership of some portions of the ocean 
floor, especially in the estuary of the St. Lawrence River and the 
Gulf of St. Lawrence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, the bill provides that the government can establish marine 
conservation areas—and I quote the bill as amended—if the 
government is satisfied “that Her Majesty in right of Canada has 
clear title to or an unencumbered right of ownership in the 
lands to be included in the marine conservation area”. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There already was a good example the government knew about. They 
only had to rely on it to get our support. I am talking, of 
course, about the bill passed in 1997 to establish the 
Saguenay—St. Lawrence marine park. 
That legislation respects the jurisdiction of both levels of 
government. In co-operating to create that park, the federal 
government did not demand ownership over the lands that Quebec 
considers its own under the British North America Act of 1867. 
But things are different for the areas subject to Bill C-8. 
Ottawa wants to assume ownership over these lands, regardless of 
the Quebec legislation on crown lands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And there is more. As a result of infringing upon areas of 
provincial jurisdiction, of walking all over the provinces, 
Ottawa is caught stepping on its own toes. We now have three 
federal departments who are suddenly and simultaneously 
interested in protecting the ocean floor. Heritage Canada wants 
marine conservation areas. The Department of Fisheries and 
Oceans want to set up marine conservation areas. 
And, not wanting to feel left out, Environment Canada now wants 
to create marine wildlife preserves. Under Bill C-8, each 
department will have jurisdiction over its own areas or zones. 
This promises to create a lot of grey areas, legal blur and 
jurisdictional conflicts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is what project co-ordinator John Melindy told the Standing 
Committee on Canadian Heritage: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, through the Oceans Act, the Minister of Fisheries and 
Oceans is empowered to declare marine protected areas to 
conserve species under threat. In view of this fact, we are 
mystified as to why Canadian Heritage is attempting to run a 
parallel conservation initiative under a separate piece of 
legislation....Our position statement is that overall we feel Bill C-8 
should be withdrawn. We cannot see any particular reason for 
making this bill into law. It is felt that this bill would 
undermine the authority of the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans 
and transfer powers for marine conservation and habitat 
protection to Parks Canada, which has no management or 
scientific expertise in the marine field.

those things.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo—Cowichan, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is important that we rise today to speak to Bill C-8, the marine 
conservation act.  In view of the fact that this body of 
amendments really calls for the clause by clause elimination of 
the bill, we can only speak rather generically to the bill 
itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps we should call this bill the marine environmental act 
or, maybe even better, the heritage minister's power grab act. 
That may seem a little strong, but I want to explain this over 
the next few minutes to see if there are not some members who 
might agree with me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I look at the bill I shake my head in amazement.  The purpose 
of the bill is to establish marine conservation areas and 
reserves under the authority of the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage, the minister chiefly responsible for national parks. On 
the surface that objective sounds like motherhood and apple pie. 
In fact there are some parts of the bill that I would agree with 
and support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition, for instance, is in favour of a 
polluter pay principle.  It makes sense to me that, just like a 
user pay situation, those who pollute should also pay the price. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition is also supportive of the concepts of 
participating in the world community of agreements and 
maintaining the biodiversity.  Throughout this we need to be good 
stewards of what we have been given. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, that is just about as much support as I can give 
for the original drafting of this bill.  I will expand upon my 
level of support for the amendments shortly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have far more concerns over the remaining portions of the 
bill.  To begin with, I question whether this is a parks bill or 
an environmental protectionist bill.  I believe that parks are to 
be available for the public good.  The way I read the bill, the 
minister will have sweeping powers to virtually eliminate public, 
private and commercial activity in vast areas of Canada's marine 
lands.  I do not know if this would be acceptable to many 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through clauses 5, 6 and 7 the minister would be able to 
designate new areas under the act without bringing the act 
forward again to parliament.  This investiture of power to one 
official in one office is not in keeping with my personal view of 
an accountable, democratic government.  The circumvention of 
parliament may exist in other acts; however, that does not make 
it right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very concerned that the heritage minister may simply 
exclude any exploration or development from any and all sites 
that she deems to be held within the marine conservation areas. 
I find this demagogue-like approach to power within the bill very 
scary but typical of the Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This approach to power is one that cannot be taken lightly.  As 
an example, I would like to bring a matter before the House that 
is a direct case in point of the heritage minister and Parks 
Canada superseding all reasonable approaches to power and the 
issue of common law.  Within my riding of Nanaimo—Cowichan lies 
a portion of the Pacific Rim National Park.  Pacific Rim is home 
to the West Coast Trail, and a more beautiful and rugged part of 
Canada we will hardly find.  Yet, it is here that a family's 
nightmare began. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of my constituents, Mr. John Van Egmond, has met with me on 
several occasions.  The Van Egmonds had a dream of living in a 
wilderness setting and being able to help people through a 
practical, hands on approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Less than two years ago the Van Egmonds thought that they had 
found the perfect solution to their dream.  Two parcels of fee 
simple land became available for sale.  One land parcel was 
adjacent to and the other within the boundaries of Pacific Rim 
National Park. 
They subsequently purchased both parcels of land.

</I></B></P><P align=left>They confirmed with the local regional district that they would 
be permitted to build a bed and breakfast on this property. 
Unfortunately, after Parks Canada later became involved, they 
learned that a bed and breakfast would not be permitted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ever resourceful, the Van Egmonds began to put together a 
wilderness adventure school that could teach people about the 
outdoors, specifically in the West Coast Trail environment. 
Furthermore, their school would be used as a rescue base and 
emergency shelter for the many hikers that annually use the 
trail.  Over the past several years, due to the popularity of the 
trail, a reservation system has been used. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although isolated, thousands of people from around the world use 
that trail every year.  Nevertheless, many people are not fully 
prepared for the hardships of the trail and are injured along the 
way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To accomplish their revised goals, the Van Egmonds had the 
written assurance of Parks Canada that the rights of private 
property owners would be respected.  However, that is when the 
problems really began with Parks Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the course of the next few months Parks Canada officials 
cut off access to their land.  Remember, this is private land 
that had been privately purchased.  Parks Canada would not permit 
them to cross crown land that was designated as a park reserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Van Egmonds believe that Parks Canada officials contacted 
all the local helicopter companies and told them not to contract 
with the Van Egmonds to drop building materials or supplies on to 
their property.  It disallowed a septic permit for the Van 
Egmonds on their own property, even though the local regional 
district had given its approval.  This is where it gets 
interesting.  This was in light of the fact that 8,000 hikers 
annually use the trail and use the pristine shoreline and 
surrounding area as their own private septic field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to try to comply with Parks Canada officials, Mr. Van 
Egmond had been using a wheelbarrow to move his supplies from a 
river to his property along the beach.  Parks Canada then issued 
a letter that the Van Egmonds would not be allowed ingress or 
egress across park land at all, which meant that they would be 
trespassing every time they stepped off their own property.  This 
is in free Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, Parks Canada officials had told the local Ditidaht 
Band that the Van Egmonds were illegally fishing salmon stocks 
out of the local Nitinat Narrows and accepting fees to show 
hikers a series of revered petroglyphs adjacent to their 
property.  This was brought to a head when several members of the 
band verbally and physically confronted the Van Egmonds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When cooler heads prevailed and voices of reason compared 
different sides of the story, the Ditidaht Band realized that 
Parks Canada officials had not told them the truth about the Van 
Egmonds.  The Van Egmonds had not been fishing illegally and were 
not taking people to view the sacred petroglyphs.  At this point 
the Van Egmonds and the Ditidaht Band began to work together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Out of respect for the Ditidaht Band, the Van Egmonds have left 
their property and have been attempting to resolve the issue with 
the heritage minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The situation is so serious that the Ditidaht Band has since 
written the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development 
and the Minister of Canadian Heritage stating that they will not 
continue in their land claim negotiations until Heritage Canada 
resolves the issue with the Van Egmonds.  Sadly, neither minister 
has taken the time to date to respond to the Van Egmonds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These allegations in a free democracy are difficult to believe. 
Yet, I have talked and met with people independent from the Van 
Egmonds who have confirmed these reports.  The Van Egmonds want 
nothing more than to resolve this issue, and yet once again the 
government is not listening, as it does not listen to many 
people, particularly in B.C.  Is it any wonder that I cannot 
support this bill and the centralization of power that it would 
give to the minister? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take this opportunity to speak out loudly on this issue.  This 
bill is inappropriate.  It has far-reaching power that I believe 
supersedes parliament itself.  This is not acceptable.  We cannot 
have any more cases like the Van Egmonds.  It cannot be 
supported.  Without the approval of many amendments, I will 
certainly not be able to support the bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This schedule deals with titles and marine conservation areas. 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>under this section or subsection 6(2) may be made only if 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(<I>a</I>) the Governor in Council is satisfied that Her Majesty in 
right of Canada has clear title to or an unencumbered right of 
ownership in the lands to be included in the marine conservation 
area— 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must therefore be established whether the submerged lands 
they wish to include in the conservation area belong to the 
federal government.  According to this section, which I would 
put in the context of Quebec, when I think of the St. Lawrence 
River, the immediate answer is that they do not, that the 
federal government is not the owner of the bed of the 
St. Lawrence River. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know this is what the bill says.  There are three sites 
in the St. Lawrence River and in the Gulf of St. Lawrence that the 
federal government wants to turn into marine conservation areas. 
It is ignoring subsection 5(2) and wants to go further still. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do I say that the riverbed does not belong to the federal 
government?  Quite simply because I am referring to the 
Constitution Act, 1867.  As a member of the Bloc Quebecois, I 
must look at the British North America Act, 1867, the 
Constitution, because it is the overriding law right now, 
because the Canadian Constitution is the number one law that 
everyone must respect, including the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 92(5) of the Constitution Act, 1867, provides that the 
management and sale of public lands come exclusively under 
provincial jurisdiction. 
I know it is complicated, but what is quite clear is that the 
floor of the St. Lawrence River belongs to the province of 
Quebec, to Quebecers, and not to Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How will they implement their nice little legislation if not 
through a show of force? We know how easy it is for the 
government across the way to flex its muscles in these areas, 
and we will probably witness another show of force when the time 
comes to implement this legislation. Legally however, based on 
the existing legislation, we can only conclude that the federal 
government does not have jurisdiction over the floor of the 
St. Lawrence River.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know it is complicated, as I said earlier. The government 
opposite finds it complicated, so you can imagine how ordinary 
citizens feel about it. They find it extremely complicated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said so in a previous speech, and I want to say it again 
because some of my constituents from Berthier—Montcalm just 
cannot believe it and they ask me “Michel, is it really so 
complicated?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When you look at the St. Lawrence River and at the fish in these 
waters, you do so from the perspective of Quebec fishers. They 
realize that the banks of the river indubitably fall under 
provincial jurisdiction. They belong to Quebec. Now, if they 
want to fish, they need to register their boats with the federal 
government. 
The St. Lawrence river bed falls under provincial jurisdiction, 
but the water itself, the seaway, falls under federal 
jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very complicated for the average person. Add to that 
federal protected areas and wildlife reserves located in areas 
under provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe the government opposite should at least start respecting 
legislation that concerns it directly. It should at least accept 
these jurisdictions and accept exclusively provincial 
jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have not yet talked about fish. A fish, as such, is under 
provincial jurisdiction, but there are federal quotas. 
Recreational fishing requires a provincial licence, but 
commercial fishing also requires a federal licence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is quite complicated. 
Yet it could be a lot simpler if the government opposite were 
more co-operative, if it were not always intent on doing only as 
it pleases. It seems the only person here who has a monopoly on 
the truth is the Prime Minister. Everybody else is crazy and is 
wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, we have examples in the area of wildlife protection. In 
Quebec, we have a good example in the Saguenay—St. Lawrence 
marine park. It is a good example to follow simply because both 
levels of government co-operated to make something that works and 
that is in harmony with the Constitution of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Both levels 
of government agreed to create a marine wildlife reserve with a 
co-ordinating committee made up of various people selected by 
both the provincial and federal ministers responsible. Each 
contributed half of the required funding. 
It is working out well, because there was consultation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the bill before us, all stakeholders came to tell us in 
committee that the federal government had not consulted those 
involved sufficiently.  They did not consult the Government of 
Quebec sufficiently, for one thing, and its property is 
involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are beginning to get used to this.  I have spoken about the 
bottom of the St. Lawrence. Everyone here in this House agrees 
environment is a shared jurisdiction.  Clearly, under the 
Canadian constitution, the environment concerns both federal and 
provincial levels.  If something is covered by environmental 
legislation, both levels of government have to be consulted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have also referred to the federal government's desire to 
overlap and bypass Quebec's jurisdictions. 
At the federal level, that there is departmental overlap. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill overlaps Fisheries and Oceans Canada and Environment 
Canada jurisdictions.  People from both of these departments 
came before the committee and told us “This makes no sense. 
There is too much overlap.  People will not understand at all. 
It is too complicated.  The government needs to go back to the 
drawing board”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I realize that the bill under consideration is exactly the 
same.  Let the Liberals go back to the drawing board before they 
propose something.  At least the people responsible for 
application of this legislation within their own departments 
will have nothing to say against it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before closing, I would like to make some very important quotes.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, this is not the first time I have spoken to this bill, 
although the last time it had a different number attached to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition believes in sustainable development and 
management of the environment to both preserve biodiversity and 
conserve the environment for the enjoyment of Canadians at 
present and in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The heritage minister by this bill simply expands her domain and 
encroaches on what is more properly the responsibility of the 
Minister of the Environment, her old portfolio.  The minister in 
this bill sidesteps the proper role of parliament with the 
insertion of Henry VIII clauses, as we have already heard 
described today. The bill requires provincial governments to obey 
it. The bill impinges on provincial jurisdiction in many ways. 
Enforcement officers may arrest without warrant and enter private 
property without permission.  That is a summation of some of my 
concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a politicized environmental bill and not a useful one to 
assist the environment. That is the problem with the bill. It 
will burden us with another layer of government bureaucracy. This 
will prevent honest fishermen, hardworking oil and gas 
exploration companies, local anglers and recreational boaters 
from being able to make a living or enjoy themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill will not prevent natural disasters.  It will not 
prevent poachers.  It will not prevent the environment from being 
ruined. Bill C-8 will do none of this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I attended committee.  Reform brought some witnesses to 
committee.  The chief of the Campbell River band was at 
committee.  The North Coast Oil and Gas Task Force was there. 
West coast fishermen were there.  Rather than accept at face 
value concerns by west coast stakeholders, what did we hear?  A 
lecture from the chairman of the committee.  Quite frankly, I was 
amazed at the treatment meted out to people who had travelled so 
far. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this bill proceeds, we will have three federal departments 
that can protect marine areas:  Environment Canada, the 
Department of Fisheries and Oceans, and this bill will put 
Heritage Canada into that picture as well.  This is very sloppy 
indeed and is not the way to proceed. Any time more than one 
party manages something, we get diffused management, diffused 
objectives and things tend to fall apart. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to talk about the west coast because I know it best. 
About half of the British Columbia coastline is in my riding. 
Obviously it is a busy place.  There is aquaculture going on, 
fishing activity, commercial and recreational, undersea 
harvesting of different kinds, some of it actively being pursued 
and others are proposed.  There are transportation activities of 
every kind, tug and barge, marine commercial transportation, 
ferries, cruise ships, we have the works.  We also have a history 
of oil and gas exploration.  I am going to spend some time 
talking about that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The oil and gas reserves on the west coast exceed many times, 
for example, the oil reserves in Hibernia and other areas in 
Canada, which are currently being exploited quite successfully. 
At the end of 1998, the Hibernia operation had already provided 
107,000 man years of work, a very significant number and one that 
British Columbians are taking note of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should not be pre-empted from an opportunity to fully develop 
our industry by legislation that blindly creates parks without 
taking all of these things into account.  It is very clear, from 
the way this bill has been developed, that those things have not 
been taken into account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>British Columbia is unique.  We fought as a province to 
establish provincial jurisdiction over the Gulf of Georgia, which 
is salt water and seabed and marine resources that are owned by 
the province.  This legislation would be tantamount to the 
Nanoose Bay expropriation if it were done without the agreement 
of the province.  That is what the legislation attempts to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have major concerns with the politicization of the protection 
of marine areas.  This bill doe not accomplish anything for the 
environment.  It is only here as a public relations exercise by a 
department and a minister of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the legislative package came out, I sent it out to 22 
groups that I knew had an interest in this type of legislation 
and that should have been consulted by government.  These groups 
found they could not comment in any meaningful way on this 
legislation because they did not know where the marine 
conservation areas were being proposed.  The legislation is not 
at that stage.  By the time it gets to that stage, there will be 
no parliamentary purview other than some ability to comment on 
what they can do by order in council without further reference to 
parliament.  That is wrong.  We are opposed to it.  We know that 
west coast interests will be overruled because we have already 
seen the attitude display in this process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The recreational sector, which will be heavily impacted by 
anything that comes out of this, has no effective lobby.  It is 
composed primarily of individual anglers.  Once enabling 
legislation is drafted to create these areas and then they are 
not created, the bureaucracy is uncomfortable because the 
minister has a mandate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have is a self-perpetuating machine churning out 
regulations in new areas that have no business existing in the 
first place.  We end up with marine conservation areas with a 
very weak rationale which flies in the face of common sense and 
local sentiment.  There has to be a better way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We recommended that the municipal level of governance be put 
into this legislation in a meaningful way so that it can have a 
decision making role in whether these specific areas will come 
into being or not.  There have been no changes or movement 
whatsoever in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A major concern we have with the bill is its potential to affect 
offshore oil and gas exploration and industry.  We have had a 
moratorium since 1989 on the west coast.  This is supported by a 
federal moratorium which will be in place until B.C. decides to 
allow this exploration. 
In September 1999, in the B.C. northern development 
commissioner's report, he said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report clearly shows that northerners support the development 
of a process that would reconsider the current oil and gas 
moratorium.

with Bill C-8, British Columbians may be hampered in developing 
this industry due to the additional restrictions that may be 
imposed by Bill C-8.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil—Papineau—Mirabel, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise today in this House to speak to 
Bill C-8.  This bill concerns the creation of a network of 
national marine conservation areas, the marine equivalent of 
national parks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This network would be representative of 29 marine regions in 
Canada, covering the waters of the Great Lakes, inland waters 
including swamps, the territorial sea and the 200 mile exclusive 
economic zone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this bill, the government will set the boundaries of the 
marine conservation areas in all the regions in Canada, in 
consultation, we hope, with the people of the area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-8 gives the governor in council, on the recommendation of 
the Ministers of Fisheries and Oceans and Canadian Heritage, the 
right to limit or prohibit activities in commercial zones in 
order to protect marine resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also gives the governor in council, on the recommendation of 
the Ministers of Transport and Canadian Heritage, the right to 
limit or prohibit transportation in marine conservation areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to note that 1998 was set aside as the year of 
the oceans by the UN.  The most important activities held to 
draw attention to this event include the world's fair in Lisbon, 
Portugal, and the adoption of the ocean charter by UNESCO in 
September 1997 in St. John's, Newfoundland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government claims it is important to preserve the natural 
marine ecosystems and their balance to maintain biologic 
diversity.  It says there is a need to establish a 
representative network of marine conservation areas, whose scope 
and features will ensure the maintenance of healthy marine 
ecosystems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois supports environmental protection measures. 
It gave its support when the government introduced legislation 
to establish the Saguenay—St. Lawrence marine park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, I must say that, in my riding of 
Argenteuil—Papineau—Mirabel, water is precious.  The Argenteuil 
Parti Quebecois and the PQ subcommittee on the environment for 
the Laurentian region submitted briefs to the BAPE. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People wanted to show their support for the protection of the 
environment, particularly ecosystems in the groundwater, marine 
conservation areas, forests and other areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1986, the federal government launched the marine conservation 
area program. In 1988, the National Parks Act was amended to 
take into account the establishment of temporary protected 
marine areas. Since then, the following areas were created: 
Fathom Five National Marine Park in the Georgian Bay, the Gwaii 
Haanas marine conservation reserve in British Columbia, and the 
Saguenay—St. Lawrence marine park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The park is over 1,100 square kilometres and has a unique 
tourist component, the importance of which we are just beginning 
to grasp.

<A HREF="#LINKT38"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This marine park was 14 years in the making. Its management is 
shared by the provincial and federal governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The project began in 1985. It took quite a long time to create 
the park because of the public consultations, environmental 
studies and negotiations that were required. That precedent 
should have served as a model for the federal government in 
establishing other marine conservation areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should be pointed out that co-operative mechanisms already 
exist to protect ecosystems in the Saguenay—St. Lawrence marine 
park, and in the St. Lawrence River, under the agreement entitled 
“St. Lawrence action plan, phase III”, which was signed by all 
federal and provincial departments concerned and which provides 
for an investment of $250 million over five years in various 
activities relating to the St. Lawrence River. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, the Bloc Quebecois is opposed to the bill before 
us today for two reasons. First, it is not clear whether 
Quebec's territorial integrity will be respected. Second, we are 
opposed to this bill because Heritage Canada is proposing the 
establishment of a new structure, that is the marine 
conservation areas, which will simply duplicate fisheries and 
oceans' marine protected areas and Environment Canada's marine 
wildlife reserves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec's jurisdiction is recognized under the British North 
America Act of 1867. 
There is overlap within the federal government. With the 
bill, the government wants to establish marine conservation 
areas under the responsibility of Heritage Canada, marine 
protection areas under the responsibility of Fisheries and 
Oceans and marine wildlife areas under the responsibility of 
Environment Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same site could have more than one designation. It could be 
designated as a marine conservation area by Heritage Canada and 
as a marine protection area by fisheries and oceans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In both cases, it is obvious that the local population would 
have a major role to play in the establishment of marine 
protection areas. The Bloc is concerned about problems related 
to the bureaucracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same area, according to fisheries and oceans, could fall 
under different categories and be subject to different 
regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that when more than one department is involved in a 
project, even if all the departments involved belong to the same 
government, there are difficulties and additional costs to the 
taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government would have been better to make sure that 
ecosystems are managed by one department only. The departments 
involved should sign a framework agreement to delegate all of 
their responsibilities over ecosystems to the same department 
while respecting constitutional jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to mention the fact that the preliminary 
consultations were a failure. Furthermore, during hearings by 
the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage, almost all groups 
from coastal areas heard condemned the bill on the grounds that 
the system proposed by Heritage Canada would duplicate part of 
the work done by Fisheries and Oceans and create confusion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On February 11, 1999, Patrick McGuinness, vice-president of the 
Fisheries Council of Canada, told the Standing Committee on 
Canadian Heritage that it was simply inefficient, cumbersome 
public administration.  In his view, bringing forward this 
marine conservation area initiative in its own act under the 
responsibility of a separate minister and a separate department 
was unacceptable.  His conclusion was that the bill should be 
withdrawn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Jean-Claude Grégoire, a member of the board of directors of the 
Alliance des pêcheurs professionnels du Québec, which represents 
almost 80% of all professional fishermen in Quebec, also told 
the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage that there were 
numerous problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his testimony, he mentioned that such an area was difficult 
to access from a scientific point of view, meaning that people 
were working more with probabilities and presumptions than with 
real scientific knowledge of what existed.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois is opposed to this bill because, instead of 
focussing on collaboration, as in the case of the Sagenuay-St. 
Lawrence marine park, the federal government wants to introduce 
marine conservation areas with no regard for Quebec's 
jurisdiction over its territory and environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois concludes that the consultation conducted by 
the Department of Fisheries and Oceans in Quebec with respect to 
the introduction of marine conservation areas was also a 
failure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, the Bloc Quebecois knows that the Government of 
Quebec is also engaged in initiatives to protect the environment 
and submerged lands and water in particular.  Bill C-8 does not 
respect the integrity of Quebec's territory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois is in favour of measures to protect the 
environment, but opposed to Bill C-8 for all the reasons I have 
mentioned.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
it is very interesting to speak to Bill C-8, the marine 
conservation act, particularly in light of the motions put 
forward by the Bloc, which would delete all clauses of the bill. 
It is interesting because of what I perceive to be contained 
within the bill.  Quite frankly, we will be supporting the Bloc's 
amendment to stall or stop this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at most government legislation that comes forward, 
we see an enlargement of ministers' jurisdiction.  The 
enlargement of ministers' jurisdiction can be done in a 
tremendous number of ways.  We see it even within my own 
constituency, within the four mountain parks, two of which are in 
my constituency and two of which are in the Wild Rose 
constituency.  We see an action that is presently taking place 
where the minister has chosen, through the Canada <I>Gazette</I>, 
effective November 6, to take over 90% of the hectares under park 
jurisdiction and basically remove them from the parks, which are 
for the enjoyment of the citizens of Canada and visitors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This goes to the whole issue of Bill C-8, the marine 
conservation act.  If we take a look at the sensible reasons for 
the government wanting to bring this bill forward and put them up 
against the actions it is presently taking with respect to the 
parks under Parks Canada jurisdiction, we get an idea of where 
this bill could take us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was interested in many of the comments made by members of the 
Bloc Quebecois.  I reject outright their assertion that this 
takes jurisdiction away from their province.  However, I reflect 
upon the comments of the previous speaker who talked about the 
fact that basically this is not a bill that is reflective of the 
needs or the requirements of the park, it is a preservationist 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is always a dynamic tension in Parks Canada, in particular 
with anything having to do with the environment, between people 
being able to enjoy certain activities within the confines of the 
park and the preservation issue because we are attempting to 
preserve the park for future generations.  Indeed, this is a 
dynamic balance that is ongoing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we see what happens when special interest groups catch 
the ear of the current minister.  She ends up reacting to special 
interest groups that, in my judgment, are detrimental to where 
Parks Canada is going and certainly detrimental to the enjoyment 
of the parks.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I can recall one interesting squabble I had with the minister 
when I was heritage critic over the issue of the airstrip in 
Banff National Park.  The airstrip was being used by a local 
flying club, but it was there almost exclusively and primarily 
for the use of people in an emergency situation.  We had an 
ongoing verbal battle over this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was trying to drive home the fact that the airstrip was 
located within those very high mountains at the confluence of 
three valleys where there can be a lot of turbulence and a lot of 
changes in the weather.  A small aircraft can fly from one 
valley, say from the direction of Calgary, over the airstrip and 
proceed up toward the Continental Divide.  It can run into a wall 
of weather, turn around in the valley and attempt to come back, 
only to find that both the valley out toward Lake Minnewanka and 
the valley out toward Calgary are all blocked in.  What does the 
pilot do? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recall that the minister seemed to be not prepared to take the 
issue of safety for small planes seriously and was very concerned 
about the fact that perhaps I was attempting to keep the airstrip 
open so that the local flying club could have the pad, which of 
course I was not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting that after she had gazetted that the airstrip 
was going to be closed, a parks crew flew in the area and exactly 
what I just said happened.  Those people flew over the strip. 
They were on some kind of a survey for elk or something.  They 
ran into a wall of weather toward the B.C. border.  They turned 
around, only to find that they could not go anywhere.  They had 
to use the strip for an emergency landing.  Guess what?  The 
strip remains open as a result of that near miss. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is that kind of interference that is of deep concern to me 
when I look at Bill C-8, the marine conservation act, and realize 
that there is the very real potential, on the basis of the 
history of the current minister, that decisions could be made 
from Hamilton or from Ottawa that would not really take into 
account the needs of the affected area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned the business of gazetting.  As of November 6 of this 
year, it is my understanding that under an order in council, in 
the Canada <I>Gazette</I>, the minister has said that over 90% of 
the land within the four mountain parks will be set aside as a 
preserve.  Anybody wishing to go into that area will require a 
permit to do so.  Anybody with an ounce of common sense 
recognizes that Banff in particular, probably of all the parks in 
the world, is under the greatest environmental stress as a result 
of its popularity.  We can clearly understand the difficulty that 
is created when there are horses travelling on back trails, as 
well as motor bikes tearing up the trails.  The hooves of horses 
tear up the trails as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of those issues are part of the mix.  The minister simply 
exerts the power she has under the current parks legislation, 
which will be reflected and enhanced in Bill C-8.  For her to 
simply go ahead and take such action is mind boggling.  The 
continued enjoyment and intelligent use of that parkland by human 
beings that will be stopped as a result of that decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been consultations in the current situation and I am 
sure there will be consultations in future situations if this 
bill comes into effect. 
I have accused Parks Canada of not understanding what the word 
consultation means.  The word consultation, in my judgment, 
particularly by this minister, is to say that it is a fait 
accompli, it is an information session and not actual 
consultation per se.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>NATIONAL PARKS ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK184">&nbsp;</A>
<P><A NAME="LINK185"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.)</B> moved that Bill 
C-236, an act to amend the National Parks Act (Stoltmann National 
Park), be read the second time and referred to a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Madam Speaker, I express my gratitude for the 
opportunity to speak to Bill C-236, which would amend the 
National Parks Act to create the Stoltmann National Park.  It 
would require the Minister of Canadian Heritage to commence 
negotiations with the Government of British Columbia to ensure 
the establishment of a new national park in British Columbia 
comprising the Stoltmann wilderness area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of the bill is to designate a 500,000 hectare area, 
which includes the Elaho Valley, as the Stoltmann National Park. 
The name comes from a famous conservationist, Randy Stoltmann, 
who first proposed in April 1994 that the area be preserved, 
shortly before his untimely death. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The area is located a three hour drive north of Vancouver, not 
far from the world's famous four season resort village of 
Whistler.  It is a wilderness area located on the mainland of 
British Columbia in the coastal mountain range.  This is an 
important observation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question will arise as to why the area should be protected 
as a national park.  These are the reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the Stoltmann wilderness area has a unique ecosystem 
found nowhere else in Canada.  I visited the area twice.  The 
Stoltmann wilderness area includes ancient rain forest trees. 
Its pristine valleys of old growth forest have stands of Douglas 
firs which date back some 1,000 and even 1,300 years. The diverse 
habitat of the valley provides a home for black bears, grizzly 
bears, a moose population and other very interesting species. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1730"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT43"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT43"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1730

<A HREF="#LINKT42"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The area offers habitat to a grizzly bear population identified 
by the British Columbia wildlife branch as being threatened.  It 
is anticipated to become a grizzly bear recovery management area 
under that very province's grizzly bear conservation strategy. It 
is designed to help reverse the loss of grizzly bears in British 
Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently Clendenning Provincial Park was created by the 
province.  I congratulate the government for having done so. But 
this is not a sufficient reason to justify logging in the 
remaining grizzly bear habitat of the Elaho Valley. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members may be aware that the province of British Columbia has 
recognized the ecological value of the area by establishing three 
provincial parks.  The current parks cover less than 10% of the 
entire Stoltmann wilderness area. Grizzly bears have very large 
pristine habitat requirements and according to expert 
conservation biologists, these parks are not sufficient to 
sustain them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other animals have been sighted by experts, biologists and the 
like in the area, such as wolves, racoons, moose, deer, as well 
as numerous birds and small mammal species.  The proposed 
national park would protect one of Canada's rarest types of old 
growth forest as well as the habitat of many wildlife species, 
including grizzly bear populations that are at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second reason is that the protection of the ecosystem in the 
Stoltmann area is gradually becoming a matter of national 
concern.  Hundreds of letters and cards have come in asking for 
the protection of this unique ecosystem.  They have been sent to 
the Prime Minister, the Minister for Canadian Heritage who is 
responsible for national parks, the Minister of the Environment, 
the British Columbia premier, myself and many others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, there are numerous reports in the media on the pitiful 
state of our national parks system in general. The panel headed 
by Mr. Jacques Gérin, who is a respected international 
consultant, is about to produce a report. The federal government 
10 years ago pledged to complete the national parks system by the 
year 2000 and reiterated its commitment in the Speech from the 
Throne. It must be noted that to date, only four out of the 15 
promised parks have been created. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two years ago Parks Canada reported that only one park is not 
threatened by human activity.  The other 38 are threatened by 
logging, mining, hydroelectric development and tourism 
development.  This is an issue of great significance across the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One may ask why the Stoltmann area is not currently represented 
within the national parks system. The current national parks 
system uses a framework of 39 natural regions for planning for 
national parks.  The Stoltmann wilderness area is being clear cut 
and roads are being pushed into pristine areas, despite the fact 
that the forest service in the U.S. has imposed moratoria on road 
building on public lands in grizzly bear recovery areas. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1735"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT43"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Stoltmann area per se, we find beautiful ancient growths 
of trees which are currently logged by International Forest 
Products, Interfor, a Vancouver based company with logging rights 
in the area.  This exploitation of one of the last old growth 
forests in Canada will only generate short term benefits as the 
resource will soon be exhausted.  Establishing this park makes 
sense because it would prevent the loss of a beautiful ecosystem. 
In addition, as I will expand on in a moment, it would also 
offer a golden economic opportunity for the long term. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The long term benefits of establishing such a national park are 
very interesting and deserve to be explored.  Currently some 
estimate that logging in this area supports anywhere between 30 
and 70 local logging jobs.  By contrast, a study conducted a few 
years ago revealed that Banff National Park generates $614 
million per year for the local economy.  In Whistler the tourism 
industry has recognized the potential long term benefits of a 
national park in the area and it has commissioned a study to 
evaluate the economic benefits of the proposed Stoltmann national 
park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At present, with little infrastructure and no legal protection, 
this area already is visited frequently.  Therefore the 
establishment of the Stoltmann national park would generate 
tourism.  It would generate economic activity.  It would generate 
employment in the area where by contrast, logging jobs would be 
in decline and would eventually be phased out when the resource 
had been exhausted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I submit that a diversified economic base is critical to the 
future of communities in the region surrounding the Elaho Valley. 
A national park would secure long term benefits for the regional 
economy.  As well it would preserve this area for the benefit of 
present and future generations of visitors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Citizens, it must be said, are quite active in urging us to take 
action to protect the Stoltmann wilderness area in the valley. As 
I have explained, letters have been written in support of a 
national park. Most of these letters are private accounts 
describing the beauty encountered by people visiting the area and 
even letters of outrage at the fate of this region.  The public 
as well as many groups have currently no public venue for these 
concerns to be addressed.  As a result, there is a growing degree 
of frustration and tension in the area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1996 the province of British Columbia held a planning process 
in the lower mainland area of B.C.  Unfortunately, important 
voices were not heard in the consultation process.  Concerned 
citizens, environmental and native groups have expressed 
discontent with the lack of public access to the hearings that 
took place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover there was a serious gap in the consultation.  The 
planning process, for instance, did not include environmental 
impact assessments of the proposed land use, its impact on 
wilderness and on grizzly bear habitat.  It did not include 
economic studies of various land use options.  In fact, in order 
to find the solution, the premier of British Columbia is 
directing people to write to the federal Minister of the 
Environment on this issue, believe it or not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The discussion on the future of this valley must inevitably and 
most urgently also include the question of native rights.  In the 
Stoltmann wilderness area there are four native groups whose 
territory includes parts of Stoltmann.  The largest portion 
belongs to the Squamish native group who are currently in treaty 
negotiations. 
Squamish natives have expressed their concern that current 
logging is destroying their land. They have been closely working 
with conservation groups in order to prevent this from happening.

<A HREF="#LINKT44"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must be said that a national park would include recognition 
of native land rights. The process would begin with negotiations 
with native groups on the best approach to protect this land for 
the benefit of everyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An option could be a co-managed national park reserve such as 
the one that was set up and established quite successfully in 
South Moresby in the Queen Charlotte Islands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have explained, the merits for this proposal are numerous, 
but most important is the sense of urgency associated with it. At 
the current rate of exploitation by the logging company it will 
soon be too late.  This unique wilderness area will not be worth 
protecting any longer as private interests will run away with the 
profits and will leave behind clear cuts and impoverished land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has an opportunity to provide through the 
process of establishing a national park the much needed open 
democratic process that people have been asking for by 
negotiating with all parties involved:  concerned citizens, 
environmental and conservationist groups, the logging company, 
native groups, the tourism industry, all of them. The federal 
government has the opportunity to co-manage with the first 
nations all that this publicly owned piece of wilderness has to 
offer.  The protection of this unique wilderness area is for the 
long term benefit of everyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To conclude, this area is located in the Pacific coast mountains 
region of British Columbia. It is an area that is not yet 
represented in the network established by the Parks Canada 
system.  This is why the Stoltmann national park commands 
attention by those of us who are keen in ensuring that we have an 
adequate national parks system as a heritage for future 
generations of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know there are dissenting views on this matter.  I look 
forward to hearing the views of my colleagues and to take good 
note of what they have to say.  I am partially familiar with what 
the dissenting views are about.  Very simply, the Stoltmann 
national park stands for whether we are guided in our decision 
making process by the short term or the long term.  I hope that 
the long term will prevail.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to provide a B.C. 
perspective to this misguided initiative by the member for 
Davenport.  I will also speak on behalf of individuals and 
organizations from my constituency of West Vancouver—Sunshine 
Coast, people who live in the area where the member of parliament 
from Toronto wants to put a national park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it interesting that the member for Davenport is trying to 
foist this upon the citizens of my riding.  I surely cannot see a 
British Columbia member of parliament telling the residents of 
Davenport or anywhere else in Ontario how to manage their land 
base.  I am also intrigued by this initiative, given that the 
former secretary of state for parks and the current minister of 
heritage have rejected the idea of a national park for Stoltmann. 
It seems a member who knows so much about British Columbia is out 
of step with the cabinet ministers within his own party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Allow me to read into the record for the member for Davenport 
who is from Toronto what the secretary of state for parks said in 
a letter to the mayor of Squamish, British Columbia dated March 
19, 1999 concerning Stoltmann.  It states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parks Canada is responsible for the establishment and operation 
of national parks and uses a framework of 39 natural regions for 
planning the national parks system.  At present, 24 are 
represented by at least one national park or national park 
reserve.  In addition, lands have been reserved for a future 
national park in four other regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Randy Stoltmann wilderness area is situated in the Pacific 
coast mountains regions (natural region 1).  Gwaii Haanas and 
Pacific national park reserves currently represent this region in 
Canada's system of national parks.  Given that this region is 
well represented in the existing network, Parks Canada is 
focusing its resources on creating new national parks in those 
natural resource regions that are not yet represented.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Allow me to edify the member from Toronto further on where his 
government stands.  The following is a quote from a letter I 
received from the Minister of Canadian Heritage dated August 25, 
1999: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government is not proposing a national park for 
Stoltmann.  Parks Canada is responsible for the establishment and 
operation of national parks and uses a framework of 39 natural 
regions for planning the national parks system.  The Randy 
Stoltmann wilderness area is situated in the Pacific coast 
mountains region (natural region 1)  Gwaii Haanas and Pacific Rim 
national park reserves currently represent this region in 
Canada's system of national parks.  Given that this region is 
well represented in the existing network, Parks Canada is 
focusing its resources on creating new national parks in those 
regions that are not yet represented. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the member for Davenport if he sees any similarities in 
the two letters I just quoted from.  Does he grasp the logic and 
rationale for these decisions not to create a park in Stoltmann? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to add another reason I feel there is no need 
for another national park in British Columbia.  The Government of 
British Columbia has agreed to a protected area strategy for the 
lower mainland which resulted in 13% of the land being set aside 
for park, and a number of those parks are within the immediate 
vicinity of Stoltmann. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In May 1996 over 136,000 hectares of additional land was 
protected as parks on the lower mainland alone.  That was on top 
of the 444,000 that had already been set aside for parkland.  In 
fact, 14% of the area from the Fraser Valley to the coast is in 
protected areas.  In the Squamish area parks comprise 22% of the 
land base.  I challenge most other Canadians in major 
metropolitan areas to meet that quota of 22% of the land base for 
parks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Business paid a price at that time and lost thousands of 
hectares of timber through that process.  The British Columbia 
government assured everyone that the process of additional 
parkland was complete. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I might add, since the member who is initiating further parkland 
is not from British Columbia, that this 136,000 hectare allotment 
of parkland included the 30,357 hectare Clendenning Park and the 
19,996 hectare Upper Lillooet Park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Forest businesses in the area have categorically stated that any 
thought of a 500,000 hectare park like Stoltmann would mean the 
end of their business and consequently people on the unemployment 
line.  Perhaps that is what the member for Davenport wants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those British Columbians who developed the land use plan for the 
Squamish area agree that the plan is balanced and sets aside 
ample land for parks and protected areas.  Why does the member 
for Davenport wish to upset this balance and insinuate himself 
into the picture?  He is not from British Columbia and I know he 
did not visit this park until after he introduced the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before he or anyone from Ontario says that British Columbians 
are not sensitive to parks and protected lands, I will let him 
know that downtown Vancouver is home to the only wilderness 
forest in the world.  Its 1,000 hectares was opened in 1888 by 
Lord Stanley and has an 11 kilometre seawall circling it.  It has 
an aquarium, ponds, lagoons, towering trees, and all kinds of 
flora and fauna.  It is called Stanley Park.  Does Toronto have a 
park that is equivalent?  I think the member should spend some 
time looking at his own area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder how the member for Davenport would feel if 
preservationist splinter groups assisted by the Western Canada 
Wilderness Committee were spreading mistruths about the 
operations of companies and businesses in his riding.  These 
groups have initiated illegal blockades and have vandalized 
equipment owned by the companies attempting to carry out 
legitimate logging in the Elaho Valley.  These groups have 
misinformed the public and international customers about forestry 
and logging in British Columbia and about the Squamish area land 
use plan.  That is the real serious issue, the misinformation to 
people around the world which is hurting jobs in my community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member for Davenport condone this behaviour?  These 
same preservationists have not consulted with first nations.  The 
Lil'wat band whose traditional lands fall partially in the Elaho 
Valley vigorously oppose the creation of a park and object to the 
protester actions on their traditional lands.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does the member for Davenport feel about that?  I am sure he 
would agree with me.  He does not like these types of 
confrontations.  Why does the member for Davenport encourage 
further mistruths from these protesters about Interfor wanting to 
cut 1,300 year old trees when he and the protesters know that 
this is just not the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me say a few things about Interfor, the unfortunate company 
involved in this eco hostage taking.  Interfor leads the industry 
in the use of environmentally sensitive harvesting methods. 
Interfor owns and operates the largest helicopter logging 
operation in British Columbia.  Helicopter logging is the leading 
edge of environmentally friendly operations.  Interfor gave up 
some 30,000 hectares of tree forest licence 38 for creation of 
Clendenning Park in the upper Elaho. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Interfor practises variable retention, which means that its 
harvesting practices are designed to leave various amounts of 
standing trees.  It is known as a firm that is constantly 
evaluating its sustainable forestry.  Its practices recognize 
that a variety of systems are appropriate for different forest 
conditions.  In short, Interfor is a good corporate citizen and 
is being maligned by ecoterrorism tactics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These tactics put their workers in jeopardy.  There is no place 
for destroying the private property of anyone as these 
ecoterrorists have done to Interfor.  There are over 400 forest 
sector employees, good hard working union members and their 
families living in the Squamish area.  These people need these 
jobs.  The mayor of the district of Squamish, the council and the 
community support Interfor, as does the village of Pemberton. 
They want to see these jobs protected and land use planning 
involving the entire community.  Those who would incite to 
destroy a comprehensive and balanced approach that has been 
ratified are not welcome. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot support a bill that has little balance and knowledge of 
the area.  It initiates instability in the Squamish area and as 
such incites unrest and disharmony.  The member for Davenport 
should stay out of the affairs of British Columbians.  I reject 
his initiative, and so do my constituents, outright. 
<P><A NAME="LINK187"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to have the opportunity to enter into the debate on 
this private member's bill which is designed to amend the 
National Parks Act by designating the Stoltmann wilderness area 
as one of the Canada's national parks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must admit my surprise when I discovered that the bill was 
introduced by the hon. colleague from Davenport, Ontario.  By no 
means would I question his sincerity or his commitment to 
protecting Canada's distinctive and vitally important ecosystems, 
as the member has demonstrated that many times in committee and 
in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To the contrary, I think the member should be congratulated for 
taking an interest in wanting to preserve an important part of 
our habitat for future generations of Canadians to enjoy.  What 
was so surprising was the fact the proposed piece of legislation 
was introduced by a member of the Ontario Liberal caucus rather 
than by one of the government's own Liberal members representing 
ridings within the province of British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps there is a very simple explanation why a member for 
Davenport, Ontario, would introduce a piece of legislation that 
could have such a significant economic impact on the people of 
the province of British Columbia.  Perhaps Liberal cabinet 
ministers from British Columbia refused to consider the bill for 
fear of attracting the opposition the bill would certainly 
generate.  Maybe we could hear later from Liberal cabinet members 
to get their perspective on the particular piece of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is more likely that his Liberal colleagues from British 
Columbia simply do not support this private member's bill.  Well 
they should not because it is a very bad piece of legislation 
that could seriously impact upon the social and economic 
well-being of the people of the Elaho Valley and surrounding 
areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We recognize the importance of trying to find a balance between 
protecting the environment and encouraging economic development. 
The province of British Columbia has certainly attempted to do 
both with its land management programs.  Bill C-236 could have a 
significant negative impact on British Columbia's forest 
industry, an industry that in 1998 recorded factory shipments of 
$15.6 billion.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This industry is an extremely important contributor to the 
British Columbian economy.  Therefore any decisions to designate 
a significant portion of that province's wilderness as parkland 
must be delayed until all stakeholders have an opportunity to 
debate the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one has to educate British Columbians about the importance of 
protecting its natural environment.  British Columbia already 
boasts the second largest park system in Canada, second only to 
Canada Parks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To date the province of British Columbia has surpassed 10 
million hectares of protected land.  This includes 679 provincial 
parks, recreation areas and ecological reserves.  This equals 
10.6% of the province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The province of British Columbia appears well on its way to 
surpassing its minimum goal of protecting 12% of its ecosystem by 
the year 2000.  This would be a considerable achievement, 
particularly since it would surpass the 12% recommendation of the 
United Nations Commission on the Environment, or more 
specifically the Brundtland commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of British Columbia recognize the importance of 
maintaining existing parks while working in partnership toward 
the creation of future protected areas.  British Columbians 
recognize the tremendous social and economic benefits derived 
from their provincial parks, their recreation areas, as well as 
their ecological reserves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1998 their registered camping visits almost reached three 
million.  These campers generated huge economic benefits for 
local residents.  Total visits to British Columbia's areas 
surpassed the 26 million mark, resulting in an economic boon for 
the B.C. tourism industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Millions of tourists from all over the world are attracted to 
British Columbia because of its natural beauty.  These tourists 
can take advantage of over 3,000 kilometres of hiking trails. 
They have access to over 234 parks which are equipped with 
facilities to address the specific needs of disabled visitors. 
Visitors can witness for themselves a province that boasts the 
largest intact coastal temperate rain forest in the world, which 
is protected in the Kitlope Heritage Conservancy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on and on talking about the beauty of our western 
most province.  However I believe that one must visit it oneself 
to truly appreciate the beauty nature has to offer.  I am not at 
any time trying to suggest that British Columbia should somehow 
refrain from designating future areas as protected parks. Nothing 
could be further from the truth.  The Progressive Conservative 
Party has always promoted the protection of representative areas 
of Canada's fragile ecosystem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Going as far back as Canada's first prime minister, our party 
has continuously demonstrated its concern for protecting our 
natural habitat for future generations to enjoy.  Sir John A. 
Macdonald created Canada's national park in 1885 when he stepped 
in to protect 26 kilometres around the hot mineral spring near 
what is now the town of Banff, declaring it a national treasure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1988 the previous Progressive Conservative Party amended the 
National Parks Act and saw the passage of the Heritage Railway 
Stations Protection Act.  That same government also introduced a 
national marine parks policy in 1986. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Progressive Conservative Party continues to encourage the 
establishment of new national parks as witnessed by our recent 
support for the creation of the Tuktut Nogait National Park in 
the Northwest Territories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In some respects the member for Davenport deserves a lot of 
credit for attempting to create a new national park in British 
Columbia.  He has recognized that his Liberal government has 
failed miserably to fulfil its promises of protecting a system of 
ecologically representative areas by the year 2000.  The 
Government of Canada has set a goal of protecting 12% of its 
territory by the year 2000 but to date has achieved just slightly 
more than 6%.  The Liberal government has once again failed to 
live up to its commitment to the Canadian people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously the member for Davenport is trying to distinguish 
himself, or perhaps distance himself, from the rest of his 
Liberal colleagues who have continuously demonstrated to the 
Canadian people by their decision not to cancel the GST or change 
the free trade agreement that they could care less whether they 
break their promises to the Canadian public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, in his haste to try and salvage his government's 
dismal record, the member for Davenport has introduced a bill 
that fails to take into consideration the need for important 
consultation and valuable input from its stakeholders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Back in 1996 representatives from industry, first nations, 
community groups, outdoor tourism associations, recreational 
groups and conservation groups met with provincial government 
officials to outline a plan for future protected areas.

<A HREF="#LINKT48"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of these consultations, the government introduced a 
comprehensive protected area strategy.  This is a significant 
achievement that came about through a comprehensive, consultative 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-236 would have us ignore the achievements of all these 
stakeholders by specifically excluding them from any future 
consultation process surrounding the establishment of the 
Stoltmann wilderness area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill calls upon the federal minister to enter into 
negotiations with the Government of British Columbia to determine 
precise legal boundaries for the proposed park.  There is no 
mention in the bill of any opportunity for stakeholders to have 
any input whatsoever in determining boundaries for this park. 
This is totally unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not convinced that the introduction of Bill C-236 came as a 
result of any major consultation with stakeholders.  Both British 
Columbia ministers of forestry and environment have already 
expressed opposition to the bill, as have representatives from 
industry and first nations.  The bill lacked a strong basis of 
support even before it made its way to the floor of the House of 
Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Progressive Conservative Party understands that creating new 
national park protected areas is very difficult and 
time-consuming.  However, it is important to have a full 
consultation process in place so that we can identify appropriate 
conservation areas that will have the support of the large 
majority of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only by working together and consulting together can we develop 
a new national park in which all Canadians can be proud. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-236 is seriously flawed in this respect.  Therefore, for 
this reason and those stated previously, we cannot support the 
proposed piece of legislation. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK188"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Raymonde Folco (Laval West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to support Bill C-236, which concerns the establishment of the 
Stoltmann National Park in British Columbia, because I think 
this proposed national reserve meets three key objectives which 
are dear to Canadians. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first objective, I am pleased to hear, if this park is 
created, would contribute to the protection of biodiversity. 
This is a commitment Canada made at the biodiversity convention 
and has provided leadership on globally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This park would protect a rare habitat, an old growth coastal 
Douglas fir forest.  The Douglas fir is extremely well-known in 
Canada but there is less than a few percent of this old growth 
forest type that has been left unlogged on Canada's west coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The park includes trees of remarkable age and size, including 
Douglas fir trees, which are over 1,300 years old, Canada's 
oldest known Douglas firs.  As primary forests become 
increasingly rare planet-wide, increasing attention is placed on 
how countries are managing the remaining old growth stands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada would face criticism, not only from our citizens but from 
people around the world, if we were to continue cutting down 
thousand year old trees in this new millennium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As mentioned previously, the park would not only protect trees 
but would also protect the essential old growth habitat of a 
threatened population of west coast grizzly bears.  I will not 
mention all of the animals that were mentioned before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A second objective of importance to Canadians is ensuring that 
our economy is strong and full of a wide range of opportunities 
for our citizens as we enter a new millennium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At a time when rural areas are losing their populations to the 
cities, those who remain in the rural areas are concerned about 
diversifying their local economies.  This project would provide 
the greatest stability for the future, in particular for 
ecotourism.  Rural Canadians are concerned about the 
concentration of wealth and economic opportunities in urban 
areas.  National parks can be part of the answer since they bring 
people from urban areas to rural towns and regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member for Davenport noted, economic studies of the 
benefits of Banff National Park point to a good possibility of 
significant employment and economic opportunities to Squamish and 
other communities in the region of the projected park. 
These regions have suffered employment decreases in traditional 
resource sectors over the last few years. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1805"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT49"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A Stoltmann national park, therefore, would greatly strengthen 
opportunities for small business, ecotourism and tourism 
development in the Squamish-Whistler-Vancouver corridor, 
especially in conjunction with Whistler's 2010 Olympic bid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third objective important to Canadians today that Stoltmann 
national park achieves is the opportunity for first nations to 
co-operatively manage a part of their traditional territories in 
a manner that benefits the environment, the regional economy and 
their own communities.  Squamish first nations leaders have 
indicated publicly that they do not want to see areas like the 
Elaho Valley in the Stoltmann wilderness logged. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should mention that in my riding of Laval, we also understand 
the importance of the environment as well as what it can bring 
us both from a personal perspective, for example from the 
perspective of health, and from an economic perspective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Laval will provide a 40 kilometre portion of the green way, a 
bikeway network that goes around the whole of Quebec. Laval will 
take part in this project by harmonizing its own network with 
the green way network. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This will help Laval keep its place among the cities that have 
played a pioneering role in the ecotourism industry, one of the 
industries with the best record on sustainable development. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very important bill.  Even though it may have been 
presented by someone out of the province, it has been presented 
by a member of parliament who thinks about ecotourism and 
economic development.  After all, British Columbia is a province 
of Canada and I see no wrong in having another member of the 
Canadian parliament present this private member's bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is timely and would create the kind of national park 
reserve that we could all be proud of.  Canadians have indicated 
that they want to see greater protection of their national 
heritage.  We have a responsibility to ensure that protection is 
afforded before it is too late. 
<P><A NAME="LINK189"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am happy to speak to Bill C-236, an act to amend the 
National Parks Act.  It specifically deals with the Elaho Valley 
near Squamish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of this private member's bill from the member for 
Davenport, the Liberal government is on the record as not being 
in favour of it.  I also happen to know that the NDP member from 
New Westminster is not with the member on this bill, even though 
he can usually be relied upon to promote preserving forests in 
British Columbia, the taking of land from the working forest and 
putting it into the preservation of the forest. The province is 
certainly not in favour of the bill.  There is a very long 
history to what has gone on in this valley. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been in this valley and in this area.  I had an 
invitation from the union to travel to the area.  I have also 
travelled to the area with some European parliamentarians, and 
with the member for Davenport as recently as September of this 
year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To put it all in some context, I have worked adjacent to Pacific 
Rim Park and to what was then the germination of a national park 
in South Moresby.  Both are in the same region, one of the 39 
regions identified by Parks Canada as regions requiring national 
parks. There are already two parks in the region that are also 
represented by the Elaho Valley.  There are other regions that 
have no national parks.  Rightfully, the priority of the 
department of the government is not in this region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>B.C. has turned itself inside out in terms of land use planning, 
particularly on forestry issues. 
British Columbia has been targeted by people around the world as 
an area of great beauty, of great forest resources and of special 
forests.  Consequently, the United Nations targets were adopted 
quite some time ago; 12% preservation.  We currently exceed that 
number already on the coast of British Columbia, the very area 
covered in the bill. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1810"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT51"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT51"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1810

<A HREF="#LINKT50"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have an enviable track record.  One of the things that must 
be considered, and the member for Davenport said it, is that this 
area is three hours drive from Vancouver.  There are individuals 
in preservation oriented groups who have decided that they want 
to create their own domain at public expense in an area they can 
easily access close to Vancouver.  Because 95% of the B.C. forest 
land is publicly owned and because provincial governments tend to 
respond to the public, coastal B.C. has now reached this 12% 
target through a public consultation process. That is the way it 
should be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a very strong message that can be delivered.  As 
Canadian representatives in Europe, when we talked to European 
parliamentarians this spring, we talked about the fact that we 
have been so responsible with our forest practices in British 
Columbia, in Canada in the Canadian context that we tend to be 
targeted because we do have this substantial old growth reserve 
virtually across Canada.  Many countries have totally diminished 
that old growth reserve.  We are never going to get there because 
of our very responsible practices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the bill tends to do is promote continued agitation.  The 
reality is that there are protesters in this area.  I have 
visited the protest site.  From the very site where the protest 
was being carried out, I could see the 30,000 hectare Glendenning 
Park that has just been established to satisfy land use concerns 
in that area. I found this most disconcerting because any users 
that wanted to have that old growth experience only had to go 
there instead of where they were. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I talked to members of the union who were working in that area. 
They are very frustrated. They have had months of head games and 
attempts to incite a response by these very professional 
agitators.  It is not a very nice way to spend a day trying to 
earn a living. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary, the 30,000 hectare Glendenning Park does a more than 
adequate job.  There is no great public pressure on it at this 
point as there is on hundreds of thousands of hectares of other 
preserved areas on the B.C. coast.  We need to balance the 
environment and the jobs.  This is what the provincial land use 
planning exercise was all about.  We have gone through that in 
the 1990s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can only wonder why the member for Davenport is trying to 
upset this balance that we have now achieved on the coast of 
British Columbia. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK190"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mauril Bélanger (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I also 
want to speak briefly to Bill C-236, which was put forward by my 
hon. colleague from Davenport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe everyone knows that our national park network, as it 
now stands, is appreciated by all Canadians. 
However, it is not quite completed, and this is what I want to 
discuss. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1815"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT52"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT52"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1815

<A HREF="#LINKT51"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before 1970, we did not really have a network. It was a network 
in name only because at the time locations were selected 
somewhat haphazardly. We then embarked upon a very elaborate 
process to develop a master plan to set up a national park 
network. It was determined that Canada had 39 unique and natural 
ecosystems that deserved to be included in the Canadian national 
park network. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So far, we have been able to include in our network 25 of these 
39 distinct and unique ecosystems in order to preserve them for 
future generations. 
There are 14 other regions where we have yet to create a 
national park that would include quite a substantial sample of 
the ecosystems and natural areas we want to protect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question then is the following: Does the hon. member's bill 
cover one of the 14 geographical regions that need to be 
preserved and protected? Unfortunately, the answer is no, 
because there are already two national parks near the location 
where the hon. member wants to establish another park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From what I gathered from the comments made earlier by the hon. 
member for Davenport, he essentially hopes that we are guided by 
the long term. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“That we are guided by the long term” were our colleague's 
closing words when he introduced his bill.  I would like to 
believe, as we established in 1970 a plan that would protect 39 
of the ecological zones in Canada which were distinct and had to 
be protected—and we have achieved 25, with 14 remaining—that we 
have been guided by the long term. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, I say to the member that the area that he is proposing be 
included in the national parks network already benefits from two 
national parks in that very area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are to be guided by the long term, as he suggests, and I 
agree, as does the government, then perhaps our efforts should be 
concentrated in finding and establishing national parks to 
represent the 14 ecological zones or regions that are not yet 
protected within our network of national parks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, it is my understanding that the British Columbia 
government has moved to protect some of the land mass that our 
colleague would like to see protected within a national park.  I 
am advised that three of the areas which are mentioned in the 
proposed bill are under some protection from the Government of 
British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All this is to say that, indeed, we are being guided by an 
established plan, which everybody buys into, to protect for the 
benefit of future generations 39 ecological zones, 39 zones of 
natural geography and climate, that are representative of the 
majestic geography of Canada.  We should finish achieving that 
objective in the 14 geographic regions that are not yet in that 
network.  Therefore, it is not within the priorities of the 
government to proceed with the establishment of the park 
suggested by our colleague in his private member's bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  There are 10 minutes 
left in the time provided for Private Members' Business.  Seeing 
no members rising, the member sponsoring the bill, the hon. 
member for Davenport, will have five minutes for his response, 
and at the termination of that five minutes the debate will 
cease. 
<P><A NAME="LINK191"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, let 
me first thank the member for Ottawa—Vanier, the member for 
Vancouver Island North, the member for Laval West and the members 
for Brandon—Souris and West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast for their 
interventions and for their comments. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1820"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT52"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will deal first with the claim that the area is already 
represented by other parks.  I am particularly addressing the 
member for Ottawa—Vanier who, with all due respect, is not on 
the right track. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current national parks system, as he mentioned, uses a 
framework of 39 regions for the purpose of planning national 
parks.  The Stoltmann wilderness area is located in the Pacific 
coast mountains region, the natural region No. 1.  Two parks 
called Gwaii Haanas and Pacific Rim National Park Reserve 
currently represent this region in the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The two parks are beautiful.  They certainly deserve protection 
and they have received it.  Both parks are located, however, on 
islands off the mainland coast.  They are not located in the 
coast mountains.  This is the very ecosystem that these two parks 
are supposed to represent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, I submit respectfully to the parliamentary secretary, 
that there is a very legitimate reason for proposing this park: 
this particular region on the mainland is not represented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, we have the rather spurious and unfounded argument by 
the member for Brandon—Souris who tossed out his conclusion that 
this is a bad piece of legislation because consultations are not 
included in the legislation.  The legislation is intended to 
provide a broad framework, a concept for the establishment of a 
park.  The regulations then set out the process of consultations 
which are natural and most essential in the formation of any 
national park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this stage, when logging is taking place and the roof of the 
house is on fire, we are certainly not going to put consultations 
first on paper and then into legislation.  We first need some 
form of legislation that will allow the consultations to take 
place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will move swiftly to the member for West Vancouver—Sunshine 
Coast, who has, I must say, a rather insular view of an MP's 
role.  He thinks everybody should sit in their own little cubicle 
in downtown Toronto or uptown Montreal, or safely in the harbour 
of St. John's, and the rest of Canada does not count; it does not 
matter what happens there; we are elected like municipal 
councillors; and we should not take a view of the nation or the 
country as a whole.  Well, that is his privilege. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I invite him to visit Davenport and give us advice on how to 
establish a Stanley Park, for which we envy Vancouverites all the 
time when we manage to visit Vancouver.  In my case, I am an 
adopted British Columbian considering the number of times I have 
crossed the country to visit it.  I have been in this particular 
area twice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that it is perfectly legitimate from downtown 
Toronto to look at what happens on either coast or in the Arctic, 
and for members from British Columbia to tell us in Toronto how 
to improve our industrial set up, how to reduce pollution, how to 
improve on our public transit, anything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I invite the member for West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast to visit 
Toronto.  I would be glad to take him out to a spaghetti dinner 
and introduce him to a lot of very interesting people who know 
how make wine at home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As to the position of the department, let me add that 15 years 
ago the department was also indifferent to the creation of South 
Moresby.  It was extremely difficult to convince the department 
to take to heart the creation of a park in South Moresby. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, because of people like Speaker Fraser, other people who 
were then in government and some of us in the opposition, that 
park eventually became a reality many years later.  These 
processes are very slow and complex. 
The political rewards cannot be seen by the same generation but 
perhaps can be harvested by the next one.

election debate Mayor Lonsdale said she would look positively at 
the proposal if an economic study recommended it and if more jobs 
including replacements for displaced forest workers were created 
than lost.  This is a very responsible statement by the mayor.  I 
must congratulate her. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also the concerns of Chief Williams must be put on record. Chief 
Williams opposes logging by Interfor in the Elaho Valley. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Vancouver Island North made a reference to the 
adequacy of what has been done so far.  The Elaho Valley is the 
heart of this particular area.  It is the most valuable habitat 
of the entire valley.  Without the Elaho heart we would lose the 
real significance and the real potential from the habitat 
potential point of view, from the ecosystem point of view, that 
the entire valley has.  It would amputate the valley. Half of it 
would become clear cut and the other half along the slopes of the 
mountains would remain, thus depriving the habitat adequate 
protection.

members join me in allowing the senior member of the House of 
Commons what time is necessary to wrap up as we did not want to 
rush it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The time provided for the consideration of Private Members' 
Business has now expired and the order is dropped from the order 
paper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It being 6.28 p.m., the House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 
10 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
