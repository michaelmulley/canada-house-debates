<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="YUKONSURFACERIGHTSBOARDACT">YUKON SURFACE RIGHTS BOARD ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed from November 24 consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-55, an act to establish a board having 
jurisdiction concerning disputes respecting surface rights in 
respect of land in Yukon territory and to amend other acts in 
relation thereto, be read the third time and passed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to address Bill C-55. The 
function of the board will be to resolve disputes between parties 
concerning surface rights and access to subsurface rights.
<P>
	As the House knows, this bill is linked to two previous bills 
passed-let me rephrase that, rammed through this 
Chamber-that dealt with land claims and self-government 
agreements in Yukon.
<P>
	Unfortunately, the passage of Bill C-55 will allow these 
previous bills to come into force. One of our reasons for 
opposing this bill is because of its close association with the 
other two bills. Further reasons to oppose Bill C-55 are derived 
from its potential to increase bureaucracy, increase government 
expenditures and create conflict of interest situations.
<P>
<B>(1005) </B>
<P>
	The umbrella final agreement between the Government of 
Canada, the Council of Yukon Indians and the Government of 
Yukon was signed on May 29, 1993.
<P>
	Chapter 8 of that agreement sets out the requirement for 
establishing the surface rights board and outlines some of its 
duties and powers.
<P>
	Bill C-55 is the enabling legislation to create such a board. I 
am pleased to see within schedule II, clause 2(1), the use of 
waterfront right of way on settlement land for recreational 
purposes is guaranteed and cannot be limited by the powers of 
the board.
<P>
	Further, the board cannot deny a person the right to cross and 
make stops on undeveloped settlement lands in order to reach 
adjacent lands for commercial or non-commercial purposes. As 
well, people will have the right to enter, cross and stay on 
undeveloped settlement land for recreational purposes.
<P>
	In all, I am pleased that an individual's right to travel across 
lands in Yukon for recreational or non-recreational purposes 
will not be subject to stringent entry and exit parameters as 
established by the board.
<P>
	As well, another important aspect of the bill is that it does not 
change the legal rights of miners. I would like to turn to some of 
the problems that I see contained within Bill C-55. Let us first 
look at the bureaucracy.
<P>
	At a time when the government is drowning in deficits and 
debt, we have to be extremely cautious as to any possible 
increase in government expenditures. What we see issuing forth 
from DIAND in the form of land claim and self-government 
agreements are increased expenditures through increased 
bureaucracy.
<P>
	This is demonstrated in the umbrella final agreement and Bill 
C-55 is simply one piece of a larger, bureaucratic maze yet to be 
constructed in Yukon. The Yukon surface board is one of five 
boards, panels, councils and subcommittees yet to be 
established in Yukon pursuant to the umbrella agreement and 
previous Yukon legislation.
<P>
	Yet to be created are the following: Yukon land use council; 
Yukon heritage resource board; Yukon geographical place 
names board; fish and wildlife management board and its 
salmon subcommittees, all to be funded by the federal 
government. Let me rephrase that as well, all to be funded by the 
taxpayers of Canada.
<P>
	In all, when we speak of expenditures and when we consider 
that Bill C-55 is an agreement dealing with matters within 
Yukon territory and specifically dealing with matters relating to 
Yukon Indians, I believe it is only fair to ask these two parties to 
pay for the operation of the board.
<P>
	Yukon Indians have been awarded power over resources, 
power in taxation and they have been given financial 
compensation for a 15-year period. Given these abilities and 
given the fact that 50 per cent of the membership of the board are 
Yukon Indian 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8280"> 8280 </A></B>
<P>
nominees, it is only reasonable to ask them to pay their fair share 
of the costs of the operation of the board.
<P>
	Our amendment at committee stage would have achieved this 
cost sharing agreement between Yukon Indians and the 
territorial government but it was soundly defeated by the Liberal 
majority. Therefore Bill C-55 will pull more money out of the 
pockets of the Canadian taxpayer everywhere in Canada since 
the federal government has so generously agreed to fund the 
entire cost of the new board.
<P>
	Let us look at finance. I am pleased to see that clause 23(5) 
allows the Auditor General to review the financial statements 
and financial transactions of the board annually. Unfortunately 
past experience has demonstrated that while the Auditor 
General has raised concerns over the lack of accountability and 
expenditures of moneys at DIAND, the department has 
displayed complete disregard for the Auditor General's 
recommendations.
<P>
	However, it is curious that while Reformers proposed 
amendments to Bill C-34 that would have allowed the Auditor 
General the ability to review the financial transactions of 
self-governing institutions making use of federal moneys, these 
amendments were defeated by the Liberals at committee and in 
this House.
<P>
	As well, with respect to the expenditures of the board, I am 
concerned with clause 23(2) and the notion that the board's 
budget will include moneys for cross-cultural orientation and 
education. This seems to be wide open for abuse. I am looking 
forward to seeing the guidelines for cross-cultural orientation 
and the expenditures that such an orientation will incur.
<P>
<B>(1010) </B>
<P>
	Let us now turn to patronage. Other portions of this bill which 
concern me are clauses 8 and 19. Clause 8 stipulates that 
members of the board are to be appointed by the minister of 
Indian affairs. This is a board that is ready for a whole multitude 
of Liberal patronage appointments. The Liberals have shown no 
fear in their first year in office in appointing their own cronies to 
various positions within government or awarding government 
contracts to the party faithful.
<P>
	Then again maybe we are being too critical. After all, perhaps 
it is all a coincidence and like the Prime Minister said they are 
qualified individuals, they just happen to be Liberals.
<P>
	Old line parties like the Liberals are incapable of raising their 
political morality above this age old tradition of appointing old 
friends and confidants. Accordingly we have proposed an 
amendment which would allow half of the members of the board 
to be appointed on the nomination of Yukon territorial 
government. This would be similar to clause 9, section 2, which 
permits Yukon Indians to put forward nominees to be appointed. 
Again our amendment was voted down, thereby ensuring that 50 
per cent of the board will be ripe for patronage appointments 
from Ottawa.
<P>
	The possibility of patronage does not end with appointments 
from the federal government. Clause 19 of the bill allows the 
board to hire consultants and advisers and fix the terms of their 
employment as well as their remunerations. Again the 
possibility exists whereby members of the board may seek to 
employ their closest associates as consultants or advisers.
<P>
	When and if these people are hired board members can use the 
Prime Minister's excuse; yes, he is a consultant hired by the 
board, yes he is very qualified and yes he just happens to be a 
friend and, best of all, he happens to be a Liberal.
<P>
	Let us now look at conflict of interest. Following closely on 
the heels of this possible problem with patronage is the bill's 
wilful disregard of problems surrounding conflict of interest 
situations. Subclause 10(3) is very specific in assuring that 
neither appointments nor an individual's membership on the 
board shall be affected by the fact that they have an interest in 
land in Yukon territory.
<P>
	Therefore it is possible that a conflict of interest may arise 
since a member of a panel of the board may have a direct interest 
in the outcome of a case brought before him or her. Again we put 
forward what seems to be a reasonable amendment to ensure that 
board members may not sit on panels that are considering 
matters which may have a direct impact on the interest of that 
particular member. Again this was voted down by the Liberal 
majority.
<P>
	However there may still be hope since clauses 18(a) and 18(b) 
allow the board to enact bylaws relating to the grounds for 
removal of members and the assignment of members to panels, 
respectively.
<P>
	I would hope that the board in its wisdom and in drafting these 
bylaws would ensure that a member can be removed for blatant 
conflict of interest activities and that panels of the board will not 
consist of individuals who have a direct interest in the outcome 
of the cases before them.
<P>
	We in the Reform Party have continually argued for public 
involvement in these agreements between Indians and 
government. The government of B.C. appears to have 
recognized the discontent the populace is feeling with respect to 
the secrecy of land claim negotiations and has taken some small 
steps to open up the process.
<P>
	The public wants to be consulted on these matters and it wants 
to know how these agreements affect it. As residents of B.C., as 
residents of Yukon and as citizens of Canada they have a right to 
know, a right to participate. It is the crown's land that is being 
dealt away and it is their money that is being scattered about.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8281"> 8281 </A></B>
<P>
	While the province of B.C. may be waking up to this reality 
this government has made no meaningful attempt to include the 
public in negotiation of these agreements.
<P>
<B>(1015 ) </B>
<P>
	DIAND briefing material with respect to Bill C-55 states that 
the public was consulted by sending the guidelines to major 
interest groups in Yukon. Not enough consultation? Then how 
about this: An advertisement was placed in Yukon newspaper 
announcing the availability of the guidelines for review by the 
public.
<P>
	The bottom line is that there was virtually no public 
involvement and no information relating to the board, its 
operations, its duties, its powers and how it affects the residents 
of Yukon. We hear similar complaints over Yukon land claims 
and self-government agreements.
<P>
	There were only a chosen few who were aware that such 
legislation was ready to be tabled. Indeed even as 
parliamentarians we were not alerted until 48 hours before the 
legislation was to be tabled in this House.
<P>
	This government promised consultation. This government 
promised public input. This government promised to listen. 
These were hollow promises. Obviously this government is not 
concerned about the public input. This government is not 
worried about the public's concerns.
<P>
	This government is simply worried about expediency in 
passing legislation that creates more bureaucracy, more 
patronage, more conflict of interest and costs the Canadian 
taxpayers a ton of money. With these goals and with the present 
financial health of the federal treasury it is apparent as to why 
this government attempts to keep the public in the dark.
<P>
	While I recognize that industry supposedly favours this bill 
simply to settle native land claims in Yukon and therefore 
remove blockades to investment, I cannot support this bill for 
the reasons cited and its link to Bills C-33 and C-34.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Iyerak Anawak (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, 
Lib.):</B>
<P>
	[<I>Editor's Note: Member spoke in Inuktitut.</I>]
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to speak today on the 
third reading of Bill C-55, Yukon surface rights board act.
<P>
	I am honoured to participate in this debate because I know 
how much this bill means to the people of Yukon. When we pass 
this bill and it is proclaimed along with Bills C-33 and C-34 
which were passed by this House last June Yukon land claims 
settlement will come into force. The years of waiting will be 
over. The people of Yukon will be able to get on with their lives 
in new partnerships and new relationships with each other and 
with other Canadians.
<P>
	Hon. members will recall that Bill C-33, Yukon First Nations 
Land Claims Settlement Act approves and gives effect to the 
land claim agreements of four Yukon First Nations: the Vuntut 
Gwichin First Nation, the First Nation of Nacho Nyak Dun, the 
Champagne and Aishihik First Nations, and the Teslin Tlingit 
Council. Bill C-34, Yukon First Nations Self-Government Act 
gives effect to the self-government agreements of the same four 
Yukon First Nations.
<P>
	Bills C-33 and C-34 also authorize the governor in council to 
approve and declare valid future land claims and 
self-government agreements negotiated with the remaining 10 
Yukon First Nations.
<P>
	All these bills flow directly from the umbrella final 
agreement signed by Canada, Yukon Territorial Government and 
the Council for Yukon Indians on May 29, 1993.
<P>
	Bill C-55 is the third and final piece of legislation required to 
bring Yukon land claims settlement into effect. Through Bill 
C-55 a new surface rights regime and dispute resolution 
mechanism will be established in Yukon to accommodate the 
new land regime set out in the claim agreement.
<P>
	As a result of Bill C-55 industry and individuals in Yukon will 
have a known regime for obtaining access to both private and 
public lands. This regime will provide clear rules and 
regulations. Once this bill is enacted and we begin to implement 
First Nations final agreements there will be more certainty for 
everyone in Yukon. That certainty will translate into economic 
development opportunities. This will contribute to the 
government's objectives of putting Canadians back to work. The 
importance of providing this solid basis for economic growth 
and diversification in Yukon cannot be overstated.
<P>
<B>(1020) </B>
<P>
	Passage of this bill which will bring Yukon Indian land claim 
into effect signals to all Canadians and to international investors 
that Yukon is open for business. As well, the surface rights board 
and the other institutions of public government that result from 
Yukon land claim agreement will contribute to the political and 
administrative development of the territory. Important 
decisions will be made in Yukon, not in Ottawa. This is an 
objective supported by all Yukoners, the territorial government 
and the Government of Canada.
<P>
	Clearly Bill C-55 does more than just create a new institution 
of government. It is critical to the social, political and economic 
evolution of Yukon.
<P>
	I reviewed very carefully the speeches given by members of 
the opposition during second reading debate of this bill. While 
most were critical, as is to be expected in opposition speeches, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8282"> 8282 </A></B>
<P>
some contributions were thoughtful and constructive. Others 
were plain meanspirited and some contained errors of fact.
<P>
	I would like to take this opportunity to thank the members of 
the Bloc Quebecois for their support in this House and in 
committee of this bill and of the settlement of Yukon land claim.
<P>
	The hon. member for Saint-Jean took the time this summer to 
visit Yukon. He met with representatives of Yukon Indian people 
when he was there. His effort to get to know this most beautiful 
region of Canada and the wonderful people who live there is 
appreciated. While I do not agree with his entire philosophy, his 
effort to gain a better understanding of aboriginal issues by 
going to Yukon was certainly a step in the right direction.
<P>
	I trust the hon. member and his party will be as open-minded, 
supportive and generous in dealing with the aboriginal claims of 
the aboriginal peoples in his own province.
<P>
	As an aside, I do have to correct the member on an incorrect 
statement in his second reading speech on Bill C-55. He stated 
that the James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement was 
entirely financed by the Quebec government and that the 
Government of Canada did not invest any money in it. That is 
false. The Government of Canada is a signatory to the James Bay 
and Northern Quebec Agreement and has ongoing 
implementation responsibilities and obligations. The 
Government of Canada has provided substantial funding in 
support of this agreement. I want to correct any 
misunderstanding there.
<P>
	Getting back to Bill C-55, during second reading most 
members of the third party contributed a lot of misinformation. I 
am being extremely charitable in this characterization of their 
comments. This bill was called a recipe for disaster, among 
other things on more than one occasion.
<P>
	I want to assure members of the third party that Yukon land 
claim settlement, which this bill will help bring into force, is not 
a divisive thing. It is an achievement of which all Yukoners and 
indeed all Canadians can be proud. It represents a bonding of the 
peoples, a coming together of different interests and 
perspectives for the common good.
<P>
	I remind hon. members that the bill before us today cements 
an agreement which took over 20 years to negotiate. The parties 
to this agreement, Yukon territorial government, the federal 
government and the Council for Yukon Indians, all brought 
different positions and views to the negotiating table.
<P>
	Over the years negotiations floundered many times. Leaders 
and governments changed. Negotiators changed. Negotiating 
parameters changed. This process was fitful and frustrating, but 
the parties stuck to it. They did not give up hope. They argued, 
compromised and they emerged finally with an agreement. This 
is therefore a proud day for Yukoners and they deserve our 
congratulations.
<P>
	What has been accomplished in Yukon is no small 
achievement. The agreements and the bills effecting the 
agreements may not be perfect, but they are the products of 
many people working together for common objectives: mutual 
respect and recognition, clarity of rules, certainty of rights, and 
a better future for future generations. This is a made in Yukon 
deal, made by Yukoners for Yukoners and it is unique to Yukon. 
It reflects Yukon needs and aspirations.
<P>
<B>(1025) </B>
<P>
	Thus far I have restrained myself in this speech from rebutting 
some of the more provocative and outrageous comments made 
by members of the third party, but there is one I just cannot let go 
by. The comment I am referring to was made by a member of the 
third party, who will remain nameless, during second reading 
debate. The comment is in reference to Bill C-55. He stated: ``It 
borders on the tragic to heap so much responsibility on so few''.
<P>
	Let me assure the member and all members of that party that 
Yukon is more than ready for this responsibility. Yukoners will 
handle this responsibility much better than anyone else. Size is 
not a determinant of value or worth. So what if the population of 
Yukon is less than most cities in Canada, as some members of 
the third party pointed out. The Yukon and its people deserve the 
same respect, consideration and recognition of their rights and 
abilities to make their own decisions as anyone else in this 
country. They have agreed through their elected leaders to forge 
a new direction and build a better future together. Their decision 
must be respected and supported.
<P>
	I would like to conclude my remarks today by quoting from 
the presentation made by the Council for Yukon Indians to the 
Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs during its review of 
Bill C-55: ``The enactment of Yukon surface rights board act 
will pave the way for the proclamation of Yukon Land Claims 
and Self-Government Acts. The Council for Yukon Indians and 
Yukon First Nations have worked extremely hard in the past 21 
years to see the manifestation of the vision of Yukon First 
Nation elders. Yukon First Nations look forward to participating 
in these constitutional innovative regimes that have been 
advanced and negotiated in the interests of all parties 
concerned''.
<P>
	So do we. On behalf of the minister and the government, I 
extend warm congratulations and best wishes for success to all 
the people of Yukon.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
thank the hon. member opposite for his speech.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8283"> 8283 </A></B>
<P>
	I probably should begin by saying that I restrained myself 
from rising on a point of order when he used terminology which 
just yesterday was ruled unparliamentary by the Speaker in 
referring to us.
<P>
	I would like to tell hon. members and this member in 
particular, as emphatically as I can, that we bear absolutely 
nothing but the very, very best wishes for the people he is 
representing. It is very unfair, I think, when we begin to debate 
the issues to degenerate into name calling. I resent that because I 
do not think it adds to the debate at all.
<P>
	I would like to ask some very serious questions. First of all, in 
the government ramming through Bills C-33 and C-34 last 
June, did it really add to the understanding and the conviviality 
among different parts of our society? One of the problems is that 
many people feel that things are being rammed down their 
throats and they have no real input. We do not have an 
opportunity as members of Parliament to represent the wishes of 
all our constituents.
<P>
	It seems to me that it would have been much better had we 
taken the time to debate, to allow the Canadian people to have 
some real input into this and to build a level of understanding 
and acceptance of the deal that was made. If it really is that good 
it should be saleable. If it is not saleable then let us fix up the 
things that are not so that we can understand and accept, and I 
will even go so far as to say love each other that much more.
<P>
<B>(1030 ) </B>
<P>
	With respect to the bill before us today and the building of this 
board, once again everybody else is disenfranchised. Everybody 
else has no input. It is just being rammed through. There will be 
a board but it does not represent the rest of Canadians who are 
also contributing to the financial bill and who have an interest in 
that regard and in everything that happens there.
<P>
	I would like the hon. member to comment on the process in 
which this is all being done. Could we not do better? I 
understand and accept that there is some impatience here after 
20 years of process and we have to move on. But we need to ask 
the questions very seriously. What is best in order to build a 
relationship among all Canadians and how does this process 
help it when we ram it through like this?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Before recognizing the hon. 
parliamentary secretary, this Chair was not in the chair when the 
Speaker ruled on the word mean spirited. If the hon. 
parliamentary secretary was in the House, it is my impression 
that was a ruling two days ago or perhaps three. I wonder if the 
parliamentary secretary would be kind enough to withdraw that 
word before he deals with the questions that have been put.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Anawak:</B> Mr. Speaker, if indeed that word was ruled out 
of order, I withdraw the word.
<P>
	I want to comment on the member's remarks of the last few 
minutes. It is surprising to hear him talk, without reflecting on 
the past, of the need for consulting with the people of Canada 
which we as a government are doing on a lot of issues.
<P>
	I might remind the hon. member that there was not much 
consultation when the land of Yukon, the Northwest Territories 
and Canada was sort of taken over by a group of people without 
asking the people who lived in that region. I think the aboriginal 
people of Yukon are well justified in getting this agreement 
through. The Government of Canada, the Government of Yukon 
and the aboriginal people of Yukon should be congratulated for 
putting together such an agreement.
<P>
	I made the remark earlier because of some comments of the 
past. I say this because of some deep concern that there is room 
for intolerance as a result of some comments made by some 
members of the third party. I quote directly from second reading 
of the bill a member of the third party. It says: ``I urge members 
who believe in fairness, honesty and accountability to oppose 
this bill as it portrays the epitome of patronage and racial bias 
for which Canadians should never be known''.
<P>
	That was an unacceptable comment by a member of the third 
party. Part of the same comment states: ``Such land claims, self 
government and racially segregated mediation boards will set a 
precedent for future negotiations with aboriginals which 
Canadian taxpayers will be hard pressed to pay for''.
<P>
	The government of Yukon and the people and the Council for 
Yukon Indians are all in support. They have adopted this bill. 
Therefore, I do not think there is any room for the kind of 
remarks that have been made in the past. I say this as a response 
to comments made during second reading of this bill, not as 
comments that I am putting forward on my own. If members 
want, I can carry on for another 10 minutes quoting comments 
during second reading to make sure that the people of Canada 
know what has been said by the third party.
<P>
<B>(1035) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened with interest, especially to the commentary 
at the end. For years we have heard nothing but the abuse that 
native Indians suffered through the administration of the 
Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development. This 
is part of the same government that helped set those laws in 
process.
<P>
	Here it is telling us to trust it once again, to further a problem 
that is liable to occur and keep on occurring. This is beyond 
belief. It put a restriction in front of the natives in Yukon of only 
50 per cent of the members on the board. Why can it not be 100 
per cent? Why does this government automatically assume that 
only 50 per cent of the natives there are capable of making this 
decision and not 100 per cent of the natives?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8284"> 8284 </A></B>
<P>
	This is put on by that side of the House. I could go on and say 
that to me this seems like a very racial hindrance.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Adams:</B> What is the percentage of natives in Yukon?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stinson:</B> Why do you put a qualification on any people in 
this country? Why put that roadblock in front of them?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order, please. Again, I 
appreciate the hon. parliamentary secretary's courtesy. In 
<I>Hansard</I> on Wednesday, page 8173, a minister in fact used the 
word that came up earlier. The minister said, and I quote: ``With 
the greatest respect to you, Mr. Speaker, of course I withdraw''. 
My colleague said if the ruling was made. He now knows that the 
ruling was made.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Anawak:</B> Mr. Speaker, I withdraw the word. However, I 
want to advise the hon. member that he does not seem to have 
much confidence in the people of Yukon or the Government of 
Canada-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stinson:</B> More than you do. Why do they not go for 100 
per cent?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Anawak:</B> -in appointing aboriginal people as part of 
their 50 per cent. Hopefully the Council for Yukon Indians will 
appoint its 50 per cent as aboriginal people. If it chooses, it does 
not necessarily have to be aboriginal people. I have great 
confidence that the Government of Yukon and the Government 
of Canada, if they choose to, will appoint aboriginal people to 
the panels.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stinson:</B> The other 50 per cent will be legal hacks.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Anawak:</B> If they do not, it is their prerogative. I have 
more confidence than the hon. member in the Government of 
Canada and the Government of Yukon in having confidence in 
the aboriginal leaders.
<P>
	I just say these things. I mention the mediation boards.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stinson:</B> You are saying they should be restricted to 50 
per cent and no more.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Anawak:</B> I quote at second reading from another speech 
made by a member of the third party: ``The potential for conflict 
of interest is also there because claims are not assumed to be 
reviewed by the entire board but by a panel of three. At least one 
must be a member appointed to the board from the Council for 
Yukon Indians and two others are to be chosen by the 
chairperson. Could this not end with a blatant bias or conflict if 
all were from the Council for Yukon Indians? There are no rules 
to the contrary''.
<P>
	I rest my case.
<P>
<B>(1040) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to rise in the House today to speak to Bill C-55, the last 
in a series of three bills aimed at implementing the provisions of 
agreements in respect of certain lands in Yukon, negotiated by 
Yukon, Canada and Yukon first nations.
<P>
	To give an indication of the importance of adopting this kind 
of bill, I would like to start by putting it into the context of the 
broader issue of aboriginal land claims, not only in Quebec and 
Canada but throughout the world. We all know that the rights of 
aboriginal peoples have become an issue in many countries: in 
North America, South America and Asia, where since the 15th 
or the 16th century, Europeans came to settle lands that were 
occupied by aboriginal peoples.
<P>
	The Europeans became established either through conquest, 
colonization or various other ways, and as their numbers 
increased over the centuries, aboriginal populations were 
pushed into a minority position. In the past 20, 25 or 30 years, 
aboriginal peoples have become aware of the importance of 
surviving as a people and maintaining their identity. They drew 
up land claims so that, in certain regions, areas or countries, 
they could continue, as much as possible, to live according to the 
traditional ways of their ancestors, or otherwise obtain the 
requisite political and economical leverage to be able to 
perpetuate their identity as a people on a viable basis.
<P>
	The bill before the House this morning is part of this vast 
endeavour to satisfy the land claims of the aboriginal peoples, 
while bearing in mind the hard cold fact that other people now 
live in these territories as well, and in some cases, have done so 
for many centuries, and also have the right to live there.
<P>
	Canada and Quebec have initiated negotiations with various 
first nations on their territorial claims. In Canada, a number of 
agreements have already been concluded, such as James Bay in 
1975, the agreement on Nunavut in the MacKenzie River Delta, 
and now Yukon.
<P>
	As a member of the Standing Committee on Aboriginal 
Affairs and Northern Development, I have, of course, been 
involved in the proceedings of this committee, and since I also 
have a personal interest, I read up on the situation in Yukon and 
what had happened so far, and I realized that it was imperative 
and absolutely essential to ratify these agreements as soon as 
possible.
<P>
	As you know Yukon is in Canada's north. It was originally 
part of the territory that was given to the Hudson's Bay 
Company by the Crown and that included all of northern Canada 
and northern Quebec. This immense tract of land became the 
property of a private company. The Hudson's Bay Company 
took 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8285"> 8285 </A></B>
<P>
advantage of the territory's resources, especially through its 
involvement in the fur trade.
<P>
	Aboriginal people in Yukon came into contact with the white 
man in the person of the employees of the Hudson's Bay 
Company. They were also exposed to influences from the south, 
in a perhaps more brutal manner, during the famous gold rush in 
the Klondike at the end of the 19th century. At the time, many 
people came from the south to look for gold in Yukon, disrupting 
the traditional ways of the aboriginal peoples in this region. 
There was also the construction of the Alaska Highway in the 
1940s by the United States, to connect the U.S. territory with the 
territory of Alaska.
<P>
<B>(1045) </B>
<P>
	The result was that Yukon was brutally invaded by people 
from the south. We are not here to pass judgment. It happened 
long ago, people behaved the way they were used to, and I do not 
think it would serve any purpose to dwell on the past. However, 
we have to realize that injustices were created and that new 
arrangements must be put in place if the people who live there 
are to develop in harmony, and if their economic, social and 
political needs are to be fulfilled.
<P>
	I think that we have to watch our language carefully. When we 
look at what happened in Quebec over the last 20 years and what 
is happening now, we realize that governments and people are 
demanding that we settle the outstanding issues. Except it is 
extremely fragile. Negotiations are often difficult because the 
issues are complex. There are important constitutional and 
economic questions involved. There is also a basic political 
dimension.
<P>
	When we talk about self-determination, self-government or 
sovereignty, we deal with emotionally-packed concepts and all 
sorts of reactions from the people. We just have to recall the 
reactions to the recent declarations of a Quebec native leader in 
New York, where the word ``racist'' was bandied about. I think 
that it is rather inappropriate to use such a word in that particular 
context. We are in a negotiating context, where you must keep 
your cool to be able to come up with something which will be 
fair to all involved.
<P>
	When issues like racism are raised, a notion so emotionally 
charged because of the long racist history of mankind-just 
think of what happened to the Jews and the Gypsies during the 
Second World War-we are often taken aback, stunned and 
disappointed to see it surface in the papers, in the minds and in 
conversations, and being applied to situations occurring in 
Canada.
<P>
	We cannot say that the situation in Canada is one of racism. I 
believe that no one among native people and non-natives is 
going to form a particular opinion about a specific group 
because one member of this group is of a different ethnic origin 
or race.
<P>
	One must be very careful in Canada when using the word 
racism. One may talk about ethnocentricity, prejudices or many 
other similar things-there is no shortage of terms-but I 
believe that accusations of racism must be avoided because it 
could trigger a chain reaction with far-reaching consequences, 
especially with respect to negotiations which have been going 
on for years and could fail because the negotiating parties might 
see in each other all kind of sinister intentions.
<P>
	I wanted to get this off my chest before dealing more 
specifically with Bill C-55.
<P>
	This piece of legislation seeks to set up a board to settle 
disputes that might arise between parties to the agreements 
reached in Yukon. As we know, last June this House passed Bill 
C-33 and Bill C-34, which were enacted in July. These acts give 
effect to land claim agreements concerning Yukon and deal with 
certain matters relating to self-government for native people in 
Yukon Territory.
<P>
<B>(1050) </B>
<P>
	Negotiations prior to these agreements had been going on for 
over twenty years. There were many difficulties. The 
negotiation framework was hard to develop. People took a very 
strong stand at first, one party wanting everything while the 
other was reluctant to yield anything, vetoing the claims, so to 
speak.
<P>
	Little by little, over the years, people learned to know one 
another, setting up the framework for the negotiations. These 
negotiations finally ended in the early 1990s. The agreement 
before us this morning is simply to ensure that there are 
arbitrators are appointed when disputes arise between the 
parties to the agreement in the Yukon.
<P>
	Before getting further into the consideration of Bill C-55, I 
would like to take a second to remind the hon. members that both 
bills we have passed recognized that Yukon aboriginal peoples 
did have rights over certain lands, that is to say surface and 
subsurface rights over some lands and surface rights on others, 
lands that can form the basis for a certain economic life so that 
these peoples will no longer be dependent upon federal 
government subsidies.
<P>
	Like me, Mr. Speaker, you have no doubt read the Auditor 
General's report and noted the rather explicit criticism of the 
social assistance provided to the aboriginal peoples of Canada. 
It is reported that approximately 40 to 45 per cent of natives in 
Canada depend on social assistance. On certain reserves, it is up 
to 80 or 85 per cent of the population. That is a huge percentage! 
There is an enormous problem there. The Auditor General tells 
us that it costs $1 billion, because that is how much is paid out to 
the people, the people who are running the reserves, and that 
insufficient control is exercised over the use made of these 
funds.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="8286"> 8286 </A></B>
<P>
	I agree with the Auditor General that tighter control is 
required. But what the Auditor General is telling us in his report 
is that control over this $1 billion may not be perfect. At the 
same time, he says that $1 billion is paid out to aboriginal 
peoples because they are really having a rough time on the 
social, economic, health and education front.
<P>
	In such circumstances, I do not think that the thing to do 
would be to say: ``We need a billion dollars. We will take this 
billion and use it for something else in the budget and let these 
people manage on their own''. We must think instead in terms of 
creating conditions where they will no longer need social 
assistance.
<P>
	I think that the kind of agreement we have reached respecting 
the Yukon, and those respecting other parts of Canada such as 
the Mackenzie Delta, the Nunavut, the James Bay area in 
Quebec-and there are more coming-all these agreements will 
enable the aboriginal peoples concerned to lay the economic 
foundations required to no longer depend on government 
assistance for their social and economic development.
<P>
	I think that this is essential and that is why agreements such as 
this one must be encouraged and legislation to implement such 
agreements be passed as quickly as possible.
<P>
	As my colleague from the Reform Party said earlier, certainly 
it is quick. At the Indian affairs committee, we considered both 
Bill C-33 and Bill C-34 in June. These were complex bills. 
There are often concepts involved that are very difficult to 
grasp. While the committee may not have been pressured, it 
certainly had to make haste.
<P>
<B>(1055) </B>
<P>
	This committee even sat all night on one occasion. This 
unusual experience shows that important decisions were made. I 
think that sitting all night on this committee will be a highlight 
of my life as a parliamentarian. Representatives of Yukon first 
nations came and spent the night with the committee to show us 
how crucial this bill is to them.
<P>
	It is sometimes ill-advised to move too fast; however, when 
dealing with important issues, it is often pointless and even 
harmful to drag things out. That is why we must act now so that 
the representatives who negotiated in good faith in the hope of 
improving the lives of their people will not be disappointed. In 
such cases, when an agreement is reached after 20 years, we 
cannot afford to disappoint people by unduly delaying its 
adoption. Especially when we know how hard it is for a standing 
committee and even for the House of Commons to challenge 
agreements negotiated with the help of many experts and 
lawyers over a number of years.
<P>
	I think that we must put some trust in those who negotiated the 
agreements and those who reviewed them, like the Bloc 
members on the standing committee who, after examining the 
entire bill, did not find anything that would justify unduly 
delaying its passage.
<P>
	Of course, we can improve any bill by proposing amendments 
to it. With respect to Bill C-55, I might have had some concerns, 
like my colleague from the Reform Party, about how committee 
members are chosen. It might have been better to ensure as much 
as possible that committee members are not appointed because 
of partisan considerations-if that can be done within the party 
system prevailing in Canada.
<P>
	Canadians increasingly feel that the people appointed to 
government positions should be chosen for their personal ability 
and not because they belong to a party. I think that people in 
Yukon will be especially sensitive to the quality of those 
appointed to this board.
<P>
	I am pleased to support this bill. I hope that the people of the 
Yukon will implement it as soon as possible so that they can 
ensure their own development and that we as Quebecers and 
Canadians can establish the best possible relationship with them 
in the future.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member will have three 
minutes left to conclude after question period.
<P>
	It being 11 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 30(5) the House 
will now proceed to Statements by Members pursuant to 
Standing Order 31.

	<B>Mr. John Murphy (Annapolis Valley-Hants, Lib.):</B> Mr.

Reform members of Parliament about ACOA's funding 
practices.
<P>
	A recent contribution to Canadian Hybrid Farms in my riding 
of Annapolis Valley-Hants was singled out as an example of 
alleged wasteful government spending.
<P>
	The decision to make a contribution to this firm demonstrates 
ACOA's commitment to assisting leading edge companies set up 
shop and succeed in Atlantic Canada. This company has focused 
its efforts in developing a new strain of genetically altered 
hamsters for use by the scientific community in researching 
heart disease in humans. Medical researchers from around the 
world rely on these hamsters in order to test the efficiency of 
cardiovascular drugs.

	<B>Mr. Andy Mitchell (Parry Sound-Muskoka, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to point out that the provision of telephone 
service in rural Ontario is not adequate and when compared to 
urban areas can only be described as second class.
<P>
	There is no requirement that telephone service be provided 
beyond 62 meters of the existing system. Although quite 
adequate to ensure subscribers in cities receive new services at 
reasonable costs, in rural areas it means many individuals must 
pay thousands of dollars for a phone hookup.
<P>
	The reality for many of my constituents is that the security 
and convenience of phone service most of us take for granted are 
not available to them. In addition, large portions of my riding 
have been embargoed, meaning private lines are not available. 
This policy discriminates against rural Canadians wishing to 
establish businesses depending on such simple tools as faxes 
and computer modems, let alone access to the information 
highway. In areas where economic development is most needed 
the required communication infrastructure is being denied.
<P>
	I urge the Minister of Communications to amend the Bell 
Canada Act of 1902 and to end this discrimination against rural 
Canadians.

lately when discussing the country's financial situation with 
groups in my riding it became clear to me that the message of 
fiscal restraint has been heard by Canadians. People in my riding 
are ready for the government to make the tough choices that are 
needed to get our financial house in order.
<P>
	I have also been disturbed by how some people, especially 
from the far right of the political spectrum, are using the present 
financial difficulties as an excuse to advocate brutal measures 
against the poor.
<P>
	The debt and deficit remain real problems. The medicine will 
be no doubt bitter but I have every reason to believe that the 
government will be looking for ways to make our social security 
system more fair and equitable without hurting those most in 
need.
<P>
	I condemn those who use our present financial difficulty as an 
excuse to impose their right wing agenda on the poorest and 
most vulnerable in our society.

	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, yesterday, at their annual meeting, held in 
Jonquière, the 300 delegates from the Quebec steelworkers 
union decided to support sovereignty during the next 
referendum on Quebec's future. This central labour body feels 
that sovereignty is the only way to ensure that Quebec has the 
necessary tools to look after its economic, political and 
sociocultural development.
<P>
	Occupational training will be the top priority for steelworkers 
in the years to come. They believe that this whole sector should 
fall under Quebec's jurisdiction. In fact, Quebecers have been 
requesting this for years, but Ottawa has always categorically 
refused to consider that option.
<P>
	The decision made by the steelworkers illustrates once again 
the importance and the diversity of the various groups 
supporting sovereignty in Quebec, and we are very pleased to 
see that.

	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, while the 
Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs is telling federal civil 
servants that they should fear sovereignty for Quebec, his 
government is about to make cuts in its public service.
<P>
	According to persisting rumours among civil servants, which 
were even repeated by the Public Service Alliance of Canada, 
30,000 positions will be eliminated in February, when the next 
federal budget is tabled. It appears that these cuts would 
primarily affect civil servants working in the national capital, 
since regional staff has already been reduced significantly.
<P>
	Consequently, this massive reduction in the public service 
population of the Ottawa region has nothing to do with the threat 
of separation, the election of a PQ government, or the role of 
Bloc Quebecois MPs in this House. This government will be the 
only one to blame if such despicable cuts are made in the public 
service.

implementation of a comprehensive and coherent job creation 
strategy in Quebec.

	The federal government is refusing to reduce unemployment 
insurance premiums even though it said that lowering them 
would create jobs. The federal government is also refusing to 
implement a real defence conversion policy. And what about

	<B>Mr. Hugh Hanrahan (Edmonton-Strathcona, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we know that there are approximately seven million 
legitimate gun owners in Canada and that the use of guns results 
in one of the safest, most thoroughly self-policed recreational 
activities anywhere.
<P>
	To qualify for a purchase of a firearm or a hunting licence, 
Canadians must pass numerous examinations and training 
courses on firearms knowledge, safe firearms handling, wildlife 
identification and safe hunting procedures.
<P>
	Handgun owners are required to undergo an even tougher 
application process and have rigid security restrictions. Yet 
despite all these controls, knee-jerk Liberalism has sprung into 
effect to establish even tougher gun laws when we know the 
problem is the criminal use of guns and not with the legal gun 
owners.
<P>
	I challenge the Minister of Justice to do the right thing, which 
is to get tough on criminals and forget about creating laws that 
make criminals out of law-abiding citizens.

	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
newspapers can be a useful cross-reference. Let us consider 
three stories carried by the <I>Globe and Mail</I> on November 16, 
1994. All three related to spending abuses, all three connected 
by real estate and all three about the CBC.
<P>
	In one story Keith Spicer, president of the CRTC, asked for 
the CBC to be given breathing space from the continuous rounds 
of budget cuts. Then the editorials ran a letter from the CBC's 
vice-president of finance as he attempted to defend the expenses 
of the CBC's broadcasting centre.
<P>
	It is amazing how creative accounting can actually justify a 
yearly rental cost of almost $50 million which will balloon to 
over $200 million in the next 10 years, all of it taxpayers' 
money.
<P>
	The third story revolved around the changes to CBC 
``Midday''. Will we indeed see that program co-hosted out of 
Vancouver? At what cost? What will happen to the current cosy 
and expensive ``Midday'' studio at the broadcast centre in 
Toronto? More redundancy, more excuses, more expenditure 
abuse.

<BLOCKQUOTE>If someone consumes too much alcohol, gets behind the wheel of a car, 
then kills someone, you can guarantee that no court in Canada would decide 
to acquit that person based on his or her drinking.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>If this law is not changed we will see more and more individuals acquitted 
because criminals in Canada have avoided responsibility time and again 
thanks to the outdated criminal justice system. Laws like this one are

	<B>Mr. George S. Rideout (Moncton, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, today 
I would like to point out the importance of the mining industry in 
Canada.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The mining industry is a real economic generator in the 
country. For example, we owe 16 per cent of the country's 
exports to the mining industry. It accounts for 4.6 per cent of 
GDP and provides 100,000 high paying skilled jobs in areas of 
the country where there is otherwise very little economic 
activity.
<P>
	We only have to cast our eyes about this room to recognize 
how important the mining industry is to our daily lives. While 
today's high tech and manufacturing industries rely to varying 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8289"> 8289 </A></B>
<P>
degrees on the mining industry, the mining industry also 
incorporates much advanced technology in many of its 
processes.

	We must properly recognize that the mining industry is 
important to our economic well-being and do what we can to 
keep mining in Canada.

	<B>Mr. John Loney (Edmonton North, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
recently American news magazine ``60 Minutes'' aired a story 
called the ``Ugly Face of Freedom''. After watching the show I 
was appalled at the story. Normally ``60 Minutes'' has very high 
journalistic standards. This time the standards were much lower.
<P>
<B>(1110) </B>
<P>
	The story focused on anti-Semitism in the Ukrainian city of 
Lvov. The story talked about right-wing political movements 
calling for a Ukraine populated by only ethnic Ukrainians. 
These right-wing splinter factions are also vehemently 
anti-Semitic, according to the ``60 Minutes'' story.
<P>
	The rise of right wing politics is occurring all across Europe 
but the groups are small in numbers. The media likes to lionize 
these groups as they make good press, but in their efforts to 
attract viewers they have slandered Ukrainians everywhere.
<P>
	Ukrainians both in Canada and in Ukraine denounce the rise 
of these radical hate groups and call upon ``60 Minutes'' to tell 
the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.

Mr. Speaker, the involvement of communities in restoring our 
environment is essential. Governments can show leadership and 
set the stage but partnerships with communities are crucial to 
achieving success.
<P>
	Two hundred and fifteen thousand dollars was recently 
awarded by Environment Canada's Atlantic coastal action 
program for projects designed to improve the environment in 
five communities in the Atlantic provinces. In addition 
$100,000 has been allocated for four regional initiatives that 
will benefit all thirteen of the sites and their community groups.
<P>
	The Atlantic coastal action program was established in direct 
response to local citizens' concerns. In my coastal communities 
the problems are polluted waterways, haphazard development 
and lack of concern for the environment.
<P>
	I commend the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the

the service sector is an integral part of the Canadian economy 
and for this reason November has been declared National 
Services Month. In 1993 service industries represented 
three-quarters of Canada's gross domestic product, amounting 
to $387 billion.
<P>
	In my riding of London-Middlesex economic activity is 
generated by services such as banking, insurance, construction, 
transportation, utilities, communications, professional, 
consumer and services business. As a matter of fact service 
industries account for more than 78 per cent of total 
employment in Canada and account for seven out of ten jobs in 
each province.

<P>
	This is an umbrella organization that seeks to promote the 
interests of small and medium sized farmers in Central America 
at regional and international levels. It has been on a tour of 
Canada to meet with Canadian farm leaders and policy makers 
and to promote a vision for the sustainable development of 
Central America.
<P>
	I congratulate ASOCODE for its efforts. As it suggested, we 
must go beyond a bureaucratic level in a relationship with 
Central and Latin America. We must continue to further the 
efforts of the government in working at a political level and 
should expand to working with populist groups as well.

paint Reform as lacking compassion.

<P>
	However, we took these risks precisely because we are

principles of fairness in our recommendations. We propose cuts 
at the top including politicians pensions and perks and cuts for 
private business as well as special interest groups.
<P>
	Frankly and proudly the cuts are also based on a different 
vision of the role of government, one which gets government out 
of the lives of Canadians, encourages the family and free

	Instead of dealing with the problem of child poverty, the 
Minister of Human Resources Development has set this country

	Responding to the demands of the Official Opposition, the 
defence minister decided to move up the inquiry on the incidents 
in Somalia and announced that it would begin early in the new 
year.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Defence. Given the horror 
of these new revelations, why does the minister not initiate the 
public inquiry right now, so that the crimes committed in 
Somalia can be elucidated as soon as possible?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Michael Collenette (Minister of National 
Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I answered a similar question from members of the Reform 
Party yesterday in the House of Commons.
<P>
	It is very important to respect the judicial system and, on the 
basis of the legal counsel I received, I decided that it would be 
advisable to start the inquiry after the courts martial, but before 
the court martial disposes of the appeals.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, since 
many very important facts were covered up in the first 
investigation on the events in Somalia, does the minister not 
agree that his duty requires him to launch the public inquiry 
immediately to get to the bottom of these events, thus 
eliminating or reducing the risk of undue pressure being brought 
to bear on potential witnesses in this affair?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Michael Collenette (Minister of National 
Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my duty is to respect the judicial system in this country.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I have said earlier that what is very important in dealing with 
these tragic events is to ensure that those people who have been 
accused are dealt with the in the proper way in front of the courts 
martial.
<P>
	What I also said yesterday is that we believe that it would be 
appropriate to commence the inquiry after any disposition of 
further charges, there is one particular case that could go to a 
court martial, but before the appeals are concluded.

	That means that in the early part of next year this inquiry 
which, I repeat, will be public, open and civilian, will get under 
way and will deal with all of the specific allegations that have 
been made.
<P>
	I asked the chief of defence staff to remind members of the 
armed forces of the rules with respect to speaking on military 
matters and I do note that Major Armstrong taped the interview 
with <I>Le Point</I> about two or three days ago before I made this 
announcement yesterday.
<P>
	I think the best situation now is to allow all complaints, all 
concerns by anyone in the forces or elsewhere to go to the 
inquiry when it starts in the new year.
<P>
[Translation] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, as for 
the constraints of the inquiry now under way and the trials, I will 
remind the minister that he has already taken a first step, at our 
request, and moved the inquiry ahead of any possible appeal 
process. We think that he should continue in this direction and 
instead of asking senior army officers to keep the military from 
talking about the events in Somalia, does the minister not 
believe that he should act as openly as possible and announce 
right now whether he intends to entrust the powers of a real 
commission of public inquiry to those who will have to 
investigate the situation in Somalia?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to correct one thing the hon. member said. The inquiry will not 
prejudice the appeals that will be going on perhaps at the same 
time.
<P>
	With respect to the other part of the question, in terms of the 
conditions, the terms of reference of the inquiry, this question 
was posed last Friday by his colleague and these terms of 
reference are being worked on by the judge advocate general of 
the Canadian Armed Forces and also the officials of the 
Department of Justice. Once we announce the composition of 
the inquiry, the head of the inquiry and the other board members, 
the terms of reference will also be announced.
<P>
	Those terms of reference will be wide enough and broad 
enough to deal with all of the complaints made by people such as 
Major Armstrong and members of the opposition and other 
people in the country who feel that this particular matter is 
grave, and we agree, and has to be dealt with as expeditiously as 
possible.

	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is directed to the Minister of National Defence.
<P>
	It seems that this morning, a precarious cease-fire was 
concluded at Bihac, where 20 of the 55 Canadian peacekeepers 
are still being held hostage by Serb forces. This cease-fire 
should provide an opportunity for resumption of negotiations 
between the parties concerned and eventually lead to the 
resolution of this problem.
<P>
	Could the Minister of National Defence tell us what the 
situation is now in Bihac and indicate the terms of this 
cease-fire?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Michael Collenette (Minister of National 
Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
I have no exact information on the terms of the cease-fire in 
Bihac. Perhaps I may point out that we only have five Canadians 
in Bihac. Most of the soldiers who are being detained, and there 
are 55, are based near Visoko, north of Sarajevo.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	There are 55 Canadians currently being detained. Nothing has 
changed on their situation. They are in good shape. We are 
negotiating for their release. It is part of the larger problem 
dealing with the question of Bihac. We do have five Canadians 
in Bihac. There have been reports of some cessation of 
hostilities today in Bihac and we hope that will mean there will 
be some normalization of events.
<P>
	At the moment there is little change from what we described 
yesterday.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
glad to hear that only five and not 20 Canadian soldiers were 
taken hostage in Bihac, but the minister will agree that five is 
still five too many.
<P>
	Considering the fact that Canadian peacekeepers are still 
being kept hostage in Bosnia, could the minister indicate what 
position Canada has taken vis-à-vis its partners regarding the 
possibility of continuing air strikes?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Collenette (Minister of National Defence and

ambassador in Brussels at NATO was engaged in discussions 
yesterday about the future use of air power.

	Nothing has changed from the course of events that was 
decided upon earlier this year, that if a UN safe haven is 
attacked, if UNPROFOR forces are attacked, the UN would have 
the right to ask NATO to engage in air strikes.
<P>
	I think it is premature at this point to expect any further 
attacks in the next few days. This matter is under discussion not 
only between NATO and the UN but also between the warring 
parties in the former Yugoslavia.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, further to the questioning of the Minister of 
National Defence on the Bosnia situation, yesterday he 
acknowledged that Canadian troops in Bosnia are in a very 
dangerous situation and he indicated that very little has 
changed.
<P>
	The most recent reports indicate that the situation may have 
even deteriorated further. Last night retired Major General 
Lewis MacKenzie was quoted as saying: ``The United States 
was willing to fight to the last Canadian''.
<P>
	Given the growing danger, will the minister tell Canadians if 
he even has one contingency plan and if he does what that plan 
might be?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, an essential 
part of military planning is that you do not reveal what your 
plans are to anyone other than the people you command.
<P>
	It is a tragic situation but the question amuses me. The 
reputation and the experience of the Canadian Armed Forces not 
only in the former Yugoslavia but elsewhere should lead the hon. 
member to have confidence that the chief of defence staff and all 
those in the Canadian command, including the rest of the 
UNPROFOR forces, know what the problems are and will know 
how to deal with any situation that may arise.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I would not bring this matter to the attention of the 
minister except that we are hearing reports actually back from 
the field saying that they are concerned that there is no plan and 
morale is becoming lower.
<P>
	The Minister of National Defence insists on referring to the 
detention of Canadian soldiers but let us speak frankly as the UN 
commander has done and admit that our troops are now being 
held as hostages and as bargaining chips.
<P>
	As we noted yesterday, the minister promised to withdraw 
Canadians if the situation on the ground changed or if their 
safety were called into question. How far must the situation 
deteriorate before the government acts to remove troops from 
this dangerous situation?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I can 
categorically say there is no morale problem with the Canadian 
forces in Bosnia and Croatia. If anything is  going to undermine 
morale it is the comments of parliamentarians like the hon. 
member opposite and his colleague yesterday who made 
unfortunate references to possible situations involving fatalities 
of our soldiers.
<P>
	We are all Canadians. It does not matter what party we 
represent. These people are our people representing the country, 
doing work for the UN Let us not compromise their safety any 
more than we have to.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I assure this House that I speak out of concern and 
based on warnings that have been coming forward for several 
months.
<P>
	This is symptomatic of a larger problem. The Auditor General 
pointed out earlier this week that policy development systems in 
the Department of National Defence have significant 
difficulties, that capability objectives are not clearly stated, and 
that the Canadian forces are not always sure what they are 
supposed to be doing and what equipment they will use.
<P>
	Will the minister in light of the situation in Bosnia in which 
Canadian troops have lacked clear objectives from the 
beginning make it a priority to develop objectives to avoid a 
repeat of the Bosnian morass?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am a little 
annoyed. We have had two debates in this House about the 
engagement, the deployment of our troops in Bosnia and 
Croatia. There was a consensus that Canada should discharge its 
obligations and stay there. This is not a matter of partisan 
debate. I realize some people have reservations. There was a 
consensus. We have tried to depoliticize this whole debate.
<P>
	To link the Auditor General's report, which describes a 
situation that we inherited from the former government and one 
which we are correcting, to the current tragic situation on the 
ground in Bosnia is absolutely irresponsible.

<P>
	Last Tuesday, the Minister of National Revenue said, in an

that sum''.

<P>
	Would the minister agree that last year, the proportion of 
unpaid taxes, compared with net tax revenues, continued to rise, 
which would indicate a significant deterioration of the 
situation?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of National Revenue, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I can only repeat what I said to the House on 
two occasions last week.
<P>
	The accounts receivable are in fact accounts receivable. They 
are not the area of the accounting system we regard as lost 
accounts which we will never collect. It is not that at all. Last 
year we collected $8.8 billion from accounts receivable even 
though the average level was at $6.6 billion. In other words, I 
can repeat to the House that we will collect the vast majority of 
the accounts receivable with interest in that $6.6 billion figure.
<P>
	Canadians should know and fully understand there is not some 
pot of gold out there which can be brought in and then used to 
reduce the deficit. All the money in the $6.6 billion account 
which is recoverable and will be recovered with interest is 
money that is already taken into account by the government in 
its budgetary calculations.
<P>
	The hon. member should recognize that this is normal 
business procedure. For us to try and collect the $6.6 billion 
immediately will result only in more companies in Canada 
going into bankruptcy and more honest Canadians being 
harassed for their last dime.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, would the 
minister agree that much remains to be done and that his 
department should immediately put in place a system that will 
accelerate the collection of large accounts receivable, as 
recommended by the Auditor General?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of National Revenue, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I can only say that one year ago yesterday I 
issued a press release announcing a series of measures to 
improve the recovery of moneys owing to the government. This 
ad resulted in some billions of dollars coming in. For example, 
in this fiscal year we anticipate it will result in an extra $3.8 
billion coming in as a result of these new measures.
<P>
	I sent that press release out to everybody, including the press 
gallery, one year ago yesterday. The Auditor General at the end 
of May when the fiscal year ended, four months after I sent out 
this report, looked at the year. Most of the months in that year 
were Tory months and not months that I was minister. He said 
there were certain things that needed to be done. My press 
release was in fact a preface to the Auditor General's report with 
respect to collections.
<P>
	Two months ago the hon. member's colleague who is sitting at 
his right hand right now asked me a question about a speech of 
the Auditor General in Quebec City. I pointed out to him that it 
was something we were  collecting and there was no question of 
this money not being collected.

If the culture of the military is such that individuals feel 
compelled to remain silent for fear of retribution, is justice 
served?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not want 
to accept the premise upon which the hon. member's question is 
based. However, even if there were such concerns surely the 
announcement of an open and public civilian inquiry would 
allay any of those concerns.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the minister states that members of the service should 
speak only to their superiors yet these are the very superiors who 
suppressed evidence to start with. They have to have the 
freedom to go outside the normal chain.
<P>
	The minister has stated there will be a public civilian inquiry 
into the Somalia affair. When will the minister table a terms of 
reference for the inquiry? Will the minister ensure that the 
inquiry is broad enough to reach the highest echelons of the

terms of management, especially in the information systems 
area, something which concerns me particularly. I have asked

	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the Minister of National Defence cannot skirt the issue by 
throwing the blame on previous governments.
<P>
	Does the minister not realize that it would be possible to cut 
$1.6 billion in his department's budget, as suggested by the 
Official Opposition, without impeding operations, just by 
eliminating squandering and unnecessary spending, given the 
new international order?
<P>

<P>
	The Auditor General says that the workforce adjustment 
directive must be changed if the government hopes to reduce the 
size of the public service. The minister is negotiating with the 
unions now to do just that. However the president of the largest 
public service union in Canada said: ``We obviously will never 
agree to changes that would weaken the workforce adjustment 
directive''.
<P>
	Could the minister explain how he can change that directive to 
reduce job security when the union says up front that it will 
never agree to it?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy 
Council for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
and Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I understood the President of the Treasury Board 
this week indicated that he was having negotiations with the 
unions on the possibility of changing the directive. However, I 
understood him to also indicate that other options were being 
considered. I think the work on this is continuing. Obviously we 
will have more than one option when the time comes to make the 
decisions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
so far the government has honoured the workforce adjustment 
directive by encouraging voluntary departure. The cost this year 
in the Department of National Defence alone is over $120 
million. In fact, some officials are receiving a golden handshake 
worth $200,000 a pop.
<P>
<B>(1140) </B>
<P>
	Will the minister admit that the government plans to cut $5 
billion during its program review? This means it will have to 
change the workforce directive and if not through negotiation 
then through legislation.

	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy 
Council for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs

<P>
	As the hon. member comes from Newfoundland, I will point 
out that yesterday we signed an agreement with the province of 
Newfoundland. It is part of a series of agreements with all 
provinces across the country so that we can combine audit 
information and the work of our auditors. We can thus have 
much more efficiency in what we do. We can increase the 
revenues to both the provincial and the federal levels of 
government.
<P>
	Perhaps most important, this helps cut down on the 
duplication of government work and the harassment of ordinary 
honest citizens who presently sometimes find themselves faced 
with an audit by Revenue Canada and three weeks later faced 
with another audit by provincial authorities, neither of which 
have talked to each other.

	With respect to gun smuggling, there is no question that it is a 
serious problem. We have a country adjacent to us with an 
enormous population and that country is literally awash in 
weapons. We have a border which has 130 million transits a 
year. We have in addition the world's largest trade between any 
two countries. We have vast numbers of tourists. It is thus 
impossible to create the type of Berlin wall that the member 
seems to think would stop the smuggling that he speaks of.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, if the 
revenue minister took time to understand what the Reform Party 
was saying, the one area that we would not be cutting is in the 
area of control and justice. That is one area we would not be 
cutting.
<P>
	We have heard this 25 per cent figure before. As a matter of 
fact I think the minister gave it to us on February 8. Yet there are 
numerous press reports that indicate customs is in the process of 
laying off customs people in the front lines. How can he 
reconcile the difference between his statement and the press 
reports?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of National Revenue, 
Lib.):</B> Very simply, Mr. Speaker. We have increased the numbers 
overall at the border as indicated.
<P>
	On the other hand, as the member knows, we have tremendous 
fluctuations in numbers of tourists who come to Canada at 
different times of the year. In addition we have differing 
requirements at different areas of the border. We do move people 
around within the regions and indeed within Canada as a whole 
to deal with the demand at certain times.
<P>
	I specifically refer the member from British Columbia to the 
extra 65 people we brought into Victoria during the 
Commonwealth Games to make sure that we had quick and 
effective customs surveillance at that point.
<P>
	It is a simple issue of good management by customs officers 
and not a question as he seems to suggest of reducing 
enforcement.

	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the minister of heritage. Yesterday, former CBC 
chairman Patrick Watson accused the heritage minister of being 
invisible and lacking the will to protect Canadian cultural 
industries. We rarely hear such a credible member of the cultural 
community condemn a minister's inaction so strongly.
<P>
	Does the minister not agree that Mr. Watson's very strong 
words about him amply demonstrate once again his lack of 
leadership and credibility in the cultural community?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage, 
Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, Mr. Watson spent almost all his life in  the 
world of show business and news reporting. Of course, visibility 
is important in these sectors, but we are in the business of 
governing and the way to do it is with authority. We do not need 
to show off. If that is what our Bloc colleague wants, she should 
do so while we are busy running the country.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
wonder who is showing off.
<P>
	How can the minister reconcile his current position on stable 
financing for the CBC with the promises he made to the 
corporation at the time of his appointment as heritage minister?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage, 
Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I think that our colleague is badly 
misinformed; she should know that the Liberal government 
helped the CBC avoid a major financial crisis.
<P>
<B>(1150) </B>
<P>
	That is what we have done this year. We allowed the CBC to 
reposition itself in the 500-channel universe we have heard 
about. I supported the CBC in this matter. With the help of the 
finance minister, we will continue to ensure that the CBC 
remains the flagship of Canadian culture.

	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
reason for negotiating international trade deals like the free 
trade agreement, NAFTA or GATT should be to tear down trade 
barriers rather than build them up. Yet access to the American 
market has decreased for the Canadian sugar industry due to 
protectionist measures. In jeopardy are some 1,700 Canadian 
jobs at the present time.
<P>
	My question is to the Minister for International Trade. What 
will the government do to protect the jobs in the Canadian sugar 
industry and to improve Canadian access to American sugar 
markets?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mac Harb (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for 
International Trade, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member

the best interest of the Canadian industry.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a 
supplementary question. Can the minister indicate what type of 
measures the government is planning to put in place in terms of 
removing some of the protectionist opportunities that the 
American government may take with regard to GATT or what 
other measures can be taken that will protect our industry on not 
only a short term basis but a long term basis as well?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mac Harb (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for 
International Trade, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, obviously it is good 
news that we will be seeing fairly soon, hopefully effective 
January 1, 1995, the introduction of the World Trade 
Organization as a mechanism whereby all trading partners 
around the globe will be able to go to it whenever we have a 
dispute. We will be able to solve it through that mechanism.
<P>
	When it comes to bilateral relations of course we would have 
to continue to work within the framework of NAFTA between us 
and our partners in North America. We are confident that 
through bilateral negotiation and through the multilateral forum 
we will be able to resolve many of those issues as my colleague 
has suggested.

	In view of the recommendations made by the Reform Party, 
which wants to eliminate all programs related to 
multiculturalism, can the minister tell us again how Canadians 
benefit from the policy on multiculturalism, and can she also tell

the minister shed some light on this issue?

	For less than $1 per Canadian per year, I think we are getting

<P>
	I suggest to my colleague, who is a very concerned and 
considerate member representing a wonderful riding on the tip 
of Quebec between the two borders, that the amount of money 
we invest and the efforts that are deployed jointly by many

<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in the last 
year there has been a virtual management revolution in the 
ministry of defence.
<P>
	We are trying to have many services contracted to the private 
sector. We are trying to adopt many private sector methods such 
as in warehousing, in having on time just in time delivery where 
suppliers actually keep the particular components rather than 
having them stored. We are in the process of installing a state of 
the art computer system that will keep track of all of the 
components in the materiels group. Indeed, we have 
restructured the materiels group, which is the largest section of 
national defence, in charge of procurement and administration 
of all big capital programs. We have totally restructured that and 
in the next year there will be more and more layers of 
management eliminated. I think when it is all done the taxpayers

	It shows an anxiousness that Canadians have to see the deficit 
resolved and their willingness to participate in widespread

does the Minister of National Revenue propose to stop or reduce 
the smuggling of guns into this country?

	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of National Revenue,

have one of the most effective customs services in the world 
which operates extremely efficiently along our border.
<P>
	He should also be aware that the numbers of officers have 
been increased substantially within the last year, indeed in 
February of last year and thereafter.
<P>
	He should be aware because his specific concern is that of 
firearms that we have a situation involving our border with the 
United States, a country which has a vast number of weapons, a 
country which has a tradition of people both carrying and using 
weapons which is quite foreign to our own. It is very important 
for us to use, as we are doing, modern equipment, dogs to sniff 
out weapons, which they can do and also as many custom

which should normally happen in 1997?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, my comments were certainly not interpreted correctly. 
What I said is this: We intend to review the drug patent

been saying since the very beginning.

a lot of money and is a real source of concern.

supplement, (<I>d</I>) unemployment insurance and (<I>e</I>) GST rebates and what 
crimes were they incarcerated for?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> I am 
informed by the Departments of Human Resources 
Development and Revenue Canada as follows: (a), (b) and (c). 
Under Canada pension plan and old age security legislation, 
beneficiaries are entitled to continue receiving benefits while in 
prison.
<P>
	However, to answer these parts would require the exchange of 
information on inmates between Human Resources 
Development Canada and Correctional Service Canada. The 
existing Old Age Security Act and Canada pension plan/income 
supplement legislation do not permit such an exchange.
<P>
	On October 7, 1994, the Minister of Human Resources 
Development tabled a bill, C-54, which proposes to amend 
these two acts to allow for better information sharing between 
government departments. The Solicitor General has also tabled 
a bill, C-45, allowing for similar amendments to the Corrections 
and Conditional Release Act. These, if enacted, will allow for 
the exchange of information necessary to respond to these parts.
<P>
	(d) Section 32 of the Unemployment Insurance Act 
specifically denies payment for the period during which a 
claimant is an inmate of any prison or similar institution.
<P>
	There are control programs in effect to enforce this section of 
the act.
<P>
	Human Resources Development Canada is not aware of any 
inmates receiving payment of UI benefits during a period of 
incarceration.
<P>
	During this calendar year, January to August, there have been 
1,688 disentitlements imposed denying benefits for the reason 
that the claimant is an inmate of a prison or similar institution.
<P>
	The courts, however, are providing a more varied approach 
when imposing sentence on certain offenders. Payment may be 
made to persons serving a sentence who are not confined to an 
institution and who meet all the conditions of entitlement. 
Examples of this would be incarceration during weekends or 
evenings only, or electronic surveillance.
<P>
	As to the question what crimes were they incarcerated for, this 
is of no relevance to the determination of entitlement to UI 
benefit. Accordingly, information on the reasons for 
incarceration are not collected.
<P>
	(e) Correctional Service Canada provides to Revenue Canada 
the following information: name; date of birth; date of 
incarceration; date of release and nature of parole arrangements 
if any. This information is used to ensure that only those 
individuals who are entitled under the law to GST credit benefits 
receive them. Inmates who are confined to prison at the end of 
the taxation year, and had been so confined for at least six 
months in the year, are not eligible to apply for the GST credit 
benefits.
<P>
	The latest information concerning the number of individuals 
who received the GST credit would be based on the 1993 
taxation year. However, the number of federal inmates who 
received the GST credit is not data that is accumulated for 
purposes of administration of the Income Tax Act. This 
information is not readily available and would require a 
considerable expenditure and reallocation of resources to 
assemble. The reason for the incarceration is not provided to 
Revenue Canada as it is not a determining factor in providing 
GST rebates. To determine the nature of the incarceration of any 
GST credit recipient, income tax information would have to be 
communicated to Correctional Service Canada and that is 
precluded by the confidentiality provisions of the Income Tax 
Act.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The questions as enumerated by the 
parliamentary secretary have been answered.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> I ask that the remaining questions be allowed 
to stand.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="YUKONSURFACERIGHTSBOARDACT">YUKON SURFACE RIGHTS BOARD ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill 
C-55, an Act to establish a board having jurisdiction concerning 
disputes respecting surface rights in respect of land in the Yukon 
Territory and to amend other Acts in relation thereto, be read the 
third time and passed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
concluding, I simply want to say that as far as aboriginal land 
claims are concerned, whether we are talking about Canada or 
Quebec, I think it is important to put this debate in its proper 
historical and geopolitical perspective.
<P>
	I also wish to emphasize that at the negotiations, a spirit of 
justice and tolerance should prevail, both among federal and 
provincial authorities and leaders of aboriginal communities. I 
think anyone with political responsibilities in Canada has a 
moral responsibility to ensure that in these discussions, we do 
everything in our power to avoid making accusations that are 
sometimes unfair and that merely create ill feeling, so that the  
people of Quebec, the people of Canada and the aboriginal 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8302"> 8302 </A></B>
<P>
peoples concerned can live in harmony on Canadian and Quebec 
territory, and this vast issue of aboriginal land claims will 
finally be settled in Canada as far as possible.
<P>
	I agree one can never obtain satisfaction on all aspects of 
these claims, but I think that if we develop a spirit of justice and 
tolerance, we can conclude agreements that are acceptable to the 
various communities concerned.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philippe Paré (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish 
to make a brief comment.
<P>
	I listened carefully to the speech by my colleague from 
Jonquière. I am proud to be the colleague of this member who 
spoke very openly and generously about the native 
communities. It would be so easy to make speeches that raise 
tensions and play on the public's emotions, in short, to engage in 
demagogy.
<P>
	The member for Jonquière took a radically different 
approach. His speech well reflects the thinking of Quebecers on 
this issue and I call on all members of this House to reread my 
colleague's speech. It is an unfailing source of wisdom in 
dealing with the issue of respecting native rights.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I have only a few comments to make at third 
reading of Bill C-55, Yukon Surface Rights Board Act.
<P>
	It gives me a considerable amount of pleasure to see this bill, 
having come through all stages, and be able to say a few words at 
the conclusion of the debate.
<P>
<B>(1215) </B>
<P>
	At the same time I want to congratulate the parties that were 
involved in the negotiation of the agreement and in the 
execution of the legislation that has led us to this point. A couple 
of very specific congratulations, one to my own leader, the 
member for Yukon. The member for Yukon has been actively 
engaged in the discussion, debate and negotiations leading up to 
this point today.
<P>
	I commend to the House the work that she has been able to do 
for her constituents, members of the Council for Yukon Indians, 
members of the communities of Yukon, all residents of Yukon. 
The member for Yukon has spent a considerable amount of time 
relaying information in one direction, discussing with 
ministers, parliamentary secretaries, committee chairpersons 
throughout the course of the debates on all three parts of Yukon 
self-government and land claims process which concludes the 
proclamation of this act.
<P>
	I was very pleased to have been in a number of meetings that 
the member for Yukon initiated and attended. I am very pleased 
to have been able to work with her throughout this process as the 
New Democratic Party's aboriginal affairs and northern 
development critic.
<P>
	I also want to congratulate the people of the Council for 
Yukon Indians and all of the people from Yukon who have 
worked so hard for so long to ensure that this day would come. A 
lot of changes have been made in people's positions and 
attitudes over the years, that this idea has been in front of not 
only the people of Yukon but now the people of all of Canada. I 
congratulate all of those who over the years have been involved 
so diligently in this process.
<P>
	I would like to now spend just a couple of minutes indicating 
to those who are tuning in this afternoon for the first time some 
idea of what is in front of us on this bill that we are concluding 
today and to indicate to the House that I and my party are very 
pleased to support the legislation in front of us, just as we were 
pleased to support the previous two bills that are part of this 
three part package.
<P>
	We know that Bill C-55 is a companion piece of legislation to 
what was Bill C-33, Yukon First Nations final land claims 
settlement act and Bill C-34, Yukon First Nations 
self-government agreement. Both acts were passed in the spring 
session of this Parliament but they will not come into effect until 
this act, Bill C-55, is concluded.
<P>
	Bill C-55 establishes a process in Yukon for obtaining access 
to private and public lands based on models used in the western 
provinces. I come from Saskatchewan, a province that 
successfully negotiated a land entitlement agreement with a 
large number of the aboriginal communities in our province. I 
am very pleased to be able to see that models which were 
discussed in Saskatchewan are being useful in the negotiations 
of agreements in other locations.
<P>
	The bill in front of us also establishes Yukon surface rights 
board to resolve disputes between parties guaranteeing access to 
vast holdings of private land.
<P>
	The bill is very technical. Anything that subjects parties to an 
agreement has technical aspects to it. In essence Bill C-55 
provides guidelines whereby land disputes will be settled by the 
surface rights board. Under the legislation a person may apply to 
the board for the arbitration of a matter only after that person has 
first attempted to negotiate an agreement with the other party.
<P>
	The board will have jurisdiction over other matters such as the 
disputes between persons holding surface rights and those 
holding subsurface rights, the amount of compensation for the 
expropriation of settlement land, and the amount of 
compensation for pockets of government lands retained within 
settlement lands.
<P>
<B>(1220) </B>
<P>
	If parties cannot reach agreement in a matter relating to 
access to lands the board has the power to establish the terms 
and conditions of a right of access, award compensation for the 
right of access and for damage resulting from that access, and 
periodically review orders previously made by the board with 
regard to land  disputes. Orders by the board are final and 
binding. Final decisions are enforceable through the Supreme 
<P>

<B><A NAME="8303"> 8303 </A></B>
<P>
Court of Yukon territory. The board will not retain any 
permanent staff and will meet only as needed.
<P>
	As well, the bill confirms the legal rights of minors and is said 
to address concerns raised over the need for certainty pertaining 
to land title in Yukon. Greater certainty pertaining to land title 
will facilitate exploration and resource development in Yukon, 
matters that we know go to the heart of the economy of the 
territory.
<P>
	I would also like to indicate that final passage of Bill C-55 
clears the way for implementation of four Yukon First Nations 
land claim settlements already negotiated and will trigger 
financial compensation agreements already signed with these 
four individual First Nations.
<P>
	Earlier in the debates on this bill when my leader, the member 
for Yukon, spoke she indicated a couple of things that I would 
like to repeat for the benefit of the House as we close the debate 
today.
<P>
	I quote the member for Yukon representing her constituents' 
interests in this bill. She stated in the House of Commons on 
November 1, 1994: ``Bill C-55 ensures that all Yukoners, 
aboriginal and non-aboriginal people, have the tools to move 
forward with the certainty that is necessary for business with the 
respect and dignity accorded to First Nations in Yukon and that 
will lead toward self-sufficiency for Yukon territory.
<P>
	``What we are showing can be done within Canada is that we 
can respect the languages, the cultures and the historic traditions 
of all peoples within a certain territory and we can do it under 
the flag of Canada''.
<P>
	These are very important words looking at a long history of 
negotiation of a very difficult matter that now seems to have 
been resolved quite peacefully and satisfactorily.
<P>
	We in the New Democratic Party are proud of the work of all 
those who have been involved in this process and we are pleased 
today to commit ourselves to agreement on Bill C-55.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is the House ready for the question?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Question.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt 
the motion?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> On division.
<P>
	(Motion agreed to, bill read the third time and passed.)
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, there has been some discussion 
among members in the House to proceed immediately to private 
members' hour. I see the proponent of the private member's 
ballot item in the House.
<P>
	I think if you were to ask for that consent you would find that 
the House is now prepared to move to private members' hour.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is there unanimous consent to proceed 
to Private Members' Business?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for 
Burnaby-Kingsway has given written notice that he is not able 
to proceed with his motion on Monday, November 28, 1994. 
Most regrettably there have been, I am told, 30 members who 
have been contacted to ask if they could fill in on Monday and 
none of the 30 to my knowledge has indicated that he or she is 
willing to do that.
<P>
	Accordingly, since we cannot exchange the debate for 
Monday, I would direct the table officers to drop the item of 
business to the bottom of the order of precedence. Private 
members' hour will thus be cancelled. Pursuant to Standing 
Order 99(2), the House will meet to consider Government 
Orders at 11 a.m.
<P>
<B>(1225) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	There is unanimous consent for the House to proceed now to 
the consideration of Private Members' Business as listed on 
today's Order Paper.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="DIVORCEACT">DIVORCE ACT</A></H3>
	<B>Mrs. Daphne Jennings (Mission-Coquitlam, Ref.)</B> moved 
that Bill C-232, an act to amend the Divorce Act (granting of 
access to, or custody of, a child to a grandparent), be read the 
second time and referred to committee.
<P>
	She said: Mr. Speaker, I rise today to begin the debate on Bill 
C-232, an act to amend the Divorce Act. I am speaking today on 
behalf of all our grandchildren who are without their 
grandparents at this time and on behalf of all the grandparents in 
Canada who have worked long and hard to convince the 
legislators of Canada that this bill is necessary.
<P>
	In the time I have to speak today I would like to go through 
exactly what this bill sets out to accomplish and then discuss the 
need for the bill. Finally, I will attempt to give enough reasons 
so that all members of this House can unite in support of this 
bill.
<P>
	The main purpose of Bill C-232 is to fill a void in the Divorce 
Act in the area of access and custody. At present only parents of 
a child are allowed to discuss access and custody in a court in the 
case of divorce. The practical effect of this is that grandparents 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8304"> 8304 </A></B>
<P>
who may have spent considerable time with their grandchildren 
have no automatic right of standing in court.
<P>
	At the present time if grandparents are concerned that this 
access might be cut off as a result of the divorce, they must first 
seek leave of the court to raise the access or custody issue. 
Should leave be granted, then and only then have they a right to 
ask the court to put a right of access clause for them as 
grandparents in the divorce decree of the parents.
<P>
	Dealing specifically with the provisions of the bill, the first 
clause would amend section 10 of the Divorce Act. This is the 
section of the Divorce Act which deals with access and custody. 
Under clause 1, grandparents would have standing in court to 
seek either access or, I suppose in some exceptional 
circumstances, custody of the grandchildren.
<P>
	Clause 2 of the bill seeks to amend section 17 of the Divorce 
Act dealing with applications to vary access or custody orders. 
Therefore, if at a time after the order for access or custody was 
granted under section 16 and it was found that the original 
decision was not appropriate, then it would be open to the 
grandparents to go back to the court just as parents can do to 
seek amendment of the original order.
<P>
	Again, with the adoption of this clause grandparents would 
have the automatic right to standing in the court should either 
the parents or they seek to wish alteration of the original access 
or custody order.
<P>
	Finally, the bill would add a new clause to the Divorce Act 
which deals specifically with the amendments contained in Bill 
C-232. This new clause requires that the clauses contained in 
this bill be referred to an appropriate committee of this House 
four years after their coming into force so that a committee of 
this House can review the effectiveness of the provisions.
<P>
	One part of the bill I did not refer to is clause 2 part (2). This 
clause seeks to amend subsection 16, part (5) of the Divorce Act. 
It would give grandparents who have a right of access a right to 
make inquiries and to be given information as to the health, 
education and welfare of the child.
<P>
	I have had discussions on the legality and appropriateness of 
this clause with my friend on the other side of the House, the 
member for Nepean. My friend from Nepean has a private 
member's bill on the Order Paper quite similar to Bill C-232. 
We have approached this matter in a non-partisan fashion.
<P>
	She has brought to my attention that this subclause could give 
grandparents more rights than the parents of the children 
presently enjoy. This subclause may also contravene privacy 
acts or rights of the child which may exist by statute or common 
law.
<P>
	Therefore while procedurally it cannot be removed at this 
time, I trust when the bill gets to committee this clause can be 
deleted.
<P>
	While I am dealing with technicalities, I thought it important 
to bring to the attention of the House the wording of the new 
Quebec Civil Code as it relates to grandparents and the issue of 
access arising out of divorce of the parents. It states in section 
611:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In no case may the father or mother, without a grave reason, interfere with 
personal relations between the child and his grandparents.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Failing agreement between the parties, terms and conditions of these 
relations are decided by the courts.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Therefore in Quebec, thanks to the Civil Code, grandparents 
enjoy the right of standing in court and therefore this bill would 
compliment the Civil Code or simply not be operative in the 
province of Quebec, as the matter is already covered by 
legislation.
<P>
	Having dealt with what Bill C-232 does, it is important now 
to turn to the need for such legislation.
<P>
<B>(1230 ) </B>
<P>
	This proposal has a long history. In the last Parliament it 
appeared as a private member's bill in the name of the former 
member for Delta from the Progressive Conservative Party. In 
this Parliament there is a private member's motion by the 
member for Winnipeg Transcona. The subject matter has also 
been the subject of the member for Ottawa West's householders. 
Of course my good friend from Nepean also has a private 
member's bill on the Order Paper dealing with the same subject 
matter.
<P>
	Therefore, the subject matter of this bill receives wide 
support in the House. For that reason I want to make it clear this 
is not a partisan issue, not a Reform issue, not a political issue, 
but a grandchildren's and a grandparents' issue, a human issue 
which has to be addressed now.
<P>
	When we discuss grandchildren we usually envision a happy 
family scene with the entire family present. Perhaps it is a 
holiday time like Thanksgiving or Christmas, when 
grandparents are always a part of the celebration, or Mother's 
Day or Father's Day, when a special part of the day recognizes 
grandparents as well as parents, with gifts made by children who 
are also grandchildren.
<P>
	It is my sad duty today to remind Canadians everywhere that 
this happy scene is not always the case, that in fact many of our 
senior citizens no longer have happy Christmases or 
Thanksgivings, or any other holiday celebrations, because one 
of the major parts of the whole is missing. Many Canadian 
grandchildren no longer see their grandparents.
<P>
	I suppose many of us, busy with our lives, never took the time 
to care or find out that some Canadian families are missing vital 
parts to keep them whole. We cannot do anything about the 
growing divorce rate which seems to know no check point. 
These are adults who must make their own decisions. We can 
address the needs of the  family members for whom no one 
seems to be speaking, the rights of the grandchild, the rights of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8305"> 8305 </A></B>
<P>
all our grandchildren to see, to visit, to talk to their 
grandparents.
<P>
	The movement for this type of legislation, which will only 
give grandparents standing before the courts, began a number of 
years ago in 1986 in British Columbia with the founding of the 
Canadian Grandparents' Rights Association. Now we have other 
chapters across Canada.
<P>
	In Ontario, one grandparents group goes by the name of 
Grandparents Requesting Access and Dignity or GRAND. 
Another Ontario support group is Grandchildren/Grandparents' 
Rights of Wholeness through Heritage or GROWTH. It was 
formed by the group of grandparents concerned over the failure 
of provincial and federal legislation to adequately address the 
issue of grandchildren's rights to visit with their grandparents.
<P>
	All these groups and others I have not yet mentioned are 
trying to address grandchildren's rights. Article 5 of the 
convention of the rights of the child, which was adopted by the 
General Assembly of the United Nations on November 20, 1989, 
requires state parties to respect the responsibility, rights and 
duties not only of parents but also of members of the extended 
family.
<P>
	Article 16 of the said convention provides that no child shall 
be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with family. 
Preventing a child from seeking his or her grandparents without 
just cause is unlawful interference with family. It is important 
that we look at why it is important that contact between 
grandchildren and grandparents be maintained after the divorce 
of the parents.
<P>
	Would it simply not be cleaner and neater to cut off access so 
the children of the divorce, the memories of grandparents and 
the way it used to be when mommy and daddy lived together 
simply faded with the passage of time? Fortunately this is not 
the opinion of experts in the files of family psychology. Anton 
Klarich, chief psychologist of the French language separate 
schools in Essex county states: ``A tremendous amount of love 
and security can go a long way to help children who are worried 
about what lies ahead of them in an increasingly uncertain 
world''.
<P>
	Klarich was referring to a report released in August 1993 by 
the Ontario government which showed that children as young as 
10 are overwhelmed by the helplessness that grips family 
members worried about personal and financial problems. The 
children absorb feelings of insecurity, worry and fear. Klarich 
says: ``With such a scenario it's good to know there is someone 
there within a child's family, the grandparents, who always 
provide love and stability''.
<P>
	This short poem reflects just such a feeling of love and 
security instilled in a young grandson by his grandpa entitled 
``Grandpa and Me'':
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>He's never too busy to listen<BR>
He's never too tired to play<BR>
We go up on a hill and down together we ski<BR>
My Grandpa and me.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We go camping and we go fishing<BR>
A great fisherman is he<BR>
And then we sleep out under the trees#<BR>
My Grandpa and me.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I know that someday he will leave me<BR>
And I'll be as sad as can be<BR>
But I'll always remember the good times we had<BR>
My Grandpa and me.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This poem was written by an 11-year old grandson and I think 
he says it all very well. Lynn Wells, chief psychologist for the 
Wellington Board of Education in Guelph, Ontario, believes that 
grandparents contribute to the upbringing of grandchildren in 
more positive ways than they realize.
<P>
<B>(1235) </B>
<P>
	Her quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Young children create their self-concepts from the comments that people 
give them. So the more positive and loving people that are around them, to 
give them different perspectives of themselves, the more widely developed 
their self-esteem is.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	A study in 1986 at the University of Guelph found that 
grandmothers have an innate tendency to respond to the needs 
and emotional upheaval of a grandchild.
<P>
	The study was conducted by Jim Gladstone, a professor of 
social work surveyed 80 grandmothers in southwestern Ontario 
whose children had divorced or separated. Gladstone has said: 
``Previous research on children of divorce suggest that young 
children have very little opportunity to talk about the break-up. 
Grandmothers seem to be prepared to talk and listen to their 
grandchildren''.
<P>
	I want to share with members a poem written by a 
grandmother who has been denied access to her grandchildren. I 
believe she is asking us to listen:

<BLOCKQUOTE>All children are precious and sacred to me-<BR>
We're fighting a battle to help them be free<BR>

	This poem is both a statement and a question. It is from one of 
our many hurting grandparents.
<P>
	Ruth Isbister, Toronto author of <I>Grandparents Don't Just 
Babysit</I> says that the role and function of grandparents as the 
connection between past and future has not changed nor has 
their natural ability to make a child feel special. ``You transfer a 
feeling of confidence to your grandchild''. By their presence, 
grandparents add something to the child's comprehension of the 
continuity of life.
<P>
	In fact one of the leading jurists in the United States in the 
area of grandparents' rights stated in 1992 that there were over 
three million children nationwide in the states being raised by 
grandparents.
<P>
	The case for grandparents' rights has also been captured 
dramatically in the brief submitted by the Canadian 
Grandparents Rights Association of Richmond, B.C., to the 
Department of Justice. I would like to quote some passages from 
this brief:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The experience of the grandparents' society shows that the true safety net 
with regard to child rearing is not the state but the grandparents.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It is important to understand that this safety net is provided by 
grandparents not based upon the hopeless inefficiency of state bureaucracies. 
It does not function on the basis of filling out forms, making appointments, 
or qualifying by any test, nor is it governed or supervised by a psychologist, 
a counsellor, a therapist or a mediator. It is usually available on a phone call, 
the call often being a product of an emergency and attracts no publicity at 
all. It does not become an occasion for grandstanding in the press or in the 
courts.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The brief goes on to say:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>At present when there is a family break-up and the need to look after children, 
there is no obligation on the state to even notify members of the extended families, 
let alone consult with them, although state agencies will occasionally issue 
statements suggesting that that is the policy. In fact the state's policy is that the 
family ends with the parents which defies the social practice of Canadians across the 
country. In dealing with aboriginal communities in B.C. the same policy has come 
to be quite otherwise. An Indian band for instance will be notified if children of a 
band member have been apprehended. They will be  given every assistance to look 
after the child within that community.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
	It is not clear to us why a perfectly sensible policy now 
developing in the case of aboriginals should be denied the 
overwhelming majority of Canadians. ``This, with regard to 
grandparents specifically, where they are often more than ready 
to look after the children of a broken family.
<P>
	When family is available, grandparent or extended family, it 
should be preferred to strangers in matters of custody, and that 
should be a statutory presumption. Access should be provided to 
grandparents also by a legal presumption, so that a parent who 
would deny it will have to make that case, will have to go to a 
judge and persuade''.
<P>
	I think you will agree this is pretty powerful stuff. On the 
other hand it is written by people who have contributed to 
society for a great many years and are now frustrated by the 
rules of that society.
<P>
	There is another issue here we need to address. We have a 
growing crime rate with young offenders. Jails are crowded 
already. Is it not time we began to use common sense and 
preventive measures? We must reach children before they begin 
school. This is not a problem to be dumped on teachers. It begins 
in the home. Responsibility begins in the home.
<P>
	Why then are we ignoring the very group in our society who 
can help build strong character and a sense of responsibility 
within our children, our senior citizens. They are experienced. 
They are wise. They are loving. They are willing to help, yes, 
willing to help.
<P>
	I recently had the honour of listening to Judge Andrea Ruffo 
speak of her concerns that children know they are loved and 
needed, that they are encouraged to try to follow their dreams. 
Grandparents have the time to discuss our grandchildren's 
dreams with them and to encourage them.
<P>
	I am not suggesting that all grandparents should have access 
to their grandchildren. I know there are some problems. That is 
why I stress the courts will make the decision in the best 
interests of the child. We must not punish 95 per cent of 
grandparents for 5 per cent of the problems.
<P>
	Bill C-232 is designed to relieve some of this frustration. We 
owe it to these grandparents and we owe it to the grandchildren 
to see this bill passed into law. This is the year of the family. 
Families should include grandparents and great-grandparents. 
It is important that grandparents be given the rights set out in the 
bill.
<P>
	Ladies and gentlemen, members of the House, we can do 
something. We have been sent to Parliament to make a 
difference. The passage of Bill C-232 will not cost the Canadian 
taxpayers anything except the cost of a stamp to alert 
grandparents when the divorce case will be heard before the 
courts. This bill will only give Canadian  grandparents the right 
to be heard. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8307"> 8307 </A></B>
<P>
Access will only be granted if the judge feels it is in the best 
interests of the grandchild.
<P>
	We often say we can do nothing. We have no excuse to say 
today we can do nothing. If and when this bill goes to 
committee, necessary changes can be made if it is decided in the 
best interests of the child.
<P>
	Bills are amended every day if necessary. Here we can address 
a problem too long denied in our country, the right of the child to 
his or her family. May I suggest that this is such a time to relieve 
the frustrations of grandparents not able to visit or see their 
grandchildren.
<P>
	I know that some will question the appropriateness of this bill 
because it deals with the problems of a very small group of 
people. It can be argued that this type of change should be made 
in the context of an overall review of family law at the 
provincial level. There it could deal with common law 
relationships and with children put in foster homes.
<P>
	I can tell you that the grandparents groups that tried this 
avenue have been given the usual bureaucratic runaround. It is 
time to do something positive for those who helped to build this 
great country, grandparents. If this bill is passed and becomes 
law then perhaps the provincial jurisdictions will move to 
broaden the group who could benefit from such as law. However, 
let us, the members of this federal Parliament, take a stand today 
and get on with this bill.
<P>
	May I remind the House our Prime Minister on his recent tour 
to China made the comment that representatives of different 
political stripes can pull together for the benefit of the country 
and all Canadians.
<P>
	As I said at the beginning of my speech this is not a partisan 
issue. I hope and I know grandparents across the country hope 
that the government will support this measure so that it will be 
passed into law and fill one of the large holes in the Divorce Act. 
The voice of the children needs to be heard.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Beryl Gaffney (Nepean, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very 
pleased to speak to Bill C-232, an act to amend the Divorce Act 
which is the granting of access to or custody of a child to a 
grandparent proposed by my colleague, the member for 
Mission-Coquitlam.
<P>
	It is especially important to note, as she has mentioned in her 
comment, that I am standing in support of this bill. One of the 
nice things that can happen in this House is that members from 
different parties can agree on an issue when it is relevant to all 
Canadians. It is particularly relevant in this International Year 
of the Family that we are discussing this important relationship 
between grandparents and grandchildren. More important, we 
are talking about protecting that relationship.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	I am a grandparent. As we all know grandparents can and do 
play an important role in the psychological and social 
development of grandchildren. They provide an additional 
source of love, affection, support and understanding, all of 
which serve to enhance the child's self esteem and confidence.
<P>
	Grandparents serve as mentors and as teachers to their 
grandchildren, giving them the benefit of years of experience 
and a sense of their roots that cannot be obtained from any other 
source.
<P>
	Especially important is the relationship between grandparents 
and grandchildren when families dissolve and separate. 
Children are the innocent parties of a marriage breakup. They 
are the ones who are least capable of coping or understanding 
the problems that divorce creates. As a result, their disrupted 
lives and broken hearts need healing. They need someone who 
can hold them together in this very complicated and stressful 
time.
<P>
	Grandparents do play an integral role in this process of 
healing. Grandparents give a real sense of security and 
continuity. They provide a sense of being wanted and loved. A 
grandparent's love is unconditional.
<P>
	Despite the positive role that grandparents play in the lives of 
their grandchildren prior to the family breakup, during 
separation and after the divorce they often do not have access to 
these vulnerable young people. As a grandmother it is very 
difficult for me to understand not having access to my wonderful 
grandchildren.
<P>
	They are sometimes denied the right to visit or to have contact 
with their grandchildren. Grandparents rights organizations 
across Canada have thousands of documented cases where 
grandparents have been obstructed from contacting their 
grandchildren.
<P>
	I recall a case in Toronto in which a woman lost contact with 
her seven year old grandson when her former daughter-in-law 
refused to take her phone calls or allow her any visitation rights. 
After considerable attempts to contact the mother in order to 
work out some kind of visitation, the grandparent was charged 
with phone harassment and thrown in jail, locked up with the 
criminals.
<P>
	Yesterday I received a letter from a grandmother in my riding 
of Nepean relaying her anguish to me over her inability to see 
her young grandson. I would like to quote from her letter. She 
says: ``Because of a pending divorce I am having difficulty 
seeing my grandson and this is a cause of constant pain in our 
family. We waited 11 years for a grandchild. Much of the joy of 
this wondrous event is now tarnished as we have no right to 
access. Denying or making it difficult for us to visit with our 
little guy runs contrary to most people's idea of family. A child 
has two families and deserves to know them both well. To know 
he is treasured, to have pride and love from both sides of the 
family is a birthright''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8308"> 8308 </A></B>
<P>
	I could go on and on with testimonials from grandparents 
across the country fighting for the right to see and speak to their 
grandchildren. There are many.
<P>
	On October 5, 1994, I presented over 3,000 signatures in this 
House of Commons seeking a remedy to this problem. Just 
yesterday I received another 802 signatures. In many of these 
cases it is a personal tragedy for the grandparents. More 
important, it is a personal tragedy for the grandchildren of 
immense proportions that will probably affect them for the rest 
of their lives.
<P>
	There are a number of organizations across Canada that are 
working very diligently to help grandparents who are 
experiencing this situation. I would like to take this opportunity 
to mention the organizations I have been working with. I cannot 
mention all of the people, but I see some here in the gallery 
today, although I know I am not supposed to mention that. They 
include GRAND, Florence Knight of the Canadian 
Grandparents' Rights Association, Liliane George of the 
Grandparents Requesting Access and Dignity and Madeleine 
Bremner of the Grandparents Right of Wholesomeness Through 
Heritage.
<P>
	I congratulate them and all of the many people who have 
worked so hard in this regard. All of these people have done a 
tremendous amount of work. I congratulate all of you.
<P>
	In Canada federal legislation states that grandparents have no 
legal access to grandchildren. That is sad. If a grandparent wants 
to see one of their grandsons or granddaughters who for example 
is living with a former daughter-in-law they may have to go to 
court unless there is an agreement made with the divorcing 
parent.
<P>
	This process can be terribly expensive and time consuming. It 
pits grandparents against an aggressive and adversarial court 
system. This is not conducive to the maintenance of harmonious 
relationships.
<P>
<B>(1250) </B>
<P>
	Many countries in the world recognize the unique 
relationships between grandparents and grandchildren. In most 
cases they have granted either through legislation or through 
jurisprudence that parents may not without serious cause place 
obstacles to relations between the child and his or her 
grandparents.
<P>
	Since 1980 the Quebec civil code has stated that ``in no case 
may the father or the mother, without serious cause, place 
obstacles to personal relationships between child and 
grandparents. Failing agreement between the parties, the 
legalities of the relations are settled by the court''.
<P>
	This recognizes that the personal ties between the grandparent 
and the grandchild must not be interpreted as an intrusion in the 
life of the custodial parents, but as an opportunity for the child 
to maintain a link with his or her ancestry and cultural heritage 
as well as an opportunity to maintain that unique relationship 
with his or her grandparent.
<P>
	The amendments to the Divorce Act proposed by Bill C-232, 
and my colleague has joined me on this side of the House, would 
serve to complement this section of the civil code on 
grandparents.
<P>
	Bill C-232 recognizes the federal government's role in 
ensuring grandparents' access to grandchildren by amending the 
Divorce Act to recognize them as a distinct category of third 
persons who may apply for access to a child without requiring 
leave of the court.
<P>
	The Divorce Act would also provide a presumption that this 
relationship is in the best interests of the child and that this 
relationship should therefore not be disturbed unless it can be 
demonstrated to a court that it is not in the best interest of the 
child for the grandparents to have access to this grandchild. My 
colleague mentioned that in her comments.
<P>
	Upon seeking legal advice with regard to my bill, which is 
similar to this Bill C-232, there is a clause in my bill as well as 
in hers that causes me concern. It was lines 10 through 17 which 
reads: ``Unless the court orders otherwise, a spouse or 
grandparent who is granted access to a child of the marriage has 
the right to make inquiries and to be given information as to the 
health, education and welfare of that child''.
<P>
	There is concern with this proposal because this type of 
information is private and normally only available to parents in 
normal marriage situations. If this amendment were included in 
the Divorce Act the effect may be that grandparents of the 
children of divorced parents could have rights to receive health 
and educational information that grandparents of children in an 
intact family do not have.
<P>
	While I wholeheartedly support the principles laid out in the 
bill and I will support it, I will seek to amend clause 1 through 
the justice committee's review. I would amend it by possibly 
deleting lines 10 to 17. First and foremost, and I must say this 
quite categorically, I will be supporting this bill and will work to 
ensure that it reaches final approval in this House of Commons.
<P>
	I cannot emphasize enough the importance of this bill. The 
relationship that exists between grandparents and grandchildren 
is unique. During these times of rapid social change, this bond 
provides a sense of continuity and hope in the lives of our young 
people. When obstacles are placed in the way of this relationship 
the results can be devastating for both grandparents and 
grandchildren.
<P>
	I call on all my colleagues in this House to support Bill C-232 
to amend the Divorce Act, to protect the rights of grandparents 
to have access to their grandchildren.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8309"> 8309 </A></B>
<P>
	I am delighted to stand here today in support of Bill C-232 
and I would hope that all my colleagues would do the same.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to speak to this bill to amend the Divorce Act, Bill C-232. 
The bill would amend the Divorce Act to provide for a person to 
be granted custody of or access to any of his or her 
grandchildren. By virtue of this change, grandparents would no 
longer be required to obtain leave of the court to make such an 
application.
<P>
	Furthermore, this bill would give grandparents the right to be 
given information as to the health, education and welfare of the 
child. Finally, this bill provides that these amendments to the 
Divorce Act would be reviewed by a parliamentary committee 
four years after coming into force.
<P>
	Taken at face value, this bill appears eminently acceptable 
and I must admit that, as a grandmother myself, my gut reaction 
would be to support the bill.
<P>
<B>(1255) </B>
<P>
	After all, what grandparent would accept to be denied access 
to his or her grandchildren after their parents separate or get 
divorced? Of course, such sensitivity and feelings are only 
human and quite normal when, for example, they have fewer 
kids and they live far away, in poverty and in sickness, as the 
case may be.
<P>
	Nonetheless, we think that this bill wanders from the primary 
objective, which is the welfare of the child. The emotional needs 
of grandparents should certainly not come before their 
grandchildren's quality of life.
<P>
	As Madam Justice Andrée Ruffo said, it may be more 
appropriate to talk in terms of the rights of children to be granted 
access to their grandparents than the other way around. When 
there are children involved, the paramount criterion should be 
their best interests.
<P>
	All in the name of commendable principles such as the rights 
of grandparents and the welfare of grandchildren, I can see how 
Bill C-232 could put the child in the middle not only of family 
disputes, but also of jurisdiction disputes.
<P>
	Let us be quite clear on this point. Bill C-232 is inefficient if 
its primary goal is to facilitate contacts between grandparents 
and grandchildren. It may make the process easier for 
grandparents, but it may in turn make things more complicated 
when the parents are deemed to have retained parental control 
and there are no reasons for them to be disqualified.
<P>
	Parental control, incidentally and to the best of our 
knowledge, is an exclusive provincial jurisdiction under 
paragraph 92(13) of the Constitution Act, 1867. We wonder if 
giving more rights to the grandparents, when there is a divorce, 
is not an encroachment on provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	As we know, the federal government has jurisdiction in 
divorce matters. In a general sense, we wonder if Bill C-232 is a 
challengeable extension of federal jurisdiction over divorce at 
the expense of provincial jurisdiction in family matters.
<P>
	Other questions come to mind. What are the rights of 
grandparents when the parents are not married, as is now the 
case for 40 per cent of children born in Quebec? Federal 
parliamentarians must note that the continued rise in the number 
of children born outside marriage means that provincial family 
law is gradually replacing the federal Divorce Act on issues 
relating to child custody and access rights.
<P>
	It must be understood that Bill C-232 only affects the children 
of couples in the process of divorcing or already divorced. Most 
children are not affected by divorce, while others live, as we 
have just pointed out, with parents who are not legally married.
<P>
	This bill may not be as helpful to the grandparents who want 
access to their grandchildren as it purports to be.
<P>
	Furthermore, the parents or people with legal custody of a 
child have primary responsibility for looking after the child's 
best interests. In abuse cases, judicial remedies may be 
authorized by provincial legislation. Provincial legislation also 
applies to all family situations, even in the absence of marriage 
leading to divorce.
<P>
	After reviewing this bill, we fear that, despite honourable 
intentions, C-232 only compensates for some provinces' 
reluctance to legislate in this area.
<P>
<B>(1300) </B>
<P>
	As for Quebec, it passed legislation on this issue 14 years ago. 
Indeed, the Quebec civil code, through article 611, allows 
grandparents who suffer a prejudice, in terms of their relations 
with their grandchildren, to ask the courts to examine the details 
of these relations.
<P>
	Article 611 of the Quebec civil code provides that fathers and 
mothers cannot, unless they have a major reason to do so, 
interfere with the personal relations of a child and his or her 
grandparents. Unless there is an agreement between the parties, 
the details of these relations are defined by the court.
<P>
	This article from the Quebec civil code is not only 
comprehensive, it is also clear. It can be invoked before or after 
a divorce, in the case of married people, as well as in the case of 
common-law couples, single-parent families, or after the 
adoption of a child by a new spouse.
<P>
	Quebec's legislation is already far ahead of this unbalanced 
bill. As we said earlier, the federal government does not have to 
compensate for the reluctance of other provinces to legislate.
<P>
	We have problems with another provision of this legislation. I 
am referring to the fact that grandparents would have the right to 
make inquiries as to the health and education of a child. Based 
on Quebec's legislation on personal information, we thought 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8310"> 8310 </A></B>
<P>
that the protection  of information on health and education also 
fell under provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	It goes without saying that the parent of parents having 
custody of a child must not be allowed to break the contact 
between that child and his or her grandparents. The underlying 
principles of Bill C-232 are closely related to those of the 
Quebec civil code. However, the Divorce Act may not be the 
most appropriate tool to grant and recognize rights to 
grandparents.
<P>
	I will conclude by saying that, as regards Quebec, we fear Bill 
C-232 would accentuate the existing double jurisdiction 
concerning family law. As you know, the federal Parliament has 
exclusive jurisdiction over marriages and divorces, while 
Quebec can legislate wedding celebrations, property and civil 
rights, marital regimes, adoptions, separations from bed and 
board, child custody and so on. This double jurisdiction not only 
leads to inconsistencies in family law, but also prevents Quebec 
from making an appropriate reform and creating a unified 
family court. Bill C-232 might worsen the situation for Quebec.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois feels that this bill is premature and 
inappropriate. I want to point out to the hon. members that we 
only wanted to question the merits of that legislation, not 
necessarily oppose it.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Dianne Brushett (Cumberland-Colchester, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I did not prepare in depth notes today because I was 
not aware that I would have an opportunity to speak. However, I 
am very pleased to stand and support this bill by the hon. 
member for Mission-Coquitlam.
<P>
	I have had numerous calls and responses from people in Nova 
Scotia. Certain things come up frequently from the parents and 
grandparents in particular who are for the most part over the age 
of 50. These people through life experiences, through living and 
through working, have accumulated a great deal of experience in 
nurturing, guidance, sharing and loving. It is that experience 
that quite often the child of the second generation needs.
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
	Very often in many instances we see that the parents, whether 
through divorce, through emotional breakups, through living 
situations, arrangements that are so different and complex 
today, are so directly involved with the children through 
emotion and sometimes the direct link. It does not give them the 
vision to see the grandparents' needs and it does not give them 
the opportunity. The grandparent is at an arm's length so to 
speak and they can look at situations quite often more 
objectively than in an emotional situation in which two parents 
or two partners are having difficulty with children.
<P>
	Although this does come under federal jurisdiction, and the 
hon. member from the Bloc has pointed out the complexities 
that might arise because of this and because of family law in 
some provinces, I believe that we can work on those details, that 
we can look at this bill in depth and bring in the changes or the 
amendments, whatever is required, to make it more workable, 
more effective.
<P>
	It is imperative. I have seen, as I am sure all of my colleagues 
would have seen, throughout our provinces that today we have 
so many young people raising children in isolation quite often 
without access to the experience of the older population of both 
men and women who have lived long and have that experience of 
living and working and have the wisdom of nurturing and 
sharing without the biases and the direct emotional interference 
that the first generation often has to combat.
<P>
	I have recommended this in my own province. Quite often the 
young women today having babies and being isolated in 
apartments on their own have no guidance. They have no 
connection to those older people in society who have the 
wisdom of common sense, love and nurturing. This is a fault in 
our society.
<P>
	I believe this bill would bring in a closer connection to that 
whole realm of family and bringing love, nurturing, guidance 
and common sense of old wisdom that just comes from raising a 
family.
<P>
	This bill might go a long way in not only having grandparents' 
rights to the children but more than anything serving the 
children who need to know the love and nurturing and wisdom of 
living.
<P>
	A survey was done in one of the American schools asking the 
children how many of them could cite their grandparent's name. 
It was unbelievable the high number of children who could not 
even tell their grandmother's or their grandfather's name. To 
me, that is quite deplorable. It is a fact of society today.
<P>
	I believe we are on the right track with this bill in helping 
society, in helping parents to get an added abundance of love and 
nurturing that can come from the grandparents' side.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
is with great pleasure that I rise today to speak to Bill C-232, a 
bill put forward by my hon. colleague from 
Mission-Coquitlam.
<P>
	Bill C-232 would amend the Divorce Act in such a way to 
give grandparents the right of access to their grandchildren. In 
this the International Year of the Family is it not the perfect 
opportunity to legally recognize the important place that 
grandparents occupy in the family unit? I am pleased to see 
support in this House as we take the initiative in this important 
area of family development.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8311"> 8311 </A></B>
<P>
	Today's family structure is threatened by a host of 
uncertainties, tensions and stresses which can be attributed to 
unfortunate financial circumstances, job loss, career or 
vocational instability or family breakdown. There are occasions 
when the provision of adequate care for children within these 
situations becomes secondary to the unexpected disturbances or 
turbulence within the family setting. The very urgent and 
oftentimes invisible needs of the children in such an 
environment can be overlooked.
<P>
<B>(1310 ) </B>
<P>
	I am sure all of us here have met adults who, despite being 
adequately nourished and cared for physically as children, 
demonstrate the impoverishment of their emotional upbringing. 
While it is unlikely that any single event can be said to be 
responsible for all adult distress, we can nonetheless argue there 
is abundant evidence to suggest that the adult personality is 
constructed to a considerable extent from childhood experiences 
and that those who care for young children determine and define 
the nature of these experiences.
<P>
	As we consider this bill, let us not forget to address how best 
to meet the needs of children in dysfunctional settings, 
acknowledging that those who care about the children are also 
likely to be better able to care for them.
<P>
	Under the provisions of this bill and in the case of divorce the 
trial judge would be permitted to address the needs of the whole 
family at a time when it is least able to deal with problems. It is 
difficult for children after a marriage breakup to adjust to this 
change and if in addition they lose their grandparents, it can be 
devastating. It is devastating for the children because they lose 
what may seem to be the only stable element in their young lives 
and devastating for the grandparents because the children they 
love can be taken away from them with little legal recourse.
<P>
	Since most grandparents are on fixed incomes and cannot 
afford to initiate a court action to help their grandchildren 
maintain some security and stability in their lives, I believe the 
government should intervene to alleviate the fear of losing their 
grandchildren. Many grandparents experience a sense of 
tremendous loss during divorce proceedings and this sense of 
loss in many cases becomes a reality. Bill C-232 sets out to

	The bill before us would amend the Divorce Act in such a way 
as to provide a person wishing to make an application under the 
Divorce Act to be granted access to or custody of any of his or 
her grandchildren and shall not be required to obtain leave of the 
court to make such an application. The bill would also provide 
that a person who was granted access to any of his or her 
grandchildren shall have the right to make inquiries and to be 
given information as to the health, education and welfare of the 
child.
<P>
	To make sure these amendments to the Divorce Act are 
actually serving their intended purpose they would be subject to 
a review by a parliamentary committee every four years after 
their enactment.
<P>
	Most grandparents are concerned about the well-being of 
their grandchildren. This whole subject was debated in the 
Alberta legislature. I would like to read from its <I>Hansard</I>. In her 
speech Mrs. Hughes quoted a study by Jim Gladstone from the 
University of Guelph. Gladstone conducted a study in 1986 that 
reinforced the importance of grandparents, that relationship of 
grandparents to grandchildren.
<P>
	That report concluded that when marriages break down, 
grandmothers have more contact with their grandchildren than 
before the breakdown. Gladstone believes this means 
grandparents have an innate tendency to respond to the needs 
and emotional upheaval of their grandchildren. Previous 
research on children of divorce has suggested that young 
children have very little opportuntiy to talk about the breakup.
<P>
	Gladstone believes that through the child's unique 
relationship with the grandparents they can obtain the kind of 
counselling, comfort and reassurance that they need providing 
they have continuous access.
<P>
	In the Winter 1991 issue of <I>Your Better Health Magazine</I>, a 
writer Jane Widerman writes of the personal devastation 
experienced by estranged grandparents: ``Until recently when it 
came to the fallout from divorce, the primary focus has been on 
the nuclear family''.
<P>
	Professor Edward Kruk of the University of Calgary does 
social work there. He first began to formally study the effect of 
divorce on the extended family. He says: ``Mental health 
practitioners have tended to ignore the extended family and the 
importance of the grandparent-grandchild attachment, which 
doesn't decrease after divorce''.
<P>
	Social work experts are beginning to recognize that the 
phenomenon of estranged grandparents is larger than was first 
suspected and Kruk agrees. In his recent study of non-custodial 
fathers he found that more than 50 per cent lose contact with 
their children. By extension, the fathers' parents probably also 
suffer the loss of access which, says Kruk, likely translates into 
major mental and physical health problems for grandparents.
<P>
	It is called involuntary child absence syndrome when 
referring to non-custodial fathers. The symptoms encompass a 
range of health problems including disrupted sleep, anxiety 
attacks, grief, mourning and depression. It is bad enough that 
anyone should suffer. But what parents may not realize is that if 
the grandparent-grandchild relationship is sabotaged the 
children are casualties too.

	Kruk says that older relatives represent stability, giving 
children a sense of personal history, a sense of personal 
belonging. This becomes even more important when one link in 
the familial chain is removed. During the trauma of divorce 
grandparents can be a huge source of comfort to the children, a 
sort of neutral territory in the divorce battleground.
<P>
	Children cut off from their grandparents experience the 
double whammy of separation from the non-custodial parent as 
well as one set of grandparents. Therefore, there is a necessity 
for creative legislation to protect access for grandparents. Bill 
C-232 would legally recognize these unique relationships.
<P>
	We need to also look at the precedents in legislation. For 
example all 50 states in the United States have similar types of 
legislation. In Canada, Quebec in article 659 has dealt with this 
item as my hon. colleague previously mentioned as has Ontario 
in article 59(4).
<P>
	It therefore seems to be at the very least reasonable and 
psychologically sound to argue that children should be nurtured 
and cared for by people who have actively chosen to be with 
them and to have a commitment in their development and 
well-being. I urge all hon. members of the House to give 
thoughtful deliberation to this bill and based on its merits and 
for grandparents and grandchildren everywhere give it their 
vigorous support.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
very pleased to advise the House that I am going to be a 
grandfather in February for the very first time. This is a rather 
interesting experience. I have always wanted to be a 
grandfather. However when my wife's aunt asked what I thought 
it was going to feel to be a grandfather, I thought: I cannot be 
that old. It is a very unusual feeling.
<P>
	I am standing to speak in favour of this bill not only from a 
personal point of view but also from the point of view of the 
concerns that many of my constituents have passed along to me.
<P>
	The stability of children is the question we are discussing 
here. When children have stability as they grow to be adults that 
our society will have stability. Our society is made up of 
individual components, 29 million of us. As we have individual 
stability so our society will be as well.
<P>
	Unfortunately, it is a widely accepted premise that during the 
course of a divorce many children if not the majority feel as 
though somehow they are the people who are to blame. They end 
up blaming themselves for all of the fracture within their family 
unit that is going on around them. They truly need stability.
<P>
	Almost invariably there is hostility at that particular time. 
Again, children pick up on that and unfortunately part of that 
hostility can be focused specifically toward the grandparents. In 
other words when the parents are fighting with each other, 
particularly if their parents in  turn become part of that fight, 
there ends up being this hostility.
<P>
	If we are going to be able to work in the direction of creating a 
feeling of roots and self-worth, then the grandparents have a 
very, very important place in that. Children have to have a 
feeling of ownership, that they are part of something. Children 
have to be able to develop a feeling of self-worth.
<P>
	I also believe that each of us in our own way feels it is 
important that we have a feeling for our heritage. Many of us 
have travelled to the places our grandparents came from, places 
we have never seen before. Perhaps they are overseas or perhaps 
they are in this country. We have never seen them and yet we 
have a feeling of belonging and a feeling of heritage.
<P>
<B>(1320 ) </B>
<P>
	For all of those reasons I speak in favour of this bill. However 
I knew that the Liberal members would be disappointed if the 
Reform Party did not end up talking about dollars and cents at 
some point in this debate so I will not disappoint them. I quote 
from a submission on behalf of the Canadian Grandparents 
Rights Association to the Custody and access project, family 
and youth law policy section of the Department of Justice:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We believe that one large problem in this area is a gross misconception of 
the powers and capabilities of the state. In British Columbia for instance, out 
of 850,000 children, the state has seen fit to apprehend into its custody about 
6,000 at current levels. Most of these are children who have been in and out 
of custody repeatedly, rebellious teenagers, or Indian children. Less than 
2,000 will be small children it was necessary to remove from their parents. 
Even this small number (one that has been declining for two decades) creates 
a huge financial obligation for the state in terms of immediate care, foster 
care, and the associated activities of the state, including investigation, 
apprehension and after care. It is hard to reach a definite conclusion as to 
what those costs are, but we believe they are more than $50 million a year.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	There we have it. We have a dollar and cents argument to 
something that to any rational and reasonable person is not a 
dollar and cents issue. Nonetheless it does have implications for 
our society.
<P>
	Rather than standing and beating my gums for another eight 
minutes what I simply would like to say is that I speak strongly 
in favour of this bill. I believe as we have strong citizens in our 
country with a strong feeling of self-worth which comes in no 
small part from the feeling of heritage and parentage that we 
will be building a better and stronger society.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am also 
pleased to stand in support of my hon. colleague's bill. I have a 
leg up on the hon. member who just spoke because I already am a 
grandfather.
<P>
	I put this all into perspective. It is a great privilege to be part 
of a family. When I think of the influence my parents have had 
on our children and indeed the influence my grandparents had on 
<P>

<B><A NAME="8313"> 8313 </A></B>
<P>
me, I think that we  greatly err if we do not do everything 
possible to preserve that familial connection.
<P>
	I remember when I was a young man leaving home for the first 
time to go to university in Saskatoon. My parents made a special 
point of taking me over to my grandparents' place to say 
goodbye to them. I will never forget that my grandfather, who is 
long gone now, took the time to pray with me. That was very 
important to our family. We had an opportunity to pass on those 
most deeply held values from generation to generation. Our 
grandparents were of great assistance.
<P>
	I think also particularly of my children's grandfather, my 
father-in-law, who was a tremendously strong influence in their 
lives. He was most influential and was such a solid and loving 
man.
<P>
	To a large degree I will speak on behalf of grandfathers. At the 
beginning of this debate it was our female members who were 
promoting it which is wonderful. However I do not want people 
reading this record to think that we men do not care because we 
do care deeply. I am thinking particularly of my own children 
and the high esteem in which they held Grandpa Klassen as we 
called him, my wife's father, and how we all were so close 
together during that time when he was fighting cancer. He 
passed away just a little over a year ago. Therefore those are 
extremely important connections.
<P>
	I think too of the occasions that we have had in working 
together with a number of families in recent years who have 
experienced this devastation of the family breakup. I remember 
not long ago speaking with the father of a couple, I will not 
identify them, who were breaking up and how he literally cried 
when he thought of his grandchildren.
<P>
	I can only, as forcefully as I can, support this bill and say how 
important it is for children, for grandfathers as well as for 
grandmothers. I commend and congratulate my colleague for 
bringing this forward.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Elk Island will 
have four minutes if he wishes the next time this matter comes 
up for debate. That is the time remaining to him.
<P>
	The time provided for the consideration of Private Members' 
Business has now expired.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Pursuant to Standing Order 93, the order is dropped to the 
bottom of the order of precedence on the Order Paper.
<P>
	It being 1.26 p.m., this House stands adjourned until next 
Monday at 11 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 1.26 p.m.)
