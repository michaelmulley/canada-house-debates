COMMERCIALIZATION ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed from May 15, 1996, consideration of Bill 
C-20, an act respecting the commercialization of civil air 
navigation services, as reported (with amendments) from the 
committee; and of Group No 2.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Dear colleagues, I believe the hon. 
member for Laval Centre has the floor.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am delighted to say that you are right. Besides, what 
could be more fantastic than to be the first one to speak in this 
House on a beautiful Friday morning, before an eight-day recess, 
not a holiday, but a change of pace?
<P>
	I am pleased to speak to Bill C-20, an act respecting the 
commercialization of civil air navigation services. As you know, 
the Bloc Quebecois supported the principle of this bill. However, 
you will agree with us that this bill is far from being perfect, as 
demonstrated by the several amendments proposed by the official 
opposition. As it is now, we are sure the commercialization will not 
be done only in the best interests of users. I will deal more 
precisely with the Bloc's motions in Group No 2, before us this 
morning.
<P>
	First, I would like to comment on the bill in general. As I 
mentioned, the Bloc Quebecois is not against the bill as such. We 
are not against the privatization of air navigation services, but the 
one thing that concerns us the most and that we must not forget, is 
the issue of safety.
<P>
	Privatization must never be done at the expense of the safety 
standards inherent to navigation services. Too often, privatization 
of public services entails a deregulation leading to a certain lack of 
rigour concerning safety standards for example.
<P>
	Last week's tragedy in Florida involving a ValuJet aircraft may 
be an indication of that. We have every reason to wonder if, as an 
effect of deregulation, some carriers more interested in profits than 
in passenger safety are not ignoring minimum safety rules.
<P>
	The motions in Group No. 2 we are debating today are about the 
distribution of Nav Canada's notices concerning its decisions on 
airport facility closures. Bill C-20 states that these notices should 
be sent to local newspapers and band councils by mail or 
electronically. It is true that this is the age of the information 
highway, but is it reasonable to choose one way or the other? We 
believe not.
<P>
	The motions presented by the Bloc Quebecois, only 18 motions 
concerning six clauses or three motions per clause on average, are 
mainly intended to change this so that notices are sent both by 
regular mail and the more modern medium, e-mail. As members 
know perfectly well, not everyone has access to e-mail and it is of 
capital importance that all those concerned, all the groups that 
could be affected by a Nav Canada decision to reduce or close 
airport facilities, receive an advance notice early enough to be able 
to take action.
<P>
	That is simple respect for users. The fact that air service is 
privatized does not mean that this service should be less accessible. 
Services must be maintained, particularly in remote regions where 
news information is sometimes harder to get and less timely. God 
knows there are many remote regions in this huge territory that is 
Canada. The people who live there are entitled to a quality service.
<P>
	My colleague from Abitibi gave a very good description of the 
concerns of remote regions as regards air service, which is very 
often an essential service in cases of medical emergencies or other 
such problems. Privatization does not mean the government can 
forget its obligations in matters of aviation safety and air services 
that must be provided to Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1010)</B>
<P>
	The government cannot do what it did so blithely with ADM, 
saying it had no say in the closing of Mirabel because it was a 
private sector issue. It can try to hide behind a private corporation, 
but Quebecers and Canadians will not admit that. On the contrary, 
when the government adopts such an attitude, Canada and Quebec 
reject it.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2928"> 2928 </A></B>
<P>
	If privatization is necessary to reduce costs, very well, but it 
must not be done at the expense of services to users. They must 
not do it for the sole purpose of reducing the deficit and, at the 
same time, transfer costs to the taxpayers. It seems this 
government has developed that habit, but you can be sure the 
official opposition will be there to remind members of the 
government that we find it totally unacceptable.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to join in this debate, at second reading, on 
Bill C-20, an act respecting the commercialization of civil air 
navigation services.
<P>
	As my colleague, the member for Louis-Hébert, said in this 
House on Wednesday May 15, when the former Minister of 
Transport, now Minister of Human Resources Development, first 
announced the policy on commercializing airports and air 
navigation, in July 1994, the Bloc Quebecois agreed with the 
principle.
<P>
	Since then, we have been thinking long and hard about how the 
principle is to be applied. The creation of Nav Canada, a non-profit 
organization providing a public service, is aimed necessarily at 
being cost-effective. This corporation bears a striking resemblance 
to ADM, Aéroports de Montréal, the corporation managing 
Montreal airports, airports being plural, of course. It is not for 
profit and has no capital stock.
<P>
	On August 1, 1992, ADM signed a lease with Transport Canada 
giving it the mandate to manage, run and develop Dorval and 
Mirabel airports. ADM is headed by a board of seven directors 
representing businesses in metropolitan Montreal, and by a CEO 
appointed by seven agencies making up SOPRAM, the body 
responsible for promoting Montreal airports.
<P>
	Even though I am not a member of the Standing Committee on 
Transport, I have a particular interest in Bill C-20 as the Lachute 
municipal airport and Mirabel airport are located in my riding of 
Argenteuil-Papineau. Both airports, together with about 600 
airports across Canada, are affected by Bill C-20.
<P>
	Before I continue, I would like to give a brief history of Lachute 
airport. It was built in 1950 by Ayers Limited and acquired by the 
City of Lachute in 1973. Considering the enthusiasm of the local 
population and private companies for the municipal airport of 
Lachute, it was decided to proceed with a study on development of 
the airport with a view to attracting companies in the aviation 
sector, without taking anything away from the recreational aspects 
of the airport.
<P>
	Improvement work was started in the Fall of 1992, with the help 
of a federal contribution from the Financial Assistance Program for 
Local and Commercials Airports at Transport Canada. Today, 
Lachute airport, with 200 acres of industrial and commercial land, 
close to Dorval and Mirabel airports, is a major drawing card for 
the  region. The amendments that the Bloc Quebecois proposed 
would protect taxpayers and air carriers.
<P>
	The first motion of the Bloc Quebecois is very important. It 
would add to the preamble of Bill C-20 that the safety of 
passengers, personnel, air carriers and the public take precedence 
over all other considerations in the business decisions taken by Nav 
Canada. It is essential that safety and the interests of the public 
come before the commercial interests of Nav Canada.
<P>
<B>(1015)</B>
<P>
	Motion no 2, also presented by the Bloc Quebecois, is equally 
important since there are some similarities with ADM, and since 
the board of directors is constituted the same way. Only large 
carriers are represented on the board of Nav Canada. In the case of 
ADM, we now realize that the public has really no voice to choose 
representatives to protect its interests.
<P>
	For these two companies, only business interests counts. And 
what about these political appointments that certainly do not 
necessarily ensure the interests of taxpayers and air carriers, 
especially small carriers?
<P>
	The federal government is transferring to local authorities 
responsability for the management and operation of airports. There 
must therefore be close and increased monitoring to prevent abuse. 
Bill C-20 must not be passed without including the amendments 
proposed by the Bloc Quebecois, amendments that will ensure a 
minimum of protection for the public and air carriers.
<P>
	With my colleagues from the Lower Laurentians, the hon. 
members for Blainville-Deux-Montagnes and Laurentides, the 
mayor of Mirabel and many other stakeholders, I personally 
intervened in the issue involving the transfer of flights from 
Mirabel airport to Dorval. I can assure you that ADM had no 
scruples making decisions without public consultation.
<P>
	Indeed, a public hearing request was made repeatedly by local 
representatives and others, a request that was supported by 
Quebec's transportation minister, Jacques Brassard. The answer 
was shocking: ADM gave a one-month deadline, without going 
over the decision taken a long time before.
<P>
	This brings me directly to motions No. 25 and 26, which would 
delete clause 96.1 and add Nav Canada to the list of institutions in 
the act. The Bloc Quebecois categorically opposes Motion No. 25, 
which attacks the very foundation of transparency. The federal 
government would be well advised to exempt Nav Canada from the 
Privacy Act. As in the case of ADM, the public would be unable to 
be informed of major information regarding them.
<P>
	I myself recently asked for the reports on which ADM based its 
decisions regarding the transfer of flights from Mirabel to Dorval. 
ADM told me flat out that, as a  protected corporation, it was under 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2929"> 2929 </A></B>
<P>
no obligation to provide me with the studies or reports, just as 
Nav Canada will be protected by the government's proposed 
amendment.
<P>
	Taxpayers' representatives then commissioned an economic 
study on Dorval and Mirabel airports. This study, which was done 
by Professor Yvon Bigras, from the Université du Québec à 
Trois-Rivières; Professor Robert Gagné, from the École des hautes 
études commerciales; and Professor Jacques Roy, from the 
Université du Québec à Montréal, was in complete contradiction 
with ADM's arguments for consolidating flights at Dorval. The 
public could read this report, but not some of the studies allegedly 
done by ADM.
<P>
	This report scientifically outlines the myriad disadvantages of 
consolidating flights at Dorval. All the measures to be 
implemented were estimated at $643 million by ADM in 1993. 
Moreover, compensating Mirabel's current franchisees would cost 
some $80 million. The transfer of flights to Dorval raises the 
problem of noise with the resulting operational restrictions.
<P>
<B>(1020)</B>
<P>
	This report shows that the advantage of concentrating flights at 
Mirabel lies in the airport's quasi-unlimited ultimate capacity and 
few noise restrictions. ADM even admitted that, in any case, flights 
will have to be consolidated at Mirabel within 10 to 15 years 
because of Dorval's limited capacity.
<P>
	What will be the fate of regional airports, which will have to pay 
charges without having a say in this?
<P>
	This brings me to Motion No. 15 put forward by the Bloc 
Quebecois, whose purpose is to ensure that aircraft belonging to 
DND or to a national government are not exempted from paying 
charges. In the opinion of the Bloc Quebecois, if clause 32(2) is not 
amended, it will, once again, hide DND's spending. The Bloc 
Quebecois has always been in favour of reducing defence spending. 
The bill would force taxpayers and carriers to pay DND's charges.
<P>
	In conclusion, I urge the government to join us in protecting 
taxpayers and carriers.

	<B>The Speaker:</B> I have the honour to inform the House that a 
message has been received from the Senate informing this House 
that the Senate has passed Bill C-275, an act establishing the 
Canadian Association of Former Parliamentarians, with 
amendments.
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CIVILAIRNAVIGATIONSERVICESCOMMERCIALIZATIONACT">CIVIL AIR NAVIGATION SERVICES 
COMMERCIALIZATION ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed consideration of Bill C-20, an act respecting 
the commercialization of civil air navigation services.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I rise in this House at 
report stage to speak on Bill C-20 respecting, as mentioned 
previously, the commercialization of civil air navigation services.
<P>
	The purpose of this bill is to privatize air navigation services 
across the country through the establishment of Nav Canada, also 
called NAVCAN. This is a name worth repeating a few times so 
that the public will get used to it, because it may well become 
infamous for the problems it will create.
<P>
	This corporation will be responsible for supervising air 
navigation services throughout Canada. As someone already 
pointed out, this kind of organization is being established as part of 
an overall Transport Canada strategy to modernize transportation 
services across the country.
<P>
	Under this strategy, the government has already privatized CN, 
recently commercialized some services provided by the Canadian 
Coast Guard and is currently contemplating the possibility of 
commercializing the operation of the St. Lawrence seaway.
<P>
	Canada is selling off its ports, airports, railway lines, railway 
cars and even bridges. This is like some kind of huge liquidation 
sale. The sale of bridges, and the Quebec bridge in particular, will 
obviously give rise to untold difficulties, since whoever buys the 
bridge in Quebec City will not have to take on the obligations the 
government had regarding the bridge. In fact, the government has 
gone into business.
<P>
	Today, it is civil air navigation services that are being 
commercialized. The federal government tells us that we must 
agree in principle with improved efficiency and lower prices. The 
federal government's real motivation in creating Nav Canada is 
quite obvious. Its main concern is really to make air navigation 
services cost-effective-or so it says-at the expense of safety and 
regional development.
<P>
	The former Minister of Transport himself has admitted that the 
government can no longer afford the cost of maintaining adequate 
air navigation services. We must therefore ask ourselves if the new 
corporation will be able to do any better. Several of the 
stakeholders who spoke on this issue expressed their concern about 
the possible costs of the new system and their impact on charges 
paid by users of air navigation services.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2930"> 2930 </A></B>
<P>
	Only large carriers will have a representative on the board of 
directors of the new corporation known as Nav Canada. Regional 
air transportation associations and companies will not be 
represented.
<P>
<B>(1025)</B>
<P>
	We know that, for a long time, in Quebec as well as in other 
provinces, the government has been asked to decentralize its 
operations so that local residents, who are familiar with local 
conditions, can have a say in something affecting their community. 
Again, in this bill we see an excessive centralization that will result 
in large carriers being the only ones to be heard.
<P>
	Thus, regional air transportation associations and companies 
will not be represented. Large carriers are being given an advantage 
over small ones, especially as far as passenger fees are concerned. 
This aspect must be followed very closely, and we will do so as this 
bill progresses.
<P>
	My colleagues and I are worried about the impacts of Bill C-20 
in this regard. That is why we are proposing to add to the preamble 
a note indicating that Nav Canada must agree to maintain equal 
opportunities for small and large carriers in setting all charges.
<P>
	This way, we will ensure small carriers a certain degree of 
fairness in this regard, and we know how important this is. Usually, 
large companies always end up deciding on everything, and 
everybody abides by their decisions. Nav Canada is meant to be a 
non-profit corporation with a mandate to manage public interests, 
and as my hon. colleague was saying a moment ago, we can draw a 
comparison with Montreal, where private companies will 
determine the future of Montreal airports without involving 
anybody else, without holding any public hearings, without making 
any studies available. The government is about to do something 
similar with this bill and the establishment of Nav Canada.
<P>
	This creates a risk for users and the general public, since Nav 
Canada will hold a monopoly over air navigation services in 
Canada. The corporation will impose user fees and will have 
absolute control over the tariff structure. We want to make sure that 
Nav Canada's financial interests do not take precedence over the 
public interest. This is why the Bloc Quebecois motion seeks to 
include, in the preamble of the bill, a recognition that the safety of 
passengers, personnel, air carriers and the public has priority over 
all other considerations in the decisions taken by Nav Canada.
<P>
	The first motion in the first group aims to have the government 
and Nav Canada recognize that public safety and interest take 
precedence over Nav Canada's financial interests. We have to 
ensure that someone is still accountable for safety standards, which 
must always remain the top priority. The government would be 
ill-advised to oppose the motion, since the minister sponsoring the 
bill said, in a speech, that Transport  Canada's top priority is to 
maintain and, whenever possible, to improve the safety and 
security of Canadians.
<P>
	The government can really not vote against a motion confirming 
such priority in the bill, since the minister himself alluded to it. I do 
hope government members will support the statements made by 
one of their ministers, even though what we saw and heard in recent 
weeks might lead us to think otherwise. Indeed, as recently as 
yesterday, the government did not even support a declaration made 
not too long ago by its Prime Minister, in some kind of 
autobiography, not posthumous of course.
<P>
	The third motion in the first group seeks to add to the preamble a 
mention that Nav Canada recognizes that ``Canada is a country 
where air services to northern and remote regions is essential''. The 
purpose of this motion is to establish a basis for interpretation. 
Again, I do not see how government members could oppose the 
motion. We want to make sure that regional services will 
effectively be provided, particularly in remote regions.
<P>
	This parameter will serve as a basis for interpretation by 
stressing that one of Nav Canada's fundamental objectives is to 
provide services to the regions. The idea is to make sure that large 
carriers do not impose their rules on smaller ones, without regard 
for regional markets and needs. Co-operation and understanding 
are essential between all carriers, large and small.
<P>
<B>(1030)</B>
<P>
	As you can see, the first group of motions includes three motions 
that would fit into the preamble in order to recognize the legitimate 
rights and responsibilities that Nav Canada should always respect.
<P>
	What these motions propose is, roughly, that the government and 
the new corporation recognize that the safety of passengers is one 
of the most important concerns and must take have paramountcy 
over all other considerations, including the financial interests of 
large carriers and the new corporation. I would like to mention, not 
as a vision of doom nor as something that could happen-because I 
hope it will never happen-the plane crash that happened recently 
in the United States, in the Florida Everglades.
<P>
	The possibility was clearly raised on television, at least 
according to some comments I heard, that the accident could be 
related to the financial problems suffered by the airline, which 
would appear to have great difficulty in performing the technical 
checks needed to ensure the full safety of its passengers. This is 
currently under investigation in the United States.
<P>
	I mention this case to ensure that we do everything to prevent 
such an occurrence here. As we know, this country's two largest air 
carriers have financial problems. And we do not want them to take 
advantage of the establishment of this new corporation to bail 
themselves out by increasing rates, for example, which would  
immediately impact negatively on small regional carriers. We do 
not want to find ourselves once again in the situation where the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2931"> 2931 </A></B>
<P>
little guy is made to pay for the big guy. This seems to have become 
the rule nowadays.
<P>
	We only have to think of what the Auditor General of Canada 
just told us. Large family trusts have no problem because, through 
nebulous rulings made behind closed doors, and often in matters 
that could be judicially examined, they can transfer billions of 
dollars out of Canada without paying taxes. When you are big, 
there is no problem doing that. We are even setting precedents that 
will allow all the others to do the same afterwards.
<P>
	Last week, the <I>Financial Post</I> quoted Revenue Canada 
documents to the effect that over $60 billion in assets were taken 
out of Canada in 1991 without any tax being paid. It is obvious that 
big shots in Canada have no trouble whatsoever making their sweet 
little deals. Included in those big shots were most Canadian banks 
who advertise on television and tell us how much they care about 
the public's interest. What we would not like to see happen with 
this bill is big companies ending up with an advantage over the 
small ones.
<P>
	In conclusion, there is no reason why the government should 
oppose these motions, especially those in the first group, since they 
are a mere confirmation of principles the government itself has 
applied repeatedly. All we want is to see these principles clearly 
entrenched in the bill and included in the preamble.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am very pleased this morning to have the opportunity to 
take part in debate at second reading stage of Bill C-20, an 
important piece of legislation to privatize Canadian airports.
<P>
	As my colleague from Laval Centre mentioned earlier, the Bloc 
Quebecois is not against any privatization initiative that could 
improve the efficiency of airport management throughout the 
country. However, there is privatization and privatization. When 
privatization leads to security problems, as we saw recently in the 
United States when a ValuJet airplane crashed, then the Bloc 
Quebecois cannot give its assent. Also, when basic principles such 
as fairness and transparency are set aside, then again the Bloc 
cannot give its assent.
<P>
	In the bill before us, two basic principles are violated. First, the 
local communities are not treated fairly. As for respect for the local 
communities, nothing in this bill leads us to believe that regional 
and local communities will have their say in the privatization 
process and the management of the airports in Canada, or will 
receive the information they need and be treated fairly and 
respectfully for what they are.
<P>
<B>(1035)</B>
<P>
	It is not surprising that this bill shows no concern for local 
communities. The former Minister of Transportation, now Minister 
of Human Resources  Development, reacted the same way when 
the issue of unemployment insurance reform was addressed 
recently. He showed that he did not care about some local 
communities who depend on seasonal work, by overlooking the 
many concerns expressed by people from his own riding, people 
who live in these communities, who know them well, who are able 
to assess the bad decisions made by the government and the real 
negative impact they have on the local economies.
<P>
	It does not surprise me that Bill C-20 reflects a lack of concern 
for local communities and that the government has turned a deaf 
ear to our numerous requests in this regard.
<P>
	Such a bill should not only aim to ensure, directly in the mandate 
of this new organization created by the federal government-Nav 
Canada-air transportation in remote areas, for example, but also 
to advise local communities, which are the first concerned and the 
main clients of the air carriers, of any change in services-rates, 
frequency, schedules, etc.-and in air transportation equipment or 
infrastructure.
<P>
	The bill is rather deficient as far as information to be provided to 
local people is concerned, since, according to the government, one 
notice only in a national newspaper like the <I>Globe and Mail</I> or <I>Le 
Devoir</I>, for example, should do. Thus, this group of motions, that 
is, motions Nos 4 to 12, aims essentially at ensuring one thing: 
information.
<P>
	It is not normal that people living close to the airport in 
Mont-Joli, for example, should be informed in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> 
of changes that concern them. The normal and respectable thing to 
do would be to publish these notices of changes in the Mont-Joli 
local newspapers. <I>Le Devoir</I> would not be the normal vehicle for 
such a notice on the North Shore, since this newspaper is not that 
easy to find in that area.
<P>
	Local communities should have a guarantee that they will 
receive notice directly, through their local media, of changes in the 
frequency of service, in the schedules, etc., or of more substantive 
chaanges such as the reduction of some services or even the closure 
of some airports. The same holds true for Native bands. It is not 
always easy to reach them, even through the local media. The band 
councils must be informed of the changes regarding local airports.
<P>
	Today, information is not only a privilege, it is also a basic right, 
all the more so since the communities that will be the first affected 
by the changes made by Nav Canada are the local ones. It will not 
be the communities in major centres, where there is a larger density 
and frequency of services. This then becomes a necessity.
<P>
	In this respect, let me praise the member for 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup for being sensitive to these issues, 
that is to say for insisting on service, respect and fairness for local 
communities. As you may know,  our colleague, the member for 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, is also the official Bloc Quebecois 
spokesman for a major organization in Quebec called Solidarité 
rurale, and I think it is much to his credit to have succeeded in 
making our party, our 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2932"> 2932 </A></B>
<P>
caucus and our members more aware of the needs of local 
communities and of the respect we owe them.
<P>
<B>(1040)</B>
<P>
	It is more and more obvious that this government wants to carry 
out all its reforms by betraying the very principles it says it wants 
to protect. In the red book or the speech from the throne, much is 
made of respect for people, for rural communities and the people's 
decisions. But this government's actions give a completely 
different picture.
<P>
	I was listening to the Minister of National Revenue who 
displayed such compassion for Canada's richest families. She said 
that there should more of them. In other words, she supported her 
department's decision, which allowed the transfer of $2 billion 
worth of assets in the United States absolutely tax free, without one 
cent of tax being paid on capital gains. She displayed a lot 
compassion for those families.
<P>
	If her government displayed the same compassion for local 
communities and the needy, we would be one hundred per cent 
behind the government, but the fact is that there is an almost 
insurmountable chasm between what the government says and 
what it does.
<P>
	Out of respect for local communities, for the human beings who 
live in these regions and who are the victims of the government's 
carelessness or of the cruel and inhuman decisions of the Minister 
of Human Resources Development concerning unemployment 
insurance, maybe we should, for once, be taking measures which 
favour them; in other words, we should give them an inalienable 
right to information when it comes to an important project such as 
the privatization of airports.
<P>
	So this is the meaning of the motions moved by the Bloc 
Quebecois, and it can seem strange for people who live in Ottawa, 
Toronto, Montréal, Québec, Winnipeg, Calgary, etc., to call for 
these notices to be given in the local media, but for the people 
concerned, it makes all the difference between the pride of being 
who they are and the respect due them by government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, to give the context of the series of changes proposed by 
the Bloc Quebecois and included in the second group of 
amendments, it must be pointed out that the objective of the bill is 
to commercialize the air navigation services, which is to say to 
transfer to a not for profit organization a service that had been up to 
now in the public domain.
<P>
	As I said in my speech on the first group of amendments, that is 
something that could be interesting and commendable but only if 
we can guarantee the  population that the security and safety level 
of the services will be maintained and that it will have its say at the 
regional level on all decisions having a major impact on the local 
economy.
<P>
	For that reason I would like to correct an impression left by the 
parliamentary secretary on May 15, when he said that our motions 
contained errors because we were not referring to the right clause. 
This is not the case because, as we also said in committee, we want 
to ensure that information is made available not only on the 
formula for calculating the fees, but also on the services because, in 
isolated areas, services are as important as fees.
<P>
	If decisions taken by Nav Canada have the effect of depriving 
airports of safety equipment and have an impact on the volume of 
local air traffic, we must ensure that the local population has its 
say. That is the reasoning behind our amendments. If we want 
regions to have their say, they must be informed of the decisions.
<P>
	We want to give people the opportunity to send their comments 
by traditional or electronic mail and ensure that they will be 
informed of all planned changes.
<P>
	We added special consideration for the native band councils 
because, due to their particular situation, the traditional media are 
not necessarily the best means to reach them. We must ensure that 
they are well informed also. I think that, considering the special 
interest of the government for the natives, it should accept our 
amendment to guarantee appropriate coverage.
<P>
<B>(1045)</B>
<P>
	An airport is vital to a remote area, to an isolated area, because if 
often has a strong impact on the region. Let us take, for example, 
the Mont-Joli airport, in eastern Quebec. It is obvious that any 
decisions made with regard to aviation safety at this airport will 
likely have an impact on the activity at this airport.
<P>
	We want people from the regional county municipality, people 
from Mont-Joli, all stakeholders in the tourist industry and other 
industries to have their say in any decisions that will have an 
impact on safety at the airport and that could ultimately have an 
impact on the economic activity around the airport.
<P>
	That is why we want to ensure that the information is adequate 
and timely so that people can have time to react and make their 
opinions known accordingly.
<P>
	We have a very good example of that in the decision of 
Aéroports de Montréal to possibly transfer international flights 
from Mirabel to Montréal. It is not for me to say here whether this 
decision is good or bad, but I just want to show that this 
organization created by the federal government to manage both 
Montreal airports has changed its position drastically in a relatively 
short period of time. At first, it was saying that both airports could 
survive, that it would share out responsibilities and  transportation 
opportunities between both airports, and that everything should 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2933"> 2933 </A></B>
<P>
work out this way. Now it is saying that it wants to transfer all 
international flights to Dorval.
<P>
	This situation is provoking reactions in the Dorval area because 
people have certain fears in terms of safety. We saw it again today 
in the newspapers. There is even talk of taking this matter to court. 
So would it not be preferable for the consultation mechanisms 
allowing people to voice their opposition and express their views to 
be provided for in the bill that creates Nav Canada, the organization 
which will be responsible for air traffic control, instead of ending 
up with very expensive legal battles in which economic decisions 
will be challenged?
<P>
	I take this opportunity to urge the government once again to take 
its responsibilities in this matter and also to make the comparison 
with the bill before us today. If we have an example like the one 
concerning ADM, because there is an unwillingness to let people 
have their say about the future of their airport, the future of air 
navigation in their region, is there not a risk that, in the years to 
come, there will arise two, three, five, ten problems of the same 
sort as we are seeing in Montreal, with negative reactions from 
local communities, who are forced to take a very vocal approach or 
go through the legal system in order to make their views known.
<P>
	This is the reasoning behind our amendments today in Group No. 
2. We want to ensure that people living in the Northwest 
Territories, in northern Quebec, as well as in large centres, because 
there are decisions about large airports that affect urban 
populations, have a say. When an airport has a lot of traffic, take 
Pearson in Toronto, it is certain that there are decisions that, in the 
medium term, have an impact on all economic development in a 
region, and it would be very appropriate if, before decisions about 
safety equipment in these airports were taken, the people in the 
surrounding areas were heard from.
<P>
	That brings me back to the safety aspect. Last week, there was a 
very unfortunate plane crash in southern Florida in the United 
States, pointing up just how important the question of air 
navigation is. No margin of error is acceptable in this sector. It is a 
sector where guarantees of safety with respect to decisions taken 
are essential, and if accidents happen, that they be truly 
unforeseeable and not in any way due to decisions made either by 
the government or by the new agency known as Nav Canada.
<P>
	Imagine what we could have in a few years' time, if there were a 
similar accident here and Nav Canada officials refused to accept 
any responsibility, saying: ``The legislation did not oblige us to 
have safety take precedence over our economic commitments. In 
the case of the airport where the accident took place, we did 
everything we were required to do. We did not necessarily buy the 
latest equipment it would have taken,  or put in place all the 
required safety measures, but it was not in our mandate''.
<P>
<B>(1050)</B>
<P>
	There would be costs in terms of human lives and of equipment, 
and no way of ascribing the blame to anyone. It is important that 
the bill provide some balance.
<P>
	Originally, the costs of air navigation were extremely high. Steps 
were taken in conjunction with the industry and most of the 
stakeholders, although the small carriers were not given enough of 
a say, with a view to ensuring lower and more acceptable costs.
<P>
	The bill fails to make safety paramount, and also to ensure that 
decisions will not have a negative economic impact on the regions. 
The approach to this matter, as in a number of other current 
government bills, is to make things uniform across Canada. This is 
a trend which, in my opinion, ought to be resisted, and I think this 
is important.
<P>
	We have proposed a preamble, a sort of interpretive clause, to 
restrict somewhat the considerable leeway afforded to Nav Canada, 
and to require that it take the elements referred to into 
consideration.
<P>
	Our amendments on the distribution of information prior to a 
decision and on finding out the regional point of view reflect issues 
of importance to us, and we feel tney would make for a better bill.
<P>
	Government acceptance of the proposed amendments would 
provide the satisfactory balance the bill lacks at this time. We are 
making a transition from a very costly system to one where the 
costs will be well controlled. Let us ensure that passenger safety 
will be guaranteed. This is the purpose of our amendments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish 
to express my thanks to my colleagues who spoke on the motions in 
Group No. 2, namely: the member for Laval-Centre, the member 
for Anjou-Rivières-des-Prairies, the member for 
Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot and the member for 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup.
<P>
	Why? Because those members spoke on a fairly important group 
of motions. I take this opportunity to say that I am somewhat 
concerned by the lack of interest hon. members from the other 
parties seem to have for this very important group of amendments 
on which I will speak in a moment.
<P>
	Those amendments do not seem to raise much interest in Reform 
and Liberal ranks and this concerns me. As I said, I will explain 
why in a few seconds.
<P>
	It seems that because these amendment motions were introduced 
by the official opposition they have no merit and are not 
interesting. Actually the reason Liberals have no interest in these 
amendments is that they are not the ones who had the good idea of 
<P>

<B><A NAME="2934"> 2934 </A></B>
<P>
introducing them. This is  why they oppose them and do not even 
bother to discuss them.
<P>
	As my colleagues did this morning, I must emphasize that the 
Bloc Quebecois is not opposed to the principle of privatizing air 
navigation services. It does not oppose privatization if that will 
help these services to become viable to some degree.
<P>
	What we are troubled by are the precedents. My colleague from 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup referred to the case of ADM, the 
acronym for Aéroports de Montréal. I do not wish to take sides in 
the debate on Mirabel or Dorval or on the timeliness of privatizing 
Mirabel or Dorval or not, but I must say that this government, on 
the pretence of making the industry aware of its responsibilities, 
uses privatization as a means to shirk its own responsibilities.
<P>
<B>(1055)</B>
<P>
	The other day we saw the minister wriggle shamefully out of 
answering opposition questions by saying: ``That is not the 
responsibility of the Minister of Transport. It does not come under 
the authority of the federal government, but rather under the 
authority of the ADM. We no longer have any say in this''.
<P>
	It is totally unacceptable to have the government, under entirely 
creditable and honourable guise, trying to wriggle out, to take 
French leave, to avoid making a decision when one needs to be 
made.
<P>
	Still on the subject of the ADM, we should note that this sort of 
privatization suffers from a certain lack of transparency. Decisions 
can be made without public consultation; decisions can be made 
without an environmental impact study. When studies are done, as 
was the case apparently in the ADM decision, the public does not 
have access to the impact studies, since these corporations are not 
subject to the Freedom of Information Act.
<P>
	Finally, here I am at the main point of my 
remarks-information. Information, according to René Lévesque, 
means freedom. The purpose of the motions in group No. 2 is to 
provide better public information.
<P>
	No one in this House will argue against, at least I hope they 
would not, the importance of airport facilities for local 
communities in the regions. In my riding, at 
Saint-Mathieu-de-Beloeil, there is a tiny regional airport, which is 
very important to Saint-Mathieu-de-Beloeil and of course to the 
neighbouring communities as well. The same is true in the ridings 
of my colleagues in the Bloc Quebecois and in other parties: 
regional airports are very important.
<P>
	Given the importance of airport facilities to these local 
communities, it is essential we provide proper information on 
decisions that have been made, particularly if a decision has been 
made to close an airport facility. So as my colleague for  
Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot rightly said a few minutes ago, we cannot 
count on people in the regions being necessarily informed by the 
dailies-and I am thinking of the people in Mont-Joli-such as the 
<I>Globe and Mail</I> or the <I>Toronto Star</I>. We have to be able to inform 
them directly through the local media.
<P>
	It is not utterly silly to claim that it is important to include in this 
bill a clause forcing the government to inform the public, through 
the local and regional media, about the major impact of decisions 
by Nav Canada.
<P>
	Obviously, it is also important to inform native bands that would 
be affected by Nav Canada's decisions to close airport facilities.
<P>
	I will conclude by saying a few words concerning the use of the 
information highway to inform interested parties about Nav 
Canada's decisions to close airport facilities.
<P>
	As an example, I will tell you about a discussion I had with the 
Minister of Foreign Affairs. It will not take too long. The minister 
told us that he wanted to consult Canadians through electronic 
mail. That is good, but not all our fellow citizens have access to 
these services yet. Therefore, other means, include the good old 
fashioned postal service, must also be used to consult the public.
<P>

<P>
	Recently Canada's quilters proclaimed the month of May as 
national quilters month. I believe these talented artisans deserve 
the recognition. For years quilts have been an important part of the 
fabric of rural life. In a  larger sense quilts are a mirror reflection of 
the lives of all Canadians.
<P>
	In the same fashion as our country was formed, quilts were built 
with hard work, perseverance and dedication. While each 
individual part in its own way is unique, together the individual 
parts form a cohesive unit, a true piece of art.

sacrifice exhibited by our police officers as they carry out their 
duties, often under unpleasant or adverse circumstances.
<P>
	This year's theme of police in the community promotes the links 
between Canada's police forces, large and small, with the

record tremendous success in the war against crime and community 
security. An ounce of crime prevention is worth countless pounds

Niagara Regional Police Service, the Ontario Provincial Police and 
the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, all of whom serve with 
distinction in various capacities in Erie riding.

where she was raped by the 11-year old. This horrendous act of

country, especially in light of the 1995 referendum.

student at the aerospace trades school in Montreal, who, on May 5, 
at the Palais des congrès de Montréal, earned the gold medal award

exceptional partnership with the industry, the school offers 
specialized training in the aerospace and aeronautical sector.

accomplishment, thus underlining the key role played by 
vocational schools in producing skilled manpower able to meet the 
needs of an ever-changing economy.

	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of National Revenue.
<P>
	While the minister is busy complaining that there are not enough 
rich families and refuses to suspend the decision of Revenue 
Canada on taxing capital gains, the precedent set by this decision 
could mean the loss of several hundreds of millions of dollars in 
Canadian tax revenues, thus putting more pressure on taxpayers.
<P>
	Is the minister of revenue in her job only to serve the very rich 
families in Canada, or is it her responsibility to defend the interests 
of all Quebecers and all Canadians, particularly the most 
disadvantaged?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my mandate is to ensure the tax system is fair and 
equitable to all. The interesting result of the conversations in the 
House and in the popular press is there needs to be more 
information on how tax rulings work in our system, on how taxable 
Canadian property is interpreted and used. The best venue for that 
is a public domain like the finance committee.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday her colleague from Brome-Missiquoi said on 
television that people expected the government to act.
<P>
	So when will the minister suspend the decision of Revenue 
Canada until we find a permanent solution to this thorny problem?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we are taking direct action. Our view, the best view, is to 
ensure Canadians have an opportunity to hear all aspects of this 
case, decisions on which were made in 1991 and 1985. We are 
taking direct and urgent action. We encourage the committees to 
carry on with their work.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the minister must understand that she ought to suspend the 
decision by Revenue Canada. Otherwise, by refusing to act quickly 
in this matter she becomes an accomplice in tax evasion worth 
several hundreds of millions of dollars annually, which all come 
out of the pockets of Canadians, because the rich will have taken 
their money elsewhere.

<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am not refusing to do anything. It is very important for 
the community to understand how tax rulings play a significant role 
in our tax system and the underpinning they provide to Canadian 
taxpayers. Our tax system is very complex. Very often individuals 
need an advance ruling from Revenue Canada. That forms the basis 
of a fair and equitable process.
<P>
	These things will be discussed fully and openly in committee. I 
encourage the hon. member to ensure her members are part of that 
review.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
complexity is not a reason not to act. If she thinks it is, let her step 
aside for someone more competent, who can handle it.
<P>
	Yesterday, the minister of revenue stated in this House, in 
connection with tax loopholes, that she was acting ``in a very 
public way'', with complete transparency. She also repeated for the 
gullible that she was serving and defending the public interest.
<P>
<B>(1120)</B>
<P>
	To what public interest was she referring, that of very rich 
Canadian families, or that of the many Quebecers and Canadians 
who are being crushed by a tax burden which is constantly 
increasing because of her government's inaction?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as I said at the outset, my job is to ensure fairness and 
equity for all Canadians.
<P>
	As the hon. member participates in these open reviews, and I 
understand he is a member of the finance committee, he will come 
to understand that this aspect of the law does have implications not 
only for rich Canadians but also for Canadians of more modest 
means.
<P>
	I look forward to his response and the report. I encourage him to 
continue his participation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
auditor general, who is responsible for monitoring government 
actions, has said that a Revenue Canada decision will result in the 
loss of hundreds of millions of dollars in the future.
<P>
	Would acting in the public interest not mean suspending 
Revenue Canada's advance decision, revealing the other cases that 
may have come up since the decision, and putting in place a 
permanent solution to this problem?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as the hon. member participates in the process where there 
is full co-operation and officials from my department and finance 
providing advice, outside witnesses perhaps coming to explain the 
position as well as chartered accountants who are Canadians and 
understand the system and perhaps individual Canadians, we will 
have clarity on this topic.
<P>
	I continue to believe that having the discussion in an open forum 
where members of Parliament can listen to witnesses and experts 
and then provide advice to the government makes the most sense in 
this case.

	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, recently we 
have learned that a 13-year old girl in Toronto was abducted and 
raped by a so-called untouchable, an 11-year old who cannot be 
charged under the Young Offenders Act.
<P>
	This 11-year old has a string of robberies under his belt but all 
the police could do was hand him over to his mother. What is more, 
this child criminal was well aware that he could not be charged and 
taunted police with the fact when he was picked up.
<P>
	Will the government now listen to police officers and victims 
groups as well as members of my caucus and lower the minimum 
age under the Young Offenders Act to include 10 and 11-year olds?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as 
the hon. member is aware, the federal government has already 
enacted changes to the Young Offenders Act to stiffen up the 
penalties for the most serious crimes.
<P>
	As the hon. member is also aware, the Minister of Justice has 
asked the justice committee to go across the country and gather 
input specifically looking at further changes to the Young 
Offenders Act. Very specifically, the minister has asked that the 
committee look at the age at which a young person could be made 
subject to the act. The committee will be reporting and we will be 
responding to that report.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, during the 
latest amendment to the Young Offenders Act, members of our 
caucus pressed the government to look into this very question and 
include that within Bill C-37 as an amendment so that society could 
be protected from the criminal acts committed by 10 and 11-year 
olds across the country.
<P>
	After apprehending the 11-year old repeat offender responsible 
for this vicious rape, Toronto police detective Duncan Miller said: 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2940"> 2940 </A></B>
<P>
``He is using the Young Offenders  Act to protect himself from the 
law. He is fully aware of his rights''. The 11-year old offender 
warned police that he could not be charged.
<P>
	My question is for the justice minister's representative. Why 
will he not protect our children from these horrible acts? Why will 
he not unhandcuff our police forces and provide them with the legal 
means to protect our children from these horrible criminal acts? 
When will he stop providing the immunity to these violent young 
offenders?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
reiterate that the justice committee will be making 
recommendations on this very specific point.
<P>
	No matter at what age the line is drawn, cases will always appear 
that would suggest the line should be drawn somewhere else. As all 
the evidence and studies indicate, there needs to be more action 
taken by the provinces, communities and individuals across the 
country to assist young people before they get into trouble with the 
criminal justice system. An ounce of prevention is certainly worth 
a pound of cure.
<P>
<B>(1125 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
absolutely unacceptable that people can knowingly commit crimes 
of violence and not be held accountable by our justice system.
<P>
	Federal justice officials maintain that treatment and community 
programs, not prison, is the best way to reform child criminals.
<P>
	Let us take a look at this 11-year old rapist. He has a thick police 
file and is believed to be responsible for a string of auto thefts and 
robberies. One week before he raped the young girl he was caught 
trying to hold up a gas station with a toy gun. The only thing police 
could do was return him to his mother or place him with the 
Children's Aid Society.
<P>
	I ask the government, where was the treatment or community 
programs the Liberal government likes to talk about? Why will it 
not simply change the system to hold children, and their parents if 
negligent, responsible for the crimes they commit?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as I 
have indicated on a number of occasions, the justice committee is 
looking at the issue. The Minister of Justice has asked the 
committee to look at this very specific issue.
<P>
	After listening to Canadians and stakeholders within the justice 
system from coast to coast, the committee will bring forward a 
report. When the government acts on the report we hope the hon. 
member will support our actions.

	<B>Mr. Paul Mercier (Blainville-Deux-Montagnes, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Acting Prime Minister.
<P>
	The Prime Minister said on several occasions that the next 
Quebec referendum, and the declaration of sovereignty, would 
have to comply with the Constitution. However, the Constitution is 
silent on the issue.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister intend to make a constitutional 
amendment to this effect?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul DeVillers (Parliamentary Secretary to President of 
the Queen's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the government is 
very clear on these issues. Our plan is to promote reconciliation. 
We are trying to avoid another referendum.
<P>
	Any discussion on what will happen if another referendum is 
held is purely academic. The government said in its speech from 
the throne that, as long as the prospect of another Quebec 
referendum exists, the government will exercise its responsibility 
to ensure that the debate is conducted with all the facts on the table, 
that the rules of the process are fair, that the consequences are clear, 
and that Canadians, no matter where they live, will have their say 
in the future of their country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Mercier (Blainville-Deux-Montagnes, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the government seems to have a peculiar notion of clarity.
<P>
	It is getting increasingly bogged down in its clarity. Since the 
Prime Minister refuses to recognize a 50 per cent plus one vote in 
favour of sovereignty, how can the minister claim that the 
federalist status quo side won the 1995 referendum, given that it 
only got 50.4 per cent of the votes?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul DeVillers (Parliamentary Secretary to President of 
the Queen's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member 
refers to the acceptance of a 50 per cent plus one vote. A 
referendum is a consultation process and two have already been 
held in Quebec in the last 15 years. We accepted the results. The 
idea is definitely not to set a specific number. It is clear that the 
rights of 30 million citizens are at stake and that Canada will never 
be broken up by a 50 per cent plus one result.

question is for the Minister of Finance.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2941"> 2941 </A></B>
<P>
	It seems that the sweetheart deals between Liberal governments 
did not end with the GST pay-off. Term 29 of Newfoundland's 
terms of union granted an annual payment of $8 million from the 
federal government. Now we hear that the Liberal government has 
changed the rules and will give a lump sum payment of $160 
million, a windfall, to Mr. Brian Tobin.
<P>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
	Why is the federal government asking Newfoundlanders to pay a 
penalty tomorrow for saving Brian Tobin's career today?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as the hon. member 
knows, the annual payment to Newfoundland is some $8 million a 
year. It is to be made in perpetuity as part of the original 
Constitution.
<P>
	Newfoundland is facing some exceptional and difficult fiscal 
and economic challenges with the fishery and with the phase down 
of Hibernia. It has been requested that the payment be moved 
forward and we have agreed. It covers an advance of some $50 
million this year and further payments later on. It is a fair and 
reasonable substitute for the $8 million statutory requirement.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
paying the money up front today means it will cost Canadians 
hundreds of millions of dollars more over 20 years than it would if 
Newfoundland were receiving $8 million a year. At the same time, 
today's sweetheart deal will deprive future Newfoundland 
governments of that $8 million in yearly income. In other words, 
Brian Tobin is clinging to his credibility by his money grabbing 
fingernails on this issue.
<P>
	Why is the Government of Canada continuing to steal from 
Newfoundlanders and other Canadians today just to pull Brian 
Tobin's fat out of the fire?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the member obviously 
does not understand interest. To think that there would be a 
payment of $160 million up front instead of $8 million a year for 
20 years is entirely wrong. It will be discounted by an appropriate 
interest rate. That is exactly what I meant when I said it was a fair 
and reasonable substitute, with the discounted factor. That is the 
amount we will paying.

	In order to make known their dissatisfaction with the crab

refusing to go back to work. They are  thus protesting the

<P>
	<B>Mr. Mifflin:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have to tell the hon. member, 
notwithstanding the acting lessons, we really need to look at what 
is happening with respect to the crab resource.
<P>
	The plan was devised in such a way as to break down the 16,100 
tonnes between the midshore large crabbers and those many small 
inshore fishermen who need a part of the resource. The distribution 
was fair. It was done by consultation. There was 77.5 per cent given 
to the large midshore crabbers and 22.5 per cent was given to the 
inshore smaller fishermen. This was a justifiable, fair and equitable 
distribution.
<P>
	The idea was that everybody would go fishing at the appropriate 
time. The time has now arrived. I would suggest that all those who 
are interested in the industry release the plant workers and those 
who are innocent in this play. Then everybody can get on with the 
fishing and the resource can be enjoyed by all those who are 
involved in the industry. In particular, the plant workers and all 
communities can benefit from the resource of the ocean.

traditional crabbers and ground fishermen at the present time, this 
is a problem with plant workers.
<P>
	What does the minister intend to do in response to the decision

fishermen, among the plant workers, among the communities, 
among all those who are interested in having a partnership with

take action on loopholes when they become a public issue.

important issues.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
becoming quite clear that there was a secret tax ruling which was in 
favour of some people in a public tax opinion and denied the same 
opportunity to everybody else. We need to get that cleared. We 
want to know why it happened. We want to know why this 
government is standing behind that ruling as it stands today. Why 
will it not close the loophole and act today to prevent this type of 
opportunity from happening at the expense of all Canadians?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):</B> Mr.

remind the minister that the appointment of his special adviser has 
produced little to date.
<P>
	Is the minister telling us that he does not intend to take the 
initiative in this matter preferring to await the outcome of the 
appeal procedure, among other things, and that, in other words, 
regardless of the information he has in hand, he will continue to do 
nothing while Mr. Tran continues to languish in prison?

Representations have been made  by the Prime Minister, the 
Minister of Finance, myself and my predecessor directly to the 
Government of Vietnam.
<P>
	We have provided special provision for consular services. We 
have ensured that Mr. Quan has full access from relatives, friends 
and family. We transmitted all the information we have to the 
people in the government of Vietnam. It is their government, not 
ours, and we have to be able to work with them.
<P>
	That is why I had established the post of special adviser, consular 
matters who takes on these difficult cases and negotiates directly 
with other governments. We do not have the power to tell another 
government what to do. We will do everything possible to ensure 
that Mr. Quan's rights are fully recognized and fully protected, but 
we have to do it within the range of powers and jurisdiction that we 
have.

	I can assures you that we will continue to work actively on this

	<B>Mr. Lawrence D. O'Brien (Labrador, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Transport.
<P>
	With the new mineral exploration in northern Labrador there are 
now as many as 230 air vehicles using the air strip each day. This 
enormous increase in traffic has resulted in three crashes and many 
aborted flights. I have had a close call at Nain when the plane I was 
on nearly went down.
<P>
	Can the minister reassure the people of Nain and Labrador 
generally that measures will be taken without delay to ensure the 
safety of the travelling public?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I welcome the first question by our new colleague, the 
hon. member for Labrador. I thank him for the energy he has 
displayed and the initiative he has taken with this issue, organizing 
as he did in his first weeks in this House meetings with the premier 
of Newfoundland, a senior minister from Newfoundland, myself, 
the Minister of National Defence, the entire municipal council of 
Goose Bay and others.
<P>
	Aviation staff from my department have been monitoring the 
increased aviation traffic around the Nain airport which is a serious 
matter of concern. An aviation safety review team, including 
officials from the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador and 
from my department visited Nain at the end of April.
<P>
	The aviation safety review team is finalizing its report and we 
are confident that working with the province of Newfoundland and 
with the hon. member, we will be able to resolve this issue to 
everyone's satisfaction.

	<B>Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of the Environment.
<P>
	Citizens of Hamilton, Ontario are concerned that their city could 
soon become a main dumping ground for hazardous waste. The 
proposed Taro dump could be home to more than 10 million tonnes 
of industrial waste, not to mention being situated right next to the 
Niagara escarpment, a UN declared biosphere.
<P>
	Can the minister tell us whether a federal environmental 
assessment panel review will be conducted, or does he plan to 
follow the steps of Sheila Copps and sacrifice the good of the 
environment for political reasons?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I suggest that the question has more to do with the 
political reasons of a faltering Reform Party candidate in Hamilton 
than it does with the environmental issues that this member 
pretends to be genuine.
<P>
	I do not need to defend the record of the former and future 
member of Parliament from Hamilton East. She has promoted and 
defended not only the best interests of Hamilton, but the best 
interests of the environment.
<P>
<B>(1145 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Sheila Copps was environment minister and did nothing 
on this issue, even when it affected her own riding.
<P>
	The leachate from the Taro dump will pollute the federal water 
of Lake Ontario. The environment is in danger in the Hamilton area 
all because Sheila Copps repeatedly ignored the concerns of her 
community.
<P>
	Will the minister use his power and commit to launching a full 
environmental assessment of the Taro dump so all sides will be 
allowed real influence rather than just the political insiders of a 
very questionable deal?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I know that the Reform Party candidate fired his campaign 
manager. Maybe he has a new candidate right here because the 
member is only interested in political partisan gain.
<P>
	That is the last thing that Canadian citizens want the 
environment to be. They do not want it to be a volleyball. They do 
not want it to be traded between federal and provincial 
governments. They want it to be respected. They want all levels of 
government to manage the environment in the best interests of 
people today and for those who inherit Canada and the world 
tomorrow.

Meanwhile, there are priority issues that require attention, issues

Yes, Mr. Speaker.

<P>
	The CBC, the NFB and Telefilm Canada are putting high hopes

Mr. Speaker, at present, work on all issues concerning Heritage

Lam put his handgun to the head of detective Peter Leung and

	After serving a two-year sentence, Lam was held in custody by 
immigration. It was trying to deport him back  to Vietnam but 
Vietnam refused to take him. After declaring that it took too long to 
deport Lam, an immigration adjudicator released him. Soon after 
being released, Lam disappeared and is now the subject of a

an adjudicator's decision. As you know, this decision was made by 
a quasi-judicial organization, which is totally independent from the 
Minister of Citizenship and Immigration.
<P>
	I can assure the members of this House that the department is 
doing all it can to deport this individual as soon as possible and in 
accordance with Canadian law.

<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley,

individual is right now.
<P>
	On December 1, 1995 I asked the previous minister of 
immigration about the recently signed agreement with Vietnam 
that would allow for the return of criminal refugees and immigrants 
from that country. At that time, the former minister boasted that the 
agreement would permit the removal of: ``individuals who should 
not have been here in the first place. And that is being done''.

	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and

program in Ontario is a joint federal-provincial initiative. It totals 
about $5.7 million and has been in place since 1994.

	As of March of this year, 88 projects submissions had been

majority of these projects have been associated with commodity

	This conference is the largest in the world. It brings together the 
greatest scientists from every country, community groups and 
people with AIDS. Unlike his predecessor, Brian Mulroney, who 
opened the Montreal Conference in 1992, the Prime Minister has 
casually declined the organizers' invitation.

unacceptable?

	<B>Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of

Prime Minister's commitment to the issue of HIV-AIDS, stands 
without reproach. He knows quite well that the Minister of Health 
will be in attendance. He knows also that the Standing Committee 
on Health has commissioned a subcommittee, of which he is a 
member, to send two members and he is one of the two.
<P>
	He knows also that the Prime Minister's commitment will be 
translated into over $2 million in contributions from five separate 
ministries of the government.
<P>
	That is an indication that the Prime Minister is not only living up 
to the signatory obligations signed in Paris in December 1994, but 
that he is going well beyond it. He knows also that there is one 
other country which comes close, and that is France.

Edmonton women's prison is a well publicized disaster: one inmate 
murdered, one-quarter of the prison population on the escape list, 
and a rash of attempted suicides, all within a few weeks of opening.
<P>
	All the parliamentary secretary to the solicitor general can say is: 
``We believe this model of incarceration represents the best 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2946"> 2946 </A></B>
<P>
approach to addressing a very special need that women have''. God 
help us if this is the best Corrections Canada can do. One thing 
Corrections Canada could do is sell the place to the Holiday Inn 
before it is too late and someone else dies.
<P>
	Is the solicitor general planning to provide room service for the 
remaining inmates or is he going to shut the place down and admit 
that his gender experiment has failed?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am touched by the 
rhetoric that goes on week after week. Shutting the place down will 
not solve the problem.
<P>
	It has to be recognized that female inmates need special 
treatment, which is what has been done. There were two task forces 
in 1989 as well as the Arbour commission which stipulated that 
women's needs in terms of incarceration have to be looked at.
<P>
	I agree the incidents which occurred in Edmonton were sad and 
deplorable. It is an underlying situation which is more 
symptomatic of the special needs of women. Often the histories of 
incarcerated women reveal abuse, for example, in early childhood. 
As a result, we are heeding the recommendation of the task force. 
We are opening five regional centres to better serve their needs.
<P>
	One centre has had problems, while the other two have not. I 
would point that out to the member. Truro and Maple Creek, 
Saskatchewan have not had any problems.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, after 
that reply is it any wonder that Corrections Canada is in such 
disastrous shape?
<P>
	The Correctional Service of Canada has repeatedly stated that 
Warden Jan Fox at the Edmonton prison for women is one of our 
best. Yet Warden Fox has refused to take responsibility for a string 
of problems at the prison which includes assaults, escapes and 
inmate Fayant's death.
<P>
	What will it take for the government to recognize that Warden 
Fox is incompetent? Will the solicitor general make her resign, yes 
or no?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we assumed 
responsibility immediately. We took almost 14 concrete measures, 
which included $400,000 of renovations. We made important 
improvements to assure that security would be addressed which 
included enhanced surveillance.
<P>
	We are looking at a review of all the incidents which have 
occurred over the past several months to ensure the safety of people 
in the region is addressed before we open the other two centres. I 
believe that is very responsible action.

will the minister indicate to the House what kind of reaction was

Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question and for the 
fantastic support he gives fishermen and other constituents in his

<P>
	The hon. member is right. The regulatory amendments were 
recently prepublished in Part I of <I>The Canada Gazette</I> and a final 
date for comments was May 13.
<P>
	The department has received many comments and my officials 
are now in the process of reviewing them and re-evaluating the 
regulatory proposals in light of the comments and the proposals 
received.
<P>
	My instruction to the officials is to make sure the many 
comments are reviewed with great care for the institution of these 
fees, of which the total has to be collected. The consideration will 
be for all plants and in particular for small plants so that smaller 
plants are not harmed to the extent possible that we can offer any 
relief.

the words were.
<P>
	The attitude of the member raising this question of privilege is 
astonishing, because such a comment could be made about any 
remark made by anyone in this House, they could be said to have 
shouted out something irrelevant. He has not mentioned the words

until the member knows what he is talking about.

	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is my pleasure today to draw to the attention of hon. 
members that May 17 to 23 has been proclaimed national road 
safety week in Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	National road safety week, which is sponsored by the Canada 
Safety Council, aims to raise awareness of road safety issues and 
promote safe driving practices.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Because 1996 marks the 15th anniversary of operation life saver, 
the focus of road safety week this year will be on the need to reduce 
the high annual number of grade crossing accidents across the 
country.
<P>
	Operation life saver, sponsored by both the Railway Association 
of Canada and Transport Canada, works in co-operation with the 
Canada Safety Council and provincial organizations to promote rail 
safety.
<P>
	Operation live saver's mission is to make people aware of the 
dangers associated with level crossings, grade crossings and the 
dangers of trespassing on railway properties.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Studies show that many drivers are unaware of just how 
dangerous railway crossings can be. They do not understand how 
fast trains move, or how long it takes them to come to a stop.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Operation life saver produces printed materials, films and 
audio-visual presentations. It assists in driver education activities 
and also hosts special events aimed at promoting greater awareness 
of rail safety.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, like you, many of the hon. members with children 
will be encouraged to know that operation life saver targets 
educational activities toward youngsters who use railway property 
as a short cut to school or to a playground.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Transport Canada has been a proud supporter of operation life 
saver for many years, and hon. members will be pleased to hear 
that the federal governement intends to contineu supporting this 
valuable program well into the future.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	On another related topic, it is also my very great pleasure to 
announce the federal government has reached agreements with 
eight of the provinces and the two territories to continue the 
implementation of the National Safety Code. The last agreements 
are with the two remaining provinces for signature.
<P>
	The National Safety Code was developed in 1987 by the federal, 
provincial and territorial governments to encourage trucking 
safety. It is to promote efficiency in the motor carrier industry and 
to ensure consistent safety standards in this area across the country.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The code covers such topics as commercial vehicle maintenance 
and inspection, hours of service, trip inspection reports, 
driver-examiner training, and the implementation of a national 
driver's license.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2948"> 2948 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As part of this announcement, the Government of Canada will 
provide the provinces and territories with $20 million over five 
years to help put the National Safety Code in place.
<P>
	This funding is a good human and financial investment. The 
National Safety Code will help reduce commercial vehicle 
accidents. That means fewer deaths and fewer injuries on our 
highways.
<P>
	It will also help to ensure Canadians remain competitive by 
applying common standards across the country instead of the 
patchwork system of rules and regulations we have had in the past.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I would urge all members of this house to support national road 
safety week, specifically the efforts under way by this governement 
and others to reduce railway crossing accidents and strangthen 
commercial vehicle safety.

	I urge all hon. members to take heed of the message of road

<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to speak today in this House to bring 
attention, as the minister has, to national road safety week, to be 
celebrated in Quebec and Canada May 17 through 23, 1996. Since 
arriving in Ottawa, the official opposition has always made it its 
duty to support and promote issues around highway safety and safe 
driving.
<P>
	I have listened to the federal Minister of Transport's speech with 
interest. We share his concerns, and we support his desire to reduce 
the number of motor vehicle accidents. We share his belief that 
improved safety is an excellent thing.
<P>
	We were, however, a bit surprised to hear what the minister had 
to say on behalf of his government. Today he is trying to blow his 
own horn, to pass himself off as the great defender and promoter of 
road safety. As recently as last week, however, in response to a 
question by my colleague from Lévis on restoration of the Quebec 
bridge, he stated as follows: ``The deterioration of the bridge, 
including the part on which vehicles drive, is due mainly to car and 
truck traffic- Motor traffic in the province of Quebec is the 
responsibility of the Quebec transport department; it is not a 
federal responsibility''. Now today he is giving us a speech on road 
safety. We also need to see what that means in day to day reality.
<P>
	The decrepit state of the Quebec bridge is beginning to be a 
threat to driver safety. The federal minister turns a deaf ear to any 
question of accepting his responsibilities and restoring the Quebec 
bridge, in conjunction with  Canadian National and the 
Government of Quebec. We see this as contradictory to the speech 
the minister has just finished.
<P>
	Where road safety is concerned, I would like to raise a 
constitutional aspect which is very likely to pose an increasing 
threat to the safety of drivers and the general public. As you know, 
the Canadian Constitution recognizes rail transportation as a 
federal responsibility, while highway safety within each province is 
a provincial one.
<P>
	This somewhat artificial division poses serious problems.
<P>
	As you know in rail transportation, the government's inaction 
has forced many businesses to use trucks rather than trains to ship 
their goods.
<P>
	The same situation could well arise with the new policy of fees 
for coast guard services the federal minister of fisheries has just 
announced. All transportation sectors interact. The effect of the 
policy is to drive many maritime carriers to American ports, 
requiring goods destined for Quebec and Canada to be transferred 
by truck.
<P>
	Because the federal government has failed to finance, manage 
and develop the rail system properly and because it is proposing an 
unfortunate policy of charging for coast guard services, private 
firms have found alternate ways to make their deliveries. The 
increased number of trucks on the roads of Quebec and Canada is 
largely the cause of the deterioration in the state of the roads, 
threatening public safety particularly.
<P>
	The arbitrary division of powers in the transportation sector 
therefore prevents our having an integrated national transportation 
policy. With intermodality increasingly popular, the obsolescence 
of Canada's Constitution may well threaten our road safety. I think 
this is the message we must bear in mind during this national road 
safety week.
<P>
	Of course we must support initiatives such as operation life 
saver, but we must recognize that, if transportation is to be 
modernized, Canadian and Quebec firms will have to acquire 
modern equipment and set aside the antiquated aspects of the 
Constitution to permit an integrated national standard on 
transportation and thus greater road safety.
<P>
	In closing, I would repeat our support for National Road Safety 
Week and encourage everyone to drive carefully.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is my pleasure to rise today in response to the minister's 
statement and acknowledge the proclamation of national road 
safety week in Canada, May 17-23. National road safety week, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2949"> 2949 </A></B>
<P>
which is sponsored by the Canadian Safety Council, is to raise the 
awareness  of the need to promote safer driving habits. In 
particular, this year the national safety week is featuring Operation 
Lifesaver, which focuses on grade crossing accidents. It is being 
co-sponsored by the Railway Association of Canada, Transport 
Canada and the Canadian Safety Council.
<P>
<B>(1215)</B>
<P>
	I could continue to talk about the virtues of national safety week 
and, in particular, the minister's statement today regarding the high 
annual number of grade crossing accidents. I appreciate what the 
minister is doing. Certainly no one could say that it is not an 
excellent project. However, I would like to take this opportunity to 
speak about my recent parliamentary activities with respect to the 
terrible carnage taking place on our highways as a result of 
impaired drivers.
<P>
	I would like to address my remarks, in particular, to the Minister 
of Transport. I know he shares the concerns of millions of 
Canadians who, on a daily basis, see in their newspapers, in the 
electronic media and hear from their friends about this terrible 
crime. They are touched every day by crimes committed by people 
who choose to drink and drive. They kill over 1,400 people every 
year on our streets and highways.
<P>
	I know the number of accidents that occur on an annual basis at 
grade crossings is a huge concern. We have to do everything we can 
to decrease those statistics.
<P>
	This might be a starting point for the government. Perhaps I can 
encourage the minister to join with this side of the House in 
supporting Bill C-201. The government could join with Mothers 
Against Drunk Drivers, Canadian Students Against Impaired 
Drivers in Canada and Ontario Students Against Impaired Driving 
in supporting Bill C-201. Locally there is the Nepean community 
council against impaired driving. The Canadian Police Association 
and other groups are crying out for the government to implement 
measures that express zero tolerance to people who even think of 
getting into their cars when they are impaired.
<P>
	That would not be hard to do. It could be reflected easily in our 
criminal justice system. Penalties could be brought in like those in 
Sweden. Sweden has very liberal drinking laws, but its criminal 
justice system says that if a person drinks, gets behind the wheel of 
a vehicle and is caught, his or her driver's licence is suspended for 
life and the vehicle seized. Why cannot we reflect zero tolerance 
such as that?
<P>
	The tragedies that occur at the hands of drunken drivers make the 
accidents that occur at grade crossings pale by comparison. If the 
government can take the initiative to proclaim May 17 to 23 as 
national road safety week and pay special attention to accidents 
which occur at grade crossings, why does the Minister of Justice 
stand speaker after speaker in the House to oppose Bill C-201?
<P>
	I will close by saying that I appreciate what the minister and the 
government is trying to do but, for God's sake, let us go further to 
address the impaired drivers who kill in this country.

<HR>
<B><A NAME="2952"> 2952 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>emphasize that their relationship with the  Canadian Wheat Board are not 
sound/positive business relationships?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Hon. Ralph Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, 
Lib.):</B> In 1991 the Canadian Wheat Board initiated a formal 
process to ensure it is properly structured and staffed to meet future 
challenges, demands, opportunities and threats. It engaged Deloitte 
&amp; Touche Management Consultants to conduct a comprehensive 
operational review, the findings of which suggested there were 
considerable areas of strength in the CWB at that time. The report 
also recommended that management undertake and implement a 
number of initiatives to address the identified deficiencies and 
concerns.
<P>
	The CWB has initiated a formal strategic planning process with 
a view to provide a greater focus on its long term activities and to 
ensure the organization is equipped to respond to change and 
opportunities. An external consulting firm has facilitated this 
annual planning process since that time.
<P>
	The CWB has also developed an extensive quarterly planning 
and reporting process by the management of the organization's four 
directorates. This process is proving invaluable from both a 
management and performance measurement perspective.
<P>
	To complement this planning process, the CWB in 1993 
conducted a detailed environmental scan, which included a survey 
of employees, customers and producers. These activities have 
placed the CWB in a position to define areas needing change, 
particularly those pertaining to the CWB's interface with its 
employees, its customers, and with farmers. It has also since 
developed an action plan of strategic initiatives in three key areas.
<P>
	The first is relationship with farmers. The pool return outlooks, 
estimated pool returns, farmer delivery contracts, farmer focus 
sessions, toll free telephone access to the CWB, and proposed 
flexible pricing options have all emanated from the strategic 
planning process.
<P>
	The second is relationship with customers. The CWB has 
developed a number of value added, market service and market 
development initiatives. For example, the introduction of basis 
contracts for customers, for example in Japan, the U.S., the United 
Kingdom and Canada, resulted form the CWB strategy of 
increasing its focus on the customer. Infomation and findings from 
a comprehensive customer survey findings assisted the CWB in 
other customer services initiatives.
<P>
	The third is relationship with employees. The CWB has 
established a formal human resources department and has 
introduced several related initiatives which focus on the employee, 
including a review of job descriptions at all levels.
<P>
	Along with these strategic undertakings the CWB has 
undertaken to develop and implement a number of key  corporate 
governance procedures and policy guidelines, some of which 
relulted from the Deloitte &amp; Touche recommendations.
<P>
	Since 1992 the CWB has established a formal audit committee. 
The audit committee's primary responsibilities are to oversee 
internal financial reporting and to review the objectivity of the 
annual external audit. The committee also determines whether 
management and auditors are responding appropriately to current 
business risks and allocating their efforts optimally. Special 
comprehensive auditing examinations are critical in ensuring that 
business practices are benchmarked against best practices of other 
corporations. The CWB audit committee performs a central role in 
strengthening communications between external auditors and 
CWB management responsible for the organizations's financial 
reporting.
<P>
	The CWB has also implemented a comprehensive department by 
department audit process, which assesses department structure and 
procedures in terms of efficiency and effectiveness. Deloitte &amp; 
Touche, which has previous experience with the federal auditor 
general's department and with government audit procedures, has 
assisted the CWB's internal audit department in this area. The 
integrity and effectiveness of the CWB audit committee is 
enhanced by the inclusion of the chairman of the CWB advisory 
committee as a member.
<P>
	The CWB also developed a formal budgeting process, which is 
continually improved when and as necessary. This is priving to be a 
valuable management tool.
<P>
	The CWB has historically developed an annual marketing plan 
which is updated throughout the crop year. In recent years this 
planning process has been enhanced by an expanded sales and 
market development division, which has an increased focus on the 
strategic planning aspects of grain sales. CWB sales plans, which 
include extensive detail pertaining to grain classes, grades, protein 
levels, projected selling prices and sales volume by destination, are 
updated on a continual basis in response to changing market 
conditions.
<P>
	The CWB market development department has been expanded 
since 1992 and works closely with farmers, the CWB sales 
department, customers and other organizations such as the 
Canadian Grain Commission and the Canadian International 
Grains Institute. In addition to the co-ordination afforded by the 
above linkages, CWB market development efforts are increasingly 
guided by the development internally of long term grain import 
projections. These projections provide an indication of country 
specific and aggregate import requirements in terms of volume and 
quality, as well as the prospective Canadian share in each market. 
All this has enhanced the overall effectiveness of the CWB 
marketing effort.
<P>
	In 1993 the CWB conducted a comprehensive review of its 
relationship with accredited exporters, which  included individual 
exporters and the Shippers and Exporters Association. This review 
generated a number of recommendations and action items to 
improve the CWB's relationship with exporters, all of which have 
<P>

<B><A NAME="2953"> 2953 </A></B>
<P>
been subsequently implemented. The CWB meets annually with 
the Shippers and Exporters Association to discuss a wide variety of 
subjects, including any concers. The CWB also meets annually 
with each accredited exporter for the same purpose.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this group of motions has within it 
two motions.
<P>
	Motion No. 13 is necessary to correct two differences between 
the French and English language versions of Bill C-20. The French 
version in the reprinted Bill C-20 of May 8 contains the 
requirement that a person requesting additional services from Nav 
Canada must agree in writing to pay all incremental costs 
associated with the provision of the additional services, and the 
standing committee agree to eliminate this requirement, and the 
English language version of the legislation reflects this agreement.
<P>
	The French version of Bill C-20 does not include the 
requirement which is contained in the English version that the 
person demonstrate, through written evidence, that a majority of 
affected users agree to the provision of the additional services.
<P>
	Motion No. 14 is a consequential amendment to a motion that 
carried at the Standing Committee on Transport. At this time I call 
for the question on the third group of motions.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is the House ready for the question?
<P>

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-20, in Clause 32, be amended by replacing lines 25 to 37, on page 16,

<BLOCKQUOTE>``(2) A charge authorized by the Minister of National Defence may be 
imposed under subsection (1)</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(<I>a</I>) on a user; or</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(<I>b</I>) on a user in respect of a state aircraft of a foreign country.''</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, in this bill that will commercialize air 
navigation services, the motions in Group No. 4 are aimed at 
ensuring that the Department of National Defence will do its part in 
funding and running Nav Canada.
<P>
	This bill currently provides that the Department of National 
Defence will not be subject to the charges that other carriers will 
have to pay. In our opinion, this distorts the real assessment of 
DND's operating costs, of the budget funds allocated to national 
defence, and may have a negative impact on some airports when 
services are shared by DND and all private air service users.
<P>
	Why should DND be exempt? The easing of international 
tensions in recent years has led to perhaps insufficient but still 
significant cuts to DND. Further cuts are needed, but DND should 
still be held accountable for all its spending.
<P>
	If DND is exempted from paying air service charges, its annual 
estimates will give the impression that it costs less than it really 
does.
<P>
	Military flights still mean something in Canada. Our training 
bases are used by Canadian soldiers, but some of our flight training 
areas, notably in Labrador, are also used by other countries. Why 
should DND not pay its share? This would also help us determine 
what parts of the country benefit from this kind of spending.
<P>
	If DND generated significant revenues for a special purpose 
airport, this would allow us to consider the economic impact of this 
bill on air navigation activities.
<P>
<B>(1240)</B>
<P>
	Ultimately, what we would like to see prevail, and this is the 
principle found everywhere else in the bill, that is why we are 
somewhat surprised at the government's position and we think it 
would be a good idea to correct the situation, is the user pay 
principle.
<P>
	Would there not be a benefit today in ensuring that the real 
expenses incurred by a department are paid by that department? 
There are other sectors of government activity that will have to 
defray these costs directly or indirectly. For example, if we take the 
health sector, ambulance airplanes are used in Canada to reach 
remote areas. These people will have to cover the planned charges. 
Why would this kind of charge be picked up by the health sector 
and not by the national defence sector? It applies in the health 
sector, but it could also apply in the tourist sector.
<P>
	The tourist industry in Canada is very important. It has grown 
considerably and is expected to grow even more in future. With the 
new charges, many small carriers may see their economic activities 
jeopardized. They will have to change their method of operating 
accordingly. This is not required of a huge department like defence, 
which spends enormous amounts on protection, but, at the same 
time, it would not be charged the portion of air navigation costs that 
apply in its case.
<P>
	It strikes us as most surprising that, in sectors like health, 
tourism, businesses, they are trying to justify fee scales for private 
sector flights but there none for defence flights. Is that not a double 
standard? Is that not a mistake, in fact?
<P>
	This seems to be perpetuating, in relation to the defence sector, 
practices which existed in the government some 15, 20, 25 or 30 
years ago. People became aware that these practices were having 
devastating effects, a loss of control over the cost of operations. If 
defence does not have to bear its part of the costs, does this not lead 
to a tendency to use available services more, and to put increased 
pressure on the system? Finally, there can be no real assessment of 
what the costs of air navigation for the defence sector are. Are there 
not facilities in certain parts of Canada which will need to be put 
into place specifically for defence purposes, without there being 
any corresponding charges levied?
<P>
	All of these questions lead us to wish to see an amendment to the 
bill, one ensuring that this department assumes its share, as other 
departments must, and as the private sector is required to do, 
paying its way in the reconfiguration resulting from the creation of 
Nav Canada and the commercialization of air navigation services.
<P>
	Reference is also made to foreign government aircraft, which 
whould also be made to pay. I think it is important, from the safety 
and security points of view, to know what is going on with these 
flights, what costs they will generate, what sort of protection we 
can provide them.
<P>
	Just imagine something which I certainly do not wish to ever see 
happen: a collision between a defence or military aircraft and one 
belonging to a private carrier. This would create a somewhat 
artificial situation in which one of the parties involved in the 
accident had never been required to contribute to the quality of 
safety services. This would surely contribute to a poor opinion of 
the defence sector. These days I do not think there is anything to be 
gained by adding to the negative image of a department described 
yesterday by its minister as in a ``painful situation'', when serious 
questions are already being asked about its efficiency and 
transparency.
<P>
	The purpose of our amendments is to ensure greater 
transparency, to make sure that the exact air navigation costs of 
department of defence activities will be known. This will, I believe, 
be worthwhile both to the House and  to those concerned with 
costs, in these 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2955"> 2955 </A></B>
<P>
times when people are questioning whether money is being used 
properly. It will be one way of knowing what the real costs are.
<P>
<B>(1245)</B>
<P>
	Also, private air carriers and Canadian taxpayers should not 
necessarily be the ones paying for national defence. Why should 
they have to foot the bill in this case? This is tantamount to giving 
additional importance to the defence sector. As I said earlier, if I 
could favour certain sectors by granting them such an exemption, 
flying ambulances would definitely take precedence over military 
flights. Let military aviation officials know exactly how much it 
really costs to fly their aircraft. This is important and it should be 
taken into account. This is the purpose of our amendment, and we 
hope the government will support it.
<P>
	Small carriers really wonder about the additional pressure put on 
their activities through the new tariff structure. They are justified in 
saying there should not be a double standard in Canada but, rather, 
a level playing field. Whether it is the military or the private sector, 
everyone must bear the overall costs. Under the user pay principle, 
everyone must make an adequate contribution, so that when the 
time comes to determine the real costs of defence activities, these 
costs will be based on actual figures, not incomplete data that does 
not allow us to know the overall government costs in this sector.
<P>
	I hope the government will seriously consider our proposal. It is 
based on sound arguments and it is fully justified. In the middle 
term, the government's decision to exempt DND from having to 
pay these costs would certainly not prove efficient from an 
administrative point of view, or in terms of the follow up of air 
navigation costs, which is the very basis of the legislation.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, if the argument being put forward 
by the Bloc member were as simple as he stated, I might even 
support this motion when it came to a vote.
<P>
	We discussed this at the Standing Committee on Transport. It 
was made very clear why the government would reject this motion. 
Motion No. 15, the only motion within this grouping, demonstrates 
again a total lack of understanding of the charging aspects of Bill 
C-20, in particular the charging aspect as it relates to DND 
services.
<P>
	The Bloc motion tries to eliminate the exemption for Nav 
Canada's charges for aircraft operated under the authority of the 
Minister of Transport and for aircraft of a foreign state. Let us deal 
with the foreign state issue first. The exemption for foreign state 
aircraft is the least significant of the two. Bill C-20 reflects the fact 
that many states do not levy charges on state aircraft and in the 
interests of reciprocity, in the interests of symmetry  the state 
aircraft of such countries should not be charged for Canadian air 
navigation services.
<P>
	The Bloc should take great comfort in the fact that the bill leaves 
the door open for the governor in council to authorize charges on 
state aircraft of countries coming into Canada that charge Canadian 
state aircraft at the present time or in the future when they fly to 
those countries. I hope that would satisfy members opposite.
<P>
	The more significant exemption being asked for is the one in 
respect of aircraft operated by the Minister of National Defence. 
Rather than an outright exemption, this is just an element of an 
arrangement between Nav Canada and the Minister of National 
Defence.
<P>
	The arrangement recognizes that the minister is both a user and a 
provider of air navigation services. As a provider of services, the 
minister operates the air navigation services in designated military 
air space which includes the air space around military bases such as 
Comox, Cold Lake, Moose Jaw, Trenton, Bagotville, Goose Bay 
and others. At present the Minister of National Defence does not 
charge for any of these services.
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
	The arrangement is for Nav Canada not to charge the Minister of 
National Defence's aircraft for the use of Nav Canada's services. In 
return, as compensation, the Minister of National Defence would 
allow Nav Canada to charge civilian users for air navigation 
services provided by the military. That means Nav Canada gives up 
some of its revenue in respect of services it provides and it gains 
some revenue from services provided by the Minister of National 
Defence.
<P>
	Because the two amounts for all intents and purposes are just 
about the same, it is a good arrangement for both parties. In 
addition, the Department of National Defence avoids having to 
establish a whole separate billing and collection system for charges 
it would otherwise likely have to introduce for air navigation 
services provided by the military.
<P>
	Because the two amounts are roughly equal, it is not correct to 
say that the exemption burdens civilian users with costs that should 
be borne by the Minister of National Defence, as outlined by 
members opposite. Users will also benefit from this arrangement 
by receiving only one invoice from Nav Canada, even when they 
use services provided by both the Minister of National Defence and 
Nav Canada.
<P>
	This motion would completely destroy this arrangement. For the 
same reasons that we stated last week at the Standing Committee 
on Transport, we would reject this suggestion.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, like my 
hon. colleagues, I am pleased to participate in this  debate today on 
Bill C-20, an act respecting the commercialization of civil air 
navigation services. Among other things, this bill establishes a 
business corporation called Nav Canada, or NAVCAN.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2956"> 2956 </A></B>
<P>
	We are now at report stage, at Group No. 4, to be more precise, 
Motion No. 15 put forward by the Bloc Quebecois. This motion is 
to amend clause 32 of the bill to ensure that DND and state aircraft 
of a foreign country are not exempt from paying charges.
<P>
	To listen to the parliamentary secretary to the Minister of 
Transport, you would think that the Bloc Quebecois never 
understands a thing and always introduces useless motions. He 
claims this is a good arrangement between the Department of 
National Defence and Nav Canada, which will apparently split the 
costs about 50-50. I would be curious to see the parliamentary 
secretary's figures in this.
<P>
	At any rate, I should point out that a proposal has already been 
tabled by small air carriers, suggesting that DND should have to 
pay for its use of services at airports in Quebec and Canada.
<P>
	The problem, then, comes from the need not to make taxpayers, 
passengers and air carriers pay for military aircraft, and there is no 
guarantee whatsoever that it will not be the case.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois feels it is unfair to have private users pay 
for services required by national defence. If clause 32(2) is not 
amended, defence expenditures will once again be hidden. We have 
always demanded a reduction in military spending. For this to 
happen, we first have to know the actual costs. However, in its 
present form, clause 32(2) will not enable us to know these costs.
<P>
	Again, it is not up to private air carriers and Canadian taxpayers 
to pay for DND's flying activities until the minister tables the 
figures relating to such activities.
<P>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
	Our motion is based on the notion of transparency. It seeks to 
avoid an artificial reduction of the national defence budget, so as to 
ensure that actual costs and expenditures relating to such activities 
are accounted for.
<P>
	Taxpayers living in remote regions-including those represented 
by the hon. members for Abitibi, Lac-Saint-Jean, Gaspé and 
others-must sometimes pay two or three times more per kilometre 
to go to Montreal or Quebec City than people who travel between 
Montreal and Toronto. Therefore, I do not see why national defence 
should be exempted from having to pay the costs associated with 
its flying activities.
<P>
	Since the Liberal government is cutting social programs, 
programs helping the handicapped, old age pensions and women's 
support programs, I wonder what could possibly justify keeping 
clause 32(2).
<P>
	If there is such a thing as natural justice, the Liberal government 
has definitely missed the boat in this case and forgotten about the 
principles of fairness which underlie our laws.
<P>
	I ask all members of this House to support Motion No. 15 moved 
by the Bloc Quebecois, so that national defence, for the reasons I 
mentioned, will not be exempt from paying fees to Nav Canada.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will raise 
a few points at report stage of Bill C-20, which is to privatize 
NavCan, and on the group of motions we are currently speaking on.
<P>
	I listened to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Transport just a few minutes ago. He explained the tradeoffs 
between the Minister of National Defence and NavCan: I will not 
charge you for your services if you do not charge me for the 
services I provide to you. This is a wonderful way to do business.
<P>
	Perhaps that is why NavCan is being created to be one of these 
not for profit organizations. Perhaps profit and efficiency are not 
the operative points which are trying to be achieved with this 
exercise. It is only an exercise to move the civil servants who work 
in the air navigation industry off the government payroll into some 
other organization which is far enough removed that there is no 
accountability. It will not be part of the normal operation of 
government and therefore will be removed from the scrutiny of the 
House. That is the point I will speak to.
<P>
	If NavCan is to be a privatized organization, why would it 
provide services for free and expect services for free when there 
seems to be no real relationship between the services being 
provided, other than to have a gentleman's agreement to ignore 
them? Is that privatization? Does that seem to be the way the 
private sector does business? The Income Tax Act calls that barter 
and it is taxable.
<P>
	The government is saying again that the rules that operate in the 
private sector do not apply to the government because the 
government makes the rules. The fundamental problem with much 
that comes out of the government is that it creates its own little 
environment by saying it makes the rules and it will say how the 
game is played.
<P>
	The government is going to call this privatization. NavCan is a 
not for profit organization. It is not designed to make a profit. It is a 
cost plus organization. It is going to remove 6,500 people from the 
civil service and put them into this organization which will be 
removed from parliamentary scrutiny.
<P>
	As well there will be no scrutiny by the Auditor General of 
Canada. It is not a crown corporation as defined in the Financial 
Administration Act. The government has come up with a new 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2957"> 2957 </A></B>
<P>
hybrid. Therefore the auditor general has not been given the 
mandate to scrutinize NavCan, as he has with other crown 
corporations.
<P>
<B>(1300 )</B>
<P>
	What is the government trying to achieve? When it set up Nav 
Canada, it had all these assets, computer equipment, buildings and 
goodness knows what else paid for by the taxpayer. What did it 
say? It told NavCan to go out into the money markets and borrow 
$1.5 billion. It is going to sell the assets to NavCan for cash. That is 
fine for the Minister of Finance because it helps him to meet his 
deficit reduction targets this year.
<P>
	I come back to the very point that the parliamentary secretary 
made. These trade-offs and these gentlemen's agreements which 
are made are totally and absolutely banned by the Income Tax Act 
and not allowed in the private sector, yet he openly admits that it is 
the trade-off made. The government does not want to figure out 
how these services are to be valued. The parliamentary secretary 
thinks it is a good deal for Canadian taxpayers. I doubt it.
<P>
	This organization, Nav Canada, is far removed from public 
scrutiny yet it has been given a monopoly. It has been given virtual 
taxing powers. There is absolutely no constraint on the way it 
spends its money. There is no constraint on what it says it needs 
and is going to pass on to the consumer, the airlines and so on. It 
will pass on costs through tickets to the Canadian consumer.
<P>
	The government tells us that this is good for Canadians. The 
President of the Treasury Board admitted in committee the other 
day that the 6,500 civil servants did not lose their jobs but just got a 
new name on their pay cheques. This is part of his civil service 
reduction package. That way Canadians think the government is 
being downsized. Not one of these 6,500 people lost his or her job. 
On Friday night, they were working for the government and on 
Monday morning they were working for Nav Canada. We gave 
them $200 million cash because they got laid off.
<P>
	These are the types of things that should be debated in the House. 
The government should be telling Canadians how it is spending 
their money. It should also be forthright with Canadians that this 
organization is far enough removed from public scrutiny that it 
does not have to worry about its financial statements.
<P>
	I have already said that the Minister of Finance will take a $1.5 
billion credit on deficit reduction courtesy of Nav Canada because 
Nav Canada will borrow the money from the private sector.
<P>
	This organization is not going to be accountable according to the 
normal rules of the private sector. The parliamentary secretary has 
already admitted that the normal rules of the Income Tax Act and 
barter do not  apply in this situation. How can he call it a private 
sector organization?
<P>
	Everything the government is doing is obfuscation and deceit as 
far as this deal is concerned. If it wants to have a true private sector 
type of organization, it should have said so. If that is not what it 
wanted, it should at least have given the Auditor General of Canada 
the power of scrutiny over Nav Canada. That is why we have these 
problems.
<P>
	In 5, 10, 15 years from now, people will find out that this 
organization has runaway costs. Canadian consumers are finally 
going to rebel and say it is too much. The government is not doing 
its job today.
<P>
	Accountability is the number one issue in the private sector. If 
the government builds in competitiveness and if it expects and 
demands that Nav Canada work according to the same rules as the 
private sector, it may have something.
<P>
	The government has removed NavCan far enough away that it 
has been swept under the carpet. The government is taking credit. 
There are 6,500 fewer civil servants. These people are still paid by 
the Canadian consumer: $1.5 billion deficit reduction claimed by 
the Minister of Finance courtesy of this equipment that is being 
used by Nav Canada, but there is no accountability.
<P>
	Mark my words. If an organization has no accountability, it leads 
down a very difficult path that usually is the wrong path. I ask the 
government to think very seriously about that.

	<B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of

member for St. Albert go without reminding him that he did not 
spend a single moment in the transport committee when we dealt 
with this bill.
<P>
	We addressed concerns between NavCan and ANS. He did not 
spend a second in committee, but he made a speech saying things 
that completely contradict the critic of his party. Can anyone 
imagine? The critic of his party is charged with the responsibility to 
go to committee to put forward the position of the Reform Party.
<P>
	Yet the member for St. Albert made his statement. Yesterday the 
member for Kootenay West-Revelstoke, the Reform Party critic, 
made the position of the Reform Party very clear. Then his 
colleague from St. Albert got up and talked about something he 
obviously knows nothing about and contradicts the critic in his 
party. You have to wonder where these guys are coming from.
<P>
	However, let us move on to the last group of motions. We are 
talking about the Privacy Act.
<P>
	The hon. member for Kootenay West-Revelstoke yesterday 
made some remarks with regard to the Privacy Act. He said he 
called NavCan, the not for profit corporation which we would like 
to move this to. He said he had talked to NavCan and it has no 
problem with the Privacy Act being brought forward to this bill.
<P>
	NavCan wrote a letter to the government on May 9 and also 
appeared before the Standing Committee on Transport. It is clear in 
the letter to the Minister of Transport and I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>First, the Privacy Act currently applies only to certain federal government 
institutions, including federal government departments and certain agencies and 
Crown Corporations. It does not apply to all Crown Corporations. It does not apply 
to  corporations that have been privatized such as CN or Air Canada. It does not 
apply to any private sector corporations or organizations whatsoever.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The extension of the Privacy Act to any part of the private sector would 
represent a significant change in policy of the Government of Canada. It would 
bring with it to the private sector not only the necessity to substantively 
guarantee the protection of personal information (which is not in itself 
objectionable) but also the processes designed to apply to the federal 
government for correcting and amending records containing personal 
information and the requirement that a private sector corporation be subject to a 
complaint and investigative procedure by a Federal government officer, namely 
the Privacy Commissioner with, ultimately, decisions on the collection, 
retention and administration of records containing personal information being 
subject to review in the Federal Court of Canada. This degree of bureaucracy 
and administration would be inconsistent with the imperatives of the private 
sector and, certainly, with the rationale for the commercialization of the ANS.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1310 )</B>
<P>
	Government could not agree more. We had discussions in the 
Standing Committee on Transport. In the government's 
reassessment of whether the Privacy Act should apply to Nav 
Canada, it became increasingly clear that the application of the 
Privacy Act to Nav Canada is completely unnecessary and 
inappropriate. The Privacy Act deals with the protection of 
personal information held by government and the rights of an 
individual to access that information.
<P>
	As I said at the outset, it was interesting to hear the member for 
Kootenay West-Revelstoke yesterday saying that Nav Canada did 
not have a problem with this. Mr. Speaker, I must put this 
diplomatically because I do not want you to intercede. The hon. 
member was incorrect in that statement. The proof of the pudding 
is the letter dated May 9. If the Reform critic for transport wants 
more evidence of that he is invited to phone the officials at Nav 
Canada any time for a very clear explanation of why Nav Canada 
does not agree that the Privacy Act should apply in this not for 
profit corporation. I hope he does that.
<P>
	We are wrapping up discussions at report stage and second 
reading of the bill. When we come back after working hard in our 
ridings next week, we will be discussing third reading of the bill. I 
hope the hon. member will retract his remarks.
<P>
	As outlined by its letter to the minister, Nav Canada would be the 
only private sector entity subject to the Privacy Act. The act does 
not apply to previous government commercializations like CN and 
Air Canada. It does not apply to other regulated monopolies, not 
even those in key economic sectors like telecommunications.
<P>
	When the privacy commissioner, Mr. Phillips, came before the 
Standing Committee on Transport, I suggested that if there was a 
need to extend the application of the  Privacy Act to private sector 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2959"> 2959 </A></B>
<P>
entities, it should be considered in the context of a comprehensive 
review of the fundamentals of the Privacy Act, not Bill C-20.
<P>
	Why decide to pick on one area, one bill, one of the four major 
modes of transportation to apply an act against a not for profit 
corporation? That kind of review should provide an opportunity, if 
Mr. Phillips were to examine his own backyard on the Privacy Act 
in which all interested parties could express their views.
<P>
	When all is said and done it must be remembered that the 
privacy commissioner can at any time investigate complaints and 
initiate investigations.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Mercier (Blainville-Deux-Montagnes, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, there is an amusing story behind clause 96.1 of the bill we 
are considering. As amusing stories are rare in this House, I will 
relate it briefly. Clause 96.1 does not appear in the text of the bill 
we passed at first reading. It appears now, because the bill before us 
was amended by the Standing Committee on Transport. It added 
this clause under the amendment proposed by our party.
<P>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
	No need to remind the House that the majority of members 
sitting on the Standing Committee on Transport are Liberal and 
therefore, with the government's motion to delete this clause, 
which was added by the Standing Committee on Transport, we 
have the minister rejecting a proposal from his own committee 
with a majority of its members from his own party. At the very 
least, we can say this is a different approach.
<P>
	And what does clause 96.1 say? It says:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>96.1 The Privacy Act applies to the Corporation as if it were a federal institution.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The purpose of the amendment we proposed, which the 
committee accepted, was to ensure that Nav Canada would protect 
personal information on personnel and clients, just as if the 
government were still responsible for all air navigation services.
<P>
	My colleague on the other side says there are other corporations, 
such as the CN, that are not subject to the Privacy Act; but by 
saying this, he is giving me other arguments. He says there are 
entities created by the government which no longer have the same 
obligations as before privatization. These government creations are 
now private sector corporations. Yes, but they took on 
responsibilities for public services and, as such, they should give 
the public the same services the government was providing before. 
It is clear, it is only logical. But they have forgotten all about that 
on the other side.
<P>
	The fundamental principle is this: it is unacceptable for a 
government creation to reduce services to the public when this 
creation is a private corporation serving the public. It is 
inappropriate to create such screens.
<P>
	My colleague, the member for Argenteuil-Papineau, said it 
again this morning, there is a stunning parallel between ADM, 
another government creation which manages the Montreal airports, 
and this corporation which is being created so that the public will 
not have access to information concerning the studies on which 
ADM based its decision. You can be for or against the decision, that 
is not the point. The point is that the public has the right to know 
about the studies used by ADM. Our offices requested those 
studies, but the request was turned down because this organization 
is under no obligation to provide them.
<P>
	What we have here is a deliberate attempt, on the part of the 
government, to hide behind corporations which act as screens, 
allowing it to dodge responsibilities it had before they were 
created.
<P>
	I now come to the argument that, as Mr. Philips is reported to 
have said, what should be changed is the Privacy Act. If this 
argument was logical, Liberals would have applied it in the bill we 
are discussing today. Yet, in that bill, what do we see? We see a 
section that we agree with, but that contradicts the principle just 
mentioned.
<P>
	Section 96 says:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>96. The Official Languages Act applies to the Corporation as if it were a 
federal institution.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This is excellent but, if it is valid for the Official Languages Act, 
why is not valid for the Privacy Act? Why do we not say: ``The 
Official Languages Act will not apply to Nav Canada, so we are 
going to amend the Official Languages Act''. That is not what the 
bill says.
<P>
	All of the sudden, we are told: ``As for the protection of privacy, 
it is not the same, it is the Privacy Act that has to be amended''. 
This does not make any sense.
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	The result of all this, and I will conclude here, is that we 
understand perfectly what the federal government is up to. It is 
transferring public property currently under the management of the 
federal Minister of Transport to Nav Canada, and then will hide 
behind Nav Canada in order to withhold important information 
from the public.
<P>
	Such an approach goes against the transparency the government 
as a whole is bragging about, and its effort to defeat our 
amendment, which was accepted by the committee and rejected by 
the minister, shows I am not making a case based on assumptions, 
but on facts.
<P>
	The Liberals want to use their majority in the House to defeat an 
amendment that was passed in committee, because they know a 
majority of Liberal members will vote as the government tells them 
to, without even knowing what this is about. And they call that 
democracy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philippe Paré (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thought 
my colleague opposite was getting ready to speak, but he was 
getting ready to leave.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2960"> 2960 </A></B>
<P>
	Since this is both the report and second reading stage, I would 
like to broaden the debate and deal with a point which seems to 
be well covered in a clause, but which is nevertheless a cause for 
great concern. That point is whether the Official Languages Act 
will apply to the new air navigation services corporation, Nav 
Canada.
<P>
	Air navigation services have been under the 
jurisdiction-actually, they still are, as long as Nav Canada is not 
operational-of Transport Canada, a government department. 
Despite this direct link between air navigation services and the 
government, Quebecers working in the air transportation industry 
had to put up a great big fight to be able to use French in planes, 
control towers, and air control services.
<P>
	This is a cause for great concern. If they had to fight so hard 
when air navigation services were under the government, how can 
we be sure Nav Canada will abide by the Official Languages Act? 
The former minister told us Nav Canada would be covered by the 
act, and that the bill says so, but how can we trust him?
<P>
	Even after the Official Languages Act was put in force, we had to 
wage a great fight. I remember the part the late Roger Demers 
played in this fight for the right to work in French in the air 
transportation industry in Quebec. It took years, even if the Official 
Languages Act was in force and if we were dealing with the 
government.
<P>
	Those opposed claimed that disasters would result if French was 
used in air navigation services. As if as soon as they entered 
Quebec air space, all the planes would have crashed simply 
because French could be used to communicate.
<P>
	Roger Demers and the Association des gens de l'air fought some 
very important battles over this issue and the use of French in the 
air, and that battle is far from over.
<P>
<B>(1325)</B>
<P>
	This was such a major event in the history of Quebec that the 
Association des gens de l'air has created two awards to 
commemorate the battle French speaking Canadians had to fight. 
Every year, the Association des gens de l'air presents to an 
individual who has distinguished himself or herself in the air 
industry the Roger Demers Award and the BILCOM, which is short 
for ``bilingualism communication''.
<P>
	These people remember perfectly the battle they had to fight and 
that is still going on.
<P>
	At this point in my speech, I would like to read part of a letter my 
colleague from Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans and I wrote to 
the Minister of Transport in April, 1994. Part of this letter 
concerned the issue of services in French, and I quote: ``After 
Canadian air control is centralized, only one of the nine air control 
centres, the Montreal regional air control centre, will be French, 
that is, one centre for 7  million people, while the ratio for English 
speaking persons will be one for 2.6 million''. How can Quebecers 
accept these figures?
<P>
	The letter goes on: ``It is not surprising, then, that the 
Îles-de-la-Madeleine are served by the Moncton regional control 
centre, usually in English unless a pilot demands to be served in 
French, in which case the control tower leaves him on standby at 
the end of the runway. He will sometimes have to wait up to ten 
minutes to get his instructions in French.
<P>
	``It is in this context also that we should look into why Transport 
Canada is so offensively slow to bilingualize the Ottawa terminal 
control unit''. We are, of coure, talking about the Ottawa airport 
here.
<P>
	``Indeed, for the last five years-this letter was written in 
1994-Transport Canada has been trying to make this terminal 
control unit bilingual, but in vain. For the umpteenth time, it has 
been announced that this service will be available as of May 1, 
1994''. It was still not to be on that day, since it was postponed to 
May 26, 1994, that is, more than five years after it was promised.
<P>
	I will continue with the letter, and I am talking here about the use 
of French: ``It also relevant that, in this part of our discussion on 
French services, we take a look at the airports that you, Transport 
Canada, have decided to exempt from centralization, namely 
Ottawa and Calgary''. These two airports have kept their terminal 
control units, whereas many cities lost theirs, including Quebec 
City.
<P>
	``Until now, in justifying these two exceptions, you always 
referred to the traffic density and complexity of the Ottawa and 
Calgary airports''.
<P>
	Traffic density and complexity are just excuses. We believe the 
real reason is totally different. Ottawa being the capital of Canada, 
Transport Canada knew that, some day, air traffic control in Ottawa 
would have to become bilingual. However, to think that the Toronto 
area control centre could become bilingual was an aberration. And 
to think that air traffic control for the Ottawa airport could be done 
from Montreal was hardly more acceptable for Transport Canada 
officials.
<P>
	So Transport Canada used another kind of logic to solve the 
problem. It was determined that the Calgary airport was busy 
enough and complex enough to warrant the maintenance of its 
terminal control unit. Then, Transport Canada concluded that 
Ottawa was similar to Calgary in this sense. Therefore, it had just 
found a way to justify its decision. But, in reality, it is the old battle 
of French in the air that justified the maintenance of the terminal 
control units in Ottawa and Calgary.
<P>
	If you look at-and this is something that is even more insulting 
to francophones-Order No. 4 from Transport Canada and read 
section 3 of that document, you will see that the title of section 3 is 
``Interdiction''. Not tolerance, but ``Interdiction''.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2961"> 2961 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1330)</B>
<P>
	The section reads as follows: ``Unless otherwise provided in 
section 4, 5 or 6, anyone operating an aeronautical radio station in 
Canada shall not exchange advisory services or air traffic control 
services in a language other than English''.
<P>
	This order was issued on May 29, 1980, therefore after the battle 
fought by the Association des gens de l'air, after nearly 10 years of 
applying the Official Languages Act, and it is still not allowed. 
Obviously, the exceptions in section 4 apply to airports located in 
Quebec. This means that, outside Quebec, francophones wishing to 
speak French with other francophones, a francophone pilot wishing 
to speak with a francophone air traffic controller in Toronto, 
Moncton or Halifax, is not entitled to do so. And that was by 
authority of Transport Canada, in other words the government.
<P>
	Just because Bill C-20 says that the Official Languages Act will 
be applied, how can we be sure that French will be protected in the 
air? That seems to me to be an extremely important point. I have 
the impression that workers in the aviation sector in Quebec will 
have to remain extremely vigilant. However, as the responsibilities 
are being transferred to a non-profit agency, I think that future 
battles will be all the more difficult. They will require even greater 
effort.
<P>
	I will conclude on this note. There was one nice thing in Order 
No. 4. It said that, in the event of an emergency, two francophone 
pilots could perhaps speak to each other in French in Canada's air 
space, but only in an emergency.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, as several 
of my colleagues have said, the Bloc Quebecois subscribes to the 
principles of Bill C-20 concerning the commercialization of civil 
air navigation services. Its objectives of efficiency, cost 
effectiveness, lowered operating costs, are praiseworthy ones, and 
we acknowledge them as such.
<P>
	The reason we have reached the report stage, which is moreover 
the purpose of the exercise, is that we want to improve this bill. If 
we listen to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Transport, however, it would appear that all of the amendments 
proposed by the Bloc Quebecois are useless. He has said that ten 
times or more since the beginning of the debate. I hope he has not 
reached the stage of considering the official opposition useless. My 
purpose in speaking will, therefore, be to convince him that Group 
No. 5 of our amendments is not useless.
<P>
	Motion No. 25 introduced by the Liberal government aims at 
removing section 96.1 of the bill as amended by the transport 
committee. This provision was added on the recommendation of 
the Bloc Quebecois and the Reform Party. Members will recall that 
members from the three  political parties, The Bloc, the Reform 
Party and the Liberal Party voted for this amendment in committee.
<P>
	I find the Liberals' about-face at the report stage rather 
astounding, because they are trying to exclude Nav Canada from 
the application of the Privacy Act. The Liberal government may 
claim that the Privacy Act has to be amended so that it can apply to 
Nav Canada.
<P>
	Yet, Liberals thought it was important to include the following 
provision in section 96 of Bill C-20:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Official Languages Act applies to the Corporation as if it were a federal 
institution.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Then why, in that case, did the government not consider it 
necessary to amend the Official Languages Act instead? This is a 
double standard.
<P>
	This government is acting contrary to the spirit of openness it so 
often brags about.
<P>
<B>(1335)</B>
<P>
	It is transferring to Nav Canada public assets under the 
responsibility of the federal Department of Transports, in order to 
escape its obligation to inform the public, claimming that this 
corporation is a private service. This government is not acting 
properly by using an agency as a screen to avoid providing 
information that the public has a right to expect from a public 
agency.
<P>
	The attitude of the Liberal government on this issue is 
disappointing, disconcerting and even demoralizing. As I said 
earlier, members of all parties supported this provision in 
committee. Today, the Liberals intend to use their majority in the 
House to defeat an amendment carried in committee. It is a pity 
that a majority of Liberal members will vote with the government, 
without being aware of the whys and therefores of Motion No. 25. 
One has to wonder why committee members bother.
<P>
	Simply put, with Motion No. 25, the federal government is 
shirking its responsibilities with regard to openness, integrity and 
respect for the public it must inform. Needless to say, the Bloc 
Quebecois is firmly opposed to this motion.
<P>
	In conclusion, I would like to say a couple of words regarding 
the comments made a little while ago by the parliamentary 
secretary, who would like to avoid putting the privatization process 
on hold because other corporations such as the CN and the CBC are 
not subject to the Privacy Act, so Nav Canada should not be subject 
to it either. This is the same as saying that it is important for this 
government to repeat past errors. This is a strange way to govern.
<P>
	Finally, Motion No. 26, in Group 5, is presented by the Bloc 
Quebecois for the sake of consistency with clause 96.1. It amends 
the Schedule to the Privacy Act so that Nav Canada is added to the 
list of institutions covered by the act.

	The House resumed from March 21 consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Roger Simmons (Burin-St. George's, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the motion of my friend from St. Albert would have us 
introduce amendments to the Financial Administration Act to 
require all departments and agencies to table in the House a 
specific response to the auditor general's report.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Forseth:</B> That is a good idea.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simmons:</B> It is a good idea. My friend from New 
Westminster-Burnaby says that it is a good idea and he is right 
again.
<P>
	I had a marvellous speech here, somewhere. It was beautifully 
typed, marvellously prepared but I cannot seem to find it. Let me 
see what I can do. I know the essence of what the member has in 
mind.
<P>
	I am a great believer in the dictum that if it ain't broke, don't fix 
it. We should first look at what is behind the motion. Knowing the 
member for St. Albert as I do, I am not suggesting there is anything 
nefarious or suspicious behind it. He must have had a reason. He is 
a member of the public accounts committee and has been  for a 
couple of years. For most of that time he has been his party's 
spokesman on these matters. Before coming here my good friend 
was an accountant. He has a specific interest in and knowledge of 
these matters.
<P>
	Accountants are people who, when they are sent a Christmas 
card, before they check the signature, they flip to the back of the 
card to see how much it cost. Accountants are particular people. 
They are very meticulous. They watch the buck. We need some 
accountant parliamentarians. We have one such person in the 
member for St. Albert, a good accountant-parliamentarian.
<P>
	One would expect that there would be a good motion from him 
and we were not disappointed. He says that departments ought to be 
required to table their responses to the auditor general's report. As I 
said, if it ain't broke, don't fix it. The corollary to that is if 
something is broken, only fix the broken part.
<P>
	I am not an accountant. I must apologize for that. The fact that I 
am not an accountant has gotten me into all kinds of problems over 
the years. I am a parliamentarian. I used to wear another hat too. In 
the Newfoundland House of Assembly from 1975 to 1979, I had the 
honour of being the chairman of the public accounts committee. 
After coming here, I was briefly the chairman of the public 
accounts committee of this House as well. I want to talk about an 
incident during my experience with the public accounts committee 
in Newfoundland.
<P>
	I have to apologize to all concerned because the dentist got at me 
and said he wanted to stitch up the inside of both sides of my face. 
If I am mumbling more than usual today, it is partly because I-
<P>
	<B>Ms. Meredith:</B> You are on Novocain.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simmons:</B> Exactly. Novocain can do some wonderful things 
to you.
<P>
<B>(1350 )</B>
<P>
	There was a situation in the Newfoundland house in which the 
auditor was reporting every year. He reported on a particular set of 
events in the Department of Public Works. We on the committee 
kept asking enough questions, kept probing enough that we found 
the smoking gun. A job which the fire commissioner after a fire at 
the fisheries college estimated to cost $35,000 to fix wound up 
costing $576,000.
<P>
	The interesting coincidence was that despite the fact the Tory 
government at the time had made much of its new public tender 
legislation in which no amount over $10,000 would be awarded 
without tender, the government had found a way to give out 
$576,000 without tender. It was simple the way the government did 
it. There were some accountants on staff. They always awarded an 
amount less than $10,000. They got around the act with over 60 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2964"> 2964 </A></B>
<P>
work orders. What was even more  interesting was that all the work 
orders had gone to the same firm.
<P>
	The public accounts committee and I as the chairman did enough 
probing that we got to the root of that one. The result was the 
following: a public inquiry into the spending practices of the 
Department of Public Works in Newfoundland; the resignation of 
the two ministers who had been in the portfolio during the period 
under investigation; and criminal charges laid in which an 
individual was convicted of fraud and sentenced to a prison term of 
three years as I remember.
<P>
	I cite this example to show that if we are going to have 
accountability in this Chamber, it is not enough to dicker, to 
change, to amend, to perfect the rules. We have to fix the part that 
is broken. We have to see to it that the public accounts committee 
and the members on that committee, including my friend from St. 
Albert, do the necessary probing.
<P>
	Before we get to that, before we begin to point fingers, we have 
to ask ourselves whether the public accounts committee and the 
House have the tools to do the job. In other words, is there 
something else that is broken that needs fixing. That is the 
allegation, the premise in the motion of my friend from St. Albert.
<P>
	The hon. member wants the agencies and departments of 
government to bring specific responses to this House. Let us 
look at what the case is right now and has been the case under the 
Financial Administration Act for many years. The case is that 
when the auditor general reports, each department, each agency 
of government or as the act says, the government itself, is 
required within 150 days to give a specific response on the 
criticism in the auditor general's report and what that 
department or agency is doing about it.
<P>
	There is another point. In 1994 we amended the Financial 
Administration Act to allow the auditor general to make more than 
one report to Parliament a year. Before that he made only one 
report a year. Since the auditor general has had the legislative 
authority or permission to report more often than once a year he has 
done so. In 1995, the year after the change in the act came in, he 
reported three times. In 1996 he can be expected to do likewise.
<P>
	My point is that the tools are there. The auditor general reports 
quite frequently but his report, and I gave the example of the 
Newfoundland House of Assembly, in itself is not enough. We can 
swamp this place with paper and reports and we do.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Do you listen to them?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simmons:</B> My friend from St. Albert asks if we listen to 
them. I am going to pass the buck right back to him. He, together 
with others-and I do not see any of them in the House-including 
his friend from Calgary Centre, are on the public accounts 
committee. The gentleman from 
Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans is  the chairman, my friend 
from London West is on the committee and my friend from Kent is 
a member of the public accounts committee. I believe those are the 
only members of the public accounts committee in the Chamber 
right now. These are the people who must take the pieces of paper 
that come here and follow them up, as we did in the Newfoundland 
house.
<P>
<B>(1355)</B>
<P>
	If there is a smoking gun, if there is some lack of accountability 
they are the people who, having a good relationship with the 
auditor general, will see that these matters are ferreted out.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley, 
Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is interesting to listen to the arguments from 
the other side. I find it confusing that somebody could even 
question accountability to the House of Commons and Parliament.
<P>
	My colleague's motion merely asks that government 
departments be accountable for the money they spend, particularly 
when the auditor general's report indicates instances in which there 
might be some question of whether it could have been spent in a 
better way. My hon. colleague's motion is only suggesting that all 
departments be required to table responses to the auditor general's 
report when it brings into question some of the activities within the 
departments.
<P>
	The reason my hon. colleague suggests that the departments 
should table responses is that the public accounts committee cannot 
handle all the issues raised by the auditor general. If it were only 
the public accounts committee that would deal with these issues in 
an effort to bring resolution to the concerns in the auditor general's 
report, it would have no opportunity to do the necessary follow-up.
<P>
	We spend $50 million a year for the auditor general to audit 
some government department accounts. All my hon. colleague is 
suggesting is that if we are going to invest that kind of capital for 
the auditor general's department to do checks on government 
spending, then the government departments that are found to be 
somewhat in question as to whether they are operating with the best 
value for the dollar for Canadian taxpayers should be accountable. 
This is something that should have the support of every single 
member in the House of Commons.
<P>
	The House of Commons is accountable to the Canadian taxpayer 
and to the Canadian public. Members of the House of Commons 
are voted in by the Canadian taxpayers to make sure their interests 
are being looked after, considered and protected.
<P>
	What Canadians feel, rightly or wrongly, is that government 
bureaucracies, the departments, tend to remove themselves from 
accountability to the House of Commons. Canadians think the 
bureaucracy is running the show. If Parliament wants to regain 
some control and  some accountability of government departments 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2965"> 2965 </A></B>
<P>
that administer the policies established in the House of Commons, 
then something like this is needed.
<P>
	What is needed is a report which gives the department's 
explanation and what it will do about the auditor general's concerns 
and the time frame within which it will address the issues brought 
up by the auditor general. We are only asking that these 
departments table a report acknowledging the auditor general's 
comments, giving an explanation of why it occurred and giving 
some indication of how much time it will take the department to 
rectify the concerns of the auditor general.
<P>
	It is almost impossible to understand how an hon. member 
across the way could find fault with this request. The hon. member 
for St. Albert is asking for the government bureaucracies and 
departments to be accountable and to answer to the House of 
Commons.
<P>
<B>(1400)</B>
<P>
	The auditor general is an officer of the House of Commons. He is 
acting our behalf to investigate, to audit public accounts and to 
make sure Parliament is aware of where the government is 
spending money. It makes sense to me and hopefully to everybody 
else here that Parliament should be holding the departments 
accountable for responding to the auditor general's report; not just 
a parliamentary committee which has not the personnel, the 
members, to address all of these concerns.
<P>
	If I remember correctly, in 1994 the report had 34 chapters of 
detailed information on selected government programs in a dozen 
departments and agencies. Only four of these chapters received a 
response from the government in last year's budget. That does not 
indicate to me and to Canadians that government departments take 
seriously the concerns raised in the auditor general's report. If we 
are to invest the kind of money we do, if we are to invest the 
opportunity for somebody to audit government accounts, we should 
also make sure their suggestions and concerns are given serious 
consideration.
<P>
	This year, of 27 chapters in the auditor general's report only 1 
was addressed in the budget plan, annex I. One has to ask how 
seriously the government takes the concerns raised by the auditor 
general. How seriously does the government take those situations 
in which the auditor general is pointing out taxpayer money is not 
being well spent, or that the return on that investment of taxpayer 
dollars is not just justified and not enough?
<P>
	I suggest all members in the House of Commons, if they believe 
it is the House of Commons that is in control of the country and not 
the government departments and not the bureaucracy, should fully 
support Motion No. 166 to see that control and accountability are 
returned through the House of Commons and not through the 
government departments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Maloney (Erie, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
member for St. Albert for his motion to introduce amendments to 
the Financial Administration Act, a motion that will require all 
departments and agencies to table in the House responses to the 
recommendations of the auditor general. I am honoured to have the 
opportunity to express my views as we resume debate on this 
motion.
<P>
	In March, when we last debated this motion, many interesting 
points were raised. Several comments were made about the lack of 
adequate government response to both the auditor general and the 
Standing Committee on Public Accounts. As these comments have 
become part of the public record, I feel it is my duty to provide 
some defence.
<P>
	The role of the auditor general is to call attention to anything he 
considers to be of significance and of a nature that should be 
brought to the attention of the House of Commons. The auditor 
general is an officer appointed by Parliament. He tells 
parliamentarians and all Canadians what he has found as he 
investigates the workings of government. He has tabled three 
reports on government in the past year.
<P>
	Each report is automatically referred to the Standing Committee 
on Public Accounts. This committee is chaired by a member of the 
official opposition and investigates in depth many of the issues the 
auditor general has identified. The committee also contacts each 
and every department mentioned in the reports and requests a 
response outlining actions taken.
<P>
	It was suggested on March 21 that unless the Standing 
Committee on Public Accounts calls witnesses and tables a report 
the government ignores the recommendations of the auditor 
general. This is not true.
<P>
	The government is continually making improvements to its 
programs and policies based not only on the recommendations of 
the auditor general and the public accounts committee but on 
recommendations from program managers, from its own internal 
review groups and from its clients.
<P>
	To take the second of these, I cannot think why any department 
would continue to employ and pay these internal audit evaluation 
and review shops if it were not interested in learning how 
effectively and efficiently it does business and how it can improve. 
It is part of being a good manager.
<P>
	It was suggested that in cases where the Standing Committee on 
Public Accounts did investigate there was a lackadaisical attitude 
on behalf of the government in addressing these issues. I do not 
think I would consider, for example, that the President of the 
Treasury Board tabled the first annual report to Parliament on 
review an indication of a lackadaisical attitude
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2966"> 2966 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1405)</B>
<P>
	Allow me to elaborate a little to show the government's 
dedication to improvement. This report tabled in Parliament in 
November 1995 was titled ``Strengthening Government Review''. 
It was a snapshot of the state of review in the federal government 
and the kind of performance information available. It also included 
an action plan to address the opportunities for improvements 
identified.
<P>
	This report was produced in response to concerns raised in the 
1993 auditor general's government-wide audit of program 
evaluation and internal audit and to follow up a report by the public 
accounts committee. It was and continues to be by no means a 
small or lackadaisical effort.
<P>
	In response to the 1993 auditor general's call for strengthening 
government evaluation and internal audit, the Treasury Board 
issued a new review policy. The policy encourages departments 
and agencies to develop better information. It asked that they use 
performance information in business planning processes and that 
they make this performance information accessible to the public. In 
short, the Treasury Board asked for greater accountability for the 
use of public funds.
<P>
	In 1995 Treasury Board developed a revised expenditure 
management system. This system requires departments to 
articulate goals, targets and measures in key expenditure areas.
<P>
	Over the years the auditor general has been asking government 
to become more accountable by providing better information on 
results and costs. The government has responded in no small way. 
Departments and agencies must demonstrate to parliament and to 
all Canadians whether goals set have been met and if not, why not. 
What better example of accountability is there?
<P>
	It was also suggested the government sometimes appears to be 
not interested in being accountable. Sometimes in our busy day in 
the whirlwind of issues we forget the amount of progress that has 
been made. We are so busy focusing on the trees we sometimes 
miss the forest. It is important we consider what has been 
happening in the widest sense before we focus on specifics.
<P>
	The auditor general notes that for over 65 per cent of of his 
recommendations there has been full implementation or else 
satisfactory progress has been demonstrated.
<P>
	Specific examples cited by the auditor general include 
significant improvements in the layout and presentation of the 
government's annual financial statements that have been made in 
response to recommendations by the auditor general.
<P>
	Another example is the significant improvements in the quality 
of information in crown corporation corporate plan summaries and 
annual reports provided to Parliament.
<P>
	These responses illustrate the dedication of government to 
continuous improvement and reflect its emphasis on 
accountability.
<P>
	That these criticisms were uttered suggests a disturbing 
misperception that government does not listen to the auditor 
general. Even more disturbing is the misperception that the 
government does not care to listen. It is important to hear these 
comments. It seems the government has been too quiet about its 
success stories. In our drive to improve we sometimes forget to 
celebrate our accomplishments.
<P>
	Believing these misperception might very well lead one to 
suggest departments and agencies should table in the House of 
Commons action plans in response to the auditor general's 
findings.
<P>
	If it were true that nothing happened in response to the auditor 
general's reports, it would make sense. However, this is clearly not 
true. As we have seen and heard both today and on March 21, quite 
a lot happens to remedy shortcomings noted by the auditor general.
<P>
	Not only does the government address the specific items noted 
by the auditor general, it has been working diligently 
government-wide to address the underlying themes present in the 
auditor general's reports. This diligence is visible in a concerted 
effort to improve the quality of its programs and services to make 
them effective, efficient, affordable, accessible and fair.
<P>
	How has the government been achieving this? On March 7 we all 
saw the progress report on getting government right. Perhaps we 
should remind ourselves of the efforts in using information 
technology better, being more responsive and flexible, changing 
the way government makes decisions, and focusing on results 
based management to achieve our goals.
<P>
	For example, the government has been harnessing information 
technology innovatively to make services more accessible and 
affordable for Canadians. Canadians can now receive at a single 
location a range of government services from several departments 
and levels of government. Some of this is possible from home or 
through an automated kiosk.
<P>
	New approaches provide new solutions to old problems. The 
government is exploring new ways to deliver programs and 
services that offer the best value for taxpayer dollars. Some of 
these ideas include partnerships, integration of departmental 
responsibilities and employee takeovers.
<P>
	I think these changes reflect a fundamental shift in the way 
government manages itself. For example, the move to accrual 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2967"> 2967 </A></B>
<P>
accounting allows government to report more  accurately the cost 
of its activities on an annual basis. This increases public and 
parliamentary accountability. Better information means better 
decisions.
<P>
<B>(1410)</B>
<P>
	This shift is also reflected in the government emphasis on 
results. The quality service initiative is designed to provide 
accessible, affordable, relevant and responsive services to 
Canadians. Most departments have published performance 
objectives for the delivery of government products and services. 
These standards act as benchmarks against which Canadians can 
measure the timeliness, accessibility, reliability and accuracy of 
services to which they are entitled.
<P>
	I could go on at length. However, I think these examples more 
than adequately show the dedication of the government to getting 
government right by improving and becoming more accountable.
<P>
	I certainly hope I have begun to remedy the misperceptions that 
government does not want to change. The government is 
committed to improvement. The government has recognized a deep 
and enduring public demand for better governance. In response, the 
government launched major reviews of its overall policy 
frameworks, co-operated with the provinces and territories to make 
all levels of government work better, initiated program review 
which examined all federal programs and activities to rethink not 
only what the federal government does but how it does it. This 
includes reducing areas where costly overlap and duplication had 
previously occurred.
<P>
	I call it progress. It is undeniable. Progress in reducing spending 
levels is also progress in restoring financial health. Progress in 
making government work better is progress in restoring public 
faith in government.
<P>
	If the government were not listening to the auditor general, to the 
Standing Committee on Public Accounts, to the citizens of Canada, 
this motion would be a welcome initiative to get us back on track. 
However, we must consider the facts. When the auditor general 
thinks change is occurring to a large extent in a timely and 
satisfactory manner, we must stop and think. I do not think 
members can disagree. It is becoming increasingly clear that if we 
were to implement the motion suggested by my fellow member we 
would be to a large extent duplicating much of the effort that 
currently exists.
<P>
	I am sure none of us would want to ask the citizens of Canada to 
pay more for something that is already provided. I am sure fellow 
members would not want to show the Canadian public an attempt 
to create a larger and more expensive bureaucracy, flying in the 
face of all we have been trying to accomplish.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I sit here in utter amazement listening to the hon. member, 
particular his last statement that he would not expect that anyone 
would want the  government to spend money for something that is 
already provided.
<P>
	This party would because the extra money this may cost, which 
has not been verified yet, would save the government untold 
millions of dollars by increasing the efficiency of its departments. 
We would be prepared to see this motion passed.
<P>
	I am pleased to support the motion put forward by my colleague 
from St. Albert. The member for Burin-St. George's mentioned a 
couple of times in his speech that if it ain't broke, don't fix it. Let 
me assure the House it is broke, contrary to his opinion.
<P>
	Let me give an example of how broke it is. It is interesting that 
no Bloc members are in the House today speaking on this bill. 
After all, why would they? They could only speak in opposition to 
this bill because they have not demonstrated in one instance since 
they have been in the House that they have any intention of 
bringing the government to accountability. They have no desire to 
see accountability in any of the spending departments because it 
does not work with their agenda.
<P>
	The motion our member has brought forward would strengthen 
the role of the auditor general and provide much more 
accountability with respect to taxpayer dollars by the government. 
Where have we heard that phrase before? Have we ever heard it by 
the government? No. Have we ever heard it by the Bloc? No. Have 
we heard it from Reformers over here? Yes. We have heard it for 
years from Reformers that governments have to become 
accountable to the taxpayers. Governments must begin to regard 
taxpayer money as a sacred trust. That is what we are trying to get 
to.
<P>
	It would also ensure all departments and agencies would table a 
response to the auditor general's report. That is not rocket science. 
That means reporting to the House of Commons, to Parliament, on 
what someone is doing since the last report which said they were 
doing a pretty lousy job. When going through the auditor general's 
reports, at least the ones I have seen since I have been in the House, 
he has not exactly given a glowing report to any government 
department.
<P>
<B>(1415)</B>
<P>
	This motion would ensure that timeframes would be laid out by 
departments with respect to taking corrective actions as a result of 
the findings of the auditor general. Timeframes is a foreign word to 
this Liberal government. This word is used in private business all 
the time. There is a timeframe for getting this done and there is a 
timeframe for getting that done. That is why business operates so 
efficiently. Businesses operate on their own money. The 
government is operating on taxpayers' money. The money does not 
belong to the government, so why be efficient?
<P>
	Last, it would ensure that the public accounts committee and any 
other relevant standing committee would be involved in the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2968"> 2968 </A></B>
<P>
process. That is not rocket science. Why not? Why would the 
government be opposed to that?
<P>
	As the House knows, the auditor general and his department 
provide an invaluable service. The department is charged with the 
responsibility of overseeing how government operates. It makes 
criticisms and gives praise where it is due, although praise has been 
absent in the last number of years.
<P>
	The auditor general reports annually to the House on improper 
money management, improper records maintenance, non-approved 
expenditures and program efficiency. These are matters with which 
all of us should be concerned. All Canadians are concerned. The 
government should be concerned.
<P>
	The auditor general receives about $50 million annually to fulfil 
his mandate but many of his findings and recommendations go 
unanswered. That goes right to the heart of accountability within 
government and contributes to the cynicism with which the public 
views how the government is using their money. If we asked the 
average taxpayer what is the one thing government could do to 
make him or her happy, I bet that nine times out of ten the answer 
would be: Spend my money a little more wisely. That is what we 
are talking about here. We are talking about implementing a 
mechanism which will force departments to spend the taxpayers' 
money more wisely.
<P>
	The attitude within departments appears to be that it is 
taxpayers' money and there is a lot more where that came from. 
The auditor general's follow-up findings to past recommendations 
would seem to confirm this type of attitude within the departments.
<P>
	If we watch the Letterman show on late night television, every 
night he has a top 10 list of something or other. The auditor general 
has a top four list. I would like to read them to the House. Here is 
today's top four list. As a matter of fact, these items have probably 
been the top four for as long as the auditor general has been 
reporting.
<P>
	Number four: varied, though mostly limited response to our 
recommendations.
<P>
	Number three: lack of action on many recommendations.
<P>
	Number two: measures undertaken are not sufficient.
<P>
	Number one: progress is slow.
<P>
	These types of statements are common in the follow-up findings 
of the auditor general. We can find them year after year. Why? 
Because there is no demand for the departments to become 
accountable.
<P>
	These are the complaints which the auditor general has of the 
corrective actions which are supposed to have been taking place. 
Obviously many of the departments are not concerned with 
responding quickly and effectively to the concerns of the auditor 
general.
<P>
	On March 21 the Parliamentary Secretary to the President of the 
Treasury Board stated that Motion No. 166 was not necessary since 
the government is highly motivated to respond to the concerns 
raised in each of the reports.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	While the government may be highly motivated to respond, this 
does not mean that it is actually responding or going to respond, but 
only that it is highly motivated. As an example, I might be highly 
motivated to go swimming in the Rideau Canal but I do not think I 
will be diving in just yet because I might be a bit afraid of what I 
am going to find. By comparison the government departments, 
although they may be highly motivated into digging into the 
auditor general's recommendations, are not responding. They are 
not quite ready to go in there. They may be afraid themselves of 
what they will find in their own departments. Being highly 
motivated does not automatically translate into taking action.
<P>
	Motion 166 goes a long way to addressing this concern. Quite 
frankly, any member of the House who is concerned about how the 
government spends taxpayers' money should be supporting this 
motion. By comparison I would imagine that any member who is 
not concerned with the way the government spends the money is 
going to oppose this motion. That is very clear. We have had two 
Liberal members today oppose the motion. Obviously they do not 
have any concern about how the taxpayers' money is spent. They 
are not concerned about accountability.
<P>
	Two speakers from the Reform Party today spoke in favour of 
this motion. Obviously they are concerned about how the 
government spends taxpayers' money. It is as simple as that.
<P>
	The red ink book, the document of promises, promises, promises 
which have been broken, broken, broken states that committees are 
to be given greater influence over government expenditures. That 
is what the red book says. The infamous red book of the Liberal 
Party promises openness, transparency, accountability and every 
other nice thing that one could ever imagine which has never come 
true actually says that government has to be more accountable.
<P>
	Here is the opportunity for the government. Instead of breaking 
red book promises, it could live up to one of them: accountability.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jerry Pickard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure 
to address the House as we resume debate on Motion 166.
<P>
	This motion was introduced by the member for St. Albert. As the 
House will recall the proposed motion  calls for an amendment to 
the Financial Administration Act. This amendment would require 
all departments and agencies to present to the House action plans. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2969"> 2969 </A></B>
<P>
These action plans would set out planned activities and timeframes 
for acting on corrective actions required by the auditor general's 
reports.
<P>
	We have had time since the debate began in March to consider 
what was said. Today it is important that we recognize that the 
member for St. Albert, the mover of this motion, put it forward in 
the pursuit of good governance. It is the spirit of this motion which 
I applaud. It is something on which we all agree.
<P>
	The pursuit of good governance and accountability were 
substantive themes. They are the reasons why we have to make 
certain that all dollars are spent properly. I say substantively 
because it is easy to sidetrack certain things, look at debates in the 
House, finger point and so on. However, when I see an honest and 
open debate on issues as important as getting government right it 
makes me proud as a Canadian to serve this House, proud to serve 
people.
<P>
	Today we have the opportunity to continue the debate and 
refocus our thoughts on this motion. I would like to pick up on 
some of the points that were raised on March 21 when it was last 
discussed and refocus the discussion on what we are really talking 
about: accountability and good government.
<P>
	Sometimes it is easy to forget all of the key checkpoints in our 
loop as we currently have it existing. I will try to revisit some of the 
elements of this circle while we consider this motion.
<P>
<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
	The auditor general is an officer of Parliament. He is not a civil 
servant. He does not work for the government. The auditor 
general's job is to call attention to anything that he considers to be 
of significance about the workings of the government. He provides 
us with an independent assessment of how things are working. He 
takes his job very seriously. The auditor general is committed to 
making a difference for the Canadian people by promoting in all his 
work for Parliament, answerable, honest and productive 
government.
<P>
	As members will recall, the auditor general has tabled three 
reports this year. In total, he audits about 200 organizations each 
year. In his part III of the estimates, he points out that he audits 
departments and agencies, crown corporations and other 
organizations from large ones such as the Governments of the 
Yukon and the Northwest Territories to small organizations such as 
the Army Benevolent Fund. Canadian taxpayers collectively pay 
about $50 million each year for this service.
<P>
	With each report, members of this House, the media and citizens 
alike focus their attention on the performance of the government. 
They listen to the auditor general. They question the government 
and, as a consequence, the government is highly motivated to 
respond to the concerns raised in each of the reports. There exists, 
as a fellow member aptly described it, a circle of accountability.
<P>
	Each department and agency has the opportunity to respond to 
the comments made by the auditor general directly in the published 
report. This is the first opportunity the government has to indicate 
what it will do to respond to the auditor general's concerns and 
findings.
<P>
	Daily question period provides an opportunity for members to 
question ministers further about the operations of government. As 
members will have noted from May 7 when the auditor general 
tabled his latest report, question period can become an important 
forum for challenging the government on the points raised through 
the auditor general's reports. Canadians, through their 
representatives, call government to account for its activities and 
can and do ask what will be done to remedy any shortcomings.
<P>
	The auditor general follows up every two years on his 
recommendations. He measures the progress that the government 
has made in responding to his concerns. He reports his findings in 
his annual report. This reflects the diligence of his office.
<P>
	During our debate of March 21, one of the members suggested 
that Motion 166 would legitimize the auditor general's work. The 
work of the auditor general is valuable in every respect and is very 
much respected in this House. I cannot imagine why a member felt 
that the reports of the auditor general somehow needed to be 
legitimized. I am sure that the member was not suggesting that we 
collectively pay $50 million for something that requires a motion 
like this to legitimize its existence. The auditor general has the full 
confidence of Canadians. His reports do not need to be legitimized.
<P>
	In his part III of the estimates, the auditor general noted that he 
had followed up 572 of his 786 recommendations made between 
1989 and 1993. His review indicated that 23 per cent of his 
recommendations had been fully implemented, and that 
satisfactory progress was being made on an additional 41 per cent 
of the cases. Keeping in mind that a number of recommendations 
were rendered no longer relevant, these findings mean that a 
significant percentage of the auditor general's work is acted on in a 
significant, timely, satisfactory manner.
<P>
	As a member said, it is important that we have some production 
out of criticism. I think the numbers more than adequately speak 
for themselves. The numbers are a testament to the legitimacy of 
the auditor general. They are also a testament to the effort that the 
department and agencies put into ensuring problems pointed out by 
the auditor general are properly addressed.
<P>

<P>
<B>(1430 )</B>
<P>
	The number of recommendations implemented is not a sufficient 
indicator of the success of this office. One must look at the 
individual success stories. The auditor general can and does in part 
III of the estimates offer plenty of examples to show how 
government has successfully acted to follow up on opportunities he 
has identified for improvement.
<P>
	One of the auditor general's priority areas in recent years has 
been revenue collection. In his 1996-97 part III of the estimates, he 
outlines several areas where Revenue Canada was responsible and 
responded well to his suggestions. This is one of many examples.
<P>
	As the member for St. Albert, the mover of this motion, can 
attest, the Standing Committee on Public Accounts also plays a key 
role in the circle of accountability. The committee is chaired by a 
member of the official opposition. One of its more important jobs 
is to review the findings of the auditor general's report with 
departmental officials. I would like to publicly commend the 
efforts of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts.
<P>
	As the mover of this motion can attest, it is a very busy team. As 
a result of the hearings, I believe the committee presented to the 
House 15 reports in 1995. Each report, based on the findings of the 
auditor general, called for and received a formal response from the 
government. Follow-up as careful and extensive as this should not 
be underestimated.
<P>
	The Standing Committee on Public Accounts does not have the 
time to call all departments and agencies mentioned in the auditor 
general's reports. This does not mean we let the departments off the 
hook. Each summer the committee contacts each and every 
department that was not called to testify and requests an update on 
actions taken. If it not satisfied with the progress achieved, the 
committee may call the department at a later date.
<P>
	I hope I have provided an adequate snapshot of the explicit 
points in the current circle of accountability as it relates to auditor 
general's reports. The circle exists. It is well defined and working 
well.
<P>
	We must ask ourselves how much value this motion is to the 
circle. Will the proposed legislation simply be adding further 
process, which is something we must avoid? This is where I would 
like to pick up on the other theme that ran through our last debate 
on this motion, the pursuit of good government.
<P>
	On March 7 the government released its progress report-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member's time has expired.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
an honour to speak to the motion put  forward by the hon. member 
for St. Albert, a member of the public accounts committee. He has 
gone to some considerable work since his election to bring forth a 
series of bills and motions to improve the process of accountability 
with respect to money in government, specifically accountability 
of government departments and agencies to the House of 
Commons. This is one example.
<P>
	Last year I had the pleasure to debate another rejected idea he put 
out, to have a more established system of program evaluation. I 
will read the motion before the House today:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should introduce 
amendments to the Financial Administration Act requiring all departments and 
agencies to table in the House of Commons a specific response to the auditor 
general's report on their activities, including time frames within which 
corrective action will be taken regarding any shortcomings or failures of 
administration identified by the auditor general; and such reports should be 
referred to the Standing Committee on Public Accounts and to any other 
relevant standing committees.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This sounds like something we would want to endorse. The 
auditor general is an officer of the House of Commons. He must 
report annually to the House on improper money management, 
improper records maintenance, non-approved expenditure and 
program inefficiency.
<P>
<B>(1435)</B>
<P>
	Every year we spend $50 million so the auditor general can fulfil 
this mandate. However, when the report of the auditor general is 
tabled in the House, every chapter is automatically referred to the 
public accounts committee. If the public accounts committee 
cannot pursue the matter specifically the chapter is often 
overlooked.
<P>
	As has already been pointed out, in the 1994 report of the auditor 
general there were 34 chapters, but only 4 received a response from 
the government in last year's budget. This year, of 27 chapters in 
the auditor general's report, only 1 was addressed in annex 1 of the 
budget plan. It would seem there is some reasonable need to assure 
this process is being followed and followed up.
<P>
	We all suffer our various purgatories here. The hon. member for 
St. Albert's is to be a Scotsman and an accountant, a deadly 
combination at the best of times but particularly deadly when 
dealing with issues of Canadian politics and government spending. 
Obviously that combination goes in an entirely different direction.
<P>
	When I listened to the debate today it is one of those days where 
I wonder why we are here, specifically what I am doing here. 
Before I spoke today I looked at the comments of the Parliamentary 
Secretary to the President of the Treasury Board on this motion, 
who is normally a very competent and genial member of 
Parliament representing the constituency of Bruce-Grey where 
most of my maternal relatives reside.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="2971"> 2971 </A></B>
<P>
	He made the following observations. I quote selectively from 
his speech because I think it summarizes the position of various 
government members:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I do not need to remind my fellow members that the auditor general himself 
follows up every two years on the progress and recommendations. I am positive 
that all members would agree the office of the auditor general must be diligent 
in reporting on the efficiency of the Canadian government operations. Do we 
want to undermine the efforts of his office by attempting to duplicate this work?</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>During this time of fiscal restraint, while we are trying to achieve maximum 
efficiency with a modicum of resources, we should consider as we debate this 
motion whether it will be cost effective.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It does not matter whether it is the government, a business, a municipal 
government or any organization that handles funds, it is the way in which one 
does business. It is the efficient way in which one does business and not the 
amount of paper and the reporting that makes the business function or makes it 
efficient.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In other words, we have this process, we know what it is, we 
have heard some descriptions today. The auditor general makes a 
report on inefficiency. The public accounts committee can study it 
and return its report to the auditor general or to the House. The 
auditor general will follow his own recommendations.
<P>
	We can bring it up in question period when we get these erudite 
explanations of government management and administration. We 
are to believe that all this is getting directly to the government 
department itself, which is the one thing left out of all this process I 
am describing. It was called by the previous Liberal speaker the 
circle of accountability, whether we want to put more elements in 
the circle.
<P>
	Is it a circle of accountability or is it the run around? Is it the 
non-circle or is it the circle of non-accountability and never getting 
any answers?
<P>
	I know hon. members come in and read canned speeches the 
government provides them, all with the same lines but with some 
different quotes to justify non-action.
<P>
	One hon. member said the auditor general's report must be fully 
followed and must be given all the legitimacy it requires because 
after all we do spend $50 million; the very fact we spend money 
must mean we are spending right.
<P>
<B>(1440 )</B>
<P>
	In going on with these canned speeches, the hon. member said 
that worrying about these kinds of details and worrying about 
whether or not the departments actually have a report and have 
taken action themselves that they can demonstrate, we are really 
unable to see the forest for the trees.
<P>
	Since we are all in the habit of making silly quotes for the sake of 
making a point, let me make one which brings together the whole 
issue of the forest and the trees: ``It  looks more like a sycamore to 
me''. That is a quote about the forests and the trees. It comes from 
Yogi Bear who said that as the sycamore fell on his head. The 
reason I raise that is if we want to talk about losing the forests for 
the trees and we want to talk about too much paper, maybe there is 
too much paper in some of these canned speeches.
<P>
	More important, there is too much paper out there as we float 
$450 billion in federal government bonds in international and 
national bond markets. That is the too much paper we should be 
worrying about around here; $450 billion which we are now only 
increasing at the rate of $25 billion to $30 billion a year in paper, 
enough to cut down several of Yogi's forests without any doubt. 
That is $25 billion to $30 billion a year plus, I will add just so 
nobody thinks that I am understating the problem, the other $100 
billion in various specified purpose account liabilities, plus another 
$500 billion in the unfunded liability of the Canada pension plan, 
which the hon. member for St. Albert has tried unsuccessfully to 
get the government to account for in its formal document.
<P>
	I hear comments that they are trying to get a specific answer to a 
specific problem; that they are trying to get a report; that the 
agency affected is to report directly on what it did wrong; and that 
they are trying to add that element of accountability. I hear the 
comment that it is adding too much bureaucracy. This reminds me 
of several instances in life.
<P>
	It is the same as taking my car into the mechanic because it is not 
running properly. The mechanic gives me a report stating what is 
wrong. I ask him exactly what it is he will do to fix it and how 
much it will cost and he tells me not to bother him with all that 
bureaucracy.
<P>
	It is the same as if I were to tell a doctor that I think I have some 
terrible illness. My arm, my leg or whatever hurts. I ask him to tell 
me what is wrong. The doctor runs all kinds of tests. I ask him what 
he is going to do and he tells me not to bother him with all that 
bureaucracy.
<P>
	We are suggesting that there is a purpose here. We are not 
suggesting that there be reports for the sake of having reports. We 
have already spent $50 million to find out what is wrong, now let us 
find out if anything was done about it. That is the point we are 
trying to make. I will add a couple of topical illustrations where 
this would help.
<P>
	Various changes are needed in Revenue Canada to capital gains 
legislation relating to family trusts. In the last few days in this 
House there have been discussions that some prominent Canadians 
have managed to shift billions of dollars out of the country in their 
family trusts. In other words they have avoided taxes and 
specifically capital gains taxes. There were lots of questions on 
whether that was fair in the way it was done.
<P>
	We were told by the minister of revenue, who seems terribly 
flustered by all this, that the government will act  quickly on the 
auditor general's recommendations but it really all occurred under 
the previous government. The problems were known for years but 
the government was never actually sure whether anything was done 
about them. That is precisely why the member for St. Albert is 
proposing this motion.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="2972"> 2972 </A></B>
<P>
	Another example is that in the past the auditor general has 
specifically called for discussions not just on deficit targets, as the 
government has no long term deficit targets, but that there be 
discussions on debt levels and appropriate debt to GDP ratios and 
what can be sustained in the medium and long term. This happens 
to be one of the few areas where I do have some expertise. This is a 
very important question. It is the critical question in terms of the 
long term financial health of the country. However, the last budget 
contained virtually no mention whatsoever of our enormous debt 
levels, let alone long term and medium term debt targets.
<P>
	I say all these things to point out that there is a need for it. There 
is a need to add this additional reporting requirement to ensure that 
the $50 million we spend on the auditor general office is followed 
up and that we know specifically what has happened.
<P>
	I would also point out, in spite of my frustration and sarcasm 
today, that this is a non-partisan motion. It does not aim at any 
specific government department or agency. It is something every 
member should be supporting. I hope the government members 
will put away their canned speeches, send them back to Yogi in the 
forest, so that we can get on with having some accountability for 
government money.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Waterloo, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish to 
congratulate my colleague on a fine speech. I notice that the 
member for Calgary West wants to replace the member for Calgary 
Southwest as leader.
<P>
	In terms of the motion before us, I am the vice-chair of the 
public accounts committee and I see merit in the motion. In many 
cases too many reports come before the public accounts committee. 
I believe this year there are some 35 chapters and we will be 
fortunate enough if we get to examine seven of them. Clearly it 
would be useful to make sure that issues raised by the auditor 
general got back to the relevant standing committees and then 
ultimately reported to the House.
<P>
	There is no question we want the auditor general and the public 
accounts committee to be certain that the bureaucracy has taken the 
suggestions into account and has made the relevant changes to 
make government operations more efficient.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It being 2.45 p.m., the time provided for 
Private Members' Business has now expired. The order is dropped 
to the bottom of the order of precedence on the Order Paper.
<P>
	The House stands adjourned until Monday, May 27 at 11 a.m.
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 2.47 p.m.)
