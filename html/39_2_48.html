      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clause 13 requirements would impose additional functions on the commissioner that are substantially different from those foreseen in the current mandate.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the hon. parliamentary secretary argued that the creation of the sustainable development advisory council provided for in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3075383,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3075383&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-474</A> requires a royal recommendation since this would require the expenditure of public funds in a manner and for a purpose not currently authorized.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 of the bill provides for the governor in council to appoint 25 representatives to the advisory council.

    </p><a name="Para894527"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As my colleagues have stated previously and as the government recently laid out in the Speech from the Throne, this government is clearly committed to improving environmental sustainability throughout this country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894528"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are implementing a very ambitious plan to cut greenhouse gases and to cut air pollution. For the first time ever, our government will be regulating the big industrial polluters. It took this government to take those steps to do that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894529"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among other measures, the government has taken action to protect water quality, which is so important to Canadians, including tough new regulations against the dumping of raw sewage as well as improving raw sewage treatment in municipalities and first nation communities across Canada. We are expanding our capacity to enforce our environmental laws. We are taking the environment very seriously. </div>
    </p><a name="Para894530"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that protecting and sustaining our natural environment is central to the quality of life of Canadians and this country, to our very prosperity and to the health and well-being of all Canadians. We have also been clear about our commitment to greater accountability in every step of government, especially in the environment, in advancing sustainable development.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894531"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the former minister of the environment tabled the fourth round of sustainable development strategies in December 2007, she stated the need to take action to address the inaction of previous governments and to ensure that Canada become a leader in sustainable development.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894532"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, we already have the tools to do the job for Canada to become a leader in sustainable development. Canada is one of the very few countries in the world that has enshrined sustainable development in actual legislation. We are proud of that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894533"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Auditor General Act ensures that federal departments and agencies take action to advance sustainable development within their mandates. Each of these departments and agencies reports every year to Parliament on its progress. That is correct: every year.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894534"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Auditor General Act also ensures that federal progress on the environment and sustainable development is monitored by the Office of the Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894535"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past 10 years, the commissioner's reports have offered constructive criticism on governments' progress on sustainable development strategies. According to the reports, what has been lacking by past governments is simple: action.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894536"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, that is changing under our Conservative government. Based on the commissioner's most recent report, this government has committed to undertake a thorough review of the current approach in order to achieve major improvements in sustainable development strategies. The commissioner is pleased with our commitment. We have agreed to complete our government-wide review by no later than October 2008.</div>

    </p><a name="Para894538"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, the bill proposes to establish a role for the Office of the Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development that is both unworkable and unnecessary. Let me outline a few of these issues.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894539"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3075383,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3075383&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-474</A> extends the authorities of the commissioner to that of both advocacy and audit, a clearly unworkable situation. The proposed bill, for example, states that the commissioner shall “provide advice and monitor progress in achieving sustainable development”, as is stated in paragraph 13(4)(c).</div>
    </p><a name="Para894540"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very difficult to be viewed as a non-partisan body if that body both advises on policy and then subsequently audits its implementation. Such a body would be open to accusations of bias given that it would be auditing what it helped to create. It is a clear conflict of interest.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894541"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, in its recently released report, the green ribbon panel established by the Auditor General carefully circumscribed what the Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development should advocate about. It warned against an advocacy role related to policy but supported advocacy on best practices and environmental management, which is exactly what we are arguing today.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1110"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1110"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1115"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1105"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1110">(1110)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para894542"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an issue understood by the Office of the Auditor General. Its performance manual, in 2004, stated:</div>
    </p><a name="Para894543"></a><p>
      <div>
        <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
          <tr valign="top">
            <td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>Special care is required when audit findings touch on government policy. As officers of Parliament, we do not want to be seen to be second-guessing the intentions of Parliament when it approves legislation, or of Cabinet when it selects a certain policy direction.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
    </p><a name="Para894544"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is an important statement.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894545"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3075383,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3075383&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-474</A> would extend the authority of the commissioner beyond that of federal jurisdiction to that of assessing the state of the environment by province and of reporting annually on provincial performance in meeting sustainable development goals relative to the performance of other industrialized countries.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894546"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is just the kind of interference in the jurisdiction of provinces and territories that has caused a number of wrangles, and, in the past, one in which we cannot be and should not be a party. A clear interference in provincial jurisdiction; something that the government stands well entrenched again.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894547"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3075383,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3075383&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-474</A> proposes the creation of a commissioner of the environment and sustainable development and such government bodies as a cabinet committee, secretariat and advisory council. The creation of a cabinet committee is clearly the prerogative of the acting prime minister.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894548"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The creation of a commissioner of the environment and sustainable development, the secretariat and an advisory council would require, clearly, the government to spend money and, therefore, a royal recommendation would be required as you, Mr. Speaker, have recently ruled. These issues also, clearly, require much further study.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894549"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it is time to act. The government is taking proactive steps on the environment. Very clearly, this is a government of positive action for Canadians, getting positive results.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894550"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3075383,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3075383&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-474</A> would unnecessarily deepen the authority of the commissioner with respect to the current petitions process.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894551"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Petitions are letters sent by Canadians to the Auditor General as a way to present their environmental concerns and questions to specific ministers of the federal government. Ministers are required to respond in writing within 120 days.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894552"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The commissioner concluded, in his 2007 report, that on balance the petitions process is a good news story. He noted:</div>
    </p><a name="Para894553"></a><p>
      <div>
        <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
          <tr valign="top">
            <td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>Our retrospective study of petitions shows that petitioners value the process, which provides a forum for voicing their concerns and assures them of a formal response. </small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
    </p><a name="Para894554"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The commissioner also flagged that the volume and the complexity of petitions has increased significantly in recent years. The current approach to petitions, according to the commissioner himself, is working very well. Let us spend our efforts on what really does need our attention.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894555"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is the proposal of this government: investment where it is necessary and where we are going to get positive results. We are currently taking steps to ensure that implementation of sustainable development is strengthened across the federal government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894556"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I mentioned earlier, a management review is currently under way that will draw on a decade of experience with the current approach and best practices internationally. That will identify clear means to improve the current approach. </div>
    </p><a name="Para894557"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is what the government is looking forward to doing, and is doing on many other files.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894558"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the government has taken steps to ensure greater department accountability for the strategy process. The Federal Accountability Act, which we are all on this side of the House very proud of, ensures that deputy ministers are responsible before Parliament for their management responsibilities, and that includes departmental commitments to sustainable development.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894559"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We already have the legislative and regulatory authority to strengthen the sustainable development strategy process and to ensure accountability for Canadians. This government is taking positive steps for Canadians, and we are getting positive results.</div>

    </p><a name="Para894561"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to begin by expressing our support for Bill C-474, which was introduced by my Liberal colleague, who is also a member of the Standing Committee on Environment and Sustainable Development. We will vote in favour of the bill in principle. In essence, the bill has two main goals. First, it provides for a sustainable development strategy based on the precautionary principle. Second, it provides for the appointment of an independent commissioner of the environment and sustainable development with the Auditor General's office.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894562"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We support the bill's first goal, which would create a sustainable development strategy for Canada. One thing I really like about the bill is that it reminds us of the importance of applying the precautionary principle to every decision made by the federal government. This has not been the case in the past, as we have seen clearly in various environment and sustainable development committees, not to mention with the environment commissioner, in the ten years since I first came to this House.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894563"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This principle is recognized internationally and should apply to all sectors and federal departments. That is where the problem is now. On page 29 of her 2003 report, the environment commissioner reminded us that in terms of sustainable development, objectives and related performance expectations need to be clearer, more concrete, and more results-oriented.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894564"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, results—especially outcomes—need to be more systematically measured. Performance reporting needs to be improved. That was a 2003 report.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894565"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that the Liberals are introducing this bill today, but the commissioners' reports show that the previous government did not implement a sustainable development strategy. Today, in this House, they can very well brag about introducing a bill on a sustainable development strategy, but there were a number of shortcomings in terms of sustainable development with the previous government. Once again, these shortcomings were revealed in the report by the Commissioner of the Environment in 2007. On page 39, she said: </div>

    </p><a name="Para894567"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither the previous Liberal government nor the current Conservative government have implemented adequate measures to ensure that sustainable development underlies each federal plan, policy and program. This is the other subject I want to discuss today.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894568"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The federal government has a useful tool at its disposal, which is the strategic environmental assessment. This is a useful tool as part of a sustainable development strategy but it has never been implemented here in Canada. For more than 25 years, the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A>'s Office has directed that every federal government policy, plan, program and bill—from every department—must be subject to an environmental assessment. These assessments should not be left to just the promoters. They must also be the rule in all federal departments. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1120"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1120"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1125"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1115"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1120">(1120)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para894569"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clear that neither this government nor the previous one ever applied strategic environmental assessment with any real diligence. In fact, a few years ago, in 2004, the Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development titled a chapter in one of her reports “Greening the tax system: Finance Canada dragging its feet”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894570"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In chapter 4 of that report, Ms. Gélinas noted that the federal government could not assure the public that the environmental impacts of new plans, policies or programs bound for Cabinet approval would be assessed systematically. Again using the example of Finance Canada, the commissioner referred to government Bill C-48, which was passed and would eventually entail yearly expenditures of $260 million primarily benefiting the oil and gas industry. Finance Canada never conducted a strategic environmental assessment on that bill, even though such an assessment is a key component of the department's sustainable development strategy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894571"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find it ironic that, on the government side, the member who spoke on a sustainable development strategy this morning was our friend from <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78930,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78930&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Fort McMurray—Athabasca</A>. That is where the growth in tar sands oil production will be the highest, yet the member for Fort McMurray—Athabasca is the one lecturing us about a sustainable development strategy. This goes to show how much the federal government, and this Conservative government in particular, cares about a sustainable development strategy. </div>
    </p><a name="Para894572"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to talk about interference in the provinces' jurisdictions. We support the bill in principle, because it emphasizes applying the precautionary principle by adopting sustainable development strategies, which must be specific to each department. However, Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3075383,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3075383&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-474</A> involves a great deal of interference in the provinces' jurisdictions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894573"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few years ago, Quebec adopted its own sustainable development strategy and appointed its own commissioner of the environment. We are wondering why this bill sets clear medium- and long-term targets in a series of areas. I will give a couple of examples.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894574"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it the federal government's job to set recycling targets for the provinces and especially for municipalities? Is it the federal government's job to develop a water consumption strategy? I do not think so.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894575"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Quebec especially, we have proven that our water quality is among the best and that we are able to put in place sustainable development strategies based on the precautionary principle. In addition, our environment commissioner has an international reputation. Harvey Mead works as an independent government watchdog to make sure the Government of Quebec is not tempted to ignore the principles of sustainable development, which seek to build a cohesive society through economic, social and environmental development.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894576"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, we will support Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3075383,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3075383&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-474</A> because we believe that each department must have a sustainable development strategy that incorporates the precautionary principle. We also support the appointment of an independent commissioner, as we have often stated in committee. We believe that this commissioner must be independent and must have similar powers to the Commissioner of Official Languages or the Privacy Commissioner. But it is clear that if this bill is referred to committee, we will have no choice but to amend it.</div>

    </p><a name="Para894578"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are struggling as a nation, under a new government, to assert the proper integration of the environment, the economy and the social well-being in Canada. This is a struggle that transcends Canada as a single nation state. It is a struggle that the planet is trying to achieve in terms of making progress and moving forward.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894579"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sustainable development for many Canadians is a conundrum. It is a mystery. What do we mean by sustainable development, some might say. In fact, many argue against moving forward in a coherent way, as is proposed by my colleague, because it is often very difficult, if not impossible, to define what sustainable development means.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894580"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sustainable development is not a destination. It is a direction for the way in which we order our affairs in Canada and around the world. It is a direction that looks to this proper integration of the economy, the way we operate in the free market, environmental integrity and, of course, the social well-being that flows from that appropriate integration.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894581"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sustainable development is a little bit like 50,000 pieces of a puzzle in a puzzle box without a cover picture on the box. Slowly, if we do this right, under a national sustainable development act, we will assemble 50 to 100 to 250 pieces of the puzzle at a time and we will slowly craft a new picture for the future, an idea, as I say, whose time has truly come.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894582"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only a few countries in the world actually have a commissioner for sustainable development and the environment. Our government was perspicacious. It was wise to create this position in Canada in the Auditor General's office.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894583"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am disappointed in the government's conduct around the motion that was passed through committee by all parties but the Conservatives to make truly independent the commissioner for the environment and sustainable development and strengthen that office. However, that is another matter, on which we just heard a ruling from the Speaker, and I am sure will continue to be debated in committee.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894584"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are core principles in the notion of sustainable development. The fact that we cannot necessarily describe what it looks like, what the picture looks like, does not mean that is an excuse for inaction. We know about the precautionary principle, which is increasingly informing our legislation in this country. We understand the polluter pays principle. Many of these principles have been codified through practice, and that is a very good thing.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894585"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to the notion of sustainable development and the strategies in the federal government, which the government is required to prepare, 24 to 25 or 26 line departments and a smattering of agencies, boards and commissions and occasionally crown corporations that prepare these strategies every two years, there are eight cross-cutting themes that cut right across all of these strategies.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894586"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, one of the challenges the government has not addressed whatsoever is the true accountability for performance under these strategies, which is why I so strongly support the bill put forward by my colleague from <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78515,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78515&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Don Valley West</A>. In part, one of the things the act would do is ground, locate and make responsible in the very centre of the federal administration, from a machinery of government reform perspective, it would very critically establish a sustainable development secretariat within the Privy Council office.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894587"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is where the buck stops. That is the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A>'s own personal department to backstop his political office, the Prime Minister's Office. If there were such a secretariat within the Privy Council office, it would help integrate all these strategies across all the line departments and make them more robust and more accountable for their performance and it would them all together with quantifiable and measurable goals.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1130"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1130"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1135"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1125"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1130">(1130)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para894588"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill also deals with things like making Canada a world leader in living sustainably, reducing our air pollution, changing our production consumption patterns, dealing with water stewardship, which is a critical issue for the future, and the kinds of cities in which we will live as quality of life becomes the defining factor for attracting capital now in our cities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894589"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All those questions are neatly tied into the bill put forward by my colleague. For the first time in recent Canadian history, we see a bill that is something we ought to be moving aggressively with as a Parliament going forward.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894590"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am disappointed that the government, in its own approach to the machinery of government issues around sustainable development, appears to be backing off. For example, the national round table on the environment and the economy, which I used to run, ought to be reporting, as it is structured, directly to the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> and the Privy Council office. Unfortunately, after nine years of such reporting functions, the Prime Minister in his wisdom has decided to shift the national round table out of his office and put it over into the line department called Environment Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894591"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people would say that seems to be coherent. In fact, it is completely incoherent because it sends a signal to Canada that environmental issues are marginalized issues, that sustainable development issues are only about the environment when they are not. What we are looking to do here through this bill is to fully integrate into our federal government, the nation state, a new approach which integrates right across all the line departments.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894592"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a perfect world, we may not have an environment department in due course because these issues would be treated, as they should be, in each line department at the right level and in the right way. Transport Canada and Agriculture Canada ought to be examining these questions and issues. </div>
    </p><a name="Para894593"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking this agency and pushing it over and marginalizing it with the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',105835,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=105835&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of the Environment</A> is in fact a step backwards. We are looking for more integration, not less.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894594"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those are some of the features of the bill that I think Canadians should be aware of that are particularly positive as we look to lead the world. </div>
    </p><a name="Para894595"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have lots to learn. The United Kingdom and Sweden, for example, by law require the production of a national sustainable development strategy with clear goals and objective reporting. Our previous government did two things that would strongly support and buttress this act. We developed eco-efficiency metrics. These are measurements, such as energy intensity measurements, water intensity measurements and materials intensity measurements. We devised these as a previous government with the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants so they could be measurable both in public and in private sectors in those settings.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894596"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, our previous government designed new environment and sustainable development indicators which ought to be used alongside this bill, this new approach, for national reporting. We would know then how well we were doing as a nation state, how well we were doing when it comes to air quality, water quality or the extent of wetlands in Canada or forest cover.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894597"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is all available, shrink-wrapped as they say, on the shelf for the government to use. Unfortunately, both of those initiatives dealing with eco-efficiency metrics and the environment and sustainable development indicators have been thrown out by the government as it continues to marginalize environmental issues in a line department, while grossly underfunding it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894598"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those are some of my comments. I am looking forward to seeing this bill arrive in committee. It is an idea whose time has come. I appreciate the fact that this would require a cabinet committee with a constant, unwavering focus on a sustainable development strategy. It reminds me of those folks who golf and who sometimes yell at the golf ball and ask it to sit down on the green somewhere. It is time for sustainable development to sit down on the green and the logical place for it is in PCO, something contemplated in this bill.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I first want to put on the record that the Conservative government believes in sustainable development. We do not just give lip service to it. We have taken some real action in the areas of water, air quality and climate change, which is why we are implementing comprehensive regulations of industrial air emissions. For the first time ever, we will be regulating the big polluters so they do their part as well.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894602"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said, we are taking action on protecting the water quality across our country, including tough new regulations against the dumping of raw sewage into our lakes, rivers and oceans, and by improving sewage treatment in municipalities. I was kind of taken aback when I realized that we did not have laws in place in respect to that already. It just makes a lot of sense. I think most of the public would be quite appalled or taken aback if they knew that we did not already have laws in place, that 13 long years of Liberal governments had not put something in place or previous governments before that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894603"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we are doing that. We also are regulating chemicals that are harmful to human health and to the environment. Our approach to toxic chemicals management leads the world. </div>
    </p><a name="Para894604"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It does not end there. We have done our best in terms of protecting Canada's natural heritage. In terms of those protected areas, major expansion is occurring as well.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894605"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also working on a new approach to sustainable development planning in Canada that builds upon the existing legislative framework, the framework that we already have. Indeed, the commissioner of the environment and sustainable development has already made the point that significant improvements to the current process can be made within the existing legislative framework and with the existing tools that we have. All it really takes is the will to act and to move ahead on it. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Conservative government recognizes that what is needed is action, not more legislation, more paper and so on, and certainly not more time and money spent on government processes.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894608"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The International Institute for Sustainable Development, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and others have recognized Canada's current legislative tool as having a great deal of merit, even if it has suffered from some challenges in terms of its implementation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894609"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be shortsighted to repeal what has the potential to be a real contribution to the federal planning process prior to completing a thorough analysis of it to determine how it might be better implemented. We have the tools needed to make substantial improvements for sustainable development and that is fully what we intend to be doing.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894610"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed Liberal private member's bill that is before us today is unnecessary and it is problematic on a number of levels. Some of those have been sketched out already but I will draw members' attention to a few more. </div>
    </p><a name="Para894611"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the scope of the bill is unclear. Although it is called the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3075383,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3075383&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">national sustainable development act</A>, the stated purpose of the legislation is to “...accelerate the elimination of major environmental problems and make environmental decision-making more transparent....”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894612"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am certain that my colleague is fully aware of the fact that the environment and sustainable development are not one and the same. They are not synonymous. To be sure, they are mutually exclusive, but there are some different facets involved.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894613"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the bill calls for the government to enshrine a set of sustainable development goals in legislation. The legislation itself, however, contains two rather different sets of sustainable development goals. One is in the text of the bill and another one is in a schedule appended to the bill, the latter of which includes some vague goals that are outside the stated purpose of the bill, as in the preface, one of those being creating genuine wealth.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894614"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, the bill states in its title that progress would be reported in “against a standard set of environmental indicators”. However, those indicators are not mentioned anywhere in the bill, nor is there any mechanism noted for the development of those environmental indicators.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1140"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1140"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1145"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1135"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1140">(1140)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para894615"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, one of the sets of goals in the bill includes goals that are not environmental in nature. If the legislation really does mean for there to be environmental indicators, exactly how non-environmental goals can be measured against a set of environmental indicators is rather unclear.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894616"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fourth point is that clause 13 of the bill calls for the commissioner of the environment and sustainable development to report on the state of the Canadian environment nationally and also by province and to report on progress in meeting each of the listed sustainable development goals nationally and by province on an annual basis relative to the performance of other industrialized nations.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894617"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is troubling about this part is that the bill implicates the provinces in terms of reporting on both the state of the environment and on their progress in achieving the sustainable development goals. However, the bill does not provide for any tools to engage them in acting on the goals, such as by providing new resources, nor on the results of any report findings. This is quite unworkable and amounts to a recipe for conflict with the provinces and our territories.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894618"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifth, the timeframes associated with this piece of legislation are wholly unworkable. The government would be thrust into an ineffective cycle of continuous planning and preparing with no time left for implementation before the cycle would repeat itself again. The Conservative government believes in action, not just planning for action as the Liberals have sometimes done.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894619"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the most outstanding examples is in clause 10 which states:</div>
    </p><a name="Para894620"></a><p>
      <div>
        <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
          <tr valign="top">
            <td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small> Within 30 days after a National Sustainable Development Strategy is tabled in each House of Parliament, the Minister shall make regulations prescribing the targets and the caps referred to in the National Sustainable Development Strategy and revoke any regulations prescribing targets and caps referred to in the National Sustainable Development Strategy that was tabled previously.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
    </p><a name="Para894621"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyone familiar with the regulatory process, as the member no doubt is, knows that this is completely unworkable. Good pieces of legislation take time to prepare. There are notices and there are various things in that process. They require true and genuine consultations with the stakeholders. They are not something that can be drafted in just a matter of days.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894622"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sixth problem with the bill before us today is that the process outlined for consultation in the bill in reference to the development of the national sustainable development strategy is ineffectual and unnecessarily onerous. It calls for consultations only once a draft of the strategy has already been written. Every guide to meaningful consultations will tell us that consultations need to be started early, well before the approach is decided upon in respect to what we are going to do.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894623"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The approach outlined in the legislation before us today only brings in consultations late in the process. It requires an onerous level of ministerial involvement and response, and is a staggering waste of time and resources for an uncertain result.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894624"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the ministerial duty to make regulations, this piece of legislation is highly and unnecessarily prescriptive. It enacts upon the minister a number of duties, leaving no room for ministerial discretion. It is unproductive and does not enable the minister to make effective improvements to the sustainable development planning process. Therefore, such rigidity is a hindrance to the process, not a help.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894625"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, the bill is unnecessary. Its scope and its intent are unclear. The authorities and processes it describes are not thoughtful and not thought out in a clear and deliberate way. </div>
    </p><a name="Para894626"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is needed to make progress on sustainability is not new legislation. It is the ability to set national federal level objectives in a reasonable manner and within workable timeframes, and to have a clear mechanism for measuring the government's progress. We can do that under existing legislation and with existing tools.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894627"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Conservative government is committed to sustainable development. That is why we are taking concrete action to make improvements rather than spending time and resources on instituting new and unnecessary legislative processes. That is why we will not be supporting the bill. We feel it is flawed on a number of points as we have outlined here.</div>

If Canada continues in the way it has been proceeding in the last 30 years, the climate change and greenhouse gas emissions will go sky high.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894629"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last 20 to 30 years there has been a dramatic increase of greenhouse gas emissions. We have heard a lot of empty promises. I recall in 1993 in the former Liberal government's road map, the red book, there was a promise to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2000. Of course, that did not happen. They went up by 25% instead of going down by 20%. We have lost a lot of time. However, that does not mean we should not take action on the environmental file. </div>
    </p><a name="Para894630"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We absolutely have to deal with the oil sands development. We have to look at putting a moratorium on oil sands development so that we can control our greenhouse gas emissions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894631"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be totally unfair if our generation and the Conservative government did not take action on the environmental file, because we would leave a terrible environmental legacy for future generations. It would not be fair to our young people in Canada and elsewhere on the planet.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894632"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to deal with the oil sands development, because the majority of greenhouse gas emissions comes from that development, but we also have to deal with the whole question of the building code.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894633"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For years many provinces have been saying that it is really important for Canada to take a leadership role and define what is sustainable development.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894634"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my riding in downtown Toronto a lot of condominiums are being built. Often ordinary Canadians, the folks downtown, ask why these new developments are not state of the art, and energy efficient. They want to know why are we continuing to build buildings that are not energy efficient and why we are not putting in solar panels or wind devices to capture solar and wind energy. The building code is a provincial jurisdiction. If we were to raise the point of energy efficient buildings with the territorial and provincial governments, they would say it is not being done because the federal government has not determined the guidelines for a green building, a building that is energy efficient.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894635"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a tremendous amount of buck passing between different levels of government. As a result any of the new housing that is being built is not necessarily energy efficient. There is a great deal of concern and desire among ordinary Canadians to live in buildings that are energy efficient.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894636"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been a lot of discussion regarding targets and goals. Instead of focusing on this bill, I want to talk about how we can lock the Bali targets into what the government does.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894637"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to have 80% reduction below the 1990 levels by 2050. We have to develop medium term targets of 25% below the 2020 targets. The world came together at the Bali conference and said that has to be done. We have to find ways to lock the government in, but this bill does not do that, unfortunately. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1150"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1150"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1155"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1145"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1150">(1150)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para894638"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another private member's bill, Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3073285,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3073285&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-377</A>. I hope the House will debate that bill because it certainly would lock in the government with specific targets.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894639"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to targets and transparency, it is important to have a reporting mechanism. A progress report is needed every five years on how the government is performing. Within six months of a bill being passed it is really important that a road map be established. Also, if the government does not meet the targets we have to ensure there are offences and penalties in place. The other aspect that is very important is that there be regular reviews. There need to be independent outside coordinators to say that the government is performing and is on the right track so that the people of Canada know that the government is taking the right route to deal with greenhouse gas emissions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894640"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, thank you for allowing me to talk briefly about the importance of sustainable development. I certainly hope that the government focuses on the environment as one of its prime priorities.</div>

    </p><a name="Para894642"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently the polling firm POLLARA asked Canadians what their priorities were, what were the most important things on their minds in terms of what the Government of Canada and Parliament should address. It came as no surprise that the issue of climate change and greenhouse gas emissions were the top issues to be addressed.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894643"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout the debate so far, it is very clear that all parties, except the government, support the proposed legislation. The government continues along the same kind of approach toward climate change issues as it did when Kyoto was the big topic of discussion. </div>
    </p><a name="Para894644"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remind the House that our international commitment to achieve targets within certain timeframes was opposed by the government. In fact, it described Kyoto as a money sucking socialist plot. That is the starting point of the Government of Canada with regard to climate change, that it is some sort of a plot to somehow deal with the economic implications to deal with climate change and how it might impact what the government really has in mind.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894645"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government wants the economic benefits to continue to operate at the same and more intense levels than we have today. I must admit it did not surprise me that one of its proposals was to allow the petroleum industry to continue to produce its products at the same level of intensity that created greenhouse gases. There was no reduction. It could continue to increase as long as the net intensity was not greater than today. That is basically a policy of, “Let's do more of nothing. Whatever we have today is acceptable”. </div>
    </p><a name="Para894646"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the science before Canadians is very clear. We have a problem and it has to be addressed, not simply left to the next generation to try to deal with the consequences of the failure of the government to address climate change issues. This is the real issue. </div>
    </p><a name="Para894647"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look at the record. Look at what the government has done or what it has not done with regard to climate change. Virtually every program introduced by the previous Liberal government has been cancelled by the current government. Why? Because it does not want any impact on the economy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894648"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole concept of having sustainable economic development calls on Canadians, business and individuals, to do their share. It means that when we do things within business and industry, we have to ensure not only do we not make it worse, but we make it better. We have to show progress.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894649"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not good enough to say that some time in 2050 we will hit some target. I doubt anybody who is currently in the House will still be here come 2050. This is passing off some sort of an undertaking to someone else. It is very clear that by 2050 the trend line we are on right now will have enormous consequences. If we look at poverty groups, like Make Poverty History, they will talk about the implications of not addressing climate change on the international scene. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The economic impacts of doing nothing are going to be much greater than anyone can imagine. It is going to exacerbate the economic deprivation of many countries around the world. It is going to take away important land that people need to earn livelihood.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894651"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians have been asked, through established programs, to do their share. If members are interested, they should go to a website called www.carbonfootprint.com, which is a very important site. It gives tips to Canadians as to some of things they can do to make a contribution toward reducing CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. It shows line by line the monthly reduction of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions if we do certain things, like getting a tune-up for our cars or buying energy efficient appliances. I think there are at least a dozen or so examples of what each and every Canadian can do.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894652"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians are doing that and they are prepared to do it. They are prepared to buy energy efficient automobiles if the government would only get it straight as to what the feebates schedule should be. The Conservatives raise programs and suggestions, but never have a plan to follow it through.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894653"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I raise these things because the bill has articulated, in a very clear fashion, the extreme importance for us to have a long term sustainable development strategy. It means that we ensure we leave a situation better than when we got it, and to date we have not. To date, we need to have a plan.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will begin with the remarks made by the Speaker on the question of royal recommendation. As I indicated in a reply to him previously, we recognize the difficulty of the royal recommendation in establishing an independent commissioner right now. We support the principle of doing that, but we think this is mostly about a national sustainable development act. Therefore, we will use the existing office of the Commissioner of the Environment and the existing mandate.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894659"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will also no longer require the commissioner to evaluate, in advance, the likelihood of success. We think there is a fair criticism there and we would be better off having the commissioner monitor and then audit the success of a plan developed by the government as envisaged under the bill.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894660"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, I want to make the point about the advisory committee on sustainable development. We will make it clear that these positions are non-remunerative. Hence, we will avoid the necessity for royal recommendation.</div>

    </p><a name="Para894683"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To indicate just how important this is, let me reiterate something that I said in the House of Commons when Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3076458,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3076458&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-2</A> was introduced for second and third readings. I indicated to the House at that time that the government considered tackling violent crime and the provisions of that particular act so important, that if there were any attempt to sabotage that, derail it or gut that bill, we would consider it a confidence motion.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894684"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, I was pleased that it passed the House of Commons in November of last year, and then it was on its way to the Senate. Interestingly enough, there were a number of people whom I ran into at the Christmas break who said, “Congratulations, you got your bill through. You must be very happy”. I said, “Well, it has gotten through the House of Commons. It has not gotten through the Senate yet. That is not quite the same thing”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894685"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonetheless, I remained optimistic. I want to see the bill passed. We got to January of 2008 and the bill had been in the Senate since the end of November. </div>
    </p><a name="Para894686"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the things that got me very nervous was when the Liberal Premier of Ontario, Mr. Dalton McGuinty, approached the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',105458,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=105458&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Leader of the Opposition</A> and indicated to him that he wanted to see this passed because this was good for the province of Ontario, this kind of thing had support in the province of Ontario, just as it had support right across this country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894687"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',105458,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=105458&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Leader of the Opposition</A> sort of hummed and hawed, and he was not sure about mandatory jail terms for people who commit serious gun crimes, that is when I started to get very nervous because I had this feeling that the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',105458,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=105458&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Leader of the Opposition</A> might get the Senate to do the dirty work that he did not want to do in the House of Commons, and I think that is very wrong.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894688"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was prepared the week before last and was scheduled to go before the Senate committee to address the issues, then my appearance before the committee was cancelled. The committee said it could wait an extra week, so I went last Wednesday, but I made it very clear to the committee members that these issues had been around for a long time and that these were important issues for Canadians. </div>
    </p><a name="Para894689"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was quite frank with them, as they were with me. I indicated to them that if this bill could not be passed by the end of this month, if they could not expedite this, if they could not fast-track this bill to get it done by the end of February, that I believed I had no choice except to advise the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> that I thought this to be a confidence measure and I would leave it in his capable hands.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894690"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have not received the kind of help that we would have liked from the Liberals in the House of Commons, and we are not getting it right now from the Liberals in the Senate, and that is too bad because I think I have been very honest about this bill. </div>
    </p><a name="Para894691"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The components of this bill have been before the Senate before. The provisions that would protect 14 and 15 year olds from adult sexual predators have already been before the Senate. I remember when it did not get passed by the Senate last June. I remember speaking to a reporter in my hometown of Niagara Falls and I said I was disappointed that 14 and 15 year olds were not as well protected as they should be from adult sexual predators because this bill did not get past the Senate.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894692"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was in the summer of 2007 and when I went home for Christmas, again the provisions that protect 14 and 15 year olds that are in the tackling violent crime bill were in the Senate, so I had to say the same thing over again, that 14 and 15 year olds were not as well protected in this country as they should be. That is a shame.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894693"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I hear the humming and hawing from the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',105458,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=105458&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Leader of the Opposition</A> to his colleague, the Liberal Premier of Ontario. The man is not in the business of trying to help us get our legislation through. He has his own agenda, but is there anybody in this country who thinks that the Liberal Premier of Ontario is intervening just to help out the federal Conservatives? I do not think so. He is doing it because it is the right thing to do.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say to members of the Liberal Party that they do not have to listen to me. We have made it very clear, the importance we place on this. The Liberals should listen to some of their colleagues. Mr. Chomiak, the Attorney General of Manitoba, has told me on a number of occasions how important these provisions are to him. He has made it very clear. We do not share the same political party, but we share some of the concerns about crime in this country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894695"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said to members of the opposition, fighting crime is not something that takes place when there is a disaster or a murder on the streets of some of our largest cities. That is not when we wake up to the tackling violent crime agenda. It is not something that can just wait until the election comes. We get all kind of support during the election when everybody wants to be tough on crime. I say be tough on crime between elections. That is what I want to see. We should stand up for law-abiding Canadians, for victims, between elections.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894696"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is what I am asking members to do and this is why I am so pleased that my colleague, the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',105838,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=105838&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Leader of the Government in the House of Commons and Minister for Democratic Reform</A>, has introduced this very important issue.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894697"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been very clear throughout this process. We made it a priority since the beginning of 2006. In the very first Speech from the Throne that we presented to Parliament, we said that tackling violent crime was our priority and that victims come first. We want Canadians to know that there are a group of individuals in Parliament who stand up for law-abiding Canadians because people are worried about their communities, worried about safe streets, and worried about the sometimes forgotten individual when crimes take place.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894698"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was very pleased and very proud to introduce the first federal ombudsman for the victims of crime. My colleagues joined with me and others in our government in pushing that initiative. Why? Because there is somebody who speaks for everybody in this town. There are more special interest groups than any of us could count, but my colleagues asked, who is here to stand up for victims of crime, who is that individual, where is he or she? </div>
    </p><a name="Para894699"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That office did not exist until this Conservative government created the first office of the ombudsman for the victims of crime and appointed the first ombudsman. That is a tremendous step forward in standing up for those sometimes forgotten individuals.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894700"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that Canadians do support the approach that the federal Conservatives are taking, that our government is taking. I have found it more than just passing interesting that within the last week there was a CTV strategic council poll that said that an overwhelming majority of Canadians believed Canada's justice system was too lenient on repeat offenders. This reiterates and underscores what we have been saying on this side of the House, that we have to have a criminal justice system that responds to the legitimate concerns of Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894701"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I indicated when I began my remarks, that the Liberal Premier of Ontario supports us. Mr. Chomiak, the Attorney General from the New Democratic Party in Manitoba supports what we are doing. We have had very good support from the N.S. justice minister, Mr. Murray Scott and his successor. He is very supportive of what we are trying to do. Indeed, right across this country, we have people at the provincial level who have spoken up and who are very interested in seeing legislation of this type passed.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894702"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many components of the tackling violent crime act, but other individual groups have come forward as well. Mothers Against Drunk Driving, MADD, has come forward. It wants to see the bill passed and become law. The Canadian Police Association, Ottawa Police, the Canadian Resource Centre for Victims of Crime, the Centre for Substance Abuse Awareness, thousands of Canadians right across this country have written expressing their opinions that they want to see the bill passed.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not asking Parliament to do anything that Parliament has not had the opportunity to have a look at in depth. I have pointed out on a number of occasions that every single component of the bill has been before Parliament since 2006, never mind 2007. Every single component of this has been before Parliament since 2006.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mandatory prison terms for serious gun crimes was one of the first pieces of legislation we introduced. On the age of protection, we recommended changes in 2006. The provisions with respect to dangerous offenders, the impaired driving provisions and the reverse onus on bail for serious gun crimes are all elements that have been before Parliament for quite some time.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894705"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not something new. People say we are trying to push this through. We are not trying to get the thing through in a hurry. It has been here a long time, too long. This should be the law of the country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894706"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When people ask me why we put it all together, I say it is very simple. We did not get it passed when we had it in five different components. Half of the provisions ended up in the Senate and were lost. Nothing happened. The Senate went home for the summer and these things did not get passed, I think to the detriment of Canadians, and the other couple of bills were here in the House of Commons.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894707"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the fall of 2007, since we did not get any of the five pieces of legislation done, I said, “Let us put them all together and see what our chances are”. We underscored the importance of this to our government by indicating that we would consider it a confidence measure if there were any attempt to sabotage the bill.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894708"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is it that we have? What are we asking Canadians to accept? Indeed, Canadians are buying into it, but what are we asking the House of Commons and the Senate to accept? Let us have a look at some of the things we are saying.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894709"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For illegal firearm possession and use by persons involved in criminal gangs, we know that type of activity is increasing. We are saying there will be a mandatory five year sentence if one is in the business of using a gun or associated with gangs. What kind of offences are we talking about? We are talking about attempted murder, sexual assault with a gun, aggravated sexual assault, kidnapping, robbery, extortion and hostage taking. This is not jaywalking.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894710"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember standing here when we introduced the bill. I had one opposition member say to me that he did not understand that a lot of the people who commit those crimes do not understand the consequences of their actions. I said, “that is where I want to help”. </div>
    </p><a name="Para894711"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We want to ensure that any individuals who want to get involved with these serious firearms offences will have the opportunity to focus on the consequences of their actions. We are prepared to do that and any individual who does not get the message after the first five year sentence, we will continue to help by making it a seven year mandatory prison term. This is exactly what the country wants and what the country focuses on.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894712"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We hear it when people pick up a paper and read about a drive-by shooting in one of our major cities. They start calling for this type of legislation. I tell them the same thing, that it is already here before the House of Commons and the Parliament of Canada. Our job is to get it passed and that is what we are asking this Parliament to do.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894713"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are going to strengthen the bail provisions with respect to gun offences. We are putting the onus on those alleged criminals to show that they do not pose a threat to public safety and that they will not flee before trial.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894714"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is it necessary? There are a number of reasons. I think it is only a matter of fairness. If someone wants to get involved with some serious gun crimes, if a person has a pattern of being involved with serious gun crimes, if a person is involved with guns and gangs, particularly in our major cities, what is wrong with putting the onus on such a person to show why he or she should be back out on the street?</div>
    </p><a name="Para894715"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an interesting product of this particular provision. I have had police officers in both Montreal and Toronto, as well as other law enforcement agencies, who have mentioned something very interesting about that provision. They tell me that this would send out the right message. They say that if individuals who have a pattern of gang-related or serious gun crime offences, if they are back out on the street in a couple of hours, guess what? </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1220"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1220"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1225"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1215"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1220">(1220)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para894716"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That sends out the exact wrong message to the victim. It sends out the wrong message to potential witnesses. Indeed, if that individual is back out on the street, it sends out the wrong message to the neighbourhood. This provision is exactly what we need and it is what this country wants. We are determined to provide it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894717"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I indicated as I began my opening remarks, as I have mentioned on a number of occasions, that one of the important provisions of this bill is that it will raise the age of protection in this country from 14 to 16. Canadians ask why this not been done. I tell people quite honestly that this is not something out of the 20th century; this is something that should have been changed in the 19th century.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894718"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is how long this has been around, and what happens is that it allows adult sexual predators to prey upon individuals as young as 14 and 15 years of age. That is absolutely reprehensible. It is exactly what our party has to take a stand against. That is exactly what we are doing here.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894719"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One police officer gave me an example. He told me that they had encountered some character from Texas, about 40 years old, who struck up a correspondence by email with a 14 year old. He comes to Canada and has sexual relations with a 14 year old and the police cannot do anything about it. They cannot do anything.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894720"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have had police officers ask me what they are supposed to tell parents when their 14 year old or 15 year old is being victimized by some of these predators. It is cold comfort to say to parents that we are sorry, it is not the law of Canada and these predators can do that in Canada. That is absolutely wrong and we are absolutely determined to change that. </div>
    </p><a name="Para894721"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I appeared before the Senate last Wednesday. I can tell members about some of the feedback I received. Someone said that this would drive youth prostitution underground. I did not know what that was all about. Another point was that this would discourage young people from reporting sexually transmitted diseases. I have no idea where that is coming from.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894722"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are talking about protecting 14 year olds and 15 year olds from sexual predators. This is exactly the kind of law this country should have.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894723"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There also are provisions to tighten up and improve Canada's impaired driving laws, providing the framework for the drug recognition expert program to be effective.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894724"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. member:</b> C'est bon.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894725"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Rob Nicholson:</b> My colleague says “bon”. Yes, you bet.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894726"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is exactly why MADD Canada has come forward and is urging us to get this passed. Again, we are not talking about people who are employed by the Conservative Party. These people are dedicated to the best interests of this country. They have come forward and have asked us to please get these things through. There are improvements there. </div>
    </p><a name="Para894727"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There also are improvements to the dangerous offender legislation. How often do we hear about some individual who clearly should have been labelled a dangerous offender, who does not get that designation, for whatever reason, and who gets back out on the street and is then charged with additional crimes?</div>
    </p><a name="Para894728"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then the cry goes out as to why the government is not tightening up the dangerous offender legislation. We have done that here. That is what Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3076458,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3076458&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-2, the Tackling Violent Crime Act</A>, does. It does that specifically. It responds to the concerns of Canadians with respect to dangerous offenders.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894729"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that what we are asking this Parliament to do is infinitely reasonable. As I said, Parliament has had these provisions, all of them, since 2006. We have listened to some of the concerns from the opposition parties. We have made changes to the components of this legislation as it was originally introduced in the House of Commons. We are simply asking Parliament to do something that is reasonable. </div>
    </p><a name="Para894730"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At one time the members of the Liberal Party said they would like to fast track justice legislation. That is great. They can get hold of their friends down the aisle and tell them to fast track it, to get it done by the end of February. That is not unreasonable. Let them do it. Let us get it done.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894731"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am absolutely convinced that the people of Canada support what we are trying to do to fight violent crime in this country. My colleagues have made it clear that if the opposition parties, or anybody else, want to make this an issue, go to the Canadian people and say that their soft on crime approach and their delays on these things are justifiable, they can make that case to the people of Canada. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I am absolutely convinced that if given the opportunity the people of this country will support what we are doing as a party and as a government, because I firmly believe, and I always have believed, that we are certainly acting in the best interests of all Canadians.</div>

Every element of the bill that is currently before the Senate was in the Senate prior to prorogation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894734"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2006 the Liberal Party offered to fast track this legislation, but we were refused. In 2007 we offered to fast track it and again we were refused. The bills passed through the House and were sitting in the Senate and being dealt with in an expeditious manner. Then the government killed its own legislation by prorogation. </div>
    </p><a name="Para894735"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what we have here is a minister telling us to pass this legislation, to pass this legislation because we must have this legislation, and all he is doing is recycling his speeches from last year because he likes to make those speeches. For goodness' sake, the Conservative government has wasted a year and a half on its own legislation and now it has the gall to tell the Senate to hurry up.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894736"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My goodness gracious me. It is an extraordinary circumstance in which a minister kills his own legislation through prorogation, then comes back to the House and says he has a new package and he wants us to pass it immediately. That is my number one point.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894737"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My number two point is about the further hypocrisy of the government. Two bills, Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2181694,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2181694&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-292</A> and Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2195279,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2195279&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-293</A>, have been sitting in the Senate since March 2007. Conservative senators stonewall them, divert them and do everything but deal with them. Therefore, I wonder if the minister's enthusiasm to have the senators move on his own legislation extends to other bills that this chamber has in fact passed.</div>

Let me tell members that there is nothing before the Senate that is more important than the justice related legislation, whether it be the security certificate legislation or the tackling violent crime legislation. These bills are hugely important.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894739"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. member said that all the bills were sitting in the Senate and being dealt with expeditiously in the Senate, but they did not get passed, and that is my point. We went home in June. I told people the truth when they asked me about why this legislation did not get passed. I said that 14 year olds and 15 year olds are not as well protected in this country from sexual predators as they should be and the blame goes right across the aisle.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894740"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is the beautiful thing about that group sitting across from me. I know that many of them actually agree with what we in this government are doing. It was of more than just passing interest in regard to the original Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2172019,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2172019&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-10</A>, mandatory penalties for people who commit firearms offences, and people can check the record: there were about five members of the Liberal Party who did not even buy into the approach that the Liberal Party was taking. They stood with the government and I do not blame them, because those five members were right. It was the rest of the Liberals who were wrong. </div>
    </p><a name="Para894741"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know the game those members are playing. It is not just me: they can call their friend Dalton McGuinty down at Queen's Park and ask him why he is pushing for this legislation to be passed so quickly. They can tell him it is once again sitting in the Senate being expeditiously dealt with there. They could tell him that is wonderful and ask if that is not good enough for him. I do not always agree with the premier of Ontario, but I know he would agree with me on this one. He would just tell them to get it passed.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894742"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every so often those members throw out the words “fast track”. Great. Fast track it, then, I say, and get it passed by the end of this month. They have seen all these pieces of legislation. We have taken into consideration what opposition members wanted and suggested. We were very reasonable in the package that we put before the House. I am now asking them to do the right thing for this country and get the bill passed.</div>

    </p><a name="Para894744"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This morning, we have a rather glaring example of an archaic system. We see a Senate that is no longer relevant. The House of Commons, whose members are elected, is now required to hold a debate today to tell the non-elected members of the Senate to hurry up and study a bill because it urgently needs to be passed. The Bloc Québécois has clearly said that it is in favour of the motion presented by the government this morning.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894745"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We voted in favour of the bill and, furthermore, we believe that the Senate should not have any such responsibility. We believe the Senate should no longer even exist.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894746"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That said, I do find it somewhat worrisome to see the government take such a stand, as though it were trying to convince the House to pass the bill.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894747"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us get things straight. The debate was already held in this House. The bill has been in the Senate for months now and the government has suddenly decided it is an urgent matter. I believe this has more to do with an election strategy than reality. However, to avoid playing into the minister's hand, the Bloc Québécois will vote in favour of the motion. We were in favour of the bill and we think the Senate should deal with it as soon as possible.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894748"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can the minister tell us whether this motion is more of an electoral diversion than an attempt at getting the bill through the Senate, where it has been dormant?</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will tell the House what I am worried about. I just do not want the Liberal-dominated Senate to be doing the dirty work for the Liberals in the House of Commons. If they want to defeat these pieces of legislation such as the tackling violent crime act, fine. I indicated that on one of the components there, five of them went against their own party in support of the government. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am just saying to them to do what other people do. They do not have to take my word for it. They can take the word of those organizations. They can take the word of the people at MADD, or the premier of Ontario, or former attorney general Michael Bryant, who said that the “federal Liberal approach” to fighting crime was something out of “the summer of love”. That is not something that I made up. That is something he said and of course I agree with him. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me say for the hon. member from the Bloc, yes, we want it passed, but we were very clear when it was in the House of Commons. He and other members will remember me saying that yes, we were prepared to go to the people of the country in regard to any attempt to sabotage that bill because we believe that it is so important for the benefit of this country.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, we were prepared to go to the people of the country.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did the government then move second reading of the age of consent bill? That is the bill that would raise the legal age of consent from 14 to 16 years.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government tables its bill under parliamentary rules, House of Commons rules. It moves first reading and the motion is automatically deemed to have been adopted. The bill then goes on to the order paper and it stays there until the government moves second reading.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That bill received first reading on November 23, 2006. Guess what? It sat. The government did not move second reading debate through the end of November 2006, the entire month of December 2006 and the entire month of January 2007. That government did not move second reading of the bail reform bill until February 13. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it not a coincidence, that is a bill which we offered to fast track. That is a bill that could have been law. It could have been law for over a year now, and that government did not take us up on it.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is a government that sends ten percenters into ridings of my colleagues in Manitoba, in Ontario, in British Columbia, claiming that the Liberals are obstructing the government's justice agenda. The government obstructed its own agenda.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to ask myself the following question: is this simple incompetence on the part of the government or is this government being wilfully incompetent? </div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para894786"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is that pure incompetence on the part of the government or is it wilful incompetence in delaying its own legislation?</div>
    </p><a name="Para894787"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those are just two things that we find in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3076458,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3076458&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-2</A> which could have been the law for over a year now had the Conservative government actually been truthful to its claim about victims being its main priority. Had that been the truth, the government would have taken the Liberals up on our offer to fast-track the bill and the age of consent would have been 16 years old December 2006 and reverse onus on bail for firearm related offences would have been the law over a year ago.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894788"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it gets even better. The government says that the Senate has now had Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3076458,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3076458&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-2</A> longer than all stages in the House. The government is counting on the fact that most Canadians will not know the parliamentary agenda and calendar. Bill C-2 was sent to the Senate on December 12, 2007. Parliament adjourned December 14, 2007. Parliament did not resume until Monday, January 28, 2008. The government tabled this motion claiming that the Senate was wilfully obstructing the government's tackling crime agenda.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894789"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had the government been so concerned with Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3076458,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3076458&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-2</A> and so concerned about victims and about getting the legislation that it claims is the cornerstone of its priority and agenda, why did it not table a motion last fall for a message to be sent to the Senate informing the Senate that when it receives Bill C-2, we expect it to be reported back to us by x date? The government had all the authority and power to do that last fall but it did not. </div>
    </p><a name="Para894790"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again I must ask whether it was mere incompetence. Is it because the government after two years still does not understand the Standing Orders, which is what we call the rules of this House? Is it wilful incompetence? The government understands full well the authority and powers it has under the House of Commons rules but chooses not to use them in the hopes that most Canadians will not know that it is the government that is actually obstructing its own agenda.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894791"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us talk about another obstruction. I mentioned how most of the bills, except for Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3108131,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3108131&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-27</A>, which is the dangerous offender piece of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3076458,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3076458&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-2</A>, had already moved through the House and had been referred to the Senate late May, early June, late June of 2007. The Senate only had a couple of days, according to the parliamentary calendar, before Parliament adjourned for the summer. We were scheduled to come back the third Monday of September 2007 but the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A>, in his wisdom, or in his incompetence or in his wilful incompetence decided to prorogue Parliament. </div>
    </p><a name="Para894792"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does that mean? Under the rules and procedures and Standing Orders, it means that every piece of legislation in front of the House of Commons or in front of the Senate automatically dies. The government killed its own age of consent bill, its reverse onus on bail bill and its impaired driving bill, which is interesting because that is the bill we supported wholeheartedly.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1255"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1255"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1300"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1250"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1255">(1255)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para894793"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder if MADD, Mothers Against Drunk Drivers, understands that if the impaired driving bill is not the law today it has absolutely nothing to do with the official opposition or with the Liberal senators, but has everything to do with the government's own decision to obstruct its own legislation, not to move its own legislation through the House of Commons in a timely fashion and then to prorogue and kill its own legislation. That legislation could have been the law for almost a year now had the government not wilfully obstructed its own legislation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894794"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us take the dangerous offenders bill. The <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',105826,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=105826&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada</A> talked about how that legislation would ensure that Canadians who commit violent, egregious crimes will not be free on the streets because of the changes that it brought to the dangerous offender system.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894795"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the things that the government is not telling Canadians is that the way the system worked before the government brought in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3108131,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3108131&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-27</A>, the crown prosecutor had full discretion as to whether he or she would apply for a dangerous offender hearing. The government has done absolutely nothing to change that with its tackling crime legislation. The crown will still decide. It does not matter if it is someone who has committed heinous crimes one time, been sent to prison, served the sentence, comes out, does it again, is found guilty and serves another sentence, the crown can still decide whether it will apply for a dangerous offender hearing.</div>

    </p><a name="Para894803"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it simply that the government is so incompetent that it did not understand how the dangerous offender system and long term offender system actually operated?

    </p><a name="Para894804"></a><p>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I repeat, is this government simply incompetent or is it wilfully incompetent?</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para894806"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I talked about the prorogation of Parliament. In proroguing Parliament, the government killed the age of consent bill, the bail reform bill, its mandatory minimums bill, the impaired driving bill and the dangerous offender bill. Then when the government brought Parliament back with the new throne speech, it announced to great trumpeting and chest beating that tackling crime would be a major plank in its policy, its agenda and action plan. What did it do?</div>
    </p><a name="Para894807"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government could have reinstated those bills where they were, which was in the Senate. If the government were so concerned about the Senate possibly taking too long to deal with it, it could have brought in a motion, as it did last Friday, giving a deadline to the Senate for dealing with the age of consent bill, the impaired driving bill, the dangerous offender bill, the mandatory minimums bill and the bail reform bill. It did not do that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894808"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, one again has to ask if it is shear incompetence on the part of the government or wilful incompetence.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894809"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My parents raised me, and I am sure many people in the House, if not all were raised the same, to give people the benefit of the doubt. However, my grandmother also used to say, “The first time is a mistake. The second time is a bad habit”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894810"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first time the government did not take up the Liberal offer in October 2006 to fast track the age of consent bill, to raise it from 14 to 16 years old, one could say that was a mistake. However, when it again refused to take it up in March 2007, that was no longer a mistake. That was a bad habit.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894811"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the government decided to kill the age of consent bill by proroguing Parliament in the summer of 2007, that was not a mistake. I have come to the conclusion that the government's incompetence is not shear incompetence, but it is wilful incompetence.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894812"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then that begs the question. What would be the reason, the justification, for a government to be wilfully incompetent? I am not at a point where I can answer that. While I developed the—</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Marlene Jennings:</b> Mr. Speaker, let us look at what some of the witnesses had to say at committee. They came before the committee on Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2304794,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2304794&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-22</A>, age of consent.

They came back for the reverse onus on bail hearings for firearm related offences bill. They came back for the dangerous offender bill. They came back for the mandatory minimums bill.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894816"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us hear what a representative from one of these associations had to said. This was on November 14, 2007, on Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3076458,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3076458&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-2</A>, in front of the House of Commons legislative committee. It was the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police. The representative said that quick fixes and band-aids were no longer sufficient, that a comprehensive national but locally focused strategy was required to really tackle crime and that the legislative priority for the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police were guns and gangs, child predators, as two example.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1305"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1305"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1310"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1300"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1305">(1305)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para894817"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police said that because of its legislative priorities, it had asked and pleaded with the Conservative government for modernization of investigative techniques. The association said that the Modernization of Investigative Techniques Act, also called MITA, under the previous Liberal government, died as a result of the election. The association pleaded with the Conservative government to bring it back. It waited all through 2006. The government did not act. It waited again all through 2007. The government did not act. </div>
    </p><a name="Para894818"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is now February 11, and the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police is still waiting for the government to bring in the legislation for which it has been begging and pleading, that it says it needs in order to deal effectively with violent crime, gun crime, gang crime, sexual predators and child sexual predators. The Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police has asked the government to bring in legislation modernizing investigative techniques for over two years now. What has the government done? What has the government's response been to the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police and the Canadian Police Association? </div>
    </p><a name="Para894819"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the response has been not to bring in any legislation on that. Second, the government has refused to fast track my private member's bill that would do exactly this. I offered the government to take it over if it wanted the credit for it. It is more important to get it into the law and to give our law enforcement officers the investigative tools they need in the 21st century when they try to fight crime committed through our cyberspace. The government again, as it did with the Liberal offer to fast track the age of consent and the bail reform bills, as it did with virtually every attempt on the part of the official opposition to make Parliament be effective and efficient and put Canadians and their safety and security of Canadians first, turned its head and ignored the opposition. The government acted as though it heard nothing.</div>

On the ninth day the government tabled its motion saying that the Senate majority was not providing appropriate priority to the passage of Bill C-2, when the government in fact was obstructing its own legislation.</div>

If I go to February 7, when the motion was tabled by the government, that is 31 days plus 7, which is 38 days. The Senate has had the bill for literally eight sitting days. The government obstructed its own legislation for 730 days.</div>

When one looks closely at the facts concerning all these justice related bills, when one looks closely at the actions and decisions that this Conservative government has taken, or has failed to take, one can only conclude that it is either simply incompetent or wilfully incompetent.</div>

The Liberals claim that they wanted to fast track it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894831"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us put aside for a second that such a method of fast tracking is procedurally impossible. Let us just assume that she were telling the truth on that particular point. If they were willing to fast track this legislation then, why are they not willing to pass it now? It is a very simple question.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894832"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legislation has been languishing in the Senate because the senators decided to take all of January off, even though they knew this legislation was itching to be passed. They could have come back at any time in January--they have full authority to do that--to pass the legislation, but the Liberals there refused to do that. </div>
    </p><a name="Para894833"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it should not matter. The member said that they have had only eight days, but eight days should be too long if we apply her own logic. She claims the Liberals supported this bill for fast tracking months ago, years ago even. We know at the bottom and at the root that is not true. </div>
    </p><a name="Para894834"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberals have never supported these tough measures because they were in power for 13 years and did nothing to advance them. They were against raising the age of sexual consent while in government and able to do something about it, and they are still against raising the age of sexual consent.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894835"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me cite Senator Carstairs, who was on <i>Mike Duffy Live</i> on February 6. She said in her comments that raising the age of sexual consent “might put a chill on family life education programs” and “might prevent young women and young men from reporting sexually transmitted diseases”. If that is the position of the Liberal Party, then why does her colleague in the House of Commons claim the contrary? The reality is the Liberals do not support our bills and they are trying to mask it and cover it up so that they cannot be held accountable for their soft on crime stance.</div>

Basically, when the Liberals came back to power in 1993 the way the system operated was that the Crown in its discretion was not obliged, there was nothing in the law that required the Crown to apply for a dangerous offender hearing once someone had been found guilty of a series of serious egregious violent crimes. However, if the Crown did apply for it, the judge could then send the offender, before sentencing the person, for an expert psychological evaluation. Corrections Canada would also examine the person and produce expert reports. The judge would then decide if the person was so dangerous that he or she should be sent to prison for an indefinite period. The problem was that the judge was reluctant to do so, so the Liberal government brought in the long term offender. That is someone who has already been deemed to have been a dangerous offender.</div>

    </p><a name="Para894856"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it will give me an opportunity to highlight some elements, including what we expect to see in the budget. In recent days and weeks, we have had the impression that the Conservative government and the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> have been attempting to blow all issues out of proportion and, if not for the purpose of triggering elections, at least in an attempt to apply pressure on the opposition parties perhaps as an attempt to show in an artificial way, some kind of leadership.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894857"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, I believe that the Bloc Québécois has the responsibility to denounce these manoeuvres that hide the real problems by focusing attention on the motion before us early this afternoon. For those listening, I will repeat the motion:</div>

</div>
    </p><a name="Para894859"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will start by saying that we will support this motion even though, once again, I believe it is merely a diversionary tactic. The Bloc Québécois was in favour of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3076458,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3076458&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-2</A> when it was voted on in this House. I would remind the House that Bill C-2 was an omnibus bill of sorts, since it consisted of five bills from the previous session. We were in favour of four of the five bills, and since the House had already voted and we had lost the vote, we thought the debate was over and the vote in the House was legitimate. Thus, from the beginning, we had expressed our agreement with four of the five bills, even before the government talked about making this a confidence vote.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894860"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were, and still are, uncomfortable with one aspect of the fifth bill, that is, the notion of reverse onus for some repeat offenders. That said, after weighing the advantages and disadvantages, our caucus decided that it would be better to vote in favour of the bill, since it contained more aspects that we were completely comfortable with and that we supported. Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3076458,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3076458&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-2</A> does not pose a problem for us.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894861"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As everyone knows, the Bloc Québécois considers any institution associated with the British monarchy to be completely obsolete. In our view, the Senate, as one such mechanism left over from a time when Canada was a British colony, is completely outdated. Clearly, we kept up this British parliamentary tradition—and many among us are attached to it—but, that said, some vestiges need to be abolished. And the Bloc Québécois makes no secret of the fact that, although it is not a priority for us, the abolition of the Senate would not bother us, I can assure this House.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894862"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since it is an institution made up of unelected parliamentarians, we would have no problem with that, since we do not see any legitimacy in that branch of the Parliament of Canada. As I said, given that we do not see any legitimate reason for the institution and that we would like to see it abolished, clearly, for us, voting on it in the House should be the end of the debate, instead of referring the bill, having it passed by a majority of the members of the House of Commons and sending it to an unelected Senate.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894863"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will point out that there is an unelected minister, Mr. Fortier, who, I repeat, promised to run in an election at the first opportunity that came up. But since then, there have been at least three byelections in Quebec, and we would have been very happy to see him step up to the plate in order to truly have democratic legitimacy and to be in a position to make decisions affecting the day-to-day lives of Canadians and Quebeckers.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1330"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1330"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1335"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1325"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1330">(1330)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para894864"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We feel that the Senate has no legitimacy and should be abolished. So we have no problem with the motion. But once again, we find it a bit childish that this is being debated in this House.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894865"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Québécois will not prolong this debate, nor do we expect the Senate to follow up on this message by March 1, since it is a relatively short deadline. As I said, we are not about to give credibility to this institution inherited from the past.<sup></sup></div>
    </p><a name="Para894866"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I think there is something more fundamental behind this motion, and that is the government's, the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A>'s desire to create a diversion. I would even say that we have the exact same elements in the motion concerning Afghanistan. I do not want to say that the future of Canada's mission in Afghanistan is not important, far from it, but I, and a number of observers—including all members of the Bloc and several opposition members, since I seem to recall hearing the Liberals' national defence critic mention that it should not be a confidence issue—believe that the debate on this issue should be as non-partisan as possible.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894867"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By making this a confidence motion, the government, the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A>, has decided to use this debate to create a political crisis and to trigger, perhaps indirectly, an election. In any event, it is a tactic to divert attention from the real problems Canadians and Quebeckers are currently experiencing.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894868"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among those problems, there is one that the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A>, the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78777,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78777&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Finance</A> and the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',111555,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=111555&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Industry</A> are being particularly silent about. I am talking about the ongoing situation in the manufacturing and forestry industries. That is what we should be debating today, not some message to the Senate on a bill we all agree on.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894869"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To me there seems to be something somewhat unhealthy about the Conservative government and the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> wanting to dramatize or show us who is boss, even though they are a minority government. They have never understood that and it is not something we should forget. In my opinion, today's debate should have been about improving the aid plan, the first small step announced by the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A>. He tried to use exactly the same tactics there that he is using today and with Afghanistan.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894870"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First he tried to make the aid plan, the creation of the community development trust of $1 billion over three years—which is not very much—conditional on passing the budget, thereby blackmailing the opposition parties. We do not know what will be in the budget. It may contain other completely unacceptable items. I would not be surprised to see such items in the next budget. Making this conditional on the budget puts pressure on the opposition members. But worse yet, the people who are in need of assistance in the regions affected by this crisis in the manufacturing and forestry industries, were also being held hostage by this government. </div>
    </p><a name="Para894871"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, because of pressure from Quebec, and the consensus among Premier Charest of Quebec and all the opposition parties in the National Assembly, namely the Parti québécois and the Action démocratique du Québec, the unions, who unanimously condemned the tactic, the business community—particularly those currently under pressure in these industries in crisis—editorial writers, a number of observers and the opposition parties here in this House, the Bloc Québécois in particular, the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> saw the light.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894872"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last Monday, as we all know, we had the opportunity to vote on the first part of this inadequate aid plan. I want to be very clear that this means Quebec will get $216 million over three years, even though most of the jobs lost in the manufacturing sector in 2007 were lost in Quebec.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1335"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1335"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1340"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1330"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1335">(1335)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para894873"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nobody has taken a close look at the specific job loss numbers in some sectors in the Quebec regions. I believe that is true for Ontario too, and for some regions in the Atlantic provinces. It is clear that the Prime Minister's blackmail tactics were reprehensible and that the figures announced were just not enough.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894874"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were hoping that the Prime Minister would take advantage of his meeting this weekend—not with Bonhomme Carnaval, but with the Premier of Quebec, Jean Charest—to announce improvements to the plan. We were hoping that we would be here today to talk about a bill that would fix things. However, that is not what we are talking about. We are talking about Motion No. 3, and I have already said enough about that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894875"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, I would like to point out that the problem with the $1 billion over three years is that it is to be distributed per capita, not on the basis of need or jobs lost. Furthermore, there is an additional basic $10 million envelope per province, regardless of whether that province is Prince Edward Island, Ontario or Quebec, which is just bizarre. I will come back to that in more detail and give some numbers. In the meantime, in case I run out of time, I want to point out that Prince Edward Island will get about $100 per resident thanks to this Conservative government initiative, while Quebec and Ontario will receive just over $25 per resident, even though 75% of the manufacturing sector is concentrated in Ontario and Quebec. </div>
    </p><a name="Para894876"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, what the government announced was not an aid package but a very broad-based economic revitalization plan. As we know, Alberta will receive its share. I do not think that anyone in the House seriously believes that Alberta, at this juncture, needs a little boost to reinvigorate its economy. Its problem is an overheated economy, which the government has encouraged. In particular, there were the tax cuts in last November's economic statement. For the time being, they are benefiting very few in the manufacturing sector but many in the oil and gas sector.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894877"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will show just how inadequate this Conservative government's first step is and that it needs to be improved. I will simply mention a few articles that I collected here and there during the past week. </div>
    </p><a name="Para894878"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, last Monday, the Premier of Quebec, Mr. Charest, said:</div>

</div>
    </p><a name="Para894880"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was speaking specifically of the assistance plan that needed to be bolstered.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894881"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Benoît Pelletier, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, added that Ottawa is awash in surpluses and that the aid given to Quebec, almost $200 million, represents only 10% of amounts advanced by Quebec.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894882"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is what is written but we know that it amounts to $216 million.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894883"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government of Quebec invested almost $2 billion to help the forestry and manufacturing sectors. I know that this is being debated in Quebec because some feel it is not enough. We are talking about 10% of this aid, approximately $216 million. Obviously, the financial situation of the Government of Quebec and the federal government are in no way alike. For the Government of Quebec, it is clearly not enough and there has to be more.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894884"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following day, it was the CSN's turn to make its views known. I will read an excerpt from its press release entitled “The Prime Minister must act now and abandon his partisan interests”:</div>

<td><small>—the time for action is now. As it is, the support announced by the Prime Minister reflects neither the seriousness of the situation nor the means at his disposal. In the past four years, more than 15,000 jobs have been lost in the paper and forestry industry, and some 130 sawmills and pulp and paper plants are currently inactive, depriving 31 of 250 municipalities of their main economic activity. Thousands of families in Quebec are in crisis.</small></td>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CSN represents 300,000 workers. It is an extremely important labour congress in Quebec and is very well established in the regions. I know a thing or two about the CSN, because I served as its general secretary for eight years.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also very fond of my friends in the FTQ, who weighed in on February 6 in the form of a press release from FTQ president Michel Arsenault, a former head of the steelworkers' union for Canada. </div>

</div>
    </p><a name="Para894890"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The despicable blackmail by the government and the Prime Minister had ended, but the president of the FTQ, which has 500,000 members in Quebec and a strong presence in the paper and forestry sector, added this: “Quebec is not getting its fair share. The sectors that are worst off are not getting their fair share—”. He was speaking in Abitibi-Témiscamingue, and he said, “Abitibi-Témiscamingue is not getting its fair share”. I would add that Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean is not getting its fair share, Mauricie is not getting its fair share, Gaspé is not getting its fair share, the Lower St. Lawrence is not getting its fair share, northern Lanaudière is not getting its fair share and the Outaouais is not getting its fair share. None of the regions of Quebec is getting its fair share. I will prove this in a moment. I am not finished. Unfortunately for us, groups are still having to exert pressure on this insensitive Conservative federal government. </div>
    </p><a name="Para894891"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last Thursday, the Forest Products Association of Canada announced that it had been very affected by the crisis. It said that there were more than 12,000 jobs lost in Canada in 2007 alone, and that more than 100 mills had shut down. The association called on the federal government to intervene and introduce measures, a number of which were proposed by the Bloc Québécois, the Standing Committee on Finance and the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology. I will give only one, otherwise I will run out of time, but this particular one calls for a refundable tax credit for research and development. When a business, such as a paper mill, is not generating a profit, it does not benefit from the generosity of the Conservative government, which cut taxes for businesses earning a profit, but there is still research and development to be done. If these companies, Tembec, Domtar, AbitibiBowater or whatever, continue to do research and development, they cannot benefit from refundable tax credits because they are not generating a profit. They cannot benefit from the tax cuts announced by the finance minister in the economic statement because they are not generating a profit. They need help to be able to keep investing in research and development, which is essential to innovation and competitiveness, so that once this crisis is over, they can compete in North America and throughout the world. </div>
    </p><a name="Para894892"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a consensus—in Quebec anyway—and I am sure that in Ontario it is the same thing. The billion dollars in aid announced by the Conservative government is definitely not enough. A lot more money than that is needed immediately and they could use the existing surplus and they know it. The surplus is not being used to help the industries, the regions and the workers who are dealing with the manufacturing crisis, because it is being put toward the federal debt. Some might think that is a good idea, but I would remind them that the Government of Canada's federal debt is the lowest of the G-7 countries. It has not been this low since 1984. Why would anyone insist on paying off their mortgage when they have just lost their job and their children are starving? That is precisely what is happening. Not only is that not enough money, but the allocation of this money defies logic and is completely unfair. Earlier I gave the example of Prince Edward Island, but I could go on.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894893"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take Alberta for example, which represents 7.8% of manufacturing jobs. It will receive 10.4% of the aid, while Quebec, which represents 27.6% of the jobs in the manufacturing industry, will receive just 21.8%. It is essential that this be corrected and the aid allocated according to need.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894894"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will close by reiterating the measures the Bloc Québécois is proposing. We propose investing at least $500 million in a new Technology Partnerships Canada program, with $1.5 billion as a repayable contribution for new manufacturing equipment, a forestry economy diversification fund that could very well be the $1 million from the community development trust, and $1.5 million for improving employment insurance and the older workers program. To stimulate economic activity in the municipalities—that could be saved for the budget—there could be a $1 billion increase in the excise tax transfer to the municipalities. What we are asking for right now is $3.5 billion from the $10.6 billion surplus projected for March 31. The government can do it and if it does not, it will pay the price in the next election.</div>

Why does the member think the government is embarrassing itself with this sort of silly diversionary, as he calls it, type of motion? Is it because, after being in its greatest economic position, that it cannot handle the fact that we are getting closer to a recession, which is getting worse and worse? Is it because more and more people are getting furious with the government for the loss in manufacturing and forestry jobs, which, as the member says, are very important issues to discuss? Is it because the Conservatives are the biggest spenders in history and getting us closer to a deficit and they do not want to answer the people on that?</div>
    </p><a name="Para894896"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last week the Bloc member was furious that the government was stonewalling a committee so that it would not discuss the investigations by Elections Canada of a number of members on the election. Is that why the Conservatives are using diversionary actions? </div>
    </p><a name="Para894897"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do the Conservatives not have a lot to answer for to their constituents for stalling these crime bills: the mandatory minimum, the impaired driving, the age of consent, the bail reform with reverse onus and dangerous offenders, many of which, as was explained this morning, could have been law already had it not been for the Conservatives stalling?</div>
    </p><a name="Para894898"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was mentioned that one of the bills has been stalled for over two years. The government refused to fast-track the bills as we suggested and refused to bring them forward in a timely manner, as was outlined in great detail this morning. When the Conservatives prorogued Parliament, more time was lost. Finally, the Conservatives brought them all back as one bill at the beginning instead of where they were in the process--</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are seeing attempts to divert our attention in order to prevent us, the opposition parties and all of civil society, from forcing a debate on the situation facing the manufacturing and forestry sectors, and on the outlook for the Canadian and Quebec economies.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894902"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one in this House, except the Conservative government, believes that the recession in the service sector—which is not only worsening, but also extends to the United States—will have no impact on the Canadian economy. I would remind the House that 75% of our exports go to the United States.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894903"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the January 2008 edition of <i>Affaires Plus</i> magazine, Stephen Jarislowsky wrote: “Canada cannot survive exclusively on the development of the oil sands project in Fort McMurray ... That is completely unrealistic.”</div>
    </p><a name="Para894904"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this government thinks that, through the magic of oil from that project, an entire economy as diversified as the Canadian and Quebec economy can survive. They are therefore resorting to all sorts of diversion tactics in order to prevent anyone from forcing this debate.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My reply is as follows. It is precisely so we do not fall into the trap set by the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> and the Conservative government. </div>
    </p><a name="Para894914"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this is treated as an important vote, people may be panicked into an election over a motion which, in the end, does not have a great deal of legitimacy. In fact, the Bloc does not believe that the Senate has legitimacy. Furthermore, we voted in favour of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3076458,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3076458&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-2</A>.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894915"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our opinion, we should quickly deal with this motion in order to get back to what is really important. For the Bloc Québécois, the best way of neutralizing and dealing with it is to vote for it and not to create a false crisis that will distance us even further from the real debate about the economic situation, which is deteriorating with each passing day.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894916"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why we will vote in favour of this motion. When there are substantive issues, the Bloc Québécois will be there to force an election, if warranted. However, I remind the House that we were in favour of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3076458,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3076458&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-2</A>, even though we were uncomfortable, as stated just now, with reverse onus.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894917"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, in weighing the advantages and disadvantages,—which we must often do in this House—we believe that it is better to vote in favour of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3076458,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3076458&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-2</A> and the motion before us.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to remember that the opposition improved the bill to raise the age of consent. The bill was unacceptable as it was, because it would have criminalized sexual relations between young people. That is not what we are trying to do. In Quebec, at least, we do not want to criminalize sexual relations between consenting young people. We therefore improved this bill here in this House. We were comfortable with the bill.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The David Dunlap Observatory has been a research centre for the department of astronomy and astrophysics since 1935. In 1972, the first black hole was discovered by the observatory.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894936"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a valuable site to our community. My goal is to ensure that it remains a working teaching and educational centre for astronomy.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recently had a meeting with the president of the University of Toronto, David Naylor, and other key officials to press for an extension until mid-May for the request for proposals. The purpose of the extension is to provide the consultants, Lord Cultural Resources, more time to do a thorough study of the site. I was pleased with the meeting.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894938"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Dunlap site is one of historic significance. My ultimate goal is that the Government of Canada will protect and purchase the site for a national urban park, to preserve its legacy for future generations to enjoy.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hard-working Canadians deserve protection as consumers. The government should be capping credit card interest at no more than 5% above prime. Here are five reasons why credit card rates and the banks should be reined in.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894986"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One, today's interest rates are outrageous. Nineteen per cent or higher interest rates unfairly hurt working families. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two, consumer debt is six times higher than in the 1980s, at $300 billion, and total household debt driven by high interest debt is over $1 trillion. </div>
    </p><a name="Para894988"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three, families that used to be able to save 15% to 20% of their income now can only save an average of 2%. That will not be enough to retire on.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894989"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four, the high costs of medications, training and of course child care are driving up the cost of essential items, forcing more hard-working families into debt.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894990"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five, big banks are making record profits and are heading toward another $20 billion year as they gouge consumers.</div>
    </p><a name="Para894991"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservative government has given massive corporate tax cuts that have benefited the big banks. The NDP wants to see the banks reined in, with capped credit card interest rates so that hard-working Canadians can meet the needs of their families. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that government Motion No. 4 on today's notice paper fails to meet these standards. It has not been the practice of this House that a motion becomes a motion simply by taking a press release and putting the word “that” in front of it. The government motion on notice contains eight clauses that all start with a “whereas”, all of which would be totally appropriate for the debate on the motion but really amount to outlining the reasons to support the question. In other words, these clauses are an argument and therefore should not have any place in the wording of a motion on notice.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895252"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would request that the government agree to withdraw this motion, reword it and replace it with an appropriate motion that constitutes neither a speech nor an argument. I would further submit that if the government fails to indicate that it will do this, then I would ask you to rule that this motion is not in order for debate and allow the government time to replace this flawed motion.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895253"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that the government is capable of putting a clear motion before the House on important matters. I would draw your attention to the one that we dealt with on Norad in May 2006, when the government motion basically said: “That this House support the government's ratification of the North American Aerospace Defense...agreement”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895254"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also dealt with a motion later on in May 2006, which also dealt with the extension of the mission in Afghanistan. That was Motion No. 7 in our first session. I am not going to read out that motion because it did have some whereases, but I would point out that in regard to the motion it was never put on notice and it in fact was adopted by unanimous consent as receivable. Therefore, the decision about the nature of the motion was really out of your hands, Mr. Speaker. </div>
    </p><a name="Para895255"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I remember from that motion, Mr. Speaker, was that the government basically put a proposition to Parliament and said to take it or leave it. It was not on the notice paper so we actually had no opportunity to debate the motion in terms of whether it was in its proper form.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895256"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to make two points about this motion. First, because the House agreed to waive the notice of this motion by unanimous consent, the House did not set a precedent about the admissibility of this kind of motion. I would remind you, Mr. Speaker, of what Marleau and Montpetit say on page 502: “Nothing done by unanimous consent constitutes a precedent”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895257"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also further suggest that the motion of May 2006, the first motion on Afghanistan that we dealt with, was in fact a clearer proposition than the one that is now before us. The May 2006 motion contained less than 150 words and only one question that was put to the House on the extension of the mission.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895258"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motion that is before us today, Motion No. 4, contains 560 words, including eight paragraphs of whereas clauses, which I submit are argumentative, and it contains two conditions that, as we see when we read them, are clearly outside of the control of the House and upon which support for the extension of the motion is predicated. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1520"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1520"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1525"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1515"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1520">(1520)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para895259"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The previous question we had was fairly straightforward. The one before us today includes conditions and is certainly argumentative, and therefore, we believe, should not be seen as a proper motion before the House.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895260"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On matters as important as this, I believe the government has a responsibility to give the House a clear and straightforward question that can be debated and decided upon. Motion No. 4 has failed to do that. Therefore, we ask the government to voluntarily agree to rewrite it so that it does fit the usual standards and practice. Failing that, Mr. Speaker, you should rule on this question.</div>

In the way that it is presented to the House, the motion effectively lays out the recommendations of the Manley panel. It is very clear that all of the preamble is in fact argument which would normally be made during debate. </div>
    </p><a name="Para895262"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing I can add to the argument already provided by the hon. member who just spoke, Mr. Speaker, is that the Journals Branch has been very vigilant and very rigid on the question of whereases in terms of motions. I think you will see, Mr. Speaker, that of the hundreds of motions that have been placed by members in this place, I do not believe I even recall seeing any of them include a whereas. In fact, the Journals Branch is very judicious in eliminating them and asking the members to rewrite their motions so that they get to the objective, the result that is being sought by the motion being put.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895263"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, I raise this only from the standpoint that should you allow this motion to stand in the same fashion that it is written right now, it would then serve as a precedent for all hon. members to make the full argument with regard to any and all motions that they care to bring before this place, ultimately bringing the order of the debate and the clarity of motions into some measure of confusion.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895264"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the question raised by the hon. member should be looked at very carefully with regard to the precedent setting that it appears to be causing.</div>

    </p><a name="Para895271"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to start with the height of hypocrisy that this motion represents on behalf of the government. Before I do that, I want to deal with the basic lack of logic of this motion.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895272"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are we hearing? We heard from the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> in the fall when Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3076458,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3076458&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-2</A> was put before the House, and I will come back to some of the history leading up to Bill C-2, that he was going to bring the government down if this bill was not passed. It was passed in the House and now the government is doing the same thing in the Senate. </div>
    </p><a name="Para895273"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The logic escapes me because behind the threats, the bombast and the macho image the government is trying to portray on crime is a totally illogical position, which is that we need this legislation right now, that we needed it years ago. That is what we hear from the government. There is some validity to that in the case of a number of parts of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3076458,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3076458&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-2</A>, particularly those that the NDP supported as a political party and which the Liberal government in previous administrations would not pursue.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895274"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservatives are saying, “We need it right now, we are way overdue on a number of these amendments and provisions, but we are going to go to an election”. They threatened it last fall and now they are threatening it again.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895275"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This resolution from the House has absolutely no impact on the Senate. We do not have the ability constitutionally to deal with this. It is totally illogical. If it comes to fruition, that is, if the government falls, or brings itself down is a better analysis of what is going on here, over this issue, Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3076458,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3076458&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-2</A> will die on the order paper. It will not get through the House of Commons or the Senate until the end of 2008. </div>
    </p><a name="Para895276"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where is the logic behind this? Although it is a rhetorical question, the obvious answer is there is no logic. This is not about dealing reasonably, realistically and effectively with crime in this country. This is all about political posturing and nothing else on the part of the government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895277"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why are the Conservatives pushing it right now? The answer to that is very obvious. They lost the agenda on making crime the primary issue they want to run on in an election. The Conservatives think that is where they have their best chance of gaining support in the country. I think it is an analysis that is faulty, but that is where the Conservative Party and the Conservative government is coming from.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895278"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What has happened in the last several months is that the Conservatives' agenda around the crime issues has been completely pushed aside because we passed that bill before the House recessed at the end of last year. Any number of other issues that have been before the House and the country have taken prominence, issues that the government is very afraid of. Let me mention a few of them. </div>
    </p><a name="Para895279"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, at the top of the list right now would be the economic straits we are in, in particular in the manufacturing and forestry sectors, compelling the government, in spite of the blackmail it tried to pull on the House, to move $1 billion into those sectors and communities in order to deal with the dire economic crises that a number of those communities are facing. That pushed it off its agenda.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1530"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1530"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1535"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1525"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1530">(1530)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para895280"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, the Afghanistan war, and in particular, the way Canada is handling detainees in Afghanistan, has pushed the Conservatives off their agenda in that regard. The firing of the head of the nuclear safety commission has pushed them off. Of course, there is always the Schreiber-Mulroney scandal. In the last couple of weeks, there has been the issue of the finance minister not following the rules of the Treasury Board with regard to letting contracts. There is the in and out scandal on the part of the Conservative government, the only party in the House that has been charged by Elections Canada with having in effect breached the election financing law.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895281"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are all of those issues, none of which are favourable to the government. We are seeing, as a result of all of these issues, that the government is falling in the polls. The Conservatives believe that they can hijack the agenda in this country by trying to get back on to the crime agenda.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895282"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at what the Conservatives have done historically in the last 12 months or so. Last spring, just before we broke for the summer, three of the five bills that comprised Bill<A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3076458,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3076458&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2"> C-2</A> had passed this House and were in the Senate. I say without any hesitation that by the end of 2007, had the government not done what it proceeded to subsequently do, those bills would have passed the Senate. I say that on the basis of the way the Senate has handled other crime bills since the Conservative government has been in power. The bills would have passed. I assume, if the government were really serious about doing anything about crime, the bills would have received royal assent and they would have been law.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895283"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All three of the bills would have been law by January 1, 2008, if not earlier. Those three parts of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3076458,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3076458&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-2</A>, the mandatory minimums on serious violent gun crimes, the age of consent, and the impaired driving bill, all three of those have been through this House. Let me correct that. The impaired driving bill was the one that had not gotten through. It was at report stage. It would have had third reading. It would have passed the House in the third or fourth week of September, when we were supposed to come back. The third one was the bill on the reverse onus on bail hearings which was to keep people in custody if they were facing serious charges involving guns. </div>
    </p><a name="Para895284"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those three bills, the age of consent, the mandatory minimums, the reverse onus, would have been law by now. I believe, quite frankly, the impaired driving bill would have been law by now, because it would have passed the Senate quite quickly in late September or early October, but for the action of the government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895285"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess we all know that what the Conservatives did is they did not have enough to do, that is, they did not have their political agenda. They thought they would have fallen as a government, as they probably should have, before the fall of 2007, so they prorogued Parliament. All of the bills on the order paper died. We had to start all over again. All of these bills were off, including the ones in the Senate.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895286"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to be very clear on this. All of the opposition parties were prepared in the fall when we came back in October after a month's delay to reinstate all of those bills at the same stage they had been, that is, three in the Senate and one here for a quick passage because there was the consent of all of the parties.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895287"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, with just a little bit of luck, we would have had all of those bills through the Senate by the end of the year, that is, before the year-end break, and if not, we would have had them in the first few weeks of January or February of this year, all of them. Instead, we have had this lengthy delay caused by the Conservative government, not by the Senate.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895288"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As members well know, my party and I are not supporters of the Senate. Regularly and consistently since the existence of our political party back in the 1940s, we have been calling for the abolition of the Senate. I am not here to defend members of the other place. We saw last week the kind of delay on Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3085474,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3085474&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-13</A>, the meddling they do all the time. It is an unelected, unrepresentative, and I think oftentimes an irresponsible body. I am not here to defend them, but by the same token, at this period of time the delay for this legislation lies squarely, entirely in the lap of the government. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the government were really serious about fighting crime as opposed to, as Lawrence Martin said in the <i>Globe and Mail</i> this morning, using it for, to quote him, “cheap politics”, if the Conservatives were not doing it for that purpose, if they were really serious about the need to deal with serious violent crime in particular and some of these other issues around impaired driving and the age of consent, if they were not seeing it just as a methodology to try to get re-elected, we would have moved quite a bit further along. It is to their eternal shame that we are at the stage we are. Let us look at that stage. </div>
    </p><a name="Para895290"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was interesting in the early and middle part of last week. The government, in the speeches its members were giving in the House, and in some of the addresses they were making to the media, began to sound almost desperate for an election. In that regard, if we have an election, we are going to be in the same situation. The bill is going to die, as all the others will that are on the order paper, and we will not see any of this legislation in place for the use of our police officers and judiciary across the country to apply and fight the various aspects of criminal activity that the bill would allow them to do.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895291"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservatives are pushing that button, not because they are really serious about fighting crime. That is not their primary motivation. Their primary motivation is to use this as a political tool to try to save their seats, to try to get re-elected as a government. It is probably a faulty assumption on their part that it is going to work, but that is what their motivation is, not the best interests of the country and not the victims of crime. It is the Conservative political party that this is all about in trying to save their skins in the next election.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895292"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we look at history, it is the height of hypocrisy for them to stand in the House and argue that they are tough on crime. It is simply not the reality when one looks at it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895293"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point that I want to make is that if they were really serious about being effectively tough on crime, they would not have broken their promise with regard to the 2,500 police officers that they promised in the last election, and on which they have not delivered. In fact they misled Canadians in the last election. The <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A>, the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',105824,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=105824&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Justice</A>, the former minister of justice, all of them across the country were trumpeting the 2,500 additional police officers they would see put in place.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895294"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What has happened? Number one, they did not tell the Canadian people that they were expecting the provinces to pick up most of the tab for those 2,500 police officers, money which the provinces do not have. To some degree, at least a number of the provinces have already moved on with regard to promises they made in elections to increase the number of police officers. They have already put some money into it and now the federal government is coming to them, johnny-come-lately, and saying, “Oh, by the way, although we promised this in the last election and we didn't tell the Canadian people we were going to do this, we want you, the provinces, to pay a big chunk, in most cases at least 50%”. That is not within the financial capabilities of most of the provinces, nor should it be their responsibilities when the promise was made without that condition by the government. </div>
    </p><a name="Para895295"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a full two years after the election and this broken promise is still hanging over their heads. If the Conservatives were serious about it, they would not be bringing this kind of useless motion in front of the House. They would be moving a motion in the House to see to it that money was put in place, that a budgetary item was put in place. We should have seen this last fall, we should have seen it in the budget in February and we should have seen it in the budget in the previous February.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1540"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1540"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1545"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1535"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1540">(1540)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para895296"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today we hear that the next budget is coming. Let me assure the House that there will be nothing in the budget for those 2,500 police officers. The Conservatives are going to break that promise on an ongoing basis and they are not going to fulfill their commitment to the Canadian people.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895297"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to that, whenever we look at dealing with crime effectively, we have to look at it from three perspectives. </div>
    </p><a name="Para895298"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, we have legislation, as we see with Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3076458,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3076458&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-2</A>, that deals with specific problems under our Criminal Code and other legislation. We are working on that against the delays caused by the government because it wants to keep it as a hot button item. It does not want the legislation passed because then it will be behind us. Therefore, we have done that to a great extent. There is still more that needs to be done.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895299"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other two legs of that three-legged stool, if I can use that analogy, is prevention. The big item there is to move programs into our local communities, funded by the federal government. Again, the provinces do not have the taxing power or the revenue capability to fulfill all this. However, we literally have to move $100 million a year to the provinces and the municipal local levels of government, to provide programming that will keep young people, in particular, out of the youth gangs and generally fight the drug culture and keep them out of those parts of our communities that advocate the use of drugs. That money needs to be spent. There is absolutely nothing beyond a very inconsequential amount that the government has done in this regard. It is minuscule. In fact, most of the time the government does not know what to do with it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895300"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I come back to those 2,500 police officers. We know that in those areas of our cities where we have seriously violent crimes, we need to put more police officers on the street. We simply cannot deal with that in any effective ways, even if it is in an interim measure, for the next number of years. We need more police officers on the streets fighting that kind of crime, street level crime, particularly in the youth gangs where so much of the gun crime resides at the present time. The government has done nothing on that and it has done a minuscule about on the prevention side. </div>
    </p><a name="Para895301"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, if the government were really serious, we would see that. We would not see the sham that this motion represents in the House at the present time. We would see concrete action. Most of this is looking at programming that would be successful. There are all kinds of examples of it in Canada and in other communities across the globe that we can look to and adopt, but we have to fund them. The government has been refusing to do that, just as it is refusing to fund those 2,500 police officers, as it promised in the last election. </div>
    </p><a name="Para895302"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where are we at? On a silly waste of time today debating this motion. It is going to have absolutely no effect. The government, whether it is over this, or over the budget or over Afghanistan, is looking desperately to bring itself down, to force the opposition parties to bring it down.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895303"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in this case it is not even asking the opposition parties in effect. It is saying that we should pass the motion and then if the Senate does not move, it will go to the Governor General and say that it does not have the confidence of the House, even if the motion passes. That is the stupid part of the motion. Even if the House passes it, and it looks like perhaps the Liberals and the Bloc appear as if they will support it, the government would still come down at the end of March, if the Senate, the other house over which we have no control, decides will not pass Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3076458,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3076458&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-2</A> by March 31. </div>
    </p><a name="Para895304"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is absolutely silly. It is the height of hypocrisy. It is really the height of demagoguery as well when we look at what has gone on in the House over the last few months around Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3076458,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3076458&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-2</A>. It is a shame. The government members should really bow their heads and apologize to the Canadian people for it.</div>

I know I have been there about 15 years.</div>

His crystal ball is much brighter than mine.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895307"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will stick to what I do know. Over the years many of being in this party, I, the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78732,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78732&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Calgary-Northeast</A> and Darrel Stinson, the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78876,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78876&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Okanagan-Shuswap</A>, visited with previous justice ministers, starting with Allan Rock. We went to Cowichan. We went to Anne MacLellan. We went to the previous Liberal minister, who is still in the House of Commons. They all said no to us when we requested, over and over again during that period of time, that they raise the age of consent. For the safety of our children, we said that we had to do this.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895308"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All those years, those ministers would not do it. Finally, one day the member from Lethbridge brought forward a private member's bill to raise the age of consent. Guess who voted against it? All the Liberals.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895309"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, would the member agree with me that the Liberal party never supported the bill in the very beginning? Now the Liberals realize the public really wants to see it, they are passing it to the Senate, saying not to pass the bill because they have not agree with it right from the word go? He must agree with me that this is indeed a fact. In the over 15 years I have been here, the Liberal Party never did anything about that bill because it did not want it to happen.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was at one of the Chinese New Year's dinners on the weekend at which I heard something about a partial omission of truth was like a full lie.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895312"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not that I am accusing him of misleading the House, but historically, if we study what happened around the age of consent issue, repeated bills came from the Reform-Alliance and then the Conservatives to raise the age of consent. However, they never put in the near age defence, which allowed people in the same age group to engage in sexual contact without criminalizing that sexual contact.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895313"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember sitting on a panel with a Conservative member who had sponsored one of the private member's bills. I asked him if he understood that he was about to criminalize 100,000 youth who were 15 and 16 years of age by the bill he had introduced. That was always the problem with it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895314"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have to take some personal credit. I convinced the former justice minister, when he was in opposition, to support the NDP in saying that we needed to raise the age of consent, but that we needed to put in the near age defence. Then when the Conservatives formed the government, for the first time that showed up in legislation, and it was passed.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will make one final point with regard to the Senate and the government. If the government were really serious, it would not be this motion before the House. The government would have a motion something similar to, “we call on all the senators to resign and we call on the Conservative government to initiate a process of constitutional reform to abolish the Senate for the future”.</div>

It appears that 2,500 RCMP officers are supposed to appear suddenly with the wave of a magic wand. We know that is not reality. It takes time to train these officers, hire them and get them in the field. Indeed, the government is working on that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895329"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question for the member is in relation to the bill itself. Those members keep talking about politics. They have talked about Afghanistan and a lot of things today in relation to this bill. However, the bill is about politics at the local level.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895330"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I have heard from my constituents in northern Alberta is that they want the bill to pass. These constituents want these bills to come into law because right now our streets are not safe from random gun crimes. Our children are being preyed upon by sexual predators. Repeat violent criminals are on our streets and continually let go in a rotating system. </div>
    </p><a name="Para895331"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was a lawyer in northern Alberta, I was ashamed sometimes to represent individuals who appeared eight or nine times before the court and who were let off with a 30 day or 90 day sentence for impaired driving. It was embarrassing.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895332"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since some of these bills date back to May 4, 2006, and I think the last one is November 23, 2006, would the member agree that this is enough time to talk about these bills in this place and in the Senate? When can we get on to the business of answering what Canadians want, and that is being tough on criminals?</div>

This party has always supported the contents of the tackling violent crime act. The Liberals have always opposed it, as have the Bloc and the NDP. </div>
    </p><a name="Para895337"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, they know that their constituents profoundly support the principles contained inside that bill and, as such, have twisted themselves into knots today to pretend that they, too, support the Conservative tackling crime agenda. However, let us review their records before we give them a free ride.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895338"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In opposition, our party continually fought to raise the age of sexual consent from 14 to 16 to protect teenagers from adult sexual predators. The Liberals consistently, over 13 years, blocked those changes while in government. The NDP were of no help, I will mention by the way, during that time either.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895339"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of mandatory minimum penalties, the Liberals opposed those in government, opposed them even in opposition, but are pretending to support them now in order to try to pacify the immense public sympathy that exists for the provision. On dangerous offender status, the Liberals and the rest of the opposition have opposed our initiatives.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895340"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill, as well, addresses issues such as impaired driving and reverse onus on bail.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895341"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am going to go through the elements of this bill one by one, but I am going to begin by making a very clear procedural point.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895342"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberals claim that they were willing to fast track all of this legislation long ago. Even if they were telling the truth, and they are not, why is it that the Liberal Senate will not pass the legislation today?</div>
    </p><a name="Para895343"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again, if they were willing to fast track the legislation months ago, surely, they would be willing to adopt the legislation today, but they are not.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895344"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us examine, piece by piece, what it is that the Liberals have been obstructing for so many months. Let us start with mandatory minimum penalties for firearms offences.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895345"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To begin with, this legislation was introduced as its own bill in May 2006, almost two years ago. Now, the Liberals claim that they were just about to get around to passing that bill through the Senate when the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> prorogued Parliament some months ago. However, if they were really interested in passing that legislation, why did they not do it months before, given that it had been introduced almost two years earlier? The reason is they do not support our toughened measures to crack down on gun criminals.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895346"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of age of protection, this member sitting right next to me, the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78373,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78373&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Wild Rose</A>, pleaded with the then Liberal government to increase the age of sexual consent from 14 to 16. The Liberal government consistently blocked all of those efforts because the Liberal Party believed that 14 was old enough.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895347"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of dangerous offenders, Liberals stood in the House of Commons and said that our tough new measures to designate three-time violent or sexual criminals as dangerous offenders and then put them away indefinitely would violate the constitutional rights of the criminal. That is what Liberals argued. That is what many Liberals continue to argue. Now, they claim that they supported the bill. They cannot have it both ways.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895348"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me return to mandatory jail time for gun criminals. I would just turn the House's attention to the fact that while the Liberals claim that they support that legislation now, the vast majority of them, in fact, almost all of them, voted against mandatory jail for gun criminals. The Liberals consistently opposed Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2172019,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2172019&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-10</A>, the then mandatory jail time bill. So, now they claim that they are in favour of it in order to mask the soft on crime position that they have historically taken. That is intellectually dishonest.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1600"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1600"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1605"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1555"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1600">(1600)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para895349"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mandatory jail time provisions that are now in the tackling violent crime act would guarantee that a gun criminal would have five years in jail for his first offence and seven years for the second offence. The bill would take the most violent and dangerous gun criminals off the street and ensure that they cannot wreak havoc on our communities any longer.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895350"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would remind the House that the bill in its previous form sat before Parliament for almost two years before prorogation. It had been blocked in the Senate for months upon months when finally the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> did the responsible thing and bundled it in with other legislation that is also tough on crime and forced it through the chamber.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895351"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of the age of sexual consent, Liberals now claim that they are in favour of raising the age of sexual consent after 13 years of opposing that change.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895352"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, there was a little problem in the Senate. Senator Carstairs apparently did not get the memo. She thought that Liberals were still being honest about their view on the age of sexual consent. She thought that she could tell people what she really thought and her real belief on the issue of the age of sexual consent. She did not hear from the Liberal leader that she was meant to perform a spectacular reversal and hide her real thoughts. She said this on <i>Mike Duffy Live</i> just recently: “The other issue is the whole age of consent issue. I am concerned that this may prevent young women and young men from reporting sexually transmitted diseases. I am concerned that it might put a chill on family life education programs. I am concerned that young prostitutes will be driven underground by this legislation”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895353"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To begin with, prostitution, the last time I checked, is already illegal, so it is already driven underground. Second, I have no idea what Liberal Senator Carstairs means when she suggests that somehow raising the age of sexual consent to prevent adult pedophiles from targeting young kids will cause greater transmission of sexually transmitted diseases. I have no idea what she could possibly mean by that. </div>
    </p><a name="Para895354"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, she removed the veil. She admitted that she opposes the Conservative effort to raise the age of sexual consent. She revealed where Liberals have always stood. The Liberals believe that the age of sexual consent should be 14. We believe it should be 16. That is why our government has been forced to make this a confidence issue.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895355"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberal strategy on crime has been quite an interesting one. It has been to privately and procedurally oppose the tough new measures without publicly admitting those intentions. In fact, on the one hand while Liberals oppose the tackling violent crime act procedurally, they storm around pretending publicly that they are in favour of it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895356"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will not let them get away with that any longer. The <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> packaged together the tackling violent crime act and shone the spotlight on Liberal hypocrisy on crime. All of a sudden, we have them moving over there. We have struck a hornet's nest because members of the Liberal caucus are now scattered around the House of Commons trying to convince the whole world that they always supported the Conservative agenda on crime, that they never really opposed it, and that their delays never really occurred.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895357"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that this backtracking in the Liberal Party will take itself all the way up to the Senate. One thing is for sure, if the Liberal Senate will not bring the tackling violent crime act back to the House of Commons unamended by the end of the month, members of the Liberal Party will have to explain their behaviour on crime to voters in an imminent election.That is the simple reality. Does everyone know what that is called? It is called accountability.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Liberals want to be soft on crime in a free country, it is their right to take that wrong-headed position. They have the right to their wrong opinion. However, it is the right of the Canadian voter to hold them accountable for that position and accountable they will be. More importantly, I believe that the Liberal Senate will back down and pass the bill because it is the right thing to do and Canadians are forcing the Liberal Party to change on crime. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us review the contents of this legislation. First, there would be mandatory jail time for gun criminals. This provision in the tackling violent crime act would guarantee that offenders convicted of gun crimes would go to jail for five years the first time and seven years the second time. </div>
    </p><a name="Para895360"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would create new offences: attempted murder, sexual assault with a weapon, aggravated sexual assault, kidnapping, robbery, extortion, hostage taking and discharging a firearm with intent. All of these are new firearms offences that augment existing offences in the Criminal Code. These new offences would guarantee that criminals are held to account for their gun crimes.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895361"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This legislation has the support of the chiefs of police, police associations, and it even has the support of the Liberal Premier of Ontario. The only one who does not support it is the Liberal leader and the vast majority of his caucus who voted against it when it came before the House of Commons. The Liberal Party has never supported these measures, but we are changing that by putting the spotlight on it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895362"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changing the age of protection and the age of sexual consent is responding to the call of parents right across this country who want us to help them protect their kids from sexual predators. In my constituency, numerous police officers have approached me and said that this tool would help them protect local Nepean—Carleton kids against Internet child predators. </div>
    </p><a name="Para895363"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The appeals that police officers, like Ray Lamarre of Nepean, have made to me has caused me to summon all of my energy in order to achieve that change to our Criminal Code. I have been collecting petitions in my constituency. I even launched an essay writing contest for young people to participate in to explain the ideas they had to protect other kids from the scourge of Internet pedophilia.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895364"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the one change in our Criminal Code that experts all across this country, and by experts I refer to police officers and parents not sociology professors and defence lawyers, all of the real experts want the age of sexual consent raised from 14 to 16. </div>
    </p><a name="Para895365"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That might not accord with the values of the Liberal Party. The Liberal leader has a history of believing in strange academic theories that flow from his time as an aloof sociology professor and all of that is very interesting in some strange academic circle, but among everyday people, and we know the folks I am talking about, those who work hard, pay their taxes and play by the rules, raising the age of sexual consent is basic common sense.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895366"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very proud to support the tackling violent crime act. Given that most of this legislation has been before the House of Commons and Senate for months, and some of it has been here for years, there is no reason for any more delay. At this point, now that we have illustrated the necessity of passing the tackling violent crime act, let us get to the unfortunate political obstacle that sits in front of us.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895367"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a Liberal Party that secretly opposes the bill and is asking its friends in the Senate to do its dirty work. Liberals claim that they were willing to fast track all of this legislation months ago in a procedural stunt that the Speaker has indicated never would have been allowed.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1610"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1610"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1615"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1605"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1610">(1610)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para895368"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, let us assume for a moment that they were sincere about fast-tracking this legislation. If they really wanted to fast-track our tackling violent crime legislation seven or eight months ago, clearly they should have no problem fast-tracking it today. Why do they not? Why does Liberal Senator Carstairs, who is part of the radical left of the Liberal Party, stomp her feet, scream and holler that she cannot possibly do her job between now and March because it is not enough time, if her party claimed it was willing to fast-track all this legislation seven or eight months ago?</div>
    </p><a name="Para895369"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a logical inconsistency here and that speaks to the nature of the Liberal Party saying one thing in public and playing a different game in the dark halls of the Senate. These games they are playing will not go unnoticed by crime victims. They have not gone unnoticed by voters. Voters see that the Liberals are using the radical wing of their party through Liberal Senator Carstairs to block the tackling violent crime legislation and to oppose its measures from coming into effect.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895370"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Liberal Senator has argued that raising the age of sexual consent would somehow cause sexually transmitted diseases to spread all across the country. That is Liberal Senator Carstairs. That woman could not be elected dog catcher, which is why she is in the Liberal Senate. She has absolutely no popular appeal among ordinary folks and yet--</div>

    </p><a name="Para895377"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberals have played a game on crime for years where they pretend to be tough on crime during elections and in front of the public and then in this place they do absolutely everything in their power to block tough on crime legislation from being enacted. I removed a veil in this speech and standing there disrobed was the real Liberal agenda on crime. Nothing terrifies Liberals more than the truth coming out about their position on crime.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I quoted the words of one of the most senior and most radically left wing senators in the Liberal caucus, someone who is from the left wing of the Liberal Party in concert with the views of a very left leaning Liberal leader. They together opposed raising the age of sexual consent from 14 to 16. She said so herself. She said that raising the age of sexual consent from 14 to 16 would lead to a pandemic of sexually transmitted diseases travelling across this country. Those are the radical views of Liberal senators and the Liberal Party claims that these same senators are interested in passing the legislation.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not apologize for pointing out when Liberal senators with radically extreme left wing positions use the unaccountable chamber in which they reside as a refuge against the accountability of voters and as a staging ground to protect criminals against the tackling violent crime legislation. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will stand in this place to represent the normal working people, folks who work hard, pay their taxes and play by the rules, folks in Nepean—Carleton and communities like Barrhaven, Manotick and Riverside South, the people who, thankfully, voted for me in the last election, 40,000 of them. I am very proud to represent them and I am proud to stand here in the House of Commons to defend their interests and to advance the cause of tackling violent crime by advancing this legislation.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On March 21, 2007, we attempted to use an opposition day motion that if passed would have immediately results in the passage at all stages of four justice bills: Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2250003,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2250003&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-18</A>, Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2304794,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2304794&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-22</A>, Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2304866,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2304866&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-23</A> and Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2519653,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2519653&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-35</A>.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Incredibly, the Conservative House leader raised a procedural point of order to block the motion. In other words, the Conservatives fought the Liberal attempt to pass the four Conservative justice bills. Why? They wanted to get to the attacking violent crime bill where they could try to confuse Canadians and try to blame the Liberals that they did not pass them.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, let us not engage in procedural complexities. Let us just ask a simple question. The Liberals claim that they were willing to fast-track raising the age of sexual consent to 16 years old. If that is the case, why not now? They claim that they were willing to pass Conservative legislation for mandatory jail time on gun crimes. If that is the case, q why not now? They claim that they were willing to support reverse onus for those accused of gun crimes. If they were willing to do that then, why not now? The reality is that they were never committed to passing this legislation. They were never willing to consider fast-tracking it because if they were then they would be now.</div>

    </p><a name="Para895479"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the Bloc first entered the House of Commons in 1993, there were some issues that were very important to us. We spoke, for example, about abolishing the other place. I must say in passing that I have heard a lot of my colleagues talk about the Senate. Correct me if I am wrong, but I thought it was against the rules to use that word here. We have to say the other chamber. So I will speak about the other chamber, as prescribed in the House practices and procedures. </div>
    </p><a name="Para895480"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We said at the time that the other chamber should be abolished, and people nearly called us crazy. It was the same story with regard to the creation of an institute to work toward making the U.S. dollar the currency used throughout North America. We did not say we wanted to do that, just that we wanted an institute to study the question. Once again, everybody said, “Oh, those people are crazy”. </div>
    </p><a name="Para895481"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of our most important concerns was political financing. In Quebec, we had already cleaned up the way things were done. The great René Lévesque of the Parti Québécois introduced a bill to this effect in the National Assembly more than 30 years ago. Since then, political funding has been cleaned up in Quebec. In other words, political parties can no longer accept contributions from big companies or big unions. There are also limits on individual contributions. </div>
    </p><a name="Para895482"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was only natural, therefore, that when we came to Ottawa, we would want things here done the same way. Even though there are laws and regulations, I still see people trying to circumvent them, and loans to individuals are one of the ways. </div>
    </p><a name="Para895483"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Conservatives are partly right when they say that the people in the Liberal leadership race took out some very large loans. We can certainly say that it was not proper and not in keeping with the spirit of the law. I have in front of me the contributions made to Bob Rae, and included among the $705,000 in loans are $580,000 from his brother, John Rae. </div>
    </p><a name="Para895484"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We obviously cannot just let this kind of thing go. The opposition leader himself borrowed $655,000 and there are some very important people who loaned him money: Mamdouh Stephanos, $150,000; Marc de la Bruyere, $100,000; Stephen Bronfman, $50,000; Roderick Bryden, $50,000; Christopher Hoffman, $25,000. </div>
    </p><a name="Para895485"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We know what that means, in other words, exactly what it meant back in the days when big companies and individuals could donate money without any control. Politicians were in the clutches of their big contributors. Could someone speak directly to the opposition leader if he gave the Liberal Party $5? I do not think so. But someone who had given $150 or $250 at the time could probably have contacted a minister’s or even the premier’s office directly. <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2"></A></div>
    </p><a name="Para895486"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Conservatives have their theory. I think, though, that they are a bit quick to play innocent because they too have serious problems with transparency. We in the Bloc Québécois would like to know, among other things, how much the current <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A>'s leadership campaign cost back in 2002 and who financed it. He has never been willing to reveal this completely. He unveiled part of the list but never all of it. </div>
    </p><a name="Para895487"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I said they play innocent. It is easy to cast the blame on the Liberal Party, but they too are hardly blameless. They see the mote in their adversary’s eye but not the beam in their own that is even worse. There is, for instance, all the cronyism between politicians’ offices and the big lobbying firms. The best example of this is certainly the former <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',111558,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=111558&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">defence minister</A> who worked for a lobbying firm for many years and then was one of the first to award big contracts to the entire industry, including his former clients. There is a certain problem with this and a certain decency that is wanting. </div>
    </p><a name="Para895488"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We could talk about contracts for friends of the party in power. People have been talking about this again just recently. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1645"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1645"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1650"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1640"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1645">(1645)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para895489"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78777,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78777&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Finance</A> awarded a $122,000 contract directly to one of his friends, violating all the regulations.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895490"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is this allowed? It happens here in the House of Commons. I see the Conservatives acting shocked in front of the Liberals, but they are no better about using public money for partisan purposes. When the Conservatives were the official opposition, I remember very well hearing them tell the government that what it was doing with public money was appalling, that it was using public money to conduct surveys for the party, which it then used for elections or bills in order to be in line with public opinion. </div>
    </p><a name="Para895491"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Conservatives have been in power, it has been even worse. The Conservatives have some things to be ashamed of, including their handbook on how to stall the work of the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs. In fact, I think that the member who just spoke about amendments talked for seven or eight hours in order to stall the work of the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs. Why? Because 67 of these members overrode the Canada Elections Act. They are lecturing us, telling us what to do to correct the injustices of the system. They should take a look in the mirror. I think they will see at least 10 members from Quebec, including three Conservative ministers. But they continue to waste the time of the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs, perhaps waiting for the next election. Maybe then the same thing will start up again, especially if Elections Canada has not rendered a decision.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895492"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are also all the partisan appointments: Jim Gouk, whom we all know as a former Conservative MP, was appointed to the NAV Canada board of directors—the government controls three seats on the NAV Canada board of directors; Gwyn Morgan, a big Conservative fundraiser, was appointed chairperson of the Public Appointments Commission; and Kevin Gaudet, a Conservative organizer who worked on the leadership race, was appointed to the Canada Pension Plan Review Tribunal. I could go on, but I do not want to waste too much time because I have only 10 minutes. We have a complete list of partisan political appointments. This is absolutely unacceptable, and the problems persist. We want to change things.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895493"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the Conservatives were in opposition, I often heard one of them say that it had to be made easier for whistleblowers to do their job, so that someone who witnessed something truly unfair would report it. We are still waiting. I believe that whistleblowers are paid $1,500 for legal expenses, but if it costs more, they have to cover it. We are not giving whistleblowers the tools and instruments they need, so that they can report situations when they notice anomalies and things that are unacceptable in the system.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895494"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In terms of access to information, I myself have never, in 14 years, seen a government as secretive as this one, and we see the evidence of this every day. For weeks, we have been asking what is happening with prisoners, but we are unable to find out. If we request a document under the Access to Information Act, not only are they going to exceed the time allowed outrageously, but in addition the documents delivered to us will be completely censored. Whole pages are censored. </div>
    </p><a name="Para895495"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a final point regarding the amendments, we do not like the one that makes the political party liable if a candidate does not repay a large loan. We would like that to be amended.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895496"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So we are proud of our achievements. The Bloc Québécois brought order to public finances in Quebec, and has succeeded in bringing order to the funding of political parties in the House of Commons. We will now make sure that this continues, because for us, this is a fundamental concept of democracy.</div>

I listened to his speech and, indeed, I really wonder about the Conservative government's philosophy and way of doing, or not doing, things. We have two more examples, namely the $875,000 fence, under a contract that raises some serious questions, and also the recent contract awarded for drafting the budget. We do not know what is going to happen in the case of the February 26 budget.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This raises suspicion. In his speech, our colleague illustrated why we have some very serious questions about the government's real intentions. As history shows—and this is particularly true with René Lévesque—the transparency of a government is very important, but so too is its integrity. I wonder if our colleague could elaborate on the recent events that now raise very real suspicion.</div>

I did try, in my 10-minute speech, to show that there was a problem. It is all well and fine to pass legislation and for the Conservative Party to accuse the opposition of attempting to circumvent the laws, but as I said earlier, they see the mote in their adversary's eye but not the beam in their own. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reference was made to a fence and to the infamous budget speech prepared at a cost of $45 a word. There is much more however. The purchase of $20 billion worth of military equipment is going totally unnoticed. That is a major problem. Do members know how much $20 billion is? That is 20,000 millions of dollars. Hardly any parliamentary oversight over such expenditure.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides the fence and the budget speech, there are also the bids and military procurement. This government is keeping us in the dark in that case as in many others. It is a secretive government; there is no escaping it.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a good thing that the opposition is there to denounce such actions. Not only does the Bloc Québécois denounce them, but it sometimes manages to counter them. In addition, the Bloc Québécois was the opposition party that introduced in the House the rules governing political party financing. We are doing a fine job and we will continue to ensure that contributions and taxpayers' money are managed properly, and in a transparent manner. </div>

    </p><a name="Para895522"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bloc Québécois said it was not right that if someone took out a bank loan and failed to pay it back or had problems, his political party would be held responsible by default for paying to clean up the mess. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is not how things work when a loan is taken out. Someone has to be the guarantor. A political group or pressure group cannot be told that its candidate borrowed money but failed to pay it back and now it is up to the group to do so in his stead. </div>

    </p><a name="Para895526"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3120196,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3120196&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-29</A> aims to establish a system of improved accountability for candidates to report loans taken out during election campaigns. Its key elements include creating a uniform and transparent reporting regime for all loans to political parties, including mandatory disclosure of terms and the identity of all lenders and loan guarantors; ensuring that total loans, loan guarantees and contributions by individuals should not exceed the annual contribution limit for individuals established in the Canada Elections Act; and allowing only financial institutions and other political entities the capacity to make loans beyond the annual contribution limit for individuals and only at commercial rates of interest.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895527"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tightening rules for the treatment of unpaid loans is also important to ensure candidates cannot walk away from unpaid loans by ultimately holding riding associations responsible for unpaid loans taken out by their candidates.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895528"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill was first presented to the House during the first session of Parliament as Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2903284,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2903284&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-54</A> and reintroduced in November of last year with essentially the same content as Bill C-54. The bill was very seriously examined during meetings of the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs. Members worked hard and agreed upon different elements, not the least of which was a significant improvement which now calls for unpaid amounts of the loan to be considered contributions after three years after the day on which it was made. The original government proposal was to make that period only 18 months. Now the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',105836,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=105836&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">government House leader</A> is presenting motions that would completely disregard the other amendments that were passed at committee.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895529"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government Motion No. 1 would delete the Liberal amendment to allow for annual contributions to a leadership candidate. Under this motion, for example, a person would be allowed to donate $1,000 to a leadership candidate in each calendar year until the leadership candidate paid his or her campaign debt and formally closed his or her leadership campaign.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895530"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government Motion No. 2 would make it necessary for loans to be repaid annually rather than at the point when the loan becomes due. Effectively, this would prevent candidates from taking extended repayment loans. It makes no sense to set up an artificial limit on repayment.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895531"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Considering the fact that elections can be called at different times during the year, whether it be January, April or October, it is unreasonable for someone to be asked to pay off a loan before the time limit established by the loan contract. We see that the government is pushing hard on its perception of accountability.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895532"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, as members of Parliament will know, once we are elected our focus shifts to doing our job, not to running in elections or raising money for elections. It, therefore, would be an absolute hindrance for anyone to have to focus on repaying by the end of a fiscal year if that is not the date that was agreed upon with the lender.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895533"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government Motion No. 3 would delete the Bloc amendment that would have removed liability from registered political parties for loans taken by candidates. This motion would set up a system or a responsibility for registered political parties and riding associations, regardless of whether or not they are aware that the candidate has taken out a loan. Making one entity responsible for the personal debt of an individual does not sound responsible under any criteria.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895534"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government waited for the original version of this bill to die with prorogation so that it could present new motions to completely obliterate the changes that had already been agreed upon democratically at committee.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895535"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some five bills in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3076458,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3076458&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-2</A>, many of which had progressed substantially through the legislative process.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a consequence, we now find Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3076458,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3076458&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-2</A> as an issue of debate in this place simply because the government suggests that it should happen quicker. However, it engineered the delay in those pieces of legislation. Therefore, it is very similar to what has happened with regard to this bill. </div>
    </p><a name="Para895537"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through this tactic, Canadians have seen that the government is clearly not interested in really working with the other parties to come up with sound legislation. It is only interested in continuing to pursue a philosophy of “my way or the highway” kind of legislative process. It is only interested in presenting political jabs disguised as draft legislation, and we have seen that time and time again on many bills. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the government continues to repeat that Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3120196,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3120196&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-29</A> will finally stop the undue influence of wealthy contributors who were supposedly skirting Elections Act donation limits through the use of personal loans, the bill is clearly designed to disadvantage the Liberal Party of Canada financially and to limit access to the political process for many Canadians. </div>
    </p><a name="Para895539"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact is our party has demonstrated, in good faith, that we want to work to improve election laws. After all, our party was the one that passed the bill to limit the role of corporations and unions in election financing in Bill C-24 in 2003.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895540"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our party also initiated the most significant contribution limit reduction in Canadian history. Furthermore, during our last leadership campaign, all candidates publicly disclosed all loans made to their campaigns and went above and beyond the requirement set out in the Canada Elections Act in this regard.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895541"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> still refuses to fully disclose the complete scope of financing of his own 2002 leadership campaign. Clearly the government is running a “Do as I say, not as I do” kind of operation. How can Canadians believe a government that does not want to practise what it preaches.The Liberal Party supports measures to make Canadians more confident in their politicians by seeking to improve the accountability of the electoral process.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895542"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We support the bill, as amended by the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs, which includes the measures that were approved democratically by all of the parties.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895543"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me refer also to the activity within the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs to which many important issues are referred and is represented by all parties. What happens is it is sometimes very dysfunctional in terms of deciding to do things or not to do things. In the case of the so-called in and out scandal, a filibuster has been going on since late October or early November on the ruling by the Chief Electoral Officer that the Conservative Party had breached the Canada Elections Act by transferring loans into and then out of candidates accounts. This kind of issue is very serious and the Chief Electoral Officer found that it was improper. The issue still is not out of procedure and House affairs committee. It is still not progressing because the government is filibustering.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895544"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those who may be watching, a filibuster occurs when a party decides that it will continue to talk. There are no limits on talking when a motion is made. If the chair of that committee permits it to get too broad, effectively what we can do is continue to talk. When one member is finished, another member can get up and continue to talk. Therefore, we have a filibuster whereby the question before the committee never gets voted on and no action is ever taken.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895545"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have seen that time and time again as a tactic. As members know, the government members were given a binder for their committees on how to disrupt the business of committees. Amendments were made to the bill at committee. Now they are being changed. There are all kinds of tactics, which I think Canadians would find very distasteful, with regard to respect for the rule of parliamentary procedures and law and how matters are handled.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe parliamentarians on committee, in reviewing the matter before us, did their job. They agreed upon the amendments. These have been tampered with yet again by the government to show bad faith in terms of respecting the fact that this is a minority government. It is important that we move now to make good laws and wise decisions. It does not include the changes proposed by the government.</div>

I am absolutely flabbergasted that the member of the House of Commons would dare talk about filibustering in a negative fashion.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895548"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do not believe there is anybody in the House of Commons who speaks more often on more legislation, more motions, more points of order and more than the member. I think he has written the book on filibustering and wasting the time of the House on any number of issues. Anybody who happens to watch the parliamentary channel on television would be well acquainted with the member. It is a bit rich when he talks about filibustering and suggests that our members should not utilize that completely legitimate parliamentary tactic when necessary to make a point.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895549"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the issue before the procedure and House affairs committee, to which he referred, whereby the Liberal Party of Canada wants to ensure that the procedure and House affairs committee only looks at the Conservative Party of Canada's election expenses and not its own, why does the Liberal Party not want to open up its books?</div>
    </p><a name="Para895550"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are more than willing to open up our books and have a complete review of everything we did during the last election campaign. All we are asking, and we have been asking it for months, is that the other three political parties do the same. Let us just treat all political parties equally. </div>
    </p><a name="Para895551"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think all Canadians would be in favour of that and would be supportive of it.</div>

    </p><a name="Para895553"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the member is quite right with regard to the first item. I do speak a fair bit in the House. In the last Parliament I spoke more than any other member in this place. I probably have had the same level of activity in the current Parliament.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895554"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it is not something that gets announced as what we do, but as a parliamentarian and a member of the Liberal team, we all have roles to play. We all have responsibilities. </div>
    </p><a name="Para895555"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member will know that in the last Parliament and in this Parliament I have been designated as the permanent House duty officer, which means I am responsible for being in the place to participate in debate as necessary, to raise points of order, to ensure there are members in their places and to generally coordinate the activities. It does mean I speak a lot. It is not because I like to speak. I am doing my job. </div>
    </p><a name="Para895556"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I very much appreciate the kind words that members often give me when I have spoken. They know I do my homework and they know I do not waste the time of the House.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895557"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second matter the member raised was with regard to looking at all parties with regard to the in and out scandal. The answer is very clear. The only reason the item is before the procedure and House affairs committee now is because the Conservative Party is the only party that has been charged with breaches under the Canada Elections Act by the Chief Electoral Officer.</div>

    </p><a name="Para895571"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is interesting in this House is that some debates often look like they are going to be calm affairs but then, all of a sudden, people's tempers are flaring. When we talk about the crux of the matter in an election, namely money, people often tend to get carried away. </div>
    </p><a name="Para895572"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just understood what the Liberal Party member said, through the questions of the hon. whip from the other side, and I realize that the Conservative Party is extremely fragile and sensitive. It is even a little too sensitive when we talk about monetary issues during election campaigns.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895573"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a 30-year legal career, I can say that the single most important quality that we want from a judge when we address the bench is neutrality, the appearance of neutrality. The judge must be above the fray.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895574"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem for MPs, for elected members in Canada and in Quebec, but particularly outside Quebec, is that we are now realizing that a number of members do not comply with the Elections Act. In Quebec, thanks to René Lévesque, the Quebec Elections Act, which was passed in 1977, improved the election process.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895575"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would like it to be the same on the federal scene. Unfortunately, it is not always the case and some political parties—the Liberal Party and the Conservative Party, not to mention this country's two oldest political parties—would really like nothing to change in that regard.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has to stop, however, because the credibility of the elected representatives from those parties is at stake. I will likely be taking part in my third electoral campaign within a few weeks. I can assure the House that election expenses probably account for the largest part of our spending in an election. They must therefore be clear and transparent, and that should apply to every elected member of this House. Election expenses should be clear and transparent, and we should never hesitate to answer questions about our election expenses. That is unfortunately not the case. </div>
    </p><a name="Para895577"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in the Bloc Québécois are in favour of a return to rules that are smarter and more respectful of those who elected us.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895578"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My comments will focus on Motion No. 3, which would make the parties responsible for any debt incurred by their candidates, whether they know about it or not. In any legal system, to be a party to an action, one has to have been invited to take part, have been convicted and, more importantly, have been called upon by the court to defend himself or herself. </div>
    </p><a name="Para895579"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through a motion, we would like to restore an amendment proposed by the Bloc Québécois that we feel is absolutely essential: a political party cannot be held responsible for expenses incurred by a candidate, especially when it is not aware of such expenses. It seems pretty clear to me, and the same idea could be expressed both in French and in English: one cannot be responsible for a debt they know nothing about.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895580"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government would like to come and impose upon the political parties the responsibility for debts that their candidates refuse or are unable to pay back.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1720"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1720"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1725"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1715"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1720">(1720)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para895581"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do not know about the other parties, but the Bloc Québécois always makes sure that it has reliable, sincere candidates who are capable of fulfilling their obligations. Election expenses have to be monitored carefully, not only by the candidate but also by the candidate’s financial agent, who should be there at all times to oversee and supervise election spending.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895582"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How can we assign liability to a political party when one of its candidates starts spending money that the political party does not even know about? That seems to us to be completely absurd and completely contrary to all of the laws in Canada, and in particular in Quebec, where the law says that no one can be a party to an action if he or she is not responsible for the damage caused or did not sign the contract.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895583"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If a political party is not aware of the money spent by its candidate, how can it be held liable for it? It seems to us to be absolute nonsense to require candidates not to pay. If you agree to a debt, you have to pay it, but we think it is nonsense for a party to be liable for a debt that it did not agree to.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895584"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The government would like to do something totally unacceptable: require a political party to be responsible for all debts that a candidate might incur during an election. That seems to us to be completely absurd and that is why the Bloc Québécois introduced an amendment that was agreed to by the committee. Suddenly, the government is making another attempt and once again wants the party to be responsible for a debt incurred by a candidate.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895585"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, if a candidate goes on a wild spending spree amounting to $50,000 or $60,000 or $70,000, would the political party that he or she is representing be liable for it? That seems to us to be completely illogical and irrational, and most importantly contrary to the law in force in Quebec and Canada, under which, in order for someone to be a party to a contract, that person must have signed it, must be a party to it and must have set his or her hand to it or given approval for such a contract.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895586"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Obviously we are going to invite the House to rethink Motion No. 3 seriously so it can be defeated and we can come back to the amendment proposed by the Bloc Québécois in committee. We are therefore calling for Motion No. 3 to be rejected.</div>

    </p><a name="Para895591"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some candidates could run in an election and spend money while thinking there will not be any problems. They were asked to run for a party, and since they are doing so, that party will foot the bill. It is as if someone went to a restaurant and told everyone that it is an open bar and that, in any case, he is not the one paying. It is the party that is paying. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is totally unacceptable, and I think the hon. member is absolutely right. I believe, and I maintain that a candidate who runs in an election must be personally responsible for his expenditures. It is not up to the party to foot the bill at the end of the day, but to the candidate who ran. This would ensure that the candidate acts much more responsibly and is much more cautious with money, because he would be responsible for making sure that he is spending money properly and adequately. He would then be able to account for his expenditures before the House, which may not be the case for some candidates who ran under the Conservative banner in the last election. </div>

    </p><a name="Para895601"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that many members of this House have worked hard on improving this bill at the committee stage and I certainly know that we all appreciate their hard work.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895602"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me begin by pointing out that many parts of this bill are based on recommendations made by the Chief Electoral Officer in his report to the House of Commons Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895603"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the report, the Chief Electoral Officer found that when loans are given to a political candidate by a person who is not regularly in the business of lending money, it could be perceived by some as a means to influence the political process with money.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895604"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we in this House know, even the perception of influence peddling can be just as damaging to Canadians' views of the political process as unabashed influence peddling.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895605"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the recommendations made in his report include ensuring that all loans from lending institutions be granted to a candidate at the going commercial rate. Another of his recommendations was to establish a limit on loans made by individuals that would be equal to their annual political contribution amount. For 2007 that amount was $1,100. Both of these recommendations found their way into the bill.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895606"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, corporations and unions would be prevented from making loans to political candidates and parties, just as they have been prevented from making campaign contributions. Individuals would be limited in the sum total of their contributions and loans for a given year. Both a loan and a contribution would now count toward their maximum annual limit. </div>
    </p><a name="Para895607"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another important recommendation made by the Chief Electoral Officer was that the information surrounding any loans be made public in order to mitigate the chances of a perceived conflict of interest. According to the report, the information to be disclosed should include the identity of the lender, interest rates, and a repayment schedule for the loan.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895608"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was pleased to see that during the Liberal Party's last leadership race, our candidates went above and beyond the call of duty to disclose this type of information. I believe it is an excellent idea that the other parties in this House be brought under the same type of scrutiny. There are still some people in this House, not least and most specifically the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A>, who have not revealed the names of the people and organizations which contributed to his leadership campaign in 2002. This kind of secrecy is what leads many Canadians to become distrustful of the political process. </div>
    </p><a name="Para895609"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I encourage my colleagues on the Conservative side of the House to urge their leader to disclose those contributions as soon as possible. It could be a good subject to raise in this week's caucus two days from now.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895610"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to provide some background that will illustrate how we have arrived at the current set of laws governing political financing in this country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895611"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberal Party in fact has been at the forefront of the movement toward a more open and transparent process for political donations. </div>
    </p><a name="Para895612"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2003 the previous Liberal government introduced the first annual limits on individual contributions to a political party and/or candidate. In that same bill, it also limited contributions from corporations and unions to political parties. These changes stand today as the most significant ones that have been made to political financing laws in decades.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895613"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was happy to support these changes in 2003 and I am happy to support Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3120196,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3120196&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-29</A> today, providing that the amendments made at committee are kept in place. </div>
    </p><a name="Para895614"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a danger that sometimes in our zeal to make things better we actually make things worse through a variety of unintended consequences. That is why I am glad to see that the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs made some very well-intentioned and sensible amendments to Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3120196,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3120196&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-29</A> during its review of the bill this past December. The government itself brought forward some of these amendments. </div>
    </p><a name="Para895615"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Principally, they altered the bill to ensure that if a person makes a $1,100 loan to a candidate in a given year, say 2008, and that candidate repays the loan in that same year, then the donor would be able to make another $1,100 loan without going over his or her annual contribution limit. I think this was supported by all parties at committee stage.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895616"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were some amendments which the government did not agree with, which I understand we will be voting on again here at report stage.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1735"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1735"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1740"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1730"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1735">(1735)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para895617"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One such amendment has to do with who is liable for loans that go unpaid. The NDP, Bloc and Liberal members of the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs were concerned that the wording of the original bill could have made political parties responsible for loans that their candidates took without even knowing that their candidates had secured them.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895618"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If, for instance, a candidate were to take out a $20,000 loan without informing the central party that he or she had done so, the candidate could conceivably then declare bankruptcy after the election, forcing the registered political party to assume liability for the loan, despite the fact that the party had not authorized, approved, or even been aware of the loan in the first place.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895619"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the parties that have representation in the House, this would certainly be an irritant, but it would by no means be catastrophic for them. The parties that this would really hurt are the ones not represented in the House, such as the Green Party and others like it, that field candidates in all regions of the country. For those parties, the possibility of assuming responsibility for a series of loans that their central parties were not even aware of would be extremely damaging to their future viability, and this of course would not be good for democracy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895620"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A third amendment, which the government has tabled a motion to remove from the bill, has to do with loans to candidates when the campaign stretches across the January 1 new year.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895621"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Originally the bill only allowed for a single loan to a candidate during the course of the campaign valued at the maximum annual contribution limit. At committee stage it was agreed that should a campaign cross the new year divide, another loan could be made up to the annual contribution limit by an individual in the second year. I do not think I need to illustrate that. It is a clear point and I cannot see the problem the government has with that. We very recently had an election that spanned across the new year, and I think this is a sensible amendment. It is also important for all of our parties' future leadership races which might often run from one year into the next.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895622"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without this amendment, a person who lends $1,100 to a candidate in December would be able to make a similar size donation to that candidate come January, but he would not be able to enter into a second loan agreement.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895623"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While this may seem like a trivial amendment to my colleagues over on that side of the House, I would suggest it is a common sense amendment, and I hope they will consider keeping it in the bill.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895624"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could not speak to Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3120196,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3120196&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-29</A> without mentioning some of the concerns that have been raised in some quarters about the limits imposed by this bill.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895625"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, there has been some concern raised by several financial institutions that this bill would, to a significant degree, give them some control over who has the ability to run for federal office or for leadership of a political party in this country. If a candidate is not able to meet the requirements of his or her bank to secure a loan, then that candidate will be severely handicapped in the early stages of his or her campaign.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895626"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have the sense that banks are not worried so much about actually denying someone a loan in order to run for office. After all, they are professionals and will base their decisions on to whom to lend money on sound financial principles. The problem for them would be an apparent conflict of interest if one or several candidates from a particular party are denied loans while other parties do not seem to have any trouble.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895627"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not believe that these waters are unnavigable for the banks. I believe that in terms of provincial political loans some provinces already have in place measures similar to this one and the banks appear to have done fine in that respect. It is, however, something that we in the House must be mindful of and continue to monitor as we move forward.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895628"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has also been some concern raised in some circles that this bill would severely disadvantage Canadians who are less well off and yet wish to run for political office. If a candidate has not built up sufficient equity or maintained a strong enough credit rating, he or she will be prevented from securing the loans that might help launch their political careers. I know that the National Women's Liberal Commission made a submission to the procedure and House affairs committee that outlined such a concern.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895629"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said earlier, I will be supporting Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3120196,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3120196&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-29</A> with its current amendments, but I would hope that if in the future it became evident that these types of problems were occurring, the House would be willing to reopen the issue and ensure that the problems were resolved.</div>

    </p><a name="Para895631"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latest one in this act is really a good one. Let us say that a party that we might call the L party had a candidate running for leadership, and let us just call that candidate D. He borrows $800,000 from the bank, which is guaranteed by, let us say, his brother. Then he defaults on that $800,000 loan, making his brother pay it. The banks are happy, but the brother happened to make an $800,000 contribution, which is completely against the intent of the law. There are a number of members on that side, most of them sitting on the frontbench, who did exactly that. </div>
    </p><a name="Para895632"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the member if he intends to endorse that kind of a policy, or is the member actually going to encourage members of his party to follow the law's intent and stop making the procedure and House affairs committee work so hard?</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canada Elections Act has come into question in recent weeks.

They are the only members of the House who have not been reimbursed for their election expenses since the last campaign. They will try and tell us that everything is fine, but there is a good reason they decided to filibuster in the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs. They do not want to be asked about the errors and omissions the Chief Electoral Officer has found. More than 60 members have not been reimbursed for their latest election expenses, including two ministers from Quebec: the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',111556,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=111556&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Canadian Heritage, Status of Women and Official Languages</A> and the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78771,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78771&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Transport, Infrastructure and Communities</A>.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When people—citizens, Quebeckers—read or hear things like this in the media, it does not reflect well on the political elite, particularly seeing as the members of the Bloc Québécois have all been reimbursed and have therefore not been reprimanded by the Chief Electoral Officer. We have to protect that reputation because in the previous Parliament, the Liberals marred politicians' reputation far too often.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895647"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the Conservatives are making the rest of us look bad. That is what comes of being in power, I suppose. They say that it takes absolute power, but often, as some here know, power can make people crazy, and the Conservatives are verging on it. It is coming. It is getting closer. It started with election spending. They tried to cook the books so they could get more money for the next election campaign. They want to get as much money as possible. They understand how it works, and their actions are based on the premise that the more money one has, the more seats one wins. That is the Conservative way of doing things. The more money you accumulate, the better your chances of coming to power.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895648"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in Quebec are proud that in every election since 1993, we have had a majority, and not thanks to money. We spend as much as the law allows, and not a penny more, because we collect our money $5 at a time. That has always been our way of doing things.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895649"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should point out that Canada adopted its political party financing legislation based on Quebec's, which was brought in by René Lévesque, leader of the Parti Québécois and the sovereignty movement for many years, who cleaned house in Quebec. Canada also cleaned house a few years ago, but some Conservatives got caught yet again, even though they just cleaned house. People have to understand that that's what it means to be a federalist—they have to do everything they can to collect money because that is how elections are won.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895650"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course we saw that with Option Canada. Maybe, at the time of the last referendum in Quebec, they took money to which they were not entitled. We know that an investigation has revealed that millions of dollars were spent, which was not allowed under the Quebec legislation respecting elections and referendums. But what is done is done. Federalists tell us that what is done is done but that it should not happen the next time. Maybe we should ask the UN to oversee the next referendum in Quebec because it is the only way to stop these people who have no qualms about using public funds to try to win an election.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895651"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why we have Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3120196,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3120196&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-29</A> before us, or should I say before us again.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government is bringing forward three motions to try to counter three amendments made by opposition parties in committee in the last session. I will take the time to explain these three motions. For the Bloc Québécois, two of them are totally unacceptable; there is one however—a minor change—that we will support. It has to be understood that one of these motions deals with expenses, that is the amounts that an individual can contribute to a leadership campaign. </div>
    </p><a name="Para895653"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the current legislation an individual can contribute $1,000 a year to political parties during a leadership campaign. That amount has been changed to $1,100, but in the legislation it is $1,000. We thought that the bill could contain provisions allowing for annual contributions to a leadership race, as the Canada Elections Act does. The Bloc Québécois enjoys stability, but the other parties in this House often change leaders. We want to give them a chance to raise money for changing their leader instead of for running an election campaign. After the next election, few of these leaders will still be here. I can assure you of that. We are giving them a chance to collect $1,000 a year, pursuant to the current legislation, which, as I was saying, allows individuals to contribute $1,100 a year to election campaigns.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895654"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservatives have decided that these contributions can be made once every leadership race instead of once a year. All we are asking for is some logic. We have electoral legislation that allows individual contributions of $1,100 a year. An annual contribution to leadership races should be allowed in order to provide more money for self-promotion and avoid using taxpayer dollars at election time.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895655"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will allow candidates to run their race within their party and to show their true colours. They hide because they do not have the money for a party leadership race. Then, the public discovers them once they come into power and they need taxpayer dollars in order to win the election. That is what the Conservatives do: they try to buy their way in with all sorts of tricks. They must be copying the U.S. model, where we see highly publicized campaigns. Instead of letting us get to know the individuals, prefabricated images are projected in lovely ad campaigns. The candidate, or the leader, is not presented, their image is. That is the new way of doing things. In any event, they will be judged during the next election campaign.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second motion proposes that a loan become a contribution if it has not been repaid after three years. Obviously, the law does not allow any more time. As was mentioned earlier, the limit is $1,100 a year. Clearly, the law allows loans, but when someone lends another person money, that person must repay the loan at some point. As well, people cannot be allowed to do indirectly what they cannot do directly. We cannot say that we need money, but we need more than $1,100, because we do not have enough friends to give us money. This is often what happens in the other parties. Candidates have enough friends to raise the money they need, but their friends do not have enough money, so the candidates lend themselves money. They take money and lend it to themselves. Once the election campaign is over, these loans have to be repaid.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895657"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Candidates cannot use their own money to get elected, because that would be too easy. The Conservatives and Liberals have often used this tactic in recent years to try to get elected. They used their own money to fund their election campaigns. But that is not how things work. After three years, the loan must become a contribution. Because the money has not been repaid, it becomes a contribution, and if that contribution exceeds the $1,100 annual limit—for example, if the loan is for $10,000—then it violates the law. We allowed this minor change.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895658"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last motion proposes that the government reject the amendment introduced by the Bloc Québécois. The government wants to make political parties liable for their candidates' debts. Clearly, if a candidate goes to see his banker because he has no money, but the party does have money, the candidate will be able to fund his election campaign. But if the candidate cannot repay his debts, the party will have to do so.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895659"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It makes no sense to adopt this bill in its current form. Candidates must have credibility. If they have to borrow to fund a line of credit until the money comes in, then they should borrow against their own personal assets. That is what Bloc Québécois candidates have always done. We find a way to fund our campaigns, and when we do not have enough money, we take out loans, which we sign for and guarantee ourselves, until we raise enough money. The party does not guarantee our loans, we do. In that way, we may—</div>

    </p><a name="Para895666"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any event, the law allows us to spend a maximum amount on our campaign. If we wish to exceed the allowable limit, we have to obtain loans from banks and guarantee the repayment of the campaign debt until we find the money through public funding to be in a position to repay the loan.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895667"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we decide that the party will guarantee the debt, that means that everyone who does not have the requisite credibility to obtain support or financing can become candidates. That changes the way of doing things and the selection of candidates.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895668"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personally, I hope we will find a balance. Quebec's rule is as follows: we have to be able to guarantee the debts incurred in our own election campaign. The legislation states that, after three years, the debt becomes a contribution—both guaranteed debts and loans become contributions. If we wish to obey the law, we have to be able to find the necessary money, have a line of credit and provide our own security for the line of credit, since it is our election campaign. If we decide not to, that means that we no longer need the credibility. What does that tell citizens about the candidate? We have to be able to guarantee the expenses of our own campaign election.</div>

    </p><a name="Para895672"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response I would say that it will not solve them at all. First of all, if it involves a bank loan, a credit analysis must be conducted. I am therefore much more comfortable with a candidate who has to go to a bank to obtain financing for his expenses. Some contributions could come in later to help reduce his or her campaign debts.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895673"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the bank gets fleeced, it is the bank's problem and Liberal candidates would not be able to do business with the banks during the next election campaign.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895674"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other possibility is that an individual loans a candidate some money. In such cases, that individual cannot be reimbursed. However, according to the amendments, the law would be clear: after three years, that loan would become a contribution. Anyone who contributes more than the $1,000 allowed by law would be in violation of the Elections Act and face penalties, including possible imprisonment. </div>
    </p><a name="Para895675"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I prefer the existing system, because the loan will automatically become a contribution. If someone advances $100,000 to a candidate who does not pay that money back, and that person says “no problem” and cancels the debt, that means that after three years, if he or she is not paid back, that amount becomes a contribution to the election campaign, which is no longer lawful. That becomes a violation of the Elections Act, punishable by law, including prosecution.</div>

I would first like to remind the House that the Bloc Québécois is in favour of this bill. We have been speaking a great deal about the motions, but we agree completely with the substance of the bill. We believe that it is necessary to regulate loans in order to prevent financing limits from being circumvented. </div>
    </p><a name="Para895677"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These limits were established after a long debate with the Bloc Québécois, which wanted to put an end to corporate funding and to limit individual contributions, as Quebec did 30 years ago.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895678"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that Quebec, in this regard, can truly provide an important and valuable example. We have a problem with the motions, particularly Motion No. 3.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleagues spoke about this earlier, but I would like to take it one step further. I believe that adopting this motion would lead to some very significant abuses, to the point that a political party could find itself with a great deal of money in its coffers. That could be the case for some political parties, or at least for one we know. </div>
    </p><a name="Para895681"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These political parties could tell their candidates to go into debt, that someone or another could lend them some money and that, in any case, three years later, the party would advance the money. They do not need to feel responsible because the party will pay back the money. That means that the candidates would have a millstone around their necks and that they would be chained to their party. They would not have the freedom to say that they felt responsible for their own election campaign because, in any event, the party will pay for them if they do not repay their debt.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895682"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These things can be planned. That is why I am saying that things can go farther than my colleagues have acknowledged. People will be able to plan things and borrow money from multiple sources because the party will pay it back in three years. The party has the money. </div>
    </p><a name="Para895683"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Québécois finds this way of thinking outrageous. We think that candidates have to have a modicum of freedom in their ridings to get themselves elected democratically by their supporters.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895684"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not dictate who can run for our party. It is important for candidates chosen by their supporters and by people in their ridings to be responsible for their own election campaigns and the money they spend. As a result, our candidates have much closer ties to their communities and are more connected to the voters in their ridings.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895685"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can pretty much eliminate parachuting people into a riding. Parachuting people in is easy. Some people, a week before the election, have never campaigned. This happened in Quebec in the last election, especially with the Conservatives. There were candidates who had never been involved in politics, not at all. At the last minute, the party found some people and told them not to worry because with the three-year legislation, they would not have to pay back the money they borrowed.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895686"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imagine what being told in advance that the debt will be paid off in three years can do to a candidate's accountability. A party can parachute in any candidate at all. The candidate is not accountable and is not even chosen by supporters. We are well aware—experience has shown—that there were candidates who did not even have supporters.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895687"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is much easier for a party to go into a riding and convince people to run if it promises to pay off their debts later.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This motion is truly unacceptable. The government wants to hold the political parties responsible for their candidate's debts. That is unacceptable and I would say it is bordering on immoral. In our capitalist system every individual is responsible for their own debt. Under the new plan, an individual is no longer responsible for his or her debt, but a third party, an entity, in short, a political party is. The party would become responsible for an individual's debt. That makes absolutely no sense.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895689"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is more, five or six lenders could be identified. They could even come from outside the riding and be reimbursed in three years. See how complicated this becomes? The lender would no longer ask for a guarantee. When the Bloc Québécois candidates borrowed money—at one time we needed to do so, but fortunately that is no longer the case since things are going well—they went to the bank and were responsible for the debt. This is fundamental. It gives candidates the chance to be responsible to the electors and to hold their heads high after the election whether they won or not. They do not owe anyone anything and they will settle their debts.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895690"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This necessarily forces people to work together, to collaborate and create a much greater sense of belonging within the riding. A candidate has to work with the people who are there to help. This takes many $1,100 contributions and there are not many people who donate that kind of money. In my riding, there are very few people who give $1,100. As my colleague was saying earlier, we collect donations of $5, $10 or $20 and that is what we use for our election campaign. This creates a democratic link with the people in our riding and that is what really counts. If we no longer have that and can borrow $80,000 in one shot—as we saw a candidate do and then switch parties—without paying it back, this becomes institutionalized and there is no longer any need to pay money back because the party will take care of it. That does not make any sense. It is wrong and we cannot accept it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895691"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first amendment made in committee makes sense to us since all the contribution limits currently in the Canada Elections Act are annual, except in the case of candidates for party leadership. Contributions should be annual and should not be contributions for a leadership campaign. It is a well-known and perfectly correct old habit that every January, in the new year, people can once again give money to the political parties. Why would it not be the same for leadership campaigns, which do last from one year to the next? This would let anyone who wants to support a candidate give again after the year ends. One year is long enough to assume people would be able to give again.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895692"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We think that Motion No. 1 is very important and we want to keep it that way. We are not against the idea of the annual contribution, but against the fact that parties would be responsible for contributions that come from personal loans. This could lead to dishonesty. We could end up with such a law in a few years and we could plan out all the loans taken by a candidate. This is completely unacceptable. We are against this motion and will keep voting against it. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In debate we have spent a fair bit of time talking about the filibuster in the procedure and House affairs committee with regard to what is called the in-and-out scam, whereby the Conservative Party transferred moneys to individual candidates and then the candidates would give it back to the party. They then would claim the expense as advertising. As the Chief Electoral Officer has found, the Conservatives in fact are in breach of the Canada Elections Act, it amounts to about $1 million, and it means that they have overspent.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895695"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder if the member can tell the House whether, in the Bloc's experience in the procedure and House affairs committee, the government is prepared to stand up and be accountable for what it did and what the Conservative Party in fact was found in breach of with regard to the swapping of money--or it looks like money laundering--in order to get additional advantage for the Conservative Party in a democratic system.</div>

Indeed, it seems that a piece of legislation can generally be circumvented. That is the case at this time. Although the Canada Elections Act has a relatively rigid framework, we see that it can be circumvented. In any case, some people try to do so.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895697"></a><p>

Greater attention needs to paid to this.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We get the impression that the federal government made the Canada Elections Act more rigid, but now wants it to be relaxed, because it was made a little too strict.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must bear in mind that some candidates come from areas where they are not popular, but they want to go into politics anyway.

    </p><a name="Para895703"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is practical for this person to take out a loan in his or her name. If it is not paid back, that individual's credit rating alone would be affected.

The Bloc Québécois supports the principle of this bill. However, the government has brought back some measures that we had already amended in committee.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895705"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Québécois reserves its decision regarding the final vote on this legislation. I will be brief in dealing with its content.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895706"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bill provides that all loans to political entities, including mandatory disclosure of terms, and the identity of all lenders and loan guarantors, must be uniform and transparent. Also, unions and corporations, save for some exceptions, would be prohibited from making contributions under the Federal Accountability Act, and also from lending money. The amount of loans, loan guarantees and contributions that individuals can make cannot exceed the limit prescribed in the Federal Accountability Act, namely $1,100. Finally, only financial institutions and political entities would be allowed to make loans beyond the contribution limit, and only at commercial rates of interest. The rules for the treatment of unpaid loans to ensure candidates cannot walk away from unpaid loans would be tightened. The bill also provides that loans that remain unpaid after 18 months would be considered political contributions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895707"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is with the last point. Riding associations—or, in the absence thereof, the party itself—would be responsible for paying back debts that their candidates fail to reimburse. Several of my colleagues here in the House, particularly my Bloc Québécois colleagues, have said how absurd that is. In fact, the government introduced this motion, as well as two others, to counter three amendments made by the opposition parties in committee. By putting this motion forward, the Conservative government is rejecting the Bloc Québécois amendment.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895708"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Political parties—and I think we have heard this several times now—would become responsible for debts contracted by their candidates. The problem with the governing party's motion is that political parties are not really involved in contracts between candidates and their financial institutions. In Quebec, that is between the candidate and his or her bank or credit union. Political parties do not get involved in that aspect of their candidates' election campaigns.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895709"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this motion, the government is trying to make parties responsible for their candidates' debts, which is completely illogical because parties cannot limit their candidates' spending. There is a limit, a cap, but candidates may borrow money for their own campaigns at their own discretion or that of their organizations. The party is not involved in the transaction.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895710"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A candidate can therefore go into debt. Say a candidate borrows $60,000 from a bank or credit union. The party cannot stop candidates from doing this. Legally, candidates can do this. The party would then end up with that candidate's debt, as well as that of other candidates who, unfortunately, cannot or will not pay the money back. This is akin to a law allowing someone to borrow money without informing the guarantor. When the credit union manager asks for the name of the guarantor, the borrower could say that it is his neighbour. The neighbour would then be responsible for the debt if the borrower did not pay it back. That makes no sense at all. </div>
    </p><a name="Para895711"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, it would be wrong to assume that all the candidates in an election are dishonest. On the contrary, I hope that the vast majority are honest. But we are opening the door to a situation where someone runs for election, goes deeply into debt and does not win a seat. He knows that if he cannot repay his debts, the party will be saddled with the debt. A political party would be in serious difficulty if even a few people could not or would not shoulder that debt.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I knew that after the election, I would be in debt. I hoped to get elected so that I would be able to repay my debt fairly quickly, but I lost by about 300 votes that time.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. André Bellavance:</b> I thank my colleagues for their expressions of sympathy, but it was just a temporary setback, Mr. Speaker. I won my seat in 2004.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895716"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make a long story short, after the election campaign, I no longer had a job, and I was in a lot of debt. As any responsible person would do, I made sure I repaid that debt. It never occurred to me that my party should take on that responsibility.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895717"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, I had received an election rebate, because my expenses were in order, but I had still borrowed money, because in our riding, the party did not have much money at the time. Things have changed a great deal since then. There must not be very many cases where candidates, at least Bloc Québécois candidates, do not repay their debts. If a party were saddled with all its candidates' debts, the party supporters would not be very happy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895718"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier, one of my colleagues was saying that in his riding—and it is that way for the most part in Bloc Québécois ridings—supporters quite often give small amounts of money. We have a multitude of supporters who take part in fundraising activities. They organize spaghetti nights at $10, $20 or $25 a head as a fundraiser because in our culture, we do not rely on big companies, even though the legislation has now changed for the better—thankfully.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895719"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember a time when the former prime minister, during a leadership race that was more like a coronation, received $100,000 from the Irving Oil Corporation. I can assure you that I have never received that kind of money, even when the legislation allowed it. Where I come from our supporters would be insulted if they were told that all the money they raised was going to be used to pay off a candidate's debt, if the candidate defaulted, because it was the party's responsibility to do so.</div>

Nonetheless, I believe it does know: it wants to go back to the polls because it does not have any plans that would enable it to go on much longer.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895722"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government thought it would not last long. It wanted to quickly fulfill its so-called promises, but in its haste it left out some parts.

    </p><a name="Para895724"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since I am being signalled that I have only two minutes left, I will be brief.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895725"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Québécois believes it is necessary to regulate loans in order to prevent people from getting around the financing limits. In fact, it is ironic that this government is presenting such a bill, since the Conservative Party is currently being investigated by Elections Canada, which is refusing to rebate the campaign expenses for 67 Conservative candidates who ran during the last election campaign. There are nine members from Quebec, two ministers from Quebec and a secretary of state from Quebec. The latter is not really a minister, although he has a limousine. A secretary of state is not considered a real minister. Those people are among that group.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895726"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is how they do it: money is transferred to the ridings for advertising. It was supposed to be for local advertising, but in reality, it was used for national advertising. The candidate who received the money never once saw his face on television or in the media. It really was for national advertising. The riding associations sent money back to the national level to pay for the advertising. </div>
    </p><a name="Para895727"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This strategy allowed the party to raise its limits for campaign spending by $1.2 million. That is a considerable sum, which is why it is so important at this time, on the eve of a possible election campaign, to avoid this kind of ploy, and ensure that the Conservative Party cannot repeat the same gimmick, which allowed them to have higher spending limits for campaign advertising than any other party normally would have.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to point out that the Conservative Party accused the NDP and the Liberals of doing the same thing. However, Elections Canada said that those parties really gave their candidates an opportunity to have local advertising. That is the difference.</div>

It is extremely important when it comes to the issue of promoting and advertising tour groups both in Canada and in China.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895739"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2005 the previous Liberal government had an agreement in principle to deal with this issue. This is a very important issue in terms of advertising, because 134 countries have approved destination status and it is absolutely critical for us as a country in order to be able to promote tourism. In particular, there is the fact that the Chinese have over 120 million foreign trips a year. On average, they spend about $1,800, it is assumed, when it comes to hotels, shopping and so on.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895740"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to tap into that huge market, but as we know, the government's relations with China have not been very good, to say the least, or to be charitable. The fact is that when the government came in, it talked about a thousand Chinese spies in Canada and it waited about a year to have a meeting with the ambassador here. Generally, it has been a very rocky road. </div>
    </p><a name="Para895741"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, what has happened is that this agreement in principle has fallen off the table. We need to have this agreement in place because it will give us the opportunity for tour agencies to send groups to Canada and allow Canada to advertise itself in China as a preferred destination. We need to get that opportunity.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895742"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, the relationship is one in which there has been no agreement. In fact, we had the government threatening to take China to the WTO, and there are other moves that have not been beneficial.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895743"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is important for our tourism industry. It is important for our tourist agencies. In this country, many people of Chinese descent would love to see this, as well as others, but the failure of the government to move on this issue has been and continues to be a very sore point.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895744"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We see the booming economies of China, India and others. The fact is that this is an opportunity that at the moment has been lost. We cannot have that happen. We need to have this.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895745"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The previous Liberal government saw the opportunity in China and Southeast Asia. We moved very quickly on that. We moved Canadian tourism's headquarters to Vancouver. We see Asia as an important opportunity for us, yet we are looking at a situation in which an estimated 700,000 Chinese tourists or more could come to Canada and, unless we have this ADS agreement, we will miss out. </div>
    </p><a name="Para895746"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I urged the government to get back to the table, to cut down on the rhetoric with the Chinese and to come up with an agreement in the interests of both parties. In particular, for our tourist industry this is critical, as we are talking about a potential 700,000 tourists. We are talking about an average of $1,800 being spent by people coming here. It is a tremendous market.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895747"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are looking at the Australians and others who have these agreements and we see where the tourists are going. They are not coming here. We need to get this done. I have urged the government to do so.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895748"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would hope that the parliamentary secretary either will have some good news tonight or will at least indicate to me that we will get back to talking, because in the end this is not a partisan issue. This is a Canadian issue. We are pushing it because on this side of the House we believe that it is in our national interest to push something that others are taking advantage of.</div>

    </p><a name="Para895750"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has committed to finalizing approved destination status or ADS. ADS would provide a significant boost in tourism between Canada and China, a boost that would benefit Canada's important tourism sector. That is why the government has raised this issue directly with senior Chinese officials at every opportunity.</div>

The minister met with his new Chinese counterpart, Minister Chen Deming. The two had a series of meetings where the full range of Canada-China bilateral commercial relations were discussed. </div>
    </p><a name="Para895752"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ministers talked about ongoing progress in the negotiation of a foreign investment promotion and protection agreement, the latest developments in the Asia-Pacific gateway and corridor initiative, improving two way investment flows and deepening commercial operation. Let me assure the hon. member that the Canada-China relationship has a solid foundation, one that was clearly evident by the warm reception the minister received when he visited China.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895753"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We made it clear that Canada was looking to advance this file. The issue has been in play for several years now. Canada would like to move ADS along in a meaningful way. Canada would like to see this end in a win-win negotiated arrangement, whereby both countries would stand to benefit from the increased people to people ties that ADS would help facilitate, especially with China and Canada being back to back hosts for the Olympic Games. Therefore, we continue to pursue this objective with the Chinese at every single opportunity.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895754"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government of Canada recognizes that the tourism industry is a vital part of Canada's economy. Tourism generates $60 billion of revenue in Canada. It contributes to the economy of every region. China is an important tourism market for Canada and is one of our target markets. The Canadian Tourism Commission has an office in Beijing, has launched a Mandarin website and has participated in various tourism fairs in China.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895755"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members can be assured that the government will continue to press the Chinese for progress on ADS. However, the hon. member must also be aware that ADS and tourism is but one component of our expansive commercial ties with China, which include bilateral trade, innovation cooperation and two way investments.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895756"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canada-China relationship will continue to grow and, in the meanwhile, individual Chinese visitors continue to come to Canada even without ADS. Preliminary estimates show that 146,000 overnight visitors came to Canada in 2007, the fourth straight year of growth. Canada has seen growth of about 12% in Chinese visitors since 2000.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was on January 29. The Bloc brought up the issue every day thereafter, and finally achieved satisfaction. The government decided to separate the vote on the trust from the budget. That was a good decision. We asked for it over and over.</div>

He told us that the trust money would be separate from the budget. The Secretary of State for Agriculture likes to boast that the Bloc Québécois does not have any power; however, the Bloc won this one. The secretary is not up to date. A week after the fact, he was still going on about it.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, one important issue remains.

He told him that it was a good idea to separate the money, that he himself had asked for that and that it agreed with the Quebec consensus that the votes should be separate. He also told him one more thing: that more money is needed. One billion dollars is not enough. More money is needed.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895770"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last fall, the Bloc Québécois presented a $3.5 billion action plan, with $2 billion for the manufacturing industry, $1 billion for the forestry industry and $1.5 billion for employment insurance. That is a total of $4 billion. $1 billion has been put into the trust and the remaining $3.5 billion remains to be disbursed.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895771"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will the government go ahead and respond to the second requirement of the Quebec consensus and agree to allocate the money, from this year's $10 billion surplus, as follows: $3 billion to the debt, $3.5 billion to recovery and $3 billion to help seniors? Is this not the right decision, which the government should make public as soon as possible?</div>

    </p><a name="Para895773"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the community development trust, our government intends to make a concrete difference for communities and workers who are adjusting to a shifting global economic landscape.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895774"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Canada's economy is very strong overall, we know that global economic volatility has put pressure on particular communities and workers, especially those communities that rely on a single sector or company that is being challenged. That is why we will be investing $1 billion in the community development trust to support provincial and territorial initiatives that help these communities and workers weather the economic storms facing them.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895775"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This initiative has been widely praised by key organizations and provincial leaders. For instance, Shawn Graham, the Liberal premier of New Brunswick, remarked that his government was “pleased that the Prime Minister and his government have made this commitment”. The Federation of Canadian Municipalities declared that it “applauds the federal government's decision to help Canadian communities hit by economic upheaval”. The fund “is more than welcome”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895776"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, communities told us that they need to receive this assistance in a timely fashion. That is why we introduced Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3241744,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3241744&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-41</A> to rapidly implement the trust.

    </p><a name="Para895778"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This trust builds on the significant actions we have already taken to strengthen the economy and improve the business environment, enabling businesses in all sectors to become more competitive and invest for the future.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895779"></a><p>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is that the allocation among provinces is unacceptable. Although there are two provinces that are very affected, all the provinces will receive money.

    </p><a name="Para895789"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As McGill University economics professor, Tom Velk, pointed out in <i>The Montreal Gazette</i>, he said that most of those new jobs were from the private sector and outside of export dominated industries.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895790"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, some sectors in Quebec are even facing skills shortages.</div>
    </p><a name="Para895791"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As John Simonetti, the president of a Montreal employment agency, recently noted, finding people to fill vacancies in many industries is an increasingly difficult challenge.

    </p><a name="Para895792"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly, Quebec and Canada still have solid economic fundamentals as demonstrated through our robust labour market, fundamentals that we will build on to ensure Canada remains well positioned to face any volatility.</div>
