	The House resumed from October 28 consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-29, an act to regulate interprovincial trade in and 
the importation for commercial purposes of certain 
manganese-based substances, be read the third time and passed; 
and of the amendment and the amendment to the amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Finlay (Oxford, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, in the past 30 
to 40 years the evidence has been accumulating that all is not well 
with mother earth. The list of endangered species lengthens, the 
flocks of migratory birds dwindle, the lakes and rivers die. Even 
the oceans are becoming toxic sinks. We are warned not to go out in 
the sun. A tan is no longer a sign of health.
<P>
	The aboriginal people understood these things. Many young 
people understand them. Many adults do not, or will not. Our 
modern, industrial, developed society is characterized in these 
words of the poet Gerard Manley Hopkins in his poem, <I>God's 
Grandeur</I>:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The world is charged with the grandeur of God.</BLOCKQUOTE>
It will flame out, like shining from shook foil;<BR>
It gathers to a greatness like the ooze of oil
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>crushed. Why do men then now not reck his rod?<BR>
Generations have trod, have trod, have trod;</BLOCKQUOTE>
and all is seared with trade; bleared, smeared with toil;<BR>
and wears man's smudge and shares man's smell; the soil

	Hopkins' hopeful ending suggests that all may yet be well with 
God's help. But this poem was written over 100 years ago and 
human technology is now outstripping nature. We as citizens of this 
planet must redress the balance with nature which is the only way 
to ensure a sustainable future for all humanity. Unless we change 
our attitude to the environment, we will destroy it and ourselves 
into the bargain. The time is now.
<P>
	This brings me to the bill before us today. Bill C-29 seeks to ban 
the fuel additive MMT from Canadian fuels. I support the bill 
because the most efficient way to protect the environment is to 
prevent pollution. Bill C-29 accomplishes this.
<P>
	Canadians know how important their environment is and they 
expect the federal government to take a leadership role in 
preserving and protecting it.
<P>
	Some members of the House may ask why Bill C-29 is 
important. Bill C-29 represents a prudent approach that ensures the 
Canadian consumers and the environment are protected. It deals 
with the uncertainty regarding the long term effects of MMT on 
advanced emission control technologies such as on board 
diagnostics, OBD, that are now being built into the motor vehicle 
fleet on a widespread basis.
<P>
	On board diagnostic systems are designed to monitor the 
performance of pollution control systems, particularly the 
catalysts, and alert the driver to a malfunction. These systems 
prevent increased tail pipe emissions, including carbon monoxide 
and other hydrocarbons which impact on local air quality, as well 
as carbon dioxide, the principal contributor to climate change.
<P>
	Properly functioning OBD systems are in essence an inspection 
and maintenance tool in the vehicle, and inspection and 
maintenance programs require vehicles to be tested on a periodic 
basis for emissions.
<P>
	The industry wide implementation of properly functioning OBD 
systems will permit all Canadians to benefit from an emissions 
reduction strategy. For example, an assessment of the emissions 
benefit attributed to the air care inspection and maintenance 
program in the Vancouver city area conducted on an annual basis 
shows that hydrocarbon emissions have been reduced by 20 per 
cent, carbon monoxide emissions by 24 per cent, nitrogen oxide 
emissions by 2.7 per cent and fuel consumption by 5 per cent from 
the tested fleet.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6892"> 6892 </A></B>
<P>
	Auto makers have indicated that if MMT remains in Canadian 
gasoline they would take action, ranging from disconnecting OBD 
sensors to removal of the OBD systems and decreased warranty 
provisions for automobile owners. General Motors of Canada has 
already advised the government that it has disabled certain 
functions of the OBD system on 1996 model year vehicles.
<P>
	Fortunately, there are alternatives to MMT. Alternative fuels can 
replace this additive as an oxygen enhancer in gasoline. For 
instance, ethanol is a renewable fuel that I and many of my rural 
caucus colleagues have supported for its obvious environmental 
and economic benefits. The ethanol plant in Chatham will have an 
enormous economic benefit for southwestern Ontario. The plant 
will be producing over 150 million litres of this cleaner burning 
fuel which will ensure that a better alternative to MMT as an 
oxygen enhancer is readily available for the Canadian consumer.
<P>
<B>(1010 )</B>
<P>
	The earth is a global spaceship. The delicate envelope of 
atmosphere which surrounds us is all the environment we have. As 
human beings we share with all other species of animals and plants 
this layer of air, soil and moisture. All citizens of Canada need to 
keep in mind that wonderful picture of planet earth taken by 
astronauts which shows it swathed in blue green swirls of 
atmosphere floating in the black void of space.
<P>
	Until all of us are aware of the finite, fragile and unique nature of 
our world, and treat it accordingly, we must pass laws which will 
protect this planet for future generations. Bill C-29 is such a law 
and I am proud to support it.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ): 
</B>Madam Speaker, I am pleased to speak to this bill on manganese 
based additives, but at the same time I find it sad that the 
government continues to obstinately insist on passing a bill to ban 
MMT, when there has been no proof of any real danger to the 
environment.
<P>
	In this matter, the official opposition has had the very 
constructive attitude that, yes, it would be worthwhile to look at 
this, that there would have to be impact studies, that we would have 
to look at the potential advantages, impact and risks associated 
with this additive. But the government has found no proof and has 
no justification. It seems that the sole reason for the government's 
continuing pressures is the lobbying by Ontario MPs, who see this 
bill as a way of improving the cost-effectiveness of a not very 
successful industrial sector in Ontario.
<P>
	The government's insistence on pushing the bill through, no 
matter what, has had several effects. As was said this morning, 
Ottawa wants to push through a bill that will be harmful to 
Montreal. It is, moreover, harmful  to all of Canada, for there is the 
possibility of a nearly $200 million lawsuit by an American 
company, Ethyl, under NAFTA. The Canadian government, in 
irresponsibly pushing this bill ahead, will once again be costing 
Canadians a great deal of money.
<P>
	Why does the government absolutely insist on adopting this bill, 
when it could simply be sent to a committee for study, as long as 
necessary to prove the environmental effects of MMT? Are there 
harmful effects, yes or no? Could the validity of the Ethyl claim be 
verified? When it comes down to it, will we be stuck with a major 
legal battle, with millions of dollars spent on defending Canada in a 
case about which we are not even certain? What is more, the 
governments of Alberta and Quebec have already announced that 
they intend to take Ottawa to court, and they are not alone. A total 
of six provinces have spoken out against the federal government's 
bill on MMT, this gasoline additive which has not been proven 
harmful to health.
<P>
	There are, therefore, some important elements to be considered: 
the cost to Canadians, and the tarnishing of Canada's image by 
defending a case about which there is no certainty under the free 
trade agreement. What is still more dramatic for Quebecers, 
however, was summarized very aptly by the president of the 
Canadian Petroleum Products Institute, Alain Perez, when he said 
``At this time, there are several factors threatening a Montreal 
refinery, one of which is this bill''.
<P>
	Is this one more case of the federal government putting Ontario 
before Quebec, or changing the rules of the game? The competitors 
are already in the marketplace, the rules of the game are already in 
place, and if the refineries in the Montreal region are able to 
survive, those in Ontario must be able to as well. If there are 
problems with ethanol production, efforts must be made to make it 
more profitable, to improve production processes and other 
procedures, but not via political interference. Political interference 
changes the rules of the game.
<P>
<B>(1015)</B>
<P>
	We are seeing an increasing number of instances under the 
current Liberal government. The same is being done with Canadian 
International. By playing this kind of game, the government is 
promoting unfair competition. On the one hand, the government 
upholds a certain principle and the principle of free competition is 
supposed to rule the market, because it will make us competitive 
and people will get a better deal. But on the other hand, whenever 
there is a very strong political lobby-in the case of Canadian, it is 
western Canada, and in this particular case it is 
Ontario-environmental considerations which are not justified are 
used as an excuse to go ahead and rush a bill like this one through 
the House.
<P>
	I think that in this case, the federal government has clearly 
shown that it is more or less being led by its  strong delegation from 
Ontario, by the lobby of ministers from that region. When a 
decision is to be made here in Parliament, all aspects of a bill must 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6893"> 6893 </A></B>
<P>
be considered. Whether we are talking about economic costs, the 
legal problems that can be expected with the provinces, the 
potential damage to our international reputation and the impact on 
employment in a region like Montreal, if the federal government 
adopts this bill, if the Liberal majority manages to ram it down our 
throats, they will prove once again that Canadian federalism is 
good if it is good for Ontario.
<P>
	When there is a choice to be made between economic benefits 
for Ontario or for Quebec, like the Supreme Court in this country or 
the Tower of Pisa, it always leans in the same direction. The federal 
government always leans toward Ontario, which is more less what 
is happening in this case.
<P>
	In the coming year there will be an election campaign, when 
Quebecers will be asked to consider the relevance of all this. It will 
be up to them to decide, in this case as in so many others, who 
conducted the best defence of Quebec's interests. Was it the federal 
government, which is ramming down our throats a bill that will 
benefit Ontario, without giving any scientific proof of the 
environmental impact, or was it the Bloc Quebecois, which 
defended Quebecers and the entire Canadian market, saying that 
political lobbying was the only reason and that the lobbies fully 
supported the federal government's position?
<P>
	It looks as though the federal government has taken advantage of 
the silence of the Conservative Party. Defending the interests of 
Quebec does not seem to be its main concern. When one has a 
federal vision of Canada, there are many things one does not talk 
about. We in the Bloc Quebecois have no such constraints. We have 
no wish to form the government, and so we are in a position to 
defend consumers, Canadians and Quebecers, to ensure that the 
choices made by the Canadian government produce long term 
benefits for the Canadian economy and the Quebec economy.
<P>
	When the Liberals vote on this bill later today, especially the 
Liberal members from Quebec, I hope they remember this position 
that was reported in the papers today. I am referring to what was 
said by Alain Perez, president of the Canadian Petroleum Products 
Institute: ``At this moment, the existence of a Montreal refinery is 
threatened by a number of factors, including this bill, the bill on 
MMT, on manganese-based additives''.
<P>
	When the Liberals vote on this bill, every time a Liberal 
member, especially those from Quebec, rises in the House to vote 
in favour of the bill, he will be hurting Quebec's economy, and 
Quebecers are sure to rembember this in the next election.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, the environment as a topic currently is not the 
headline grabber that it once was. However, the worrisome 
fundamental trends for our planet remain.
<P>
	The real problem is to determine what are wise actions for 
governments to take to protect the environment in view of science, 
economics and politics. Often it is the apparently obvious quick fix 
that is tried and then eventually realized as no real solution. In 
addition there is always the politics of balancing and reconciling 
the vectors that pull in different directions. It seems in this case that 
the vectors or forces of politics win over the policy vectors 
indicated by science.
<P>
	With this bill we have a political headstrong approach that is 
characteristic of governments that think they are high in the polls, 
believe their own press releases and have an arrogance that only 
they have the divine right to govern. My how the tone has changed 
from when these Liberal members were in opposition. Back then 
they howled like coyotes when the other old arrogant members, the 
Conservatives, used closure. The Liberals were outraged when 
closure was used. Now that they are in power they do the same 
thing.
<P>
<B>(1020)</B>
<P>
	Voters have to remember this and resolve that such breaking of 
faith with the community should not be rewarded in the next 
election with support and a vote for any Liberal. What is being 
done today reveals the inner heart of what drives Liberals in 
government. It is a prime example of why federal politicians are 
rated no higher than insincere used car salesmen. It is 
understandable that Canadians turn off on politics.
<P>
	Before us we have a bill which is anti free trade and which is 
supposed to help the environment but it is not supported by 
credible scientific evidence. This bill should have died on the 
Order Paper but now we have it back again under the closure rules.
<P>
	I despair that we will ever see a Liberal Minister of the 
Environment who will be content with the best that science has to 
offer for environmental policy. The quest for short term political 
payoff is evidenced in this bill to ban the importation and trade of 
MMT in gasoline.
<P>
	We were not even close to having a realistic minister when the 
member from Hamilton had the job. She had a manner of finding 
her own departmental officials two steps behind her on nearly 
every erratic policy course change in her quest for the heroin fix of 
the political hit. Unfortunately now with the new minister, 
Canadians are getting little improvement on the MMT score.
<P>
	In the environment portfolio there has not been an abundance of 
legislation. Since the Liberals took power in 1993 there have been 
only six bills brought forward by the Minister of the Environment. 
It is a stark comparison  to the active Department of Justice which 
has introduced 30 bills. With extra time to consult and consider, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6894"> 6894 </A></B>
<P>
one would think that environment would only produce wise and 
quality law. How wrong to surmise.
<P>
	In May 1995 the former minister introduced a bill that would ban 
the interprovincial trade and importation of the gasoline additive 
MMT. Bill C-94 which is now Bill C-29 has easily become one of 
the most starkly divided issues during this Parliament. No 
legislation during the 35th Parliament has lasted this long in the 
House. The reason is that the so-called science is in conflict. Ways 
and means do not match up in this bill. When a basic idea is flawed, 
the resultant legislation is bad. It does not deserve to be passed.
<P>
	However the former minister and her political friends at the 
Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association had a half baked idea 
that went too far. The MVMA wanted MMT to be removed from 
unleaded gasoline in Canada because it claimed that the additive 
which is used to boost octane and reduce pollution was creating 
havoc with the new onboard diagnostic pollution sensors in late 
model automobiles.
<P>
	There were only two ways to get MMT out of Canadian gasoline. 
One would have been for the MVMA to conclude negotiations with 
the stakeholders including Ethyl Corporation which manufactures 
MMT as well as the petroleum companies and conduct independent 
third party tests that would conclusively demonstrate if MMT was 
harmful. The other was the strong arm approach to directly 
legislate with the government trying to scare Canadians, claiming 
that if MMT was not out of fuel, automobile manufacturing plants 
could close and the price of cars would dramatically increase. 
Those latter arguments put forward by the government proved to be 
false.
<P>
	The weighing of the policy options must have taken at least two 
minutes for the minister to decide as the choice was so poor. The 
choices were politics or science, and the minister chose politics.
<P>
	The Canadian Environmental Protection Act, CEPA, was 
designed to create environmental protection and among other 
things to ban substances that are harmful to the public health and 
the environment. The former minister wanted to put MMT on 
CEPA's toxic list but Health Canada did not find it harmful to our 
health. Unfortunately for Canada's most unenvironmental 
environment minister, Health Canada had already proved that 
MMT in its present manner of use presented no harm to health and 
it later stood by their conclusion on the record.
<P>
	With the new minister, Environment Canada has been no better 
off with this bill. He had his chance to put Bill C-94 on a permanent 
shelf to collect dust. One wonders who is really in charge of 
legislative initiatives with his department as it was brought forward 
again in full view of the bill's discredit. The mistake of this bill will  
certainly remain as a legacy to Liberal environmental legislation.
<P>
	Reformers have opposed this bill without pressure from lobby 
groups because the inherent nature of the original idea was bad. 
Thorough and rigorous independent testing is the only way to 
resolve the regulatory question of whether we should have MMT in 
gasoline.
<P>
<B>(1025 )</B>
<P>
	At present MMT helps cars run cleaner with better distance to 
fuel consumption ratios so that less gas is burned which helps the 
global warming agenda. I am told that MMT in gasoline is 
significantly better for gas mileage than reformulated gasoline. 
Further, we should carefully test some of the proposed alternatives 
to reformulated gasoline as they may not be inherently as 
environmentally friendly as first thought. Choices turn out that way 
when politicians seek the short term rewards of political success 
over what science may show as the long term public interest.
<P>
	We also have to look at the taxpayer subsidies the Liberals are 
pouring into ethanol production which may be an uneconomical 
choice that in total in the big picture may not be very 
environmentally friendly. The issue of MMT and why the 
government does not like it I suspect has a lot to do with money and 
who pays rather than doing the right thing for the environment.
<P>
	Above all, the use of closure as a principle in Parliament on this 
type of bill is disrespectful to members of the House. It is an 
example of how old line system defenders, the Liberals in this case, 
continue in their traditional ways and reinforce public cynicism 
about representative government versus responsible and 
accountable government to the people.
<P>
	The bill is bad. Its methods are perverse. Now we have the final 
insult of it being driven by closure. I hope Canadians will 
remember this in the next election.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> Resuming 
debate. Is the House ready for the question?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Question.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Kilger:</B> Madam Speaker, there has already been a certain 
amount of co-operation among all the parties involved in this 
debate, and I must also acknowledge that the Chair has asked if we 
wished to resume debate. In a spirit of co-operation, we would ask 
the Chair to please return to the matter under debate so we may 
complete this nevertheless important bill.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> I acknowledge 
the remarks of the hon. government whip but I would remind this 
House that, on two occasions I called for a resumption of debate, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6895"> 6895 </A></B>
<P>
and no one seemed interested in doing so. I will call for it a third 
time. Resuming debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Laurin:</B> Madam Speaker, on a point of order. There is a 
practice in this Parliament that has gone on for three years at least 
whereby the parties agree to provide you with a list of those who 
will be speaking. The opposition has always co-operated and is 
prepared to continue doing so.
<P>
	However, a procedure, even if you did say it twice, must not be 
used to speed things up and take people by surprise. We are 
prepared to co-operate. I thank the chief whip of the Liberal Party 
for recognizing the need to facilitate debate, but I do not want 
things hurried up and the debate adjourned earlier than planned, 
before everyone on the list has had a chance to speak.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Kilger:</B> Madam Speaker, I would nevertheless like to say 
that, in presiding over our debates at this time, the Chair has 
certainly followed our Standing Orders in asking members if they 
wished to resume debate. No one rose on either side of the House. I 
do recognize that the Chair was right in following the procedure 
and putting the question.
<P>
	That said, and still in the spirit of co-operation among the parties 
in this matter, I hope we can continue the debate.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Point of order.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> The hon. whip 
of the Reform Party has to be in his seat in order to be recognized.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> He is.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to reinforce the 
position taken by the government whip. The Chair has acted 
entirely appropriately in this case. She asked repeatedly for 
speakers, for anybody to stand. There was no attempt to rush things 
through at all that I could see. I do not agree, of course, with the 
time limitations and some of the other things that are going on, but 
the Chair has acted appropriately.
<P>
<B>(1030)</B>
<P>
	By all means, if somebody wants to debate, then we will not 
stand in the way of doing it. However, the Chair is absolutely right.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> Thank you 
very much. However, you will appreciate that if members wish to 
speak and have put forth their name on the speaking list, they 
should be in the House when it is their time for debate.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Accordingly, we are resuming debate with the hon. member for 
Mercier.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Laurin:</B> Madam Speaker, again in the spirit of co-operation, 
I think a member on the Liberal side rose to speak, but you perhaps 
did not see him. As we usually alternate our speeches, we are 
prepared to have you recognize the Liberal member who rose.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> I have just 
recognized the hon. member for Mercier in this debate. Does she 
wish to continue the debate?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Yes, Madam Speaker, 
after almost losing my turn because I hoped that the hon. member 
across the way would rise in his place. I would like to speak to Bill 
C-29 this morning, with the government having just imposed an 
unacceptable gag.
<P>
	The official opposition, under the enlightened direction of our 
critic, the member for Laurentides, conducted a study and then 
mounted a campaign on this issue, which has been presented as an 
environmental issue, when in reality it is an economic one that pits 
certain parts of the country against others, in this case Ontario and 
Quebec.
<P>
	After serious examination of the matter in committee, the 
official opposition could only conclude, in the absence of 
conclusive evidence backed up by independent studies, that by 
banning MMT, the government is actually looking for a way to 
satisfy the automobile industry, which is concentrated, as everyone 
knows, in Ontario.
<P>
	This ban will have terrible repercussions on oil companies in my 
riding in eastern Montreal. Over the years, the riding of Mercier 
has lost four oil companies. Their loss had a devastating effect, not 
only on employment, but also on the rest of the petrochemical 
industry and its future.
<P>
	We would obviously have sought different solutions if there 
were proof of serious environmental consequences. In the absence 
of these independent and conclusive studies, we can only conclude 
that the government is caving in to pressure from the automobile 
industry, which claims that MMT in gasoline adversely affects the 
performance of catalytic converters. This conclusion reached by 
the automobile industry has not been proven in an objective and 
independent manner.
<P>
<B>(1035)</B>
<P>
	The official opposition therefore finds it disturbing that, with no 
regard for the economic impact on the development of Quebec and 
not just on employment in Montreal, the government is imposing a 
gag order, when we have already suggested that passage of this bill 
be delayed so that an independent study can be done. And if the 
government truly wished to protect the environment, it would have 
seen to it that these conclusions were accurate beyond all possible 
doubt, or at least beyond all reasonable doubt. But, instead, they go 
ahead with a gag order.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6896"> 6896 </A></B>
<P>
	The eastern sector of Montreal has not forgotten the federal 
decision to impose the Borden line, which meant that Quebec, 
once an exporter of refined oil to the rest of Canada, became an 
importer. This was devastating for employment. And then the 
Prime Minister came to Montreal and sadly asked ``What can we 
do for Montreal?'', but in the weeks since then we see that the 
government, through a gag order, is now trying to rush through 
a decision that jeopardizes at least one of the two remaining 
refineries.
<P>
	I repeat, this issue has been handled by our environment critic, 
who conducted consultations, who tried to have the bill postponed, 
who tried to pin down the government in committee. And the 
upshot was this gag order, this hasty decision in response to 
pressure from the automobile industry.
<P>
	On the eve of the next election, Quebecers will also remember 
that the automobile pact was supposed to distribute auto assembly 
plants more equitably, given that Quebec is one of the largest 
consumers of automobiles in Canada, but that there is only one 
assembly plant. Quebecers will also remember that to now 
seriously threaten what is left of the petroleum industry in 
Montreal does not make the government look good. So let Prime 
Minister Chrétien come back and sorrowfully ask what he can do 
for Montreal and pledge his full co-operation.
<P>
	This morning's issue of <I>Le Journal de Montreal</I> carried an 
article on the federal government's decision yesterday to gag the 
opposition parties in order to pass a bill that could threaten the 
survival of one of the last two refineries in Montreal. The article 
also pointed out that the government had interfered in provincial 
jurisdiction in drawing up this bill.
<P>
<B>(1040)</B>
<P>
	It did so by using the fact that this additive, MMT, is produced in 
the United States. It therefore decided to ban its interprovincial 
trade and importation. It did not ban production, just importation.
<P>
	This is an issue that Montrealers and Quebecers will remember 
because the environment was used as a smokescreen for the 
ambition of Ontario's automobile industry. If things had at least 
been out in the open. But no, they were obscured by suggestions 
that this was a dangerous product, when, in reality, its absence in 
gasoline will require more refining and add to pollution.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke-Lakeshore, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased that the House is giving final consideration 
to Bill C-29.
<P>
	Canadians will remember that we have an opportunity here to 
ensure that we pass legislation on the basis of both merit and good 
common sense. Canadians will remember that this is not muzzling 
Parliament, not gagging the House. We have had 10.5 hours of 
debate and discussion. Canadians will remember that this MMT 
legislation before us is an important stepping stone in the 
prevention of air pollution.
<P>
	This package of government initiatives will result in billions of 
dollars in health benefits saved for Canadians and for our health 
care system. This will help prevent the pain and suffering of 
choking and gasping attacks by the young and the elderly when bad 
air days shroud our cities with a dirty blanket of pollution which 
happens too often in many of our cities, particularly during the 
summer.
<P>
	Today almost every Canadian motorist uses MMT simply 
because Canadian refiners use MMT. The exact amount of this 
additive may vary from one batch of gasoline to another. In 
general, premium grade gasoline contains a higher volume of 
MMT than regular grade gasoline.
<P>
	Let me focus on the technological advances that have steadily 
cut the harmful emissions coming out of our tailpipes. In fact, since 
the early 1970s and the advent of national standards, over 90 per 
cent of the most noxious tailpipe pollutions have been removed. 
The automobile industry strongly warns that gasoline containing 
MMT clogs and jams up the operation of sophisticated onboard 
diagnostic systems.
<P>
	However, I want to focus on the opportunity we have here to 
promote the health of people. We cannot take chances with the air 
we breath. We need this legislation for the health of Canadians and 
a healthy environment. I can go on to talk about the 21 auto 
manufacturers that are convinced that MMT clogs their pollution 
monitoring equipment and that are supporting and petitioning the 
government and members of Parliament, bringing forward their 
concerns. It seems to me that it is quite clear that we need to heed 
their message.
<P>
	There are some 14 million cars on Canada's roads, each pumping 
out over 4 tonnes of pollutants every single year. Therefore we are 
on the road to disaster unless we do something now.
<P>
	We are pushing for national emission standards so that our auto 
makers can ensure that they protect the air for Canadians.
<P>
	We have had debates in the House about health, the health of 
Canadians. We cannot be indifferent to air quality because we 
know that air quality has a profound effect on Canadians and that it 
translates into $1 billion a year on our health care system.
<P>
<B>(1045 )</B>
<P>
	We know that hospital admissions of infants for respiratory 
conditions are linked to ozone and sulphate pollution. We are living 
in an age when dangerous atmospheric pollutants rather than 
hormones are poisoning babies.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6897"> 6897 </A></B>
<P>
	It is also important to note that scientists, including people at 
the University of Waterloo and other Canadian universities, who 
have done research work in this area, support this legislation.
<P>
	We also know a whole list of groups and organizations support 
getting rid of MMT. They have been mentioned in previous 
speeches: the Allergy Asthma Association, the Canadian Institute 
of Child Health, the city of Etobicoke public health, the city of 
Toronto public health, the Council of Canadians, the 
Environmental Defence Fund, the Learning Disabilities 
Association of Canada, the Ontario Public Health Association, 
Pollution Probe and Sierra Club. All of those organizations, who 
spend hours working on research and looking at issues, cannot all 
be wrong.
<P>
	Of the 196 living Nobel laureate scientists, 99 joined with over 
2,000 of the world's scientists to again sound a warning to us that 
we need to do something about the air we breathe.
<P>
	Canada is one of the few countries that uses MMT and therefore 
it is important that we pass this legislation for all Canadians. It is 
also important that we protect Canadians from increases in 
automobile prices and I think the discussion we heard made 
mention of that.
<P>
	It is important that we support this legislation, that we think 
about the health of Canadians and that a ban on MMT, supported by 
health departments, is really the way we must go. A healthy 
environment, the need to promote cleaner and alternative fuels, the 
trend to North American harmonization, consumer protection and 
all the economic pluses are the reasons why we need this 
legislation.
<P>
	This bill will do a number of things for us. Canadians will 
certainly remember this day when we ensure that the air they 
breathe is clean. I call on all members to support this important 
piece of legislation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, we have 
noticed that most of the members taking part in this debate were 
from Ontario. We understand why.
<P>
	The largest concentration of automakers is found in Ontario. In a 
way, we cannot blame the Ontario Liberal members for defending 
the interests of their province. At the same time, Quebec members, 
like me, cannot be blamed for defending Quebec's interests, not 
only the interests of Quebec but those of the other provinces as 
well. Ontario is somewhat in a minority position on this issue.
<P>
	Earlier, the hon. member for Mercier talked about the businesses 
and the refineries located in her riding. I have the same situation in 
my riding of Lévis, where the Ultramar refinery, one of the most 
modern and the second best performing refinery in North America, 
is located. Even though it performs well and as such is less  
threatened than the one mentioned by the member for Mercier in 
the Montreal area, its managers have told me that if this bill passes 
as it is, that will have an impact on the refinery, on the jobs and 
most of all, as we should not forget, on car owners.
<P>
	As for Quebec, the impact could reach $7 million, as was 
mentioned in a newspaper article this morning. I think it is a lot 
more, because some people want to change the rules in the interests 
of Ontario where all the automakers are located. But it is also for 
another reason.
<P>
<B>(1050)</B>
<P>
	What do they want to replace MMT with? Ethanol. Who are 
those most in favour of ethanol? Again, Ontario members. We have 
nothing against those who stand up for the interests of their riding, 
of their region; but we also have the right to stand up for the 
interests of ours. We can see that the bill only takes Ontario's 
interests into account. That is unacceptable.
<P>
	Since I have only ten minutes, I will state ten facts that the 
Canadian Petroleum Products Institute pointed out in a letter in 
answer to the Automobile Club people.
<P>
	The first point mentioned in the letter is the following: ``The 
Canadian Petroleum Products Institute and its members are not 
opposed to prohibiting MMT and have pledged to withdraw this 
product should there be any evidence'', and here comes the 
important part, ``that the presence of this substance in gasoline is a 
threat to health or to the environment''.
<P>
	This is the problem. No harmful effect was demonstrated. If it 
was proven that MMT is dangerous, or that manganese, which is 
one of its elements, is dangerous, what would Health Canada or the 
Department of the Environment do? They would ban this product. 
This bill, however, merely seeks to prohibit its use in gasoline. A 
product is either toxic or it is not. The fact is that neither the health 
department nor the environment department banned this product.
<P>
	Second point: ``Car manufacturers never clearly and factually 
proved that MMT could adversely affect the operation of catalytic 
converters''. This has not been proven.
<P>
	Third point: ``Health Canada formally, publicly and in writing, 
stated that there was no proof whatsoever that MMT was a threat to 
the health of Canadians''.
<P>
	As a member of the Standing Committee on Health, I checked 
this out. A study commissioned by Health Canada reveals that only 
one manganese-related death was ever recorded in the world. This 
death, which occurred in 1941 in Japan, was not linked to MMT but 
to manganese, and a considerable dose was involved.
<P>
	That was the only case ever recorded. Health Canada has experts 
who maintain that, in quantities such as those currently found in 
MMT, manganese is not dangerous. Not only is it not dangerous, it 
is necessary to neutralize  certain products in gasoline and prevent 
pollution. In other words, it makes certain gasoline products less 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6898"> 6898 </A></B>
<P>
polluting. It is used not only to reduce the octane number, but also 
to keep in check other pollutants found in gasoline.
<P>
	Fourth point: ``Putting MMT in gasoline helps reduce toxic 
emissions''. This is what I just told you about.
<P>
	Fifth point: ``At the recent conference of the Canadian Council 
of Ministers of Energy, eight provinces opposed Bill C-29. 
Moreover, the premiers of Alberta, Nova Scotia and Saskatchewan 
wrote the Prime Minister, asking that the bill be withdrawn. As for 
Quebec, the National Assembly unanimously approved a motion 
asking for the withdrawal of Bill C-29''. This motion was adopted 
by all the parties, including the Liberal Party of Quebec. From time 
to time, members of the Liberal Party of Canada should listen to 
their provincial counterparts. But they do not.
<P>
	Sixth point: ``On the federal level, the Minister of Natural 
Resources and the Minister for International Trade have come out 
against Bill C-29.'' Obviously, they were swallowed up by cabinet 
solidarity at that point, and so nothing more has been heard from 
them, but they had already indicated their opposition to the 
minister.
<P>
	Seventh point: ``Bill C-29 banning international trade in and the 
importation for commercial purposes of MMT constitutes a 
violation of NAFTA-this is the written opinion of Gordon Ritchie, 
former Canadian NAFTA negotiator-and of the interprovincial 
trade treaty''. That means there is a risk of prosecution, and I 
believe some legal challenges are already in the works.
<P>
<B>(1055)</B>
<P>
	Eighth point: ``The automobile makers have refused our 
organization's proposal to have a fully independent body examine 
and report on the situation''.
<P>
	If a complete, independent, exhaustive study proved that there is 
indeed a danger, then we in the official opposition would also 
respect the findings. The official opposition is opposed, but this is 
because the government has not proven its case.
<P>
	What are they doing instead? Yesterday, a motion was adopted to 
gag the House by limiting the duration of the debate, in order to get 
this bill through quickly. This attitude is becoming increasingly 
common, and the opposition objects. When someone wants to gag 
democracy, they try to paralyze the opposition. They try to rush 
bills through when the Christmas or summer break is coming up. 
As usual, the Liberal government is still trying to put one over us, 
thinking that we will soon forget about it, because it is nearly time 
for the Christmas parties to begin. But this is serious.
<P>
	Ninth point: ``Banning MMT constitutes a threat to the 
competitiveness of the Quebec refining industry, and would be 
contrary to the interests of Quebec drivers''.
<P>
	The tenth and last point is that the government stubbornly insists 
it is right in this case. The Deputy Prime Minister began this debate 
when she was Minister of the Environment in 1995, obviously also 
putting the interests of Ontario first. She started it, and the 
government tabled a bill. Now it has less and less faith in its 
evidence, as it has really not proven anything. The only way to 
proceed then is to push it ahead as fast as possible, by gagging the 
House, so that it can get its way as usual.
<P>
	Former Social Credit leader Réal Caouette sometimes had some 
good quotes. He used to say: ``The government has your good at 
heart, and it will manage to get its hands on your goods as well''. 
That is what the government has on its mind with this bill. The 
heck with the financial consequences, it says, the heck with the 
consequences for hundreds, even thousands of jobs. It thumbs its 
nose at all of this.

	<B>The Speaker:</B> Dear colleagues, before proceeding with 
Statements by Members, I would like to return to the question 
raised yesterday by the hon. member for Laurier-Sainte-Marie 
following the statement made by the hon. member for Saint-Denis 
pursuant to Standing Order 31.
<P>
	The member for Laurier-Sainte-Marie alleged that the facts as 
presented by the member for Saint-Denis were incorrect. He asked 
the member for Saint-Denis to withdraw what she had said and 
related his version of the facts.
<P>
	Although members enjoy considerable latitude in the choice of 
the subjects they wish to raise under Standing Order 31, it is for the 
Chair to determine whether those statements are in order. The 
Chair may, for example, interrupt a member improperly applying 
Standing Order 31 or using language that might offend.
<P>
<B>(1100)</B>
<P>
	I would furthermore remind members that statements 
constituting personal attacks are not permitted. Speaker Sauvé 
pointed out on January 17, 1983, at page 21874 of <I>Debates</I>, that:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The time set aside for Members' Statements should not be used to make personal 
attacks.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Members' statements are an effective and essential mechanism 
enabling members to express their opinions on a range of subjects. 
The Chair does not want to block this means of expression in any 
way.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6899"> 6899 </A></B>
<P>
	I have reviewed the blues, as I promised I would yesterday, and 
I have very carefully considered the words of the member for 
Saint-Denis. It is not for the Chair to make a pronouncement on 
the truth of members' statements. I am concerned, however, by 
the member's choice of words, since we were very close to a 
personal attack.
<P>
	On many many occasions in the past, the Chair has reminded 
members of the need to honour the conventions and traditions of 
this House, especially that of conducting themselves with the 
courtesy appropriate to elected representatives.
<P>
	An important element of this courtesy is refraining from 
levelling a personal attack at someone else. The words expressed 
are broadcast instantaneously to all regions of the country. Once 
they have been uttered, it is very difficult to retract them, and the 
impression they leave is not always easily erased.
<P>
	Statements by Members must not be used to make personal 
attacks. This is fundamental to maintaining order in Parliament.
<P>
	My colleagues, the Chair cannot always predict the course of 
debates. Members will understand that the Chair is often caught 
between respect for freedom of speech and the rapid delivery of 60 
second statements. For this reason, I must count on the goodwill of 
every member. I intend to be very vigilant to ensure no one is the 
victim of personal attacks in this House.
<P>
	I encourage all members to treat their colleagues with the respect 
they are due. I thank you for your attention in this matter.
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of 
order.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I would prefer to hear points of order following 
Statements by Members, but is this a related matter?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Laurin:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will explain it to you if I may, and 
you will judge whether it should be dealt with after or before 
Statements by Members.
<P>
	You asked the Bloc Quebecois member to withdraw his remarks. 
He did so on the understanding that you were going to make a 
ruling today or later on the matter. However, the member for 
Laurier-Sainte-Marie agreed to withdraw his remarks provided the 
member making the accusations did so as well. According to these 
allegations, he had used public money to promote his wife's 
candidacy in school board elections, an allegation that was entirely 
false. We therefore asked to have the member in question withdraw 
her remarks. There is no mention of this in your ruling, I note.
<P>
	We maintain our request that these offensive and totally false 
remarks be withdrawn. We would ask the member of the Liberal 
Party who made them in her statement under Standing Order 31 to 
withdraw them.
<P>
<B>(1105)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont-Dundas, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
not up us to decide whether the Speaker's ruling is right or wrong. 
We must accept what the Chair in its wisdom has decided. 
Speaking for the government, I believe the ruling handed down by 
the Speaker of the House is fair.
<P>
	Also, I think that when members say they will withdraw ``on 
condition'', we are on a slippery slope. I believe that members on 
both sides of the House should never question the authority of the 
Chair. We want to deal with this subject with all the respect due to 
the Speaker and the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Laurin:</B> Mr. Speaker, on the same point of order.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I do not want debate. This is the last time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Laurin:</B> Mr. Speaker, far be it from us to question the 
authority of the Chair. We believe that the ruling you gave this 
morning was given with a great deal of wisdom.
<P>
	However, Mr. Speaker, perhaps you could explain, with an eye to 
future proceedings, how we should respond to false allegations 
made by a member other than by appealing to the Chair and asking 
for a withdrawal of comments that were very inaccurate, to say the 
least? Otherwise, anyone in this House could avail himself of the 
same procedure-accuse someone of not saying the truth-without 
penalty, and give the public the impression that we have done 
something wrong.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, tell us how we could prevent this from happening 
again. Otherwise, we must conclude that we can use the same 
strategy to accuse members opposite of other irregularities.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Kilger:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not want to start a debate, as you 
yourself pointed out. I simply want to say that we are actually 
getting into a debate. Facts presented yesterday by other members 
are a matter for debate. I do not think this is a point of order.
<P>
	Like the hon. member for Joliette, we respect your ruling and 
your wisdom, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I appeal to the House that we should stay away 
from any personal attacks on other members. I never know exactly 
where you, hon. members, are going when you begin your 
statements. That is why I give you so much room. Sometimes we 
come very close but the House has a way of regulating itself.
<P>
	I would agree in the sense that there can be no conditions on the 
decision that a Speaker will take. I am your Speaker. You put me 
here. I am the embodiment of the rules of the House. Many times 
you have given me quite a bit of room in here. I do not know if I 
could ever accept that any member would withdraw  unparliamen-
<P>

<B><A NAME="6900"> 6900 </A></B>
<P>
tary language on condition that something else happen, that I do 
something else.
<P>
	When I dealt with unparliamentary language, it was something 
that was dealt with between myself as the spokesperson for this 
House of Commons and another member directly. In the sense of 
the rules, what one person says or the other person believes does 
not affect me. We look at facts. It is the old story: Is the glass half 
full or half empty?
<P>
	I would appeal to all hon. members to be very judicious in your 
choice of words when you are making statements in the House. My 
only recourse if I feel that the statement is going in a certain 
direction would be for me to intervene, cut off the member's 
statement and go to the next member.
<P>
<B>(1110)</B>
<P>
	I would hope that in this decision I have made like all of the 
others in the House you would receive it in the spirit with which it 
is given. First and foremost this institution is a place where we do 
have freedom of speech. It is not incumbent upon your Speaker to 
ever decide on the veracity of statements. When one member says 
something is true, I accept it and when the other member says 
something is true, I accept that. That is the only way we can 
function.
<P>
	I would leave that decision where it is. I will be very vigilant in 
listening to all of the statements by members. I want to let this rest 
where it is now and I want to proceed to Statements by Members.

	<B>Mr. Eugène Bellemare (Carleton-Gloucester, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Wednesday we celebrated the official opening in Orléans 
of a new public elementary school for young Franco-Ontarians in 
the area.
<P>
	The École L'Odyssée will start with nearly 450 pupils in 
classrooms that will let them use the environment as a learning 
tool. For instance, there is a glass wall that provides a view of water 
pipes and conduits, there are protractors on the doors, trees 
representative of the regional flora and hallways named after 
famous Franco-Ontarians.
<P>
	The school's ultramodern equipment will help prepare young 
Franco-Ontarians for the world that will be theirs, the world of high 
tech, computers and science, as reflected in the booming 
technological sector in the national capital region.
<P>
	The fact that École L'Odyssée has come to 
Carleton-Gloucester proves once again that francophones are 
capable of making their way in a  country full of opportunity, by 
developing their potential in their own language and culture, of 
which they are so proud.
<P>

	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the decision to go ahead with plans for a high speed train 
in the northeast corridor between New York and Boston will have 
important economic benefits for Quebec and for the Lower St. 
Lawrence, thanks to the dynamism of the Pocatec company and its 
president and general manager, Carl Casista.
<P>
	With the initiative of teachers from the Collège and the Cégep de 
La Pocatière, this SME has, over the years, built up a synergy with 
Bombardier, and has met the challenge of high tech development 
outside major centres.
<P>
	The company won a $7 million contract to design and build 
communications equipment for the high speed train. This is a 
wonderful example of the economic benefits to be derived from 
implementation of the high speed train project in the Canadian 
corridor.
<P>
	Let us hope that the preliminary feasibility study by Bombardier 
and its five partners, recently confirmed by Bombardier's chairman 
and CEO, Laurent Beaudoin, will make this dream a reality.

constituents in my riding of Peace River are fair and reasonable

federal government be fair and reasonable also.
<P>
	They want government to spend their tax money wisely and they 
want their government to be honest. But these days many

They believe this Liberal government is not being honest with

taxpayers' money, tie up the police force in paperwork and achieve 
little in reducing a growing crime problem.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in the House today to pay tribute to Mr. Norm 
Green, a constituent of mine, who is proving that with the right 
attitude obstacles in life can be overcome.
<P>
	After an accident caused him visual impairment, Norm brought 
his trademark enthusiasm to the sport of blind lawn bowling in

finished a respectable fourth. That same year he finished first for 
his class in the Ontario Lawn Bowling Championship. Then in only 
his second year of competition, Norm won the National Blind 
Lawn Bowling Championship in September 1996. Now Norm is

Canal.
<P>
	On November 29, 1829 the first Welland Canal was born. One 
hundred and sixty-seven years ago, 40 wooden locks built over the 
Niagara escarpment opened the transportation route into the heart 
of this country.
<P>
	On this special occasion we honour the builder of the canal and 
Canada's father of transportation, the Hon. William Hamilton 
Merritt.
<P>
	Today the Engineering Institute of Canada will memorialize this 
work with the unveiling of a plaque recognizing the achievements 
of Canada's professional engineers in the construction of the 
Welland Canal.
<P>
	The Welland Canada is Canada's oldest active transportation 
route. Over the years the canal has been enlarged three times to 
accommodate Canada's growing transportation needs. It is a vital 
part of the St. Lawrence Seaway and provides thousands of jobs 
and great economic benefit to the country. It also attracts hundreds 
of tourists who visit St. Catharines to watch huge ships climb 100 
meters to carry cargo between Lake Ontario and Lake Erie.

example of this double talk. Instead of uniting Canadians in the

common cause, they seriously divide Canadians against each other. 
These regulations divide province against province by arrogantly 
discounting the concerns of some duly elected governments. They 
divide rural citizens against urban citizens because of traditional 
lifestyles.
<P>
	Worst of all, they divide Canadians by race: aboriginal against 
non-aboriginal. While these regulations will be enforced 
vigorously in most of Canada, the exemptions for aboriginal people 
ensure that no aboriginal will ever be charged under the act, for the

	For many years now the retail district in this community has

when the community comes together it can produce positive

have changed the retail landscape. These improvements will move 
in step with the plans for the waterfront motel strip development.
<P>
	For almost five years there was no construction in the area. We 
see that these changes and the fruits of this government's

	<B>Ms. Maria Minna (Beaches-Woodbine, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, a 
constituent in my riding of Beaches-Woodbine has informed me 
that the Toronto Separate School Board is seriously considering 
selling off 38 schools to private companies. The private sector 
consortiums would then depreciate these buildings for tax purposes 
the way any owner of a private office or apartment builder can. The 
depreciation of these buildings will be calculated at 5 per cent 
under the federal tax rules.
<P>
	Although the private sector would initially pay millions for these 
schools, it would more than recoup their investment through rents, 
tax write-offs and the subcontracting of services.
<P>
	This is a totally unacceptable way of financing our educational 
system in Ontario or anywhere else in Canada. This uploading of 
educational costs to the federal government by province of Ontario 
is not acceptable.
<P>
	Taxpayers have already paid for the construction of these schools 
and are continuing to pay high educational taxes to maintain the 
excellence of our educational system. By selling off these buildings 
millions of tax dollars will go into the pockets of private businesses 
at the expense of services to children. This abuse must be stopped.

	It is important to know that Asian countries are very sensitive to

	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Deputy Prime Minister.
<P>
	When questioned before leaving for Asia, the Prime Minister 
said that the only solution for Canadian was to restructure the 
company rather than look to the government for assistance, 
because the company's problems were the result of bad 
management, and an infusion of federal funds would not help 
resolve this problem. The Minister of Finance took a similar line 
Wednesday.
<P>
	Since the Prime Minister has already made his government's 
position plain, can the Deputy Prime Minister tell us who 
authorized the Minister of Transport to open the public purse and 
come to the assistance of Canadian by offering a rebate on fuel tax?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Minister for the 
Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, Minister of Western 
Economic Diversification and Minister responsible for the 
Federal Office of Regional Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, this  government has taken a great deal of interest in the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6904"> 6904 </A></B>
<P>
case of Canadian Airlines, because many of the company's 
employees and clients have been deeply affected by the events of 
the last few weeks.
<P>
	I would point out to the member that 1,273 employees of 
Canadian Airlines International live in Quebec. I think it important 
for everyone that a bit of interest be shown in finding solutions to 
these problems.
<P>
	It was therefore necessary for airline management, creditors, 
governments and employees to draw up together a plan that could 
work. This step has almost been completed. Since the Prime 
Minister's departure, all groups have tried to work together, except 
for one union. Now all the interested parties have come together 
with a common plan.
<P>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would point out to the hon. minister that what is 
important is that we follow the example of other countries. All the 
major countries in the world, including France, England and 
Germany-with the exception of the United States, which has a 
population of 300 million-have only one national airline. We are 
enjoying the luxury of having two. Therein lies the problem. If we 
really want to save jobs, we must accept a long term solution and 
have just one national airline.
<P>
	We know that a number of airlines, besides Canadian 
International, are now experiencing financial difficulties. Others, 
like Air Canada, have made it back to the profit side of the ledger, 
but only after many years in the red. What criteria will his 
government use to decide which carriers will be entitled to the fuel 
tax rebate and which will not? What will be the determining factor?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
this must be made very clear. The rebate will be offered to all 
airlines under the same conditions. In return, a company will have 
to give up substantial tax write-offs.
<P>
	In other words, this could amount to payment of higher taxes to 
the federal and provincial governments in the future. Let me be 
very clear: this is an offer that will be made to all airlines.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am very pleased to see such a medley of answers. I hope 
that the minister who feels moved to reply to the next question will 
give me the right answer, because we are moving along with the 
specific information given us first by the Minister of Industry and 
then by the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	By changing the rules of the market, by subsidizing fuel, as it 
seems prepared to do, is the government not contravening one of 
the NAFTA rules, and will it not leave itself open to economic 
reprisals from the United  States, and even from other competing 
companies in Canada?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Minister for the 
Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, Minister of Western 
Economic Diversification and Minister responsible for the

subsidy according to NAFTA.

	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is for 
the Minister of Health.
<P>
	Yesterday, the Minister of Health presented us with the main 
thrust of the tobacco legislation he plans to introduce shortly. This 
was a vague and fuzzy list of the measures he is planning, 
particularly with respect to the sponsorship of sports and cultural 
events on which he intends to pass regulations.
<P>
	Can the minister indicate more clearly what he intends to impose 
in the way of restrictions on promotional material at sports and 
cultural events? In other words, can the Players Grand Prix, for 
instance, still be called that?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday we outlined the strategy of the Government of Canada to 
deal with tobacco consumption in the country. Seven major 
elements were outlined to the public in terms of what action we 
will be taking.
<P>
	We have put in place some restrictions with regard to 
sponsorship promotion that companies will have to abide by. 
However, I want to indicate to my colleague opposite that we are 
not banning sponsorship in this country. Not at all. We have 
restrictions on that promotion. The details will be contained in the 
bill. I hope to give notice later this afternoon, with the tabling of 
the bill on Monday.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, can the minister 
assure us that his bill will be more specific than his speech, and that 
he will not try to slip past us, as regulations, and therefore without 
debate, more stringent measures concerning sponsorships?
<P>
<B>(1135)</B>

<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
11,000 Quebecers die each and every year as a result of tobacco 
consumption. As the ministry of health, we have had to show some 
leadership on this particular file. There is leadership but it has 
consequences. The  consequences are that there are restrictions on 
sponsorship promotion. It will be regulated. We will consult with 
<P>

	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I found the Bloc's questions rather curious. It wants only 
one airline per country but it wants to make this into two countries.
<P>
	The government has now followed the lead of B.C. and Alberta 
in offering Canadian Airlines some relief on oppressive fuel taxes, 
but the offer may be meaningless. It is good only if Canadian's 
employees vote to accept the restructuring package and the 
government will not do anything to ensure that those employees get 
that chance to vote.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Labour. Given that the 
government's convoluted tax rebate offer is worthless if the 
employees are not allowed to vote on it, when will the government 
take action to protect the democratic rights of Canadian's 
employees?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
in response to the hon. member's question, I am certain that he is 
aware of section 108 of the Canadian Labour Code. It precludes the 
Minister of Labour from ordering a vote in circumstances such as 
he has referred to.
<P>
	The hon. member knows full well that the best way to ensure that 
workers at Canadian Airlines have the right to vote is that we 
continue to put public pressure on the union leadership.
<P>
	However, if the hon. member is suggesting that the Government 
of Canada intervene in terms of legislation in order to effectuate a 
settlement there, he is away out of line in terms of what the 
collective bargaining process is all about.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is really interesting the minister should raise section 
108.1. Yesterday the Reform labour critic placed a motion before 
the human resources committee asking for an immediate review of 
section 108.1 of the Canadian Labour Code in order to ensure the 
democratic rights of Canadian Airlines employees. The response to 
that by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Labour was: 
``Giving Canadian employees the right to vote is a waste of time for 
this committee''. The Liberal and Bloc members then proceeded to 
vote against the motion.
<P>
	My question is for the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Labour. In the cold light of day, and after a  good night's sleep, is he 
prepared to withdraw those unacceptable comments and support 
the democratic rights of Canadian employees who may lose their 
jobs if this government does not act?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I am not aware of the context of the words which the hon. member 
makes reference to, but I do not think there is a member on either 
side of this House who does not want the members of the CAW to 
exercise their right to vote on a particular package.
<P>
	What the hon. member must understand is that we have the 
Canadian Labour Code which outlines the procedures that 
employers as well as workers must follow.
<P>
	I would encourage the hon. member as well as his party to 
continue to put pressure on the various unions which are involved 
here in order that that right may be exercised.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the government's response to a plea by Canadian's 
employees to be allowed to vote on the company restructuring 
program has been that it is up to their elected union representatives. 
Those union officials are supposed to be like MPs, and I say 
supposed to be; that is representatives, not rulers.
<P>
	It is both clear and democratic that Canadian's employees whose 
jobs are on the line should have the right to decide on their own 
future. It should not be left in the hands of Buzz Hargrove whose 
job is not at stake, who will still have his job even if Canadian 
folds.
<P>
	My question is for the Deputy Prime Minister. The choice is 
democracy or dictatorship. Buzz Hargrove has chosen dictatorship. 
Is this government willing to choose democracy by protecting the 
democratic rights of the union workers of Canadian Airlines?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
on the substance of the hon. member's questions I concur 
wholeheartedly. Union members should have that right in terms of 
the package before them.
<P>
<B>(1140)</B>
<P>
	But in view of the restrictions we have within the law, it is 
incumbent on the leadership to provide that right to their members. 
That is an internal thing they will have to deal with in the weeks 
and the months ahead.

shoulder responsibility in connection with the organizations

sponsorships are reduced?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I thank the hon. member for the question. Let us be clear. The first 
objective of the legislation and the proposals we outlined yesterday 
is health. When 11,000 Quebecers are dying each and every year as 
a result of tobacco consumption it behoves the government to take 
action.
<P>
	There is no need for a replacement fund because we have not 
banned sponsorship across the country. It will be a corporate 
decision of those individual companies concerning what they do 
and the amount of money they provide to various sponsorships 
across the country.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the minister said earlier that there will be restrictions, there will be 
repercussions on sponsorships, we are assured of this.
<P>
	Departmental employees stated before the heritage committee 
this past March that they were working on a report to assess the 
impact of the Minister of Health's policy on cultural and sports 
events, as well as a draft recommendation and suggested 
timeframes.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Canadian Heritage. As we 
speak, has the minister received these recommendations, which are 
aimed at offsetting the effects of the Minister of Health's policy on 
cultural and sports events, given that the government has always 
sent a message to the organizers of cultural and sports events that 
they should link up with the private sector?

question is for the minister who is answering for the Minister of 
Labour.
<P>
	The minister said very clearly in response to the transport critic 
for the Reform Party that the government wants the workers to be 
able to vote on this legislation. As the minister said, the 
government knows that the  present provisions of the Canada 
Labour Code do not allow that.
<P>
	The government is here to pass legislation for the benefit of 
Canadians. If it wants the workers to be able to vote on this, why 
will the government not give the workers the ability to do so?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
two reasons. First, we respect the provisions of the Canada Labour 
Code.
<P>
	Second, as we speak, the Minister of Transport is in the province 
of British Columbia having consultations and discussions with 
various representatives of different unions to impress on them the 
need to allow workers of the CAW to have the right to vote on this 
restructuring package which is not a part of the collective 
bargaining process.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
government, despite the fact it says that it wants the workers to 
vote, is hiding behind the provision of the labour code that Mr. 
Hargrove is using to prevent a vote.
<P>
	Yesterday I was at the human resources committee meeting. The 
parliamentary secretary suggested this is a temporary solution and 
may not be a profitable solution in the long run. That is not what 
the company, most of the workers or provincial governments say, 
and it is not what the federal government has said.
<P>
	Is the federal government refusing to allow a vote to occur 
because it really does not believe in the future of Canadian 
Airlines?
<P>
<B>(1145 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I have been a long time supporter of Canadian Airlines. Many in 
this caucus and many members in this cabinet are very supportive 
of Canadians Airlines.
<P>
	The hon. member has it wrong. It is not the Government of 
Canada, it is not the Government of British Columbia and it is not 
the Government of Alberta. It is the union leadership of the CAW, 
namely one individual who is at fault here. The pressure must apply 
to him and his cohorts in order to give union members the 
opportunity to vote.

question is directed to the Minister of Foreign Affairs.
<P>
	The government's attempt to save its plan in Zaire will have 
lasted only 24 hours. The agreement on the food drop mission 
announced yesterday was seriously questioned today. Zaire is 
opposed to the agreement, humanitarian organizations are sceptical 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6907"> 6907 </A></B>
<P>
and even General Baril does not seem convinced, since he would 
use this option only as a last resort.
<P>
	Since the Canadian government's proposal to drop food has met 
with strong local opposition, are we to understand that the minister 
submitted this proposal without considering all the consequences? 
In other words, was the minister making a last-ditch attempt to save 
the plan?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.): </B>No, 
Mr. Speaker. After the meeting on the weekend with 
representatives of the countries concerned, especially the military 
group, we carefully assessed all recommendations. We consulted 
many countries on the level of consensus for international 
initiatives and especially to assess the information on conditions in 
Zaire.
<P>
	In the process, we received the support of 20 countries. We have 
the support of major humanitarian organizations, including the Red 
Cross committee and other international groups. Granted, there are 
some people, especially those in the Reform Party, who are critical. 
But the major humanitarian organizations agree on the need to 
provide humanitarian aid to the refugees.
<P>
	There is an international consensus among the 20 countries 
which will be meeting in Ottawa today to confirm this mission and 
guarantee the capability of the international community to 
distribute humanitarian aid in Zaire.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
minister apparently sees opposition coming from only a few 
groups. However, according to our information, that is not the case.
<P>
	Does the minister realize, as a number of intervenors in the field 
have pointed out, that a food drop in a region where there are still 
groups of armed rebels may threaten the safety and even the lives 
of refugees who are now without protection?
<P>
	That being said, and although we do not question the minister's 
good intentions, could he tell us whether he intends to obtain the 
agreement of the main partners in the field or propose another 
option? Could the minister tell us, considering all the opposition, 
whether other alternatives have been considered?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I make it very clear that we consulted with the major 
humanitarian organizations before we put the proposal forward. As 
I said before, the media can find the odd individual because there 
are always critics everywhere, but we first established that there 
should be a headquarters at Entebbe so that there is a multilateral 
force on the ground able to make evaluations and responses.
<P>
	Second, they would be given a mandate to undertake 
reconnaissance missions to develop good information in Zaire to 
determine where food assistance would be most appropriate, where 
the refugees are and how they can be most effectively delivered.
<P>
<B>(1150 )</B>
<P>
	At the present time that there is no access for convoys to go in. 
That access has not been given by the countries but we do have the 
opportunity to provide air assistance.
<P>
	The comment was made by one minister of one of the 
governments of Zaire. I would like to point out to the member that 
there is total confusion in Zaire. There are two premiers. No one is 
sure who is in control. The fact is that we have received the full 
approval of the President of Zaire in discussions with Ambassador 
Chrétien.
<P>
	Those are the conditions we are working under. I am not saying it 
is a panacea, that it is a full answer. However, I do believe most 
Canadians, with the exclusion of some of my friends opposite, 
want this country to continue to provide leadership to mobilize 
whatever efforts are possible by the international community to 
support humanitarian aid. That is our mission and we are fulfilling 
that mission.

	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Canada 
Evidence Act defence to hide cabinet documents from Krever is 
bogus.
<P>
	The McDonald commission in 1979 obtained secret cabinet 
documents by an order in council and the then clerk of the privy 
council, Michael Pitfield, admits the decision is discretionary and 
lies with the Prime Minister.
<P>
	Since there is a choice, why has this Prime Minister chosen to 
hide the files?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the McDonald 
commission occurred before the introduction of section 39 of the 
Canada Evidence Act.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, why do we care 
about these documents?
<P>
	In 1985 Saxon William Forbes was born. He was given a 
tablespoon of blood to bring colour to his cheeks. He was 
constantly sick, diagnosed with HIV and today he has full blown 
AIDS. This did not have to happen.
<P>
	Regulations were drafted in 1984. The government of the day 
decided to quash them. Today the government also has a choice. If 
it wanted to, it could release the documents to Krever. Why will the 
Deputy Prime Minister not release those documents?

the bottom of the issue  surrounding the blood scandal more than 
the government. The commissioner has the capacity to compel any 
previous minister to testify. I believe at least one previous minister 
of health has made a public statement suggesting that she would 
like to go before the commission to provide information.
<P>
	The fact is that commission counsel has suggested that her 
testimony is not necessary. If any clarification can be brought to the 
matter, I am sure that the commission and Mr. Krever will do their 
best to compel those witnesses to come forward and put all the 
facts on the table.

	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Health.
<P>
	In Canada, it is estimated that between 26,000 and 35,000 
persons carry the AIDS virus. An average of 3,000 new cases are 
identified each year in Canada. It is a sorry state of affairs, since 
Canada, along with Australia, is one of the countries where the 
average age of those with the disease has dropped since the start of 
the epidemic.
<P>
	Given the proportions of this scourge, is the minister prepared to 
renew the national AIDS strategy for five years with its budget of 
$40.7 million a year? Is he prepared to make the commitment?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member knows that the subject matter to which he made 
reference is a serious issue. It has been given serious attention and 
will continue to receive serious attention.
<P>
	We have provided substantial moneys for this fiscal year, the 
next fiscal year and thereafter additional moneys will be made 
available. We are presently reviewing the programs we have in 
place.
<P>
	By the testimony from many experts across the country, the 
interventions by government have been very helpful and very 
successful. I look forward to constructive suggestions being made 
by the hon. member as well as the standing committee, the 
subcommittee of which he is a member, as well as from other 
Canadians as we get closer to the time at which we will have to 
re-evaluate our position on additional moneys.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, a little more leadership would not hurt.
<P>
	Can the minister assure us that there will be a third stage to the 
national AIDS strategy and that it will cover all the needs of those 
with the disease, namely, treatment, community group support, 
prevention, education and research? I invite the minister to take a 
firm stand.
<P>
<B>(1155)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member is quite right. What is needed is a national 
strategy. The federal government, being one part of that strategy, 
would like to do everything that it can within its fiscal resources. I 
hope that other governments, non-governmental organizations and 
others can be a part of the solution and that they will not just stand 
back and complain.
<P>
	Many of the activists who I have met across the country have 
come forward with some very valuable and constructive 
suggestions. I look forward to that continuing as we get up to the

<P>

discovery and what it means for northern communities and 
Canada?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Natural Resources, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member raises a very important question. It 
is both a question of cultural and economic concern to the people of 
the north.
<P>
	This summer, during a regular geological field survey near 
Holman on Victoria Island, one of the geological survey mappers 
discovered a very large deposit of alabaster which will enable many 
people of the north to continue their important carving activities.

response to a question yesterday from my colleague for 
Comox-Alberni regarding the softwood lumber dispute being 
taken to the WTO, the Minister of Foreign Affairs answered: ``To 
provide an orderly arrangement with our largest customer requires 
us to play by the rules''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6909"> 6909 </A></B>
<P>
	Surely the minister must know that Canada was one of the main 
proponents in establishing the World Trade Organization. It took 
nine years at the Uruguay round of the GATT to establish rules 
to handle disputes of this nature which are extremely important, 
more important in many cases than our NAFTA rules of dispute.
<P>
	Would the minister not agree that it is time to use these rules to 
defend Canada's interest in these types of trade disputes?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, over the past 15 years there has been, almost in every year, 
a countervail action taken by the United States against the 
Canadian softwood lumber industry. This has caused major 
uncertainty in the industry. It has resulted in major costs to the 
industry. There was $800 million collected on export fees alone by 
the United States during one period. It has caused enormous 
disruptions in the marketplace.
<P>
	The Canadian government negotiated a five-year agreement in 
which there will be no countervail whatsoever so there can be an 
orderly marketing arrangement between Canada and the United 
States without any threat of trade actions. That agreement was 
based on a level of 16.4 billion board feet, which is the highest 
level in the last 10 years, with the exception of one year, based on 
average exports.
<P>
	That was the deal which was arrived at. It was supported by the 
exporting provinces. It was supported by the industry. It was put 
into an agreement and now the export market is proceeding.
<P>
	In the meantime, certain lumber companies rushed to the border, 
exceeded their quota and they are now in the position of saying: 
``We do not want to play by the rules any more''.
<P>
	The Minister for International Trade set up certain safety valves. 
They can borrow quota against their values for next year. They can 
provide extra fees if they want to export more. It is all there, but 
they cannot continue to say: ``Simply because we are not getting 
our cake and eating it too we want to change the rules''. The rules 
are there to ensure there is effective marketing and safety of the 
industry against countervail costs being imposed by the United 
States industry.
<P>
<B>(1200 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, surely 
this minister would know that every time Canada has had a trade 
dispute with the United States on softwood lumber we have won. In 
fact the $850 million he talked about was fully rebated to Canadian 
producers.
<P>
	The only thing that has happened is that the United States has 
done an end run on us and changed its domestic legislation which 
means that we will probably not win at the NAFTA panel any more. 
That is why we  are suggesting we should take this dispute to the 
World Trade Organization.
<P>
	We have been in contact with many producers in the last few 
weeks. In fact, we surveyed companies and 80 per cent of those 
which responded want us to cancel this deal and walk away if we 
are countervailed by the United States again and to take this to the 
World Trade Organization.
<P>
	Why will the government not honour that kind of concern by 
those companies that there is a threat of massive job layoffs?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, first I would invite the hon. member to be a little more 
detailed. I certainly take his representation but if he wants to 
produce those calls, those responses, those companies, I am sure 
the minister of trade would be very happy to take that 
representation.
<P>
	In the meantime, the minister has established an advisory 
committee made up of members of the industry from across 
Canada to provide him with that kind of advice in terms of 
constantly reviewing the agreement to determine quota levels and 
ways of administering the agreement.
<P>
	Rather than a random phone call survey, I would suggest the hon. 
member put his case and his information to the minister of trade. 
He can take it to the advisory committee which represents the 
entire industry and determine if those cases have been made. The 
hon. member constantly comes to the House and grandstands the 
idea of ripping up the agreement and going to dispute. This is 
simply continuing the uncertainty and the problems rather than 
trying to make this agreement work.

has reportedly been given a severe reprimand by the information 
commissioner for deliberately destroying certain documents.
<P>
	In light of such disturbing facts, does the Minister of Industry

of Canada's leading institutions, an internationally renowned 
institution?

<P>
Speaker, I have in my hand a letter from the information 
commissioner of Canada. The hon. member's allegations are false. 
The letter does not say that Mr. Evans destroyed documents, and 
Mr. Evans has clearly denied destroying any documents.
<P>
	Second, I can tell the hon. member that, upon joining the 
Canadian Space Agency, Mr. Evans immediately renegotiated the 
arrangements between the agency and the U.S. He helped me by 
preparing the agency's long term space plan. He has done an 
outstanding job. As a result of his efforts, the space agency is 
respected worldwide.
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the allegations 
were made by the commissioner of information, who is also a very 
credible person. If the accusations are false, blame the 
commissioner of information. It seems to me this situation is 
starting to look like the Boyle affair. The minister cannot just 
sweep it away.
<P>
	In light of the very serious accusations hanging over the space 
agency chairman's head, will the minister recognize that he has no 
choice but to immediately suspend Mr. Evans, his former advisor, 
and call a public inquiry into the questionable accounting practices 
of the Canadian Space Agency and its chairman?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Minister for the 
Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, Minister of Western 
Economic Diversification and Minister responsible for the 
Federal Office of Regional Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr.

information. I have his letter in my hand.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> Table it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manley:</B> It does not say that Mr. Evans destroyed 
documents. Why would he want to destroy the reputation of a man 
who has served Canada well? It is outrageous to see how 
irresponsible the people across the way are.
<P>
	I can table the letter, Mr. Speaker.

side. Since Mr. Evans has been at the head of the space agency, we 
can say that some pretty terrific things have been done, not only for 
Canada, but also for Quebec, in terms of francophone 
representation within the agency.
<P>
	I can quote statistics. When Mr. Evans joined the agency, three 
of the 14 members on the executive committee were French 
speaking. There are now eight. In addition, we are negotiating a 
major contract for Phase  II of RADARSAT. Discussions are under 
way with a consortium led by Quebec companies.

Corrections Canada and Clifford Olson whereby Canada's most 
notorious serial killer was able to produce 12 videotapes about his 
child slayings, Corrections Canada has finally and reluctantly 
released the agreement under access to information rules.
<P>

with regard to who owns the tapes.
<P>

Olson and his lawyer own the tapes, what is to stop them from 
selling those tapes to the media or other sensationalists?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the tapes in question were not produced by Olson but by the staff of 
the Correctional Service of Canada. Therefore, and this is not 
changed in any way by the wording of the agreement which was 
signed in June 1993, the tapes in question belong to the crown and 
not to Mr. Olson.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
certainly respect the opinion of the hon. minister but I hold in my 
hand copies of the registration under the Canadian Copyright Act 
which clearly puts Clifford Olson and his lawyer in possession and 
in control of these tapes.
<P>
	The facts are that the lawyer and Clifford Olson do possess the 
tapes and they do have control. There is a real chance that Olson 
will either release or sell the tapes to the media.
<P>
	I appeal to the minister on behalf of Sharon and Gary Rosenfeldt 
and other parents who have lost their loved ones to this sick 
maniac. I call upon this government to act immediately. Will the 
Solicitor General confiscate and destroy the Olson tapes? Yes or 
no?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Olson is not personally in possession of any of the videotapes in 
question. Second of all, the lawyer in question is in possession of 
five of them. He has previously undertaken not to make them 
public, but in any event I am advised that legal action is being 
undertaken on behalf of the crown to regain possession of the tapes 
from Olson.
<P>
	I further want to point out that registration of a copyright does 
not establish copyright but merely  amounts in law to a claim. If

	Pursuant to the order of reference of Tuesday, June 18, 1996, 
your committee has considered Bill C-25, an act respecting 
regulations and other documents including the review, registration, 
publication and parliamentary scrutiny of regulations and other 
documents and to make consequential and related amendments to 
other acts, and your committee has agreed to report it with 
amendments.

	<B>Mr. Dan McTeague (Ontario, Lib.)</B> moved for leave to 
introduce Bill C-356, an act to amend the Motor Vehicle Safety 
Act.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, unlike the case in the U.S., the federal 
government does not have the legal power to order a manufacturer 
to immediately recall a vehicle which has been found to have a 
serious safety defect or has actually caused injury or death.
<P>
	This bill forces manufacturers covered by the Motor Vehicle 
Safety Act to notify in public in a specifically prescribed manner 
when they become aware of a design, construction or functioning 
defect in a vehicle which they sell or import.
<P>
	It also provides the Minister of Transport with the power to order 
an immediate recall of defective vehicles and prohibit their sale 
until the defect has been duly corrected. This bill is the result of the 
tragic and entirely preventable deaths of Thomas Bonnici, Natalia 
Bajc and Stuart Herriot. These children died due to failures in the 
current system.
<P>
	Whether it was the inability to identify defects or failure to 
adequately advise the public when defects become known or not 
recalling the vehicle models concerned, these questions are left 
best to the courts.
<P>
	What is relevant from the government's perspective must be the 
current inability of Transport Canada to quickly identify vehicle 
defects even after people have been injured or killed and take 
immediate action with manufacturers to recall vehicles and correct 
the problems.

<BLOCKQUOTE>What are the financing terms and conditions for the proposed sale of two CANDU

departments or agencies, what are the terms and conditions of these loans, and how 
do the loans and/or grants to China compare to the grants and/or loans given to other 
CANDU purchasers in the past, namely Argentina, Romania and Korea?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Mr. Paul Zed (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> I am informed as 
follows regarding Atomic Energy Canada Limited, AECL.
<P>
	Loan agreements in support of CANDU sales abroad are 
commercially confidential documents to which AECL is not party. 
Therefore, AECL cannot provide information with respect to the 
terms and conditions of eventual loans to China, as the sale has not 
yet been finalized, nor can it provide comparative information in 
relation to past loans to Argentina, Romania and South Korea, for 
the first CANDU reactor. South Korea's purchases of three 
additional CANDU reactors on two separate occasions have not 
necessitated loans from the Canadian government.
<P>
	The Export Development Corporation, EDC, is participating in 
export financing negotiations for AECL sale of two CANDU-6 
reactors to China. However, all terms and conditions have not yet 
been finalized. It is important to note that there are no grants or 
subsidies  involved. Any financing would be repayable with 
interest and normal fees would apply. In other words, any loan 
would be on a non-concessional basis and would respect the 
Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, 
OECD, parameters.
<P>
	With respect to comparisons to previous AECL CANDU sales, 
EDC does not disclose the terms and conditions of transactions or 
potential transactions it supports for reasons of commercial 
confidentiality. However, all transactions involved repayable loans 
and fees.
<P>

	<B>Mr. Bodnar:</B> Mr. Speaker, I ask that the remaining questions be 
allowed to stand.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-29, 
an act to regulate interprovincial trade in and the importation for 
commercial purposes of certain manganese-based substances, be 
rread the third time and passed; and of the amendment and the 
amendment to the amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, this is 
our last chance to speak to Bill C-29. Unfortunately, we have been 
gagged, but I still have a few comments to make on Bill C-29, 
hoping that the bill will be reviewed in the Senate, and that it might 
amend or defeat this bill, which would have a huge impact on 
Quebec oil companies.
<P>
	The Liberal government is finally showing its true colours. Since 
the beginning, the government has lacked the will to be transparent 
and get to the bottom of this issue regarding the addition of MMT 
to gasoline.
<P>
	The present environment minister and the former one, the deputy 
prime minister, have always refused to shed light on this issue. 
Instead of ordering scientific studies as we have asked, they simply 
caved in to the auto makers lobby and the Ontario Corn Producers 
lobby. By a strange coincidence, both lobbies are from the same 
province as the two ministers.
<P>
	To put a damper on the controversy surrounding their bill and the 
strong opposition it is encountering, the Liberals have brought in 
time allocation at third reading. In other words, they are gagging 
us. The Liberal government is telling members: ``Enough. Keep 
your mouths shut. We will decide and you have nothing to say 
about it''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6914"> 6914 </A></B>
<P>
	Debating, the reason we sit in this House, is defined by the 
<I>Webster</I> dictionary as: ``To consider reasons for and against''. As 
parliamentarians, we are here to discuss bills at length. The right 
to speak is the Parliament's raison d'être. This is what democracy 
is all about.
<P>
<B>(1225)</B>
<P>
	The gag strategy that the Liberal government is imposing on us 
today with Bill C-29 goes directly against the very raison d'être of 
Parliament. Closure violates freedom of speech, it is 
unparliamentary and undemocratic.
<P>
	We, in the opposition, still had some things to say about this bill. 
We wanted the Liberal government to listen to us so it would 
recognize that its bill is unfounded and without any sound scientific 
basis. Bill C-29 simply responds to the automotive industry. This 
proves once again that the Liberals are responding more to lobby 
groups than to the real issues. That is a disgrace. It shows all the 
weakness and lack of vigour of the environment minister in this 
matter.
<P>
	The auto industry lobby systematically refused to reveal its 
studies and thus scientifically support its allegations that the 
additive was effectively clogging anti-pollution devices, 
particularly the OBD-2.
<P>
	As for the Ontario corn industry, it congratulated the 
environment minister on his bill, seeing that the MMT ban would 
throw the door wide open to another additive, ethanol, which is 
produced from corn. Since Ontario produces 80 per cent of 
Canada's corn, this bill means an exceptional market opportunity 
for corn producers in that province. This would be a gold mine for 
Ontario corn producers.
<P>
	Ethanol production is extremely expensive, both in terms of the 
environment and in terms of production costs. Fertilizers and 
pesticides play a major role in corn production. Moreover, the 
production of one litre of ethanol increases the cost of energy from 
oil products.
<P>
	I must also remind members that production costs are so high 
that the excise tax is removed from this product at the federal level 
and that the provinces are doing the same, particularly Ontario, 
with a tax exemption of 22 cents a litre. This weakens the myth of 
ethanol as ``green gasoline''.
<P>
	It is in Ontario that the biggest ethanol plant will soon be built. It 
is also the federal government that launched in 1994 an ethanol 
development support program. Are these all coincidences?	 
Not very likely. The government should be looking at other 
alternative fuels instead, because ethanol from corn has shown 
obvious weaknesses.
<P>
	The only scientific data based on the results of tests conducted 
on various automobiles were provided by Ethyl Corporation and oil 
companies. These data are the opposite of the allegations made by 
the auto industry,  which has not provided any supporting data. The 
MMT lobby says it is ready to withdraw its product if independent 
tests, approved by all parties, prove that MMT gums up the 
onboard diagnostic systems. These tests could be conducted within 
a very short time frame and would clarify this issue once and for 
all. But the government says no, preferring to hide behind the 
anti-MMT lobby.
<P>
	The majority of provinces strongly opposed Bill C-29. There 
was strong opposition to this bill even within cabinet, particularly 
from the Minister of International Trade, who sees this bill as an 
obstacle to free trade. As a matter of fact, Ethyl Corporation has 
given notice of its intention to launch a US$201 million lawsuit 
against the government, claiming that Bill C-29 is an obstacle to 
free trade and to the free trade agreement. Is the minister sure to 
win his case in court? Let us hope so, otherwise it will be very 
costly.
<P>
	Bill C-29 is the reincarnation of Bill C-94, which died on the 
Order Paper during the last session. We would have thought that the 
new minister would do his homework more carefully, but no. That 
is not the way it is. The minister came up with the same bill without 
being able to justify it. We have every reason to be concerned. If 
the minister does not take his work more seriously and does not 
show more thoroughness in his decisions, the Prime Minister 
should replace him without delay, because he is a liability for the 
environment.
<P>
<B>(1230)</B>
<P>
	Having accomplished nothing and unable to fulfil their promises 
with regard to the environment, the Liberals had to do something. 
So they came up with Bill C-29. What a performance. As if there 
were nothing else to do for the environment.
<P>
	Of course, there is Bill C-65 on endangered species, which the 
government recently scrambled to introduced recently to show that 
it is doing something for the environment. Let us not forget that the 
Liberals have been in office for more than three years. Before Bill 
C-65, the minister was seen last summer on a boat in the Gulf of St. 
Lawrence when the <I>Irving Whale</I> was raised. What an impressive 
record.

	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I move for the Minister of the Environment:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-65, an act respecting the protection of wildlife species in Canada from 
extirpation or extinction, be referred forthwith to the Standing Committee on 
Environment and Sustainable Development.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1235 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
speak to the referral of Bill C-65, the Canadian Endangered Species 
Act, to committee for study and action.
<P>
	Canadians from all walks of life, from urban to rural areas, have 
told us we need endangered species legislation.
<P>
	Members of Parliament on both sides, in the government 
benches and in the seats across the way, have reflected this genuine 
concern for Canada's wildlife. That is why the government looks 
forward to working with the committee while they study and 
strengthen Canada's first ever endangered species legislation.
<P>
	The government commitment to this legislation was made in the 
speech from the throne. It followed extensive consultations with 
wildlife conservation groups, other environmental groups, farmers, 
the private sector, provincial and territorial governments and 
individual Canadians.
<P>
	Our planet is losing from one to three species per day, mainly as 
a result of human activity. The recently released IUCN red list 
contains over 5,000 animal species currently at risk of becoming 
extinct. Unhappily some countries now have up to 50 per cent of 
their mammal species in this category.
<P>
	Fortunately Canada is nowhere near that figure but we are not 
immune from this disturbing trend. One out of every 25 of our 
mammal species and one out of every 33 of our bird species are 
threatened or endangered. In Canada 276 species of fish, 
amphibians, reptiles, mammals and plants are facing extinction and 
once they are gone, they are gone forever.
<P>
	All levels of government have a duty and a responsibility to 
work in partnership with one another and with concerned citizens 
across the country and around the world to do all in our power to 
prevent this from happening.
<P>
	Canadians care passionately about the natural environment. 
When we have the opportunity to enjoy wild places, few of us can 
deny the incredible feelings that overwhelm us. We must never 
forget that not only are we in nature but that nature is in us. Our 
connections with nature are expressed through social, biological, 
economic, cultural and spiritual relationships.
<P>
	Thomas Berry, an eco-theologian, urges us to maintain a sense of 
respect and a sense of gratitude toward the earth. Indeed, Canada's 
identity has been shaped by our wilderness in the grandeur of its 
gifts. It is how we see ourselves and how we are known by others 
throughout the world.
<P>
	As I said, Canadians feel passionately about our natural 
environment. Our provincial and territorial colleagues and our 
federal minister have listened to Canadians. Last month we agreed 
to a national accord to the protection of species at risk. With it we 
have put nature first and jurisdictional disputes second.
<P>
	The accord commits all provincial and territorial governments, 
along with the federal government, to take action within specific 
time periods to provide for the recovery of species in danger. I am 
confident that the provincial and territorial governments will live 
up to the spirit and the letter of that agreement in the same way that 
we are doing with this legislation before us today.
<P>
	Provisions throughout the bill enable federal action to protect 
critical habitat, including automatic protection of wildlife 
residences until the recovery plan has been developed. It covers 
threatened and endangered species that move across international 
borders. There are authorities in this legislation for immediate 
action with other levels of government, the private sector, 
environmental groups, farmers, fishers, loggers and individual 
Canadians to work together to protect species in imminent danger.
<P>
	Once an endangered species is officially listed, activities causing 
damage or destruction to its residence will be prohibited. This bill 
requires that recovery plans address threats to survival of species, 
including threats to critical habitat. It will also give provision for 
immediate emergency protection of habitat. Offences under the 
legislation could result in fines up to $250,000 and up to five years 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6916"> 6916 </A></B>
<P>
in prison. Corporations would be subject to penalties up to half a 
million dollars.
<P>
	Another important element is the provision to protect 
international cross-border species at risk. Only the national 
government has the ability to work co-operatively with other 
countries for the conservation of species.
<P>
<B>(1240)</B>
<P>
	I would be remiss if I did not mention public participation. It 
gives all Canadians a chance to play an active part in the protection 
of species. The public can take part in everything from proposing 
species for listing to access to the courts for legal redress.
<P>
	This is good legislation. Members of the committee have shown 
an active interest in working on and improving what is before us. 
They, like most Canadians, understand the special reverence we 
have for Canada's wilderness. This legislation will help us protect 
species at risk. It is time now to continue the work of putting in 
place Canada's first ever endangered species legislation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, Bill 
C-65, an act respecting the protection of wildlife species in Canada 
from extirpation or extinction, has finally been introduced in this 
House.
<P>
	Following this stage, the House will be able to refer the bill to 
the Standing Committee on Environment and Sustainable 
Development. We will thus have complied with regular legislative 
procedures. At the outset, we have to admit that everyone agrees 
that wildlife species must be protected. The flora and fauna are 
vital components of life on earth. Without flowers, trees, plants, 
animals and fish, life on earth would be impossible.
<P>
	Unfortunately, human activity has seriously damaged 
biodiversity. Only recently have we acknowledged this and started 
trying to reverse the process. We must act vigorously before it is 
too late, though it is unfortunately too late for some species which 
are already extinct.
<P>
	In the last two decades, the preservation of biodiversity has 
become an international priority. As a result, we had the 1980 
World Conservation Strategy; the 1991 report entitled ``Caring for 
the Earth''; the 1987 report of the World Commission on 
Environment and Development entitled ``Our Common Future''; 
and more recently, in 1992, the International Convention on 
Biological Diversity. As we can see, environmental awareness is a 
recent reality.
<P>
	In Canada, some provinces and the federal government have 
already passed laws in this area. Some 12 federal acts deal with the 
conservation and protection of threatened species.
<P>
	These laws include the Canada Wildlife Act, the Migratory Birds 
Convention Act, the Fisheries Act, the National Parks Act, the 
Health of Animals Act, and the Canadian Environmental Protection 
Act.
<P>
	At the provincial level, four provinces-New Brunswick, 
Quebec, Ontario and Manitoba-have their own laws designed to 
protect endangered species. As for the other provinces and the 
territories, they have laws on wildlife management and endangered 
species. Their content varies considerably.
<P>
	On October 2, at a meeting in Charlottetown, the federal and 
provincial ministers responsible for wildlife agreed in principle on 
a national convention for the protection of wildlife in Canada. This 
agreement is designed to prevent the extinction of wildlife species 
in Canada as a result of human activity. It establishes a new 
framework for co-operation between the federal, provincial and 
territorial governments. It deals with co-operation, collaboration 
and complementarity between its signatories.
<P>
<B>(1245)</B>
<P>
	Quebec, which supports the general principles and goals behind 
Canada's endangered species conservation projects, was already 
reluctant to support the national agreement, fearing overlap 
between Bill C-65, which we are debating today, and the laws 
already in effect in the provinces, particularly the one in Quebec, in 
force since 1989, which works well and is already producing 
results.
<P>
	Quebec minister David Cliche said, and I quote: ``We risk 
creating more red tape instead of dedicating ourselves to what 
really matters to us: the fate of endangered species''.
<P>
	Bill C-65 introduced by the federal minister only confirms the 
apprehensions of the Quebec minister. Again, the federal 
government clumsily encroaches on Quebec jurisdiction.
<P>
	For ministers in Quebec and other provinces, including Alberta, 
Saskatchewan and Manitoba, the principle behind the 
Charlottetown accord was very simple: if the ministers agreed that 
a species was endangered, the entity having jurisdiction over this 
species' territory or habitat would be responsible for the protection 
of both the species and its habitat.
<P>
	It is impossible to protect a species without protecting its habitat. 
Since the provinces have jurisdiction over the habitats found within 
their territory, the province, in this case Quebec, is responsible for 
the protection of this habitat. But, obviously, the federal minister 
did not understand that principle adhered to by four provinces 
which already have legislation on endangered species.
<P>
	Bill C-65 says that the federal government can act in order to 
protect the habitat of any federal species, and the definition of 
species is not limited to those species under federal jurisdiction 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6917"> 6917 </A></B>
<P>
like migratory birds and any species identified as transboundary, 
such as caribous crossing the border, for example.
<P>
	In clear terms, that means the federal government could 
unilaterally decide to take action on provincial territories if it 
considers that a given species is threatened, endangered or at risk, 
which caused an outcry from provincial ministers.
<P>
	Bill C-65 goes against the intent of the Charlottetown accord, 
which says that if the ministers agree to put a species on the list, it 
is up to the jurisdiction controlling the territory to make sure the 
habitat of that species is duly protected.
<P>
	Bill C-65 could allow some unthinkable and unacceptable 
interference in areas of provincial jurisdiction. Bill C-65 
essentially replicates the main points of the bill presented by the 
previous minister in 1995. That bill had been so massively opposed 
that it was never passed. One of the criticisms was that the 
proposed measures were not strong enough.
<P>
	We believe that this bill presents some tremendous risk of 
duplication and federal interference. Its scope is much too wide and 
it could create legislative overlap and duplication.
<P>
	We also have much to criticize in the whole process for 
implementing the protection system described in the bill. In 
particular, jurisdiction as provided will allow enforcement by the 
federal government on provincial land without the consent of the 
provinces, because of the definitions given of federal land, aquatic 
species and migratory birds. One provision empowers the minister 
to rule on transboundary species, which means that the federal 
government would be able to take action not only with respect to 
nearly all species, but also with respect to their habitat, without the 
issue being debated in the House, as the House does not discuss 
regulations.
<P>
	I will conclude by adding that, in any case, this bill will be 
referred to a committee, where we will surely propose some 
amendments to ensure that the legislation does not duplicate 
existing and very good provincial legislation. I hope the 
government and the official opposition will agree on various 
amendments.
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
	We will also see what can be done after hearing from various 
witnesses. We will then determine the position of the Bloc 
Quebecois on this issue.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is good to be able to speak to this motion today which 
has some basic optimism about doing good things which have 
general social support across the country.
<P>
	As civilization on this planet becomes more developed, 
humanity encroaches on the world ecosystem. Although there is 
some adaptive specialization and limited evolution to the living 
world, what we observe is a general trend to deterioration of the 
environment and living things, and more prospect of dying than 
living and the trend to extinction rather than survival.
<P>
	There is difficulty for mankind to find better health on this 
spaceship earth, as it is turning into everything opposite of the 
garden of Eden.
<P>
	Society may not be able to halt all of what is happening to the 
earth, but we can be reasonably responsible in stewardship. 
Mankind is on a life support system called earth that hurdles 
through space. It is all we have for our children, so we have to take 
care of its bounty and all those who live on it.
<P>
	Today with this bill we are attempting to mitigate some of the 
excesses of civilization on other species. It is not the dawning of a 
new day but some basic housekeeping for our land.
<P>
	We need to have a national conversation about this piece of 
legislation. We must have committee hearings where Canadians 
can speak, as it is fundamental to governance in a modern 
democracy. Consequently we have Bill C-65 to be moved to the 
committee stage before second reading.
<P>
	As many members of the House are aware, the Standing 
Committee on the Environment and Sustainable Development was 
supposed to travel this week to Vancouver, Edmonton, Montreal 
and Toronto. Unfortunately politics got in the way and the trip was 
cancelled at the last minute. I had several calls earlier this week 
from potential witness who are very upset that the committee 
would not be able to hear their testimony.
<P>
	I want to state for the record that the Reform Party agreed to the 
original travel plans and continues to believe that it is essential that 
Canadians from all parts of the country be heard on this bill. It is 
the concern of the committee to receive submissions from 
non-governmental organizations as well as private citizens.
<P>
	However, it will not be any Reform Party strategists that will 
oppose this bill, but we on this side of the House will be the voice 
of the community, especially those who think that often they are 
shut out by arrogant majority governments that seek out political 
credit rather than wise governance.
<P>
	Let me state publicly that if the minister does not openly listen 
and act on the suggestions of all the relevant stakeholders who have 
deep concerns with Bill C-65, this bill might become Bill C-29's 
big brother.
<P>
	Some will say is that a threat. Maybe yes, but not from 
Reformers. It is, rather, a signal of the rules of the game from the 
thousands of Canadians who are paying attention to the passage of 
this bill. It is the reasonable expectation of all Canadians who want 
to protect our environment while at the same time protect our hard  
won political rights, our vital freedoms to live in a free market 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6918"> 6918 </A></B>
<P>
economy and earn an honest living. A poor bill could become very 
problematic on those counts.
<P>
	What is paramount for all members of the Reform Party is to 
ensure that all stakeholders, including ranchers, farmers, 
environmentalists, private citizens, will always play an integral 
part in the preservation and the recovery process of species that are 
endangered.
<P>
	For years, non-governmental organizations like the Canadian 
Cattlemen's Association have taken the initiative to protect 
endangered species. For example, cattle producers have voluntarily 
co-operated with programs like the North American water fowl 
management plan as well as operation burrowing owl. These 
programs require equal participation from the producers and the 
conservation groups.
<P>
	Many individual producers have set aside parts of their land 
specifically for the protection of wildlife habitat. The bottom line is 
that producers are willing to take the necessary action to ensure the 
sustainability of endangered and threatened species.
<P>
	One of my concerns has to do with section 34 of the bill which 
deals specifically with emergency orders. In this section, either the 
Minister of the Environment, Canadian Heritage or Fisheries and 
Oceans will make an emergency order should the minister decide 
that immediate action is required to protect a specific species. As I 
read it, the order includes a provision that relates to the prohibiting 
of activities that directly affect a species or where the habitat is in 
imminent danger for the survival of the species. Therefore this 
could affect private land, not just the federal land that the bill 
claims it only covers.
<P>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
	Nowhere in the background material provided by Environment 
Canada does it state that the bill will or could affect private land. 
Yet when I questioned officials from Environment Canada they 
made it very clear to me that in certain circumstances the bill could 
affect private land. This is exactly the kind of thing the committee 
needs to work out before this legislation will be accepted by the 
vast majority of Canadians.
<P>
	In meetings with farmers and ranchers they have told members 
of the Reform Party that they are willing to work alongside the 
government in the protection of endangered species. However, 
their biggest concern is that there should be no expropriation 
without fair compensation. I hope this does not become the very 
point where it all unravels.
<P>
	Definitions need to be tightened up. I will give one example. 
What if a species lives on federal land and for some reason 
becomes endangered and the provisions of the act are triggered? 
The species, say a non-migratory bird, may also nest on some 
adjacent industrial land that is about to be expanded. It is adjacent 
private land in this  case that is not governed by a provincial law. 
So if new roads and power and sewer facilities are to be completed, 
nests will be destroyed and this would not be accidental.
<P>
	The private landowner will be affected by the act if there is no 
such legislation in the province. The owner would indeed be 
consulted about a recovery plan, but when it came down to it, it 
could mean that the expansion of the industrial park would be 
stopped and the landowner's real estate value would plummet and 
they would suffer loss. Then the question is who pays for the 
catastrophic financial loss because of a new regulation from 
government.
<P>
	The gist of this bill seems to be that the provinces that do not 
have endangered species legislation would come onboard in the 
very near future. Indeed this would strengthen Bill C-65. 
Unfortunately this does not seem to be the case, at least for the 
province of British Columbia.
<P>
	Recently B.C.'s environment minister, Paul Ramsay, was quoted 
as saying that it was not on his government's agenda to introduce 
legislation even though he signed the national accord. In British 
Columbia this act will cover only less than 1 per cent of all the 
land. So without the help of the province of British Columbia, this 
act is more than 99 per cent useless. In the province of Alberta, for 
example, the ratio is only slightly higher but not enough for the 
minister to get even a little excited.
<P>
	The auditor general says in chapter 22 of his November 1996 
report that the federal government is not doing all that well in 
cleaning up polluted federal land. Therefore is it clear that in the 
federal House of responsibility species will indeed be protected and 
that the same consequences will apply to bureaucrats as ordinary 
citizens as a result of this bill? Will public servants be fined? It 
seems to be the old problem of the lands in common and crown 
land where no individual or specific entity appears accountable.
<P>
	There are big penalties for private corporations but will 
members of the armed forces be charged and will national defence 
actually pay the corporate fines when it hurts endangered species 
on federal land such as a low fly zone or a firing range? There must 
be no double standard.
<P>
	I stress again that the minister needs to listen to all Canadians 
before he will get support on this bill. He does not want to go down 
as the environment minister who brought in Bill C-29 which caused 
more smog from automobiles and caused more endangered species.
<P>
	We must ensure this bill will not be used for a perverse purpose 
by an economic competitor to mess up the marketplace and put a 
company out of business merely because the competitor wants an 
economic advantage for their own firm. The bill must be an 
instrument for community co-operation and a point around which 
actual species can be preserved.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="6919"> 6919 </A></B>
<P>
	I want to prevent the situation wherein the only species 
preserved are lawyers who could use this new law to litigate every 
project for years and allow every fringe environmental group to 
unreasonably promote their religion to the detriment of the big 
picture of the environment or the basic rights of Canadians. 
Therefore the section on citizen complaints must be clarified.
<P>
	The Reform Party will not oppose for the sake of opposing. We 
say three things about our role. First, we have a duty as opposition 
to hold the government to account and to test the veracity and merit 
of what it brings forward in legislation and also how it delivers its 
governance. Second, we desire to compliment the government 
when it goes in the right direction. Third, if we heavily criticize we 
must be prepared to present thorough and realistic alternatives on 
the table for all to examine. Reform is ready to govern, but until 
called upon by the people we will do our duty with this bill.
<P>
	Therefore, we support the motion for Bill C-65 to go to 
committee before second reading to broaden the circle of 
examination and to provide Canadians outside this Chamber a 
better chance to participate. The terms of the bill assert a new level 
of ongoing community co-operation and consensus. Let it be also 
said in the making of this bill that we will have the same spirit of 
consultation and willingness to adjust as the bill becomes tested in 
the community.

<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> It being 1.00 p.m., the House will now proceed to 
the consideration of Private Members' Business as listed on 
today's Order Paper.

	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.)</B> moved 
that Bill C-252, an act to amend the Criminal Code (mines), be read 
the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, it is a great pleasure today to speak on my 
private member's bill, Bill C-252, an act to amend the Criminal 
Code relating to mines.
<P>
	This bill deals with an epidemic that we have in our midst which 
is affecting over 60 countries in the world. It is an epidemic which 
kills over 25,000 people every year. It is an epidemic which harms 
over three times that many people. It is an epidemic primarily 
designed to kill and maim innocent civilians, often children. The 
epidemic I am talking about is the epidemic of anti-personnel land 
mines.
<P>
	This scourge affects many countries and often the poorest 
countries of the world. It is often spoken of on the same level as 
biological and chemical weapons. These heinous devices, these 
heinous silent killers which lay underneath the ground beside trees, 
on walking paths, beside watering holes and in fields are devices 
which violate virtually every single tenet of humanitarian law. 
They are in effect by their very nature, by the way in which they are 
used and by whom they affect, illegal. Yet there are in the world 
today countries which still use them, countries which produce them 
and countries which sell them.
<P>
	The purpose of this bill is to give Canada a leadership role in 
banning anti-personnel land mines. To the credit of the 
government, it has placed a moratorium on land mines. It has also 
destroyed two-thirds of its stockpile. That is a move in the right 
direction. If we are calling for an international ban on 
anti-personnel mines which we have been doing, we must first take 
a leadership role in banning them domestically. It is disingenuous 
for us to call for a ban of these mines internationally on the one 
hand and on the other not do the same within Canada. It is a shame 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6920"> 6920 </A></B>
<P>
because these weapons are not necessary, from a military or any 
other perspective. I will get to that later on in my speech.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	There are two different kinds of these mines. There are blast 
mines which when stepped on blow up. There are fragmentation 
mines which contain pieces of shrapnel and metal one of which 
elevates itself above the ground to rip out a core and affect people 
perhaps in a 50 or 60 yard radius from where the mine has blown 
up.
<P>
	The fragmentation mines shoot out projectiles at rapid speed 
which can tear into a person's bowels, legs, groin, chest, eyes and 
face. The blast mines can take off a limb. Perversely, these devices 
are not meant to kill but are actually meant to maim. The perverted 
logic behind this is that a person who is injured is a greater problem 
to society at large than somebody who is killed and removed from 
society.
<P>
	Most of these mines are laid in battlefields. Most of them are 
laid in the poorest nations of the world. The mines are also used for 
a number of other different purposes. They are used to terrorize. 
They are used as blackmail. They are used to starve people. The 
Khmer Rouge used them very effectively in Cambodia. They 
would lay mines around the fields and say to the people that they 
could only get back into their fields if they paid them money. The 
Iraqis used them very effectively to starve the Kurds.
<P>
	These mines, as I have said before, affect the poorest nations of 
the world. When a war is over and people want to go back into the 
fields they cannot do so because of the mines. This continues the 
cycle of starvation and destitution within these nations.
<P>
	The mines are also used in a number of other heinous ways 
which is well known to the people here. Over 40 countries in the 
world manufacture mines and the list of companies that make them 
reads like the <I>Who's Who</I> of <I>Fortune 500</I>. In fact if we look at the 
nations that make them, we find sadly that those who claim to be 
the leaders in peace at the United Nations Security Council are 
those who are the greatest producers of land mines in the world. It 
is important to know that. The list includes companies such as 
Daimler-Benz, Daiwa and many others that can be found in 
<I>Fortune 500</I>.
<P>
	Many of these devices are often designed to look like little toys. 
The reason they are designed to look like toys is that children will 
pick them up and their arms will be blown off.
<P>
	My personal experience with land mines occurred when I was 
working on the Mozambique border in southern Africa during the 
war in Mozambique. It was usually young people, adolescents, 
children, youth, who had their limbs blown off. If you have ever 
looked into the eyes of somebody who is sitting on a hospital bed 
with one of their limbs torn to pieces and fragmentations embedded 
in various parts of their body, knowing full well that that the person 
is going to die or at best live a life of utter poverty and destitution, 
then you cannot arrive at any other conclusion but that these 
devices must be banned.
<P>
	In fact looking at the current conventional wisdom, the Pentagon 
has called for a ban of these devices. Twenty-two top military brass 
in the United States have called for a ban. Canadians have called 
for a ban. The international community has called for a ban, yet we 
do not have a ban. Furthermore our country has not called for a ban.
<P>
	The International Committee of the Red Cross put forth a very 
eloquent document which looked at the use of land mines purely 
from a military perspective. It was done by 12 top military brass 
including General Itani, a Canadian. The outcome was they said 
that there was no legitimate military use for anti-personnel land 
mines in the 1990s and there would not be in the future. They 
strongly recommended that these devices be banned.
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	Within 24 hours that document was supported by another 24 top 
military brass. Within 48 hours, 72 top military brass supported it, 
including General Norman Schwarzkopf and our own General 
Lewis MacKenzie.
<P>
	The primary reason for keeping land mines within our arsenal 
comes from the military, from a very archaic view of the use of 
mines. Unfortunately that is the view that is being held sway within 
our country today and that needs to change.
<P>
	I am greatly disappointed that this bill which in effect has been 
supported by members across this House and in fact in the Senate 
was not made votable. There have been dozens and dozens of 
interventions by members from the government, the Bloc, the 
Conservative Party, the NDP and Reform Party to ban 
anti-personnel land mines in Canada. There are even senators from 
all party lines who desperately want this to occur. There is no 
reason this bill should not have been made votable so that the 
House and the people of this country could vote on this very 
important humanitarian issue.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> The government should bring forward a bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> That is right. The 
government should forthwith bring forward a bill calling for a ban. 
I am sure we could get speedy passage of that bill through this 
House and the Senate to make sure that Canada is playing a 
leadership role.
<P>
	We are not the only country to have addressed this. Many 
countries have done so. For example, Belgium which had a vast 
stockpile of anti-personnel mines has made a ban. Sixteen 
countries across the world have taken leadership and it is high time 
that we as a nation did too.
<P>
	Apart from the military aspect of land mines, there is also the 
issue under humanitarian law. There are rules which talk about the 
proportional or discriminate use of weapons. Land mines violate 
international humanitarian law on at least four or five tenets. They 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6921"> 6921 </A></B>
<P>
are disproportionate, they affect civilians, they are not addressed 
necessarily to combatants, they continue to affect people long after 
a war is finished and they are inhumane by any stretch of the 
imagination.
<P>
	If we are in agreement with international law, with the tenets that 
we have signed with the United Nations, then we have to arrive at 
no other conclusion but the fact that anti-personnel land mines are 
illegal and must be banned. There are no two ways about it.
<P>
	If we want to speak in purely selfish terms, there are over two 
million land mines seeded around the world. Every year we take 
out 85,000. The cost to make a land mine is between $3 and $10, 
yet the cost to remove one can be anywhere between $300 and 
$1,000. We are losing the battle. We cannot keep up with the 
scourge if we are only removing that many and indiscriminately 
dumping over two million of them a year. And indiscriminate it is. 
Mines are tossed out of helicopters and from the backs of trucks. 
There are machines made in Great Britain, France and the United 
States which toss literally hundreds of them around.
<P>
	In the gulf war a staggering 400,000 anti-personnel land mines 
were laid every single day. What is the cost to remove them? The 
worldwide cost is over $35 billion. Who can afford that? Not the 
countries that have them because they are some of the poorest 
countries in the world. Not the international community because 
we are all labouring under huge debts and deficits which we simply 
do not have the money to pay for.
<P>
	What happens in the poorest countries of the world with the 
mines? It prevents these countries from getting back on their feet. 
Mozambique, Angola, El Salvador, Somalia; the list is endless. 
These countries will never become self-sufficient, will never be 
able to stand on their own two feet unless these issues are dealt with 
forthwith.
<P>
<B>(1315 )</B>
<P>
	Some of my colleagues will speak today about the people who 
are affected by mines and what happens to them if they are lucky 
enough to survive the blast. Some of them may be lucky enough to 
go to a hospital where they will receive proper medical treatment 
and possible amputation. They then will suffer months if not years 
of future surgeries. Because the mine fragments are embedded 
deeply they often get septic. The people become sick and require 
antibiotics which are not often available. They might need revision 
surgeries if it is available to them or they die a very painful and 
horrible death.
<P>
	We talk about prosthetics. Prosthesis for these people are not 
readily available. When one is making $15 U.S. a month and the 
cost for prosthesis is over $125 U.S., and children will use over 20 
of these in their life, one can see that is simply not available.
<P>
	Those of us who have travelled in the third world, as many 
members have, know that these people who are affected by mines 
and are amputation victims live a life in the lowest possible social 
strata in their society. They are in effect outcasts in a world of 
poverty. They often crawl on the ground using the remnants of 
rubber tires on their knees and beg. The families cannot take care of 
them and they can hardly take care of themselves. It is clearly 
inhumane.
<P>
	Therefore, it completely violates any of the tenets of 
humanitarian law under which we are supposed to live.
<P>
	Canada has a great opportunity. We have taken a leadership role 
in many other areas in the past. During the times of Pearsonian 
diplomacy we demonstrated that we can take a leadership role to 
strive for peace and understanding among people. We have 
demonstrated a leadership role in humanitarian aspects. We have 
Louise Arbour who is the head of the war crimes tribunals in the 
Hague. Canada has a pre-eminent role in diplomacy and in foreign 
policy.
<P>
	I would ask that the government look at this issue and bring in a 
bill that will have a domestic ban on anti-personnel land mines. If 
we can have a domestic bill on these devices then clearly we can go 
to the international community and talk with a great deal of 
personal conviction and credibility. We can tell other countries that 
it is in the best interest of the poorest countries and the poorest 
people of the world, indeed all of us, to ban these devices. They 
must be put on the same level as chemical weapons, biological 
weapons and lasers that are designed to blind people. All of these 
weapons have absolutely no place in warfare in the 20th century.
<P>
	So-called military experts will say that there are rules that 
govern mines. They have mapped them out and they know where 
they are. However, the facts of the matter are that is completely not 
true. Although we may try to do that, guerrillas can go in and move 
the mines around. Weather patterns shift the mines around. We do 
not know where they are. Guerrillas can take mines as they go 
through a mine field and use those mines to damage and destroy 
that which they are supposed to protect. They can also be used 
against the parties that they are supposed to protect. There is no use 
for these devices now and they must be banned.
<P>
	Strangely, although the military is the primary objector to calling 
for a ban on these devices, the primary use is by non-military 
combatants, non-conventional combatants or guerrillas. They are 
the ones who use these discriminately and they are the ones who do 
not adhere to common practices of war. We all know there are 
really no rules in war.
<P>
	Some people have said that if we call for a ban on these devices 
not everybody is going to adhere to it. That is very true, but by 
banning these substances we will be able to arrest the epidemic of 
the distribution of these devices so we can at least lower the 
numbers that are  being laid. As I mentioned before, if one is laying 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6922"> 6922 </A></B>
<P>
two million mines a year and taking 85,000 out we have a losing 
proposition and they must be removed.
<P>
<B>(1320 )</B>
<P>
	These mines are not used for military purposes. They are 
primarily used in a inhumane fashion to terrorize the civilian 
population. Many are designed to target a civilian population by 
putting them along the pathways to watering holes. The military do 
not do that. They know how to deal with mines. This practice is 
meant to terrorize the civilians.
<P>
	I would like to congratulate a number of groups in Canada which 
have worked extraordinarily hard on this issue. Mines Action 
Canada, the International Committee of the Red Cross, just to name 
a few, along with many Canadians from coast to coast have tried to 
bring the issue to the forefront of international consciousness.
<P>
	I would ask that the government follow the desires and wishes of 
the majority of Canadians and ban a device which is so heinous it is 
beyond our comprehension unless we have dealt with or heaven 
forbid, been affected by land mines or anti-personnel devices.
<P>
	I will stop there. Based on what I have said today, I would like to 
seek the unanimous consent of the House to make my private 
member's bill votable.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Finlay):</B> Is there agreement that the 
bill should be made votable?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Carolyn Parrish (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today in support of private member's Bill C-252, calling for a 
domestic ban of anti-personnel land mines.
<P>
	I have a particular interest in this issue, since last week at a 
conference of the North Atlantic Assembly I was elected Special 
Rapporteur to the Science and Technology Committee to report to 
the assembly on anti-personnel land mines with the objective of 
banning them. In the coming months I will be studying this issue 
very closely.
<P>
	In recent years, due in part to the efforts of numerous 
international non-governmental organizations, as mentioned by the 
previous speaker, the issue of anti-personnel land mines has been 
brought to the forefront of international relations. We are becoming 
increasingly informed and aware of the destruction and havoc 
caused by such weapons all over the world.
<P>
	These efforts have led to an international campaign to ban 
anti-personnel land mines, a movement in which I am proud to 
state Canada has taken a lead role.
<P>
	In October of this year, the Minister of Foreign Affairs held an 
international strategy conference toward a global ban on 
anti-personnel land mines where representatives of 70 
governments, non-governmental organizations,  multilateral 
agencies and private citizens attended. The Ottawa conference 
concluded with the adoption of the Ottawa declaration calling for 
an international ban on anti-personnel land mines.
<P>
	The problem is enormous. It is estimated there are 119 million 
uncleared active land mines around the world in more than 64 
countries. Currently, as the previous speaker mentioned, only 
100,000 are being cleared and disarmed yearly at great expense.
<P>
	The United Nations has projected that if no further land mines 
were laid, it would still take 1,000 years and $33 billion to clear the 
land mines that are already in place. However, each year two 
million to five million new mines are put in the ground. We cannot 
sit idly by and allow the situation to continue unchecked.
<P>
	These horrible weapons currently claim more than 2,000 victims 
a month and over the last 50 years have probably inflicted more 
death and injuries than nuclear and chemical weapons combined.
<P>
	While the use of land mines began as a counter to tanks, the use 
of anti-personnel land mines have become increasingly popular. 
They have become the weapon of choice for parties involved in 
guerrilla type operations and international conflicts as they are 
cheap, as little a $3 a piece, easy to lay and highly effective in 
killing and maiming human beings, particularly women and 
children. They are used in some cases to deny access to farm lands, 
irrigation channels and power plants. The effect of these usages is 
devastating in a country recovering from war.
<P>
	Once land mines are laid, they are indiscriminate in their actions 
since they do not have to be aimed or fired. They are nameless and 
faceless weapons. Unless they are cleared they go on killing long 
after the end of any conflict. In fact, the United Nations has 
estimated that land mines are at least ten times more likely to kill 
or injure a civilian after a conflict than a combatant during 
hostility.
<P>
<B>(1325 )</B>
<P>
	Moreover, floods, landslides, moving sand dunes and natural 
erosion can shift their positions long after they have been laid and 
marked. In Namibia 88 per cent of post-1980 land mine casualties 
were civilian. The same situation is reflected in many other 
countries where land mines are numerous.
<P>
	The effects of land mines are gruesome and abhorrent. One 
person is killed or maimed by a mine every 20 minutes and nearly a 
third of the survivors have at least one limb amputated. On a 
current election monitoring trip to Bosnia I was shocked to note 
that about one in every ten adults and children walking along the 
street in a town called Gorazde had either a hand, an arm or a leg 
missing.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6923"> 6923 </A></B>
<P>
	By comparison, in the U.S. there is one amputee per 22,000 
inhabitants. In Cambodia, one of the countries most affected by 
mines, there is one amputee per 384 inhabitants. A study in 
Afghanistan, Bosnia, Cambodia and Mozambique found that the 
number of mine incidents in these four countries more than 
doubled between the early 1980s and the early 1990s.
<P>
	Land mines cause havoc in a society and severely hamper 
post-war reconstruction. Most mines strike those who are poor and 
must go into debt to pay for their medical bills if they can afford 
medical treatment at all. Gorazde has 20,000 people and two 
doctors from Doctors without Borders.
<P>
	The day before I arrived in Gorazde a little boy picked up a red 
lunch pail and blew his arm off at the shoulder. All the doctors 
could do is cauterize it and send him to Sarajevo. No one knew 
what happened to him after that.
<P>
	Mines also prevent the use of land for agricultural production in 
many parts of affected countries, severely limiting economic 
recovery. For example, in Libya only 27 per cent of arable land is 
usable because it has been covered by mine fields since World War 
II. Mines make reconstruction of rail and road networks, power 
lines and waterways slow, dangerous and costly.
<P>
	When I was in Bosnia they only had power for two out of 24 
hours. It was erratic. It could not be repaired. Sometimes the 
electricity came on from two until four in the morning, the time 
when most people do not have much use for it.
<P>
	Not only do anti-personnel land mines prevent the use of 
resources, they also place a strain on the budgets of countries 
affected, especially since those countries are likely among the 
poorest in the world.
<P>
	In addition, land mines prevent the settlement and resettlement 
of refugees which is essential to the success of the peace process. 
Peacekeepers are also at risk in these circumstances and we have 
many Canadian peacekeepers in Bosnia right now, over 1,000.
<P>
	A total of 203 UN peacekeepers have been injured by mines and 
60 have been killed to date. A further 39 UN civilian personnel 
have been injured and 7 have been killed by mines. One of the most 
important briefings I got repeatedly before I went to Bosnia as a 
civilian election monitor was all the rules and regulations on how 
to avoid getting maimed or killed by a land mine. I was in one of 
the most beautiful countries in the world yet I could not step off the 
sidewalk or the road on to the grass anywhere.
<P>
	For all of these reasons, land mines make it difficult, if not 
impossible, for countries to make the transition from conflict to 
peace through economic recovery, which is what those countries 
desperately need in order to reduce the chances of future armed 
conflicts.
<P>
	Land mines are not a significant source of revenue for most 
countries. About 100 companies in some 55 countries produce 
approximately five million land mines a year comprised of about 
360 different types of anti-personnel land mines. Few countries 
profit significantly from the sale of conventional anti-personnel 
land mines, most of which sell from $3 to $30 each.
<P>
	Not only are clearance costs between $300 and $1,000 per mine, 
the human costs are overwhelming. Each victim will incur lifetime 
expenses and each country will incur serious human and economic 
costs from those injuries. We can be very proud. Canada has one of 
the best trained forces in the world in disarming these mines.
<P>
	The review conference of the Convention on Certain 
Conventional Weapons adopted on May 3 a revised version of the 
convention's protocol II regulating the use of ``mines, booby traps 
and other devices''. Some of the revisions include an extension of 
the protocol to apply in both international and non-international 
armed conflicts, a clear assignment of responsibility for mine 
clearance to those who lay the mines, and a requirement that all 
mines be mapped and recorded. Of course that requirement is 
useless in many countries. As soon as the weather changes the 
mines shift and it is impossible to find them. Self-destructing 
mines may be used without any specific restriction but they are few 
and far between.
<P>
	While I am pleased that such efforts are being attempted it is not 
enough. The provisions will be phased in over nine years. In 
addition to this delay, many of the provisions are costly, difficult to 
ensure and unlikely to be followed, particularly in the midst of war.
<P>
<B>(1330 )</B>
<P>
	Even if states comply with the recording and mapping rule these 
techniques are only marginally effective when land mines shift 
easily over unstable ground. Self-destructing mines can be 
delivered in huge quantities and are extremely difficult to map. 
Their use could lead to an even greater increase in civilian mine 
casualties.
<P>
	The limited military usefulness of land mines must be 
overridden by humanitarian priorities. I have had the opportunity to 
witness firsthand, as I have mentioned repeatedly, the destruction 
caused by anti-personnel land mines.
<P>
	On the trip to Bosnia the most nervous part of the whole trip was 
not fear that I would be shot at or fear that there would be conflict 
between the people we were there to observe, it was the fear for my 
own person. I thought to myself there are many people, young 
people, who do not have work, 85 per cent unemployed, and they 
have the added fear that if they step anywhere that they should not, 
off a road, off a sidewalk, they can be maimed for life.
<P>
	I can only imagine the dangers the average citizen faced on a day 
to day basis there. Fighting had technically ceased. Just because the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6924"> 6924 </A></B>
<P>
act of war was over did not  mean the citizens were out of danger. 
Rather, they faced a whole new set of problems, not the least 
among them was trying to rebuild a country with so many obstacles 
in place.
<P>
	Canada must take a lead role in achieving a global ban on 
anti-personnel land mines. Bill C-252 is non-partisan. It has been 
presented by a member of the Reform Party but I wholeheartedly 
endorse it in a non-partisan fashion. It draws our attention to this 
very important subject and provokes serious debate and 
consideration of the issues involved.
<P>
	I strongly urge thoughtful consideration of this bill because 
ongoing dialogue is essential to any future progress.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is my pleasure to rise today to speak to Bill C-252. 
Although it is a very rare occurrence, this bill has elicited an air of 
peace and a desire to resolve a situation that causes terrible 
problems and suffering throughout the world.
<P>
	We must recall the Government of Canada's position on 
anti-personnel mines. There is an international agreement. Canada 
has destroyed two thirds of its mines, and I think this bill today 
contributes an important additional element. It would completely 
close the door on any trade in anti-personnel mines. It would 
prevent there being any more international military transactions in 
Canada relating to mines. I think this should be incorporated in the 
Canadian government's international policy.
<P>
	I would like to remind the House of statements made in this 
regard on December 12, 1995 by the hon. member for Laval East 
and on May 8, 1996 by the member for Terrebonne expressing the 
official opposition's desire for a strong, definite and clear policy on 
the part of the Canadian government prohibiting mines so that in 
the 21st century there would be no mines on earth and so that they 
could not cause the horrible injuries we often see in reports on the 
civil wars still raging unfortunately in a number of countries in the 
world.
<P>
	This is why the bill introduced by the hon. member for 
Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca is interesting. We cannot overlook the 
possibility of arms dealers becoming increasingly greedy for gain 
and, despite the will to destroy these types of mines, of individuals 
from other countries, manufacturers for instance, or dealers using a 
country like Canada as a contact point within North America or 
even the whole world, or maybe as a place to set up business.
<P>
	I think we had better find a way to follow up on this legislation. 
The purpose of this bill is to prohibit the offer for sale, purchase, 
possession, giving, barter, manufacture, assembly, import or export 
of a mine or an apparently harmless device, which is another 
definition for a mine.
<P>
	Overall, this piece of legislation would prohibit the trade of this 
type of weapon in Canada.
<P>
<B>(1335)</B>
<P>
	It has been clearly demonstrated that these anti-personnel mines 
are left-overs from more barbaric times. Just like international 
conventions were signed to deal with gas warfare, it is important to 
try to solve this problem once and for all before the end of the 
century.
<P>
	Unfortunately, mines are used in what could be called 
conventional wars raging in several continents, wars between 
neighbouring countries and even factions within a country who can 
only afford cheap weapons and mines, which makes this type of 
weapon interesting for a warring group. Victims are either maimed 
for life or are beyond recognition.
<P>
	The most horrible aspect of antipersonnel mines is that they 
make no distinction between a child, a woman, an adult or an 
elderly person and soldiers engaged in combat. It is very important 
that the Canadian government's message to the rest of the world be 
quite clear.
<P>
	We have a firm policy, and we have destroyed two thirds of the 
mines. Is two thirds enough? Should we not have destroyed 80, 85 
or 90 per cent? Good question. We already have at least one 
element of the debate on the destruction of two thirds of Canadian 
mines. But there is one element missing from Canada's policy and 
that is to ensure there are no sales on Canadian soil. I think the 
contribution made by the hon. member for Esquimalt-Juan de 
Fuca is important in this respect.
<P>
	In a speech the Minister for International Co-operation and 
Minister responsible for Francophonie gave on October 3, 1996 at 
the international conference on strategies for a complete ban on 
antipersonnel mines, the minister said that the continued presence 
of 110 million antipersonnel mines in developing countries, mainly 
in rural areas, actually means that these countries are still a war 
zone. Because antipersonnel mines are cheap, easy to obtain and 
easy to lay, they are the weapon of choice among belligerents in the 
poorest countries.
<P>
	However, we must not forget that in many cases, the trade in 
these weapons which are used by belligerents in wars in the poorest 
countries is often in the hands of people in wealthy Western 
countries. We must ensure that Canada is not in any way involved 
in this international arms trade. That is why the bill before the 
House today can be useful.
<P>
	The minister also said in his speech that together we must put 
pressure on governments to prohibit the manufacture, sale and use 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6925"> 6925 </A></B>
<P>
of land mines. So I fail to understand why the government majority 
refused to let this bill be a votable item. I do not see why just now 
the majority refused to let this bill come to a vote.
<P>
	If we look at the bill itself, it does not contain much that is 
controversial. In fact, it consists of only two sections: the first one 
defines what a mine is, which I mentioned earlier, and says that 
every person commits an offence who purchases, possesses, 
manufactures, assembles or imports a mine or an object or device 
referred to in the second definition.
<P>
	The bill even provides that the Government of Canada or of a 
province, or a corporation, might possess mines for the purpose of 
gaining experience in mine clearing or acquiring information about 
mines. Therefore, the exemption allowing the government to 
undertake meaningful action regarding those mines that are still 
active, one third of the all remaining mines, is already provided for 
in the bill.
<P>
	It also provides for penalties which I find appropriate and which 
would be substantial in the case of someone committing an offence 
under this bill. A first offence could result in up to 10 years in 
prison; for a second offence the maximum penalty would still be 10 
years in prison, but there would be a minimum of one year in jail 
and, subsequently, for each additional offence the maximum 
penalty would be 10 years with a minimum of two years less a day.
<P>
	The only reason I believe this bill is not votable is because it 
does not come from a member of the majority.
<P>
<B>(1340)</B>
<P>
	This is rather upsetting, because private members' business is 
part of the parliamentary agenda. Its very purpose is to allow 
members who have developed an awareness of certain issues to 
propose corrective measures when government policies are flawed, 
and to have these measures properly debated.
<P>
	In conclusion, I personally believe a consensus can be reached 
on this bill in Canada. After adopting a national policy to destroy 
two thirds of the mines, we ought to be able to reach the same 
consensus to prevent the sale of mines in our country.
<P>
	I hope the government, which refused earlier to give unanimous 
consent to make this bill a votable item, will find a way to integrate 
this policy. The hon. member who introduced this bill deserves 
credit for doing so, because it is important to state that mines are 
prohibited throughout Canada.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Vancouver South, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we have had some very good interventions here today.
<P>
	I want to congratulate the member for Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca 
for bringing this forward. I know the work he has done on this 
issue. I know that the personal experiences he has obviously help 
him to understand the issue better.
<P>
	This is a very important issue for me as well in that the 
deployment of anti-personnel mines is a massive human tragedy. It 
not only maims but it takes life and a lot of the time it affects 
women and children.
<P>
	One of the opportunities I had on this issue was with a delegation 
at the Interparliamentary Union led by Senator Bosa. I was given 
the duty on behalf of the Canadian delegation to have this issue of 
banning anti-personnel land mines on the agenda. The 
Interparliamentary Union is made up of 133 countries. This is an 
international issue. It is up to members of Parliament from around 
the world to build a consensus and come to an agreement on having 
a total ban on anti-personnel land mines.
<P>
	At the Interparliamentary Union it was our task to get this issue 
on the agenda. However, just to get issues on the agenda of an 
international organization is a tremendous task. There had been a 
number of attempts before by Belgium to have this issue put on the 
agenda and they had failed.
<P>
	There was a real effort by all of our delegation. We had written to 
many of the ambassadors of other countries to inform them that we 
wanted to have this on the agenda. One of the ways that happens is 
there is a vote at the IPU on the first day. We were able to convince 
members of Parliament from around the world to come together 
and vote on this issue. We were very successful in convincing them 
to put it on the agenda.
<P>
	Once the issue was on the agenda a drafting committee was 
struck. I had the privilege to be on that drafting committee. The 
Canadian text was adopted as the working document. This was the 
document that was accepted. It would have been a great asset to 
have other members, like the hon. member for Esquimalt-Juan de 
Fuca, with us when the work was done there. Unfortunately his 
party does not want to go to some of these international forums.
<P>
	These international forums are very valuable to put international 
issues on the agenda. We are working with members from around 
the world and Canada has taken a leadership role in the world. Too 
often as Canadians we undersell our influence around the world.
<P>
	This is a good example where the Canadian delegation was able 
to get this issue on the agenda and have the Canadian text as the 
working text for the committee. What happens in these 
international organizations is that it goes to the working 
committee. The working committee debates some of these issues 
and comes up with a consensus.
<P>
	As Canadians we ask why would some countries not want to 
support the banning of anti-personnel land mines. It seems very 
logical. There were some countries that were not interested in 
doing that. One of those countries is China. It produces more 
anti-personnel land mines than any other country. When the text 
was being examines, the Chinese were not interested in a very 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6926"> 6926 </A></B>
<P>
strong text. I said to my other colleagues, most of whom were very 
supportive, that in the public mind these international 
organizations often water down what is necessary.
<P>
<B>(1345)</B>
<P>
	This resolution should not be watered down. It is very strong and 
asks for a total ban on anti-personnel land mines. It would stop 
their production, their transportation and their use.
<P>
	The Canadian delegation, along with other countries, was able to 
adopt a very strong resolution at the IPU. The final paragraph asked 
the IPU to work with other international organizations like the 
United Nations so that the international community could come 
together to formalize a convention for the total ban of 
anti-personnel land mines.
<P>
	Many of my colleagues here today have articulated the tragedies 
which land mines have caused. I also want to inform the House and 
the Canadians watching this debate of the tragedies which 
anti-personnel land mines have caused.
<P>
	The October issue of <I>Equinox</I> has an excellent article. One of the 
stories was about a mother and her four-year old daughter who 
were out working on the farm. The mother had the daughter 
strapped to her back when she stepped on an anti-personnel land 
mine which costs no more than $3 or $4 to produce. It went off with 
12 pounds of pressure. The mother was killed. She lost her limbs 
and died right there. The four-year-old child who was on her back 
lay there with one of her legs blown off for three days before 
someone found her. That four-year-old child will have to spend the 
rest of her life with one leg. Imagine the tragedy. That tragedy 
happens 500 times every week. It happens in those countries which 
are least able to deal with it.
<P>
	When my wife and I toured the refugee camps on the 
Thailand-Burma border we went to a clinic which is partly funded 
by the Canadian government. This clinic is in an old barn which has 
been converted into a hospital. It was not a hospital in the sense of 
what we are accustomed to. It was just a broken down building 
which had been put together. Normally it would hold ten patients. 
There were 100 people in that hospital.
<P>
	Our memories are very vivid. We met a 21-year-old Burmese 
student. Due to a land mine both of his arms had been blown off 
and he had no vision. It made me feel good that as a member of 
Parliament I was able to, in a very small way, help to bring this 
issue before the international community. Canada has a very 
important role to play in this regard. It has taken a leadership role.
<P>
	A conference was held in Canada. We tried to bring those 
countries who are like minded together. It is not  easy to get the 
international community to agree to something. One thing that I 
have learned as a member of Parliament is that Canada is very well 
respected by the international community. It is well known that 
Canada will take a leadership role on very important issues. It will 
be able to get those countries together but we have to do the 
groundwork. We have to get those countries together and ensure 
that we do our homework to get this done. There will be countries 
that will say they do not need it because they will ensure there are 
regulations so that the mines are not laid indiscriminately and it 
will be okay to do. However, the reality is that it is not true.
<P>
<B>(1350)</B>
<P>
	We are losing the battle. If we were to remove every one of the 
anti-personnel land mines presently on the ground it would take us 
2,000 years at today's rate. However, two to five million mines are 
being laid in the ground each year. It is a real tragedy.
<P>
	I know my time is limited so I will conclude. It is up to the 
members not only in this House but around the world to come 
together and say that as members of Parliament, as people we want 
to make sure that we correct this problem.
<P>
	I want to thank the hon. member from Esquimalt for bringing 
this forward. He can count on my support to continue to work in the 
international forums. Canada is willing to go along with it but we 
need all the other countries in the world to come on board. We need 
to concentrate on the international forums and put this debate 
forward. When we win the support of all the other politicians 
around the world then we will be able to deal with this issue. I am 
sure we can be successful in working together on this issue.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
sometimes in this House a very special thing happens and that is a 
feeling of unanimity about a particular issue. This is certainly one 
of them.
<P>
	I would like to commend my colleague, the member for 
Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca. Within all of our lives there are defining 
events. Clearly this has happened in the life of my colleague where 
he has been involved in this issue at a very personal level.
<P>
	With your indulgence, Mr. Speaker, I would like to read a 
column he had written that appeared in the <I>Financial Post</I> on 
Tuesday, May 21, 1996. He writes:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>For those who survive, the horror often begins with an ominous click as the 
detonator is triggered. It is followed by a deafening roar and having your body 
catapulted through the air. The result is either death, or a life of destitution in a 
developing country where people who are disabled occupy the lowest social rung in 
a land of poverty and despair.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In January 1992, Tomas Chiluba was a strong and fit 18-year-old Mozambican 
fleeing his country, a land wracked by 15 years of civil war. Just before arriving at the 
South African border and the hope of a new and better life, Tomas heard that fateful 
click. He was dragged into the hospital 18 hours later. The  explosion had torn into his 
legs, ripping the flesh off his left leg, while shattering the bones and sending mine 
fragments and bone shards into his right leg. For the next three hours we amputated his 
left leg above the knee and tried, as best we could, to remove dead tissue, dirt and mine 
fragments from the good leg in the hope of salvaging it. Thousands of times each year, 
far from the prying eyes of the world community, this tragic scenario is played out.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<B><A NAME="6927"> 6927 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The international community convened in Geneva earlier this month-</BLOCKQUOTE>
-that was in May of this year-
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-to deal with this silent menace. Sadly, only marginal progress was made with 
calls for the use of ``smart'' mines (a real oxymoron) that self-destruct only 90% 
of the time, and the prohibition of plastic anti-personnel mines. Canada called for 
an international ban but refused to do the same domestically citing that land mines 
are essential to our troops in the field. However, this argument has been 
effectively dispelled by a number of studies, the latest by the International 
Committee of the Red Cross. The time has now come for our country to take a 
stand. We have significant moral suasion in the international community and it is 
time we took a leadership role by banning their production and use in Canada. 
This will send a clear message for other countries to follow suit.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Land mines have been with us for decades and have become a long lasting and 
lethal by-product of war. Sixty-nine countries harbour over 100 million of them in 
their soil, their precise location unknown. Indiscriminately seeded over large 
areas, they can be active for over 50 years.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Many of the anti-personnel devices are made of plastic and are usually targeted 
against innocent civilians. Some are even designed to look like toys so children 
will pick them up, play with them, and have their arms blown off. They are not 
meant to kill, but to maim, the perverted logic being that a disabled person will be 
a continuous drain on society and therefore more costly than someone who is 
dead. The toll in human suffering they have exacted around the world is 
enormous. In Cambodia, one out of every 260 people are amputees and in Angola 
it is one in every 470 people.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Over 40 countries manufacture over 300 different types of mines at a cost ranging 
from $3 to $70. They include such nations as Italy, Sweden, Canada and 
paradoxically every permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. 
The company names run like a who's who on the Fortune 500 and includes such 
notables as Daimler-Benz and Motorola. Even in Canada, SNC Industrial 
Technologies in Quebec makes the C3A2 land mine, dubbed, ``little Elsie''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Although mines are cheap to produce, their removal is extremely costly and 
dangerous. The worldwide bill for demining is a staggering $85 billion. Who will 
pay for this? Last year, 85,000 mines were removed worldwide at a cost of $70 
million. However, at the same time two million mines were widely and 
indiscriminately seeded. Thus, despite our efforts, we are losing the battle.</BLOCKQUOTE>
Above and beyond the ruined lives and huge demining costs that mines cause is their 
devastating effect on an economy as they render huge tracts of land unusable for 
decades. This is particularly sad since those countries that are mined tend to be the 
poorest, and have been decimated by years of civil conflict. Their starving 
populations, desperately in need of the land to feed themselves, cannot because of 
the risk of stepping on a  mine. The world community recognizes this silent menace 
but must now organize itself to do something about it.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>For the sake of Thomas Chiluba and thousands of others like him, it is imperative 
that we eliminate the use of land mines and anti-personnel devices worldwide. To 
not do so will commit thousands of young people to a life of disability, leaving a 
lethal legacy in impoverished countries already devastated by war. Banning them 
is our only option.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1355)</B>
<P>
	Those are the words of my colleague from Esquimalt-Juan de 
Fuca. He has proposed in Bill C-232 a very small step toward the 
objective of reducing and finally banning land mines. I think that 
his bill makes a lot of sense from the perspective that it is not 
grandiose. It does not say anything about our country as a country. 
It does not say anything about armed personnel. It does not say 
anything about armament in bases around the world. But what it 
does say is that:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Every person commits an offence who sells, offers for sale, gives, barters or 
exports</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(a) a mine; or</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(b) an object or device that the person, on reasonable grounds, believes</BLOCKQUOTE>
(i) is designed exclusively for use in the manufacture of or assembly into a 
mine, or
<P>
(ii) will be used in the manufacture of or assembly into a mine.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(2) subject to subsection (3), every person commits an offence who purchases, 
possesses, manufactures, assembles or imports a mine or an object or device referred 
to in paragraph 1(b) above.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The bill makes sense in that it talks about putting this into the 
Criminal Code so that we at least take one small baby step, on 
whole legs, toward the objectives that we have of seeing land mines 
banned.
<P>
	Once again I would ask for unanimous consent of the House that 
Bill C-252 be sent to committee at this time.

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="QUESTIONPERIOD">QUESTION PERIOD</A></H4>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I want to raise a brief point of order of which I have just given you 
notice. The point of order is for the purpose of allowing me to make 
a correction to today's <I>Hansard</I>. I would have raised this earlier but 
this matter has just been brought to my attention.
<P>
	During today's question period I answered a question in part as 
follows: ``Mr. Speaker, Olson is not personally in possession of any 
of the videotapes in question. Second of all, the lawyer in question 
is in possession of five of them. He has previously undertaken  not 
to make them public, but in any event I am advised that legal action 
is being undertaken on behalf of the crown to regain possession of 
the tapes from Olson''.
<P>
	It is clear from the context here that I was referring to Olson's 
lawyer. As I say, it was just brought to my attention that I ended a 
sentence with the word Olson, creating an apparent contradiction 
with what I said at the beginning of my answer. I wish to confirm 
that I was referring to Olson's lawyer when I said that legal action 
is being undertaken on behalf of the crown to regain possession of 
certain tapes.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-252, 
an act to amend the Criminal Code (mines), be read the second time 
and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Colleagues, I have a request that the member for 
Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca be given a few seconds to wrap up. I see 
by the clock there are only a few seconds remaining. Rather than go 
into a full debate I am going to give the member for 
Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca the remaining time to wrap this up.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, thank you for your consideration.
<P>

<P>
	I would like to thank my colleagues for Mississauga West, 
Vancouver South, Kootenay East and 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup for their kind and heartfelt 
interventions on this enormous humanitarian issue.
<P>
	In closing, I would just like to say to every member in the House 
that as has been mentioned passionately by the members here from 
across party lines, this issue is one of non-partisanship. It is an 
issue of basic humanitarianism. It is an issue that we as Canadians 
stand for as part of our soul in being fair and equitable people who 
want to do the right thing and fight for those who are most 
dispossessed in the world.
<P>
	I hope the government will bring forward a bill forthwith on this 
issue calling for Canada to play a leadership role in banning 
anti-personnel land mines.
<P>
	I ask once again that the House make my Bill C-252 votable.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Does the hon. member have permission to put the 
motion to the floor?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> There is not permission.
<P>
	The time provided for the consideration of Private Members' 
Business has now expired. Accordingly the order is dropped from 
the Order Paper.
<P>
	It being 2.05 p.m., the House stands adjourned until 11 a.m. on 
Monday.
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 2.03 p.m.)
<P>
