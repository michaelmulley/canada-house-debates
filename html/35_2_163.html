	<B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Waterloo, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have the 
honour to present, in both official languages, the 13th report of the 
Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs.
<P>
	I present this report with pride. The foundation of any 
democratic society is its laws. As a democratic society we are 
striving for justice.
<P>
	In particular I appreciate this since I came to this country as a 
refugee from a country which did not have a just legal system.
<P>
	The report is entitled ``Renewing Youth Justice''. The report 
deals with proposed amendments to the Young Offenders Act. The 
report is a product of a cross-country tour by the justice committee 
and of  representations made to the justice committee from all 
segments of Canadian society.
<P>
<B>(1010 )</B>
<P>
	One of the driving forces behind the report is that we incarcerate 
way too many young people in institutions across this country. We 
incarcerate 10 times as many young people as Europe, 15 times as 
many as Australia and New Zealand. As I studied the information 
before us I was shocked to find that we incarcerate twice as many 
young people as the United States.
<P>
	Some adjustments must be made on the other side as well. We 
have to respond to and be involved with the community. 
Recommendation number four speaks specifically to that. It states 
that there should be community crime and justice councils, that the 
community should be involved at the grassroots level.
<P>
	I am proud to present this report on behalf of the justice 
committee.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I want to point out that the Bloc Quebecois produced a 
dissenting report for a good reason. After this cross country tour, as 
the hon. member said, and after investing tens of thousands of 
dollars in this study, the Liberals apparently gave the impression, 
after considering how Quebec treated its young offenders, that they 
would support an approach that was proposed by Quebec in the 
sixties and would fully support the demands of the Bloc Quebecois, 
demands which simply reflected the wishes of all Quebecers.
<P>
	Instead, at the very last minute, the Liberals preferred to pay lip 
service to certain principles and make recommendations that were 
more like campaign promises, in an attempt to satisfy part of the 
electorate in English Canada. One thing I cannot tolerate is that the 
government made a concession on the minimum age of young 
offenders by lowering it to 10 and 11, with the agreement of the 
attorney general. It is up to the government to set standards and 
pass legislation that is enforced across Canada. If it does not want 
to do so, it should get out of this area and hand it over to Quebec, 
which is what we want, or the other provinces.
<P>
	However, as long as we have a Constitution and certain rules, the 
government has an obligation to pass legislation on young 
offenders that will be enforced uniformly across this country.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10142"> 10142 </A></B>
<P>
	By the way, some Liberals told me I was a whiner because I 
was proposing recommendations that reflected Quebec's historic 
demands regarding this issue. That is one of the reasons why I 
decided to produce a minority report. The government would not 
listen.
<P>
	As far as age is concerned, I do not think the age should be 
lowered this way, even with the consent of the attorneys general of 
the provinces. In Quebec, attorneys general will certainly not agree 
to lower the age and make 10 and 11 year-olds stand trial. In 
Western Canada people may think differently, but I think this is 
unacceptable.
<P>
	As far as cost sharing is concerned, one of Quebec's demands 
which has been on the desk of the Minister of Justice for many 
months and many years, is the $77 million it costs Quebec because 
we properly enforce the Young Offenders Act. Before the 
government makes recommendations as it has done in the majority 
report, I think it should pay what it owes Quebec and write a 
cheque for $77 million. But we can get back to that during the 
election campaign.
<P>
	My third item is the federal government's tendency to intrude in 
a number of areas where it has no business to be. It is not up to the 
federal government to tell the provinces what to do with the money 
it pays them for the administration of justice. This is a provincial 
matter, and in this case, it is up to Quebec.
<P>
	I realize that members from English Canada do not like listening 
to what I have to say, but I say it with all the facts in hand, and I 
have the satisfaction of having done my duty.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="GOVERNMENTOPERATIONS">GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. EugÃ¨ne Bellemare (Carleton-Gloucester, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as Vice-Chair of the Standing Committee on Government 
Operations, I have the honour to present, in both official languages, 
the third report of the Standing Committee on Government 
Operations on public service renewal.
<P>
<B>(1015)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The committee has closely monitored the renewal process in the 
public service and has made a number of recommendations aiming 
to ensure that the public service is supported in a way to ensure 
renewal, the relÃ¨ve initiative, improve accountability and 
transparency and that other key initiatives be implemented so that 
the public service may continue to serve Canadians with pride and 
efficiency.
<P>
	On a personal note, I am proud to be serving my riding and to be 
representing on many occasions in Parliament the interests of the 
public servants. I salute our public service.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Pursuant to Standing Order 109, the committee requests that the 
government table a comprehensive response.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, a 
dissenting opinion on public service renewal is appended to the 
report by the Standing Committee on Government Operations.
<P>
	The Liberal majority report indicates the need for public service 
renewal, particularly since 70 per cent of all public service 
executives will be eligible for retirement within the next eight 
years. In 1996, only 1 per cent of staff were under the age of 25, 
compared to 15 per cent in 1976.
<P>
	The Liberals could have continued in the same vein and 
reminded people that, during their mandate, the government has 
made drastic cuts to the public service in the past three years. It was 
not smart enough to be concerned with ensuring the transmission of 
knowledge and the retention of the collective memory within the 
departments. This unfortunate state of affairs is, in large part, 
nothing more than the outcome of poor strategic decisions by the 
Liberals during their mandate, which thankfully is coming to an 
end.
<P>
	As for the question of the under-representation of young people 
within the public service, we again note the incompetency and 
shortsightedness of successive federal governments, from Pierre 
Elliott Trudeau's first government right down to that of the present 
Prime Minister. With the calling of the election only hours away, 
the Liberals are feeling a sudden need to act.
<P>
	The young people of the Outaouais region have borne the burden 
of this, no doubt about it. After three and a half years of Liberal 
indifference, they now have trouble believing that this same 
government has taken a sudden interest in them. When the Liberals 
came to power in October 1993, the unemployment level in the 
Outaouais for those under the age of 25, was 20.6 per cent; it has 
now risen to 21.6 per cent. The Liberal report insists on finding 
excuses for the way the federal government has treated young 
people in the difficult cuts it has had to make.
<P>
	According to the government, by 1998-99 the program review 
will have had the effect of reducing program expenditures, and the 
size of the federal administration, by 22 per cent. It is, moreover, 
estimated that, after 1999, the government will save more than $3 
billion yearly in salaries. What the Liberal report has forgotten to 
mention is that, in the meantime, the provinces have been forced, 
because of the cuts in social transfers, to reduce staff by more than 
25 per cent in the areas of health, education and social services.

	<B>Ms. Albina Guarnieri (Mississauga East, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have the honour to present, in both official languages, the third 
report of the Joint Standing Committee on Official Languages on 
the application of the Official Languages Act in the national capital 
region.
<P>
	Pursuant to Standing Order 109, we request a comprehensive 
response from the government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the report 
tabled by the Chair of the Joint Standing Committee on Official 
Languages fails unfortunately to mention the considerable 
anglicization of francophones in the City of Ottawa. In the past 20 
years or so, the figure has increased from 17 to 28 per cent.
<P>
	Accordingly, in the light of these statistics, the Bloc Quebecois 
tabled a dissenting report criticizing the fact that the committee 
tried to hide the fact that Ottawa, Canada's capital, is becoming 
English and anglicizing francophones at an alarming rate. 
Unfortunately, the report looks more at the national capital region, 
including the Outaouais. Its recommendations tend in my opinion 
to anglicize francophone Outaouais.
<P>
	For this reason, the Bloc Quebecois has tabled a minority report.

	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> moved for 
leave to introduce Bill C-438, an act to amend the Insurance 
Companies Act.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to table this bill, seconded by 
my colleague from Portneuf. The bill aims at essentially one thing: 
to eliminate the discrimination against provincially chartered 
insurance companies in Quebec, which prevents them from 
acquiring blocks of insurance from federally chartered insurance 
companies in order to strengthen the industry and meet the 
challenge of domestic and foreign competition.
<P>
	It is truly a case of discrimination against Quebec, since, barely 
two weeks ago, two Toronto companies, one a British, the other a 
German subsidiary, were able to arrange a deal between themselves 
involving 12 billion blocks of insurance without a peep or the 
batting of an eye from the federal government.
<P>
	A Quebec company, L'Entraide Compagnie d'assurances, since 
we are talking specifics, lost out on a transaction involving 1.3 
million insurance policies because of this government and the 
Minister of Finance's inertia and lack of political will when it 
comes to defending Quebec's interests. This transaction would 
have allowed this company to compete with the four major players 
in Toronto.
<P>
	We deplore the decision by the Minister of Finance, who has 
arranged it so the four Toronto insurance companies will dominate 
the Canadian market and part of the North American market, while 
the Quebec companies are left high and dry thanks to the Minister 
of Finance and the Liberal Party of Canada. We will remember this 
in the election campaign.

	<B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is with emotion and hope that I lay before this House 
today a petition signed by more than 37,000 people from Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1030)</B>
<P>
	This petition strikes a chord with everyone, since it concerns the 
sexual abuse of children. The petitioners ask Parliament among 
other things to review and assess the treatments offered to abusers 
serving their sentences, and to ensure that support is available to 
sexually abused children and their families.
<P>
	Violence against children is certainly a significant indication of 
how healthy society is. We must give ourselves all the tools we 
need to provide adequate assistance to the victims and their 
families, and to promote the rehabilitation of those convicted of 
sexually abusing children. The challenge is as huge as the problem. 
I think that, by making wise decisions, this Parliament can help 
reduce violence and its devastating consequences.

	<B>Mr. Bill Graham (Rosedale, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to rise in the House today to present this petition on the national 
AIDS strategy on behalf of hundreds of concerned citizens in my 
riding.
<P>
	The national AIDS strategy is a vital project that co-ordinates 
Canada's efforts to finance HIV-AIDS education and prevention, to 
support HIV-AIDS research and to provide care for those affected 
by AIDS.
<P>
	My constituents are therefore calling upon Parliament to ensure 
that the national AIDS strategy does not sunset in March 1998 and 
that it will continue to fund these very important projects.

	<B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Lachine-Lac-Saint-Louis, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have the honour of presenting a petition from several 
electors of my riding and adjoining regions.
<P>
	The petitioners pray that the Prime Minister and the Parliament 
of Canada declare and confirm immediately: first, that Canada is 
indivisible; second, that the boundaries of Canada, its provinces, 
territories and territorial waters may be modified only by (a) a free 
vote of all Canadian citizens as guaranteed by the Canadian Charter 
of Rights and Freedoms, or (b) through the amending formula as

Speaker, I have a number of petitions from constituents in the 
riding of Kootenay West-Revelstoke and the new area of West 
Kootenay-Okanagan.
<P>
	The petitioners state that they are concerned about the 
sustainability of the Canada pension plan, that young people are 
forced to pay higher premiums for smaller pensions and that the 
recent $10 billion premium increase reduces take home pay. Since 
it cannot be sufficiently demonstrated that perpetually increasing 
CPP premiums while continually reducing benefits will salvage the 
CPP, your petitioners pray that Parliament enact legislation to wind 
down the CPP while protecting the pension of current seniors and 
that Canadians contribute to mandatory RRSPs of their own 
choosing.

	The petitioners draw to the attention of the House that Canada's 
seniors have contributed a great deal to this country's political

development, economic growth and sustained prosperity within the 
20th century. These citizens have protected Canada's tradition of 
democracy  and individual freedom through two wars and through 
a variety of international peacekeeping endeavours.

these accomplishments and sacrifices by not seeking to reform 
Canada's national medicare or pension programs in any way that 
would reduce benefits for senior citizens living on limited or fixed 
incomes.

the House that as of October 1996 the German delegation to the 
World Health Organization Codex Committee on Nutrition and 
Foods for Special Dietary Uses has proposed legislation. We are 
well aware of the legislation, therefore I will not go through it. The 
petitioners state that these proposals if accepted will lead to drastic 
changes in legislation.

	The petitioners state that Canada was founded on principles 
which recognize the importance of marriage and family to society. 
The petitioners request the House of Commons to enact legislation 
or amend existing legislation to define marriage as a voluntary

	<B>Mr. Rex Crawford (Kent, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in the second

per cent of the national highway system is substandard and that 
Mexico and the United States are upgrading their national highway 
systems. The national highway policy study identified job creation, 
economic development, national unity, saving lives and avoiding 
injuries, lower congestion, lower vehicle operating costs and better 
international competitiveness as benefits of the proposed national 
highway program.

<P>

	The first petition is signed by 259 residents of Williams Lake

<P>
	On November 12, 1996 in British Columbia the hon. Judge 
Harry Boyle sentenced Darren Adam Ursel to two years less a day 
to be served in the community under section 742 of the Criminal

<P>
	In June 1996 the Prime Minister of Canada announced that he 
would work toward diverting the Sable Island gas pipeline to 
Quebec City. It is unacceptable for the Prime Minister to decide the 
destination of Nova Scotia's natural gas without consulting Nova 
Scotians. Therefore, Nova Scotians assert their right to control the 
destination of Sable Island gas and demand that the federal 
government cease tampering with this issue.

<P>
	In the first one the petitioners draw to the attention of the House 
that our police officers and firefighters place their lives at risk on a 
daily basis as they serve the emergency needs of all Canadians. 
They also state that in many cases the families of police officers 
and firefighters killed in the line of duty are often left without 
sufficient financial means to meet their obligations.

of alcoholic beverages may cause health problems or impair one's 
ability and specifically, that fetal alcohol syndrome or other 
alcohol related birth defects are 100 per cent preventable by 
avoiding alcohol consumption during pregnancy. The petitioners 
therefore pray and call upon Parliament to enact legislation to

<P>
	They are concerned about sexual predators. This came about

	He said: Mr. Speaker, we are at report stage of Bill C-72. Clearly 
it is impossible for the bill to pass. Even if the Prime Minister 
chickens out at the last minute and does not call an election, it will 
be very difficult for the bill to pass.
<P>
	I will refer to the history in brief of Bill C-72. After the election 
in October 1993 there was division on the prairies over how wheat 
and barley should be marketed. The minister was very tardy in 
taking action. Finally in 1995 he initiated the western grain 
marketing panel. It brought a report back on proposed changes to 
the Canadian Wheat Board in the middle of 1996.
<P>
	The minister was not happy with the western grain marketing 
panel report. It called for more consultation and a letter writing 
campaign. It was not until December 1996, more than three years 
after the minister was first elected, that he introduced legislation in 
the House.
<P>
	The bill was given first reading in December 1996 but was not 
referred to the committee until late February or early March. Then 
there were some whirlwind hearings across the prairies and in the 
third week of March the government only allowed three days of 
clause by clause discussion.
<P>
	Finally here we are on probably the second last sitting day before 
the House is prorogued and we are at report stage. Yet to occur is 
third reading and passage by the Senate. Clearly the House would 
have to sit for several more weeks if Bill C-72 were to have the 
slightest chance of seeing the light of day.
<P>
	I want to make clear that the bill is a haywire and bailer twine 
attempt to reform a terribly outdated Canadian Wheat Board. The 
Liberals, in drafting the bill, have failed to heed the advice of the 
industry. They have refused to honestly debate good amendments 
put forward by Reform in committee. These amendments are 
supported by a broad range of farm organizations and by a majority 
of farmers on the prairies.
<P>
	The Liberals have left no choice for Reform but to oppose the 
bill. We do not want it to pass because we do not want to further 
disappoint farmers who have been betrayed many times by Liberal 
and Tory governments.
<P>
	We oppose the bill and we will vote against it, but that is not the 
reason it will not pass in the 35th Parliament. The real reason it will 
die on the Order Paper is that the Liberals and the minister of 
agriculture know it is a third rate bill. They are afraid to pass it and 
let farmers experience how terrible it really is.
<P>
	The Liberals could have passed Bill C-72 if they really wanted 
to. I am rather astounded that the minister of agriculture has been 
publicly saying the opposition has  held up Bill C-72. We know 
very well in this Liberal majority Parliament the Liberals pass 
whatever they darn well feel like passing. They set the agenda. 
They place Government Orders. They use time allocation far too 
often and they use closure. For the minister to blame the opposition 
for not allowing Bill C-72 to pass is beyond stupidity and lying. It 
extends to the realm of desperation and bizarreness in the extreme.
<P>
<B>(1055)</B>
<P>
	Let us examine the bill even though it will not pass. Clause 2 
says the bill will be binding on all provinces. We asked the 
ministers of agriculture of the provinces of Manitoba and Alberta if 
they had been consulted on clause 2, the clause we are debating in 
this group of amendments to Bill C-72. Both ministers of 
agriculture said there had been absolutely no consultation with the 
provinces on clause 2.
<P>
	Clause 10 and other clauses in the bill give the minister an 
ironclad grip on the board. All the discussions across the prairies 
were to make the board more accountable to farmers and more in 
the control or in the hands of farmers. The bill fails miserably in 
accomplishing that. I believe Bill C-72 gives the minister more 
control over the Canadian Wheat Board than he currently has.
<P>
	The minister's actions and words clearly say he does not trust 
prairie farmers to manage their own Canadian Wheat Board. 
Therefore let us see what powers the minister clutches to himself. 
The minister will choose the CEO or president of the board over the 
heads of the board of directors, even though some of the board of 
directors are elected by farmers. The minister will place the CEO 
on the board of directors as a voting member, placing him or her in 
a powerful conflict of interest position.
<P>
	Time after time we heard representation from farm groups that 
the CEO of the board should be chosen by the board and should be 
accountable and responsible to the board, that the board should hire 
him or her, that the board should set that person's salary and that 
the board should terminate the CEO's employment on the board if 
it felt that were proper.
<P>
	The minister has the power to choose the interim board of 
directors in its entirety and to tell it how to chose its successors. 
This is not democracy. This is Liberal arrogance at its finest. It is 
all pretty cushy.
<P>
	The minister and his appointees lay all the plans for a partially 
elected board. It reminds me of Liberal MPs establishing their own 
fat cat pensions. If they call the rules, if they make the decisions, 
farmers are left on the sidelines watching to see what kind of a 
board will unfold, who the directors on the board will be and what 
kind of rules, guidelines and bylaws will be put in place for the 
further election and appointment of future directors to the board.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10150"> 10150 </A></B>
<P>
	Even more disturbing is the fact the minister can dismiss 
directors and employees if they are not serving the best interest 
of the corporation in the opinion of the minister. Farmers who pay 
for the board are left out in this case. It seems odd employees can 
be dismissed in the best interest of the corporation, not in the best 
interest of farmers. Therefore farmers have their hands tied behind 
their backs. They are not able to adequately make and press for 
changes in the board as they see fit.
<P>
	The minister refuses to bend on the request of farmers for a 
voluntary board even for barley. There is a consensus. Poll after 
poll indicated the majority of prairie barley producers want a 
voluntary Canadian Wheat Board even for organic wheat. We heard 
many organic growers and their associations suggest the Canadian 
Wheat Board was not the best marketing agency to effectively 
market organic products.
<P>
	The minister went against the recommendations of his own 
western grain marketing panel in denying the ability of the board, 
at least in a small way, to become a voluntary marketing agency for 
some products best marketed through other avenues than through 
the Canadian Wheat Board.
<P>
	The minister moved in this direction against the wishes of 
farmers and according to his own Angus Reid poll which indicated 
a majority of barley producers called for a volunteer Canadian 
Wheat Board. Furthermore, the minister will allow the Canadian 
Wheat Board to make cash purchases in a monolithic environment 
where livestock producers can be destroyed by artificial feed prices 
and international retaliation for unfair trading practices. We heard 
this as we travelled across the prairies. The minister has done 
nothing to correct this problem in the government amendments to 
the bill at committee.
<P>
<B>(1100 )</B>
<P>
	The government is prepared to add crops to the monopoly. This 
measure would not go over very well with farmers. In fact, if a few 
farmers are crossing the border now, if crops such as canola were 
added to the monopoly powers of the Canadian Wheat Board, I 
suggest there would be a civil war on the prairies rather than a few 
farmers taking truckloads across the border to the U.S. in protest.
<P>
	Obviously the minister does not understand the needs and wishes 
of the majority of prairie producers.
<P>
	The minister is acting like the captain of the Titanic, so arrogant 
as he blindly steams toward the icebergs. His record on the Crow 
rate is pathetic. His record on grain transportation is tragic. His 
record on the Canadian Wheat Board is dismal and dangerous. He 
is responsible for his lack of action over three and a half years. He 
is responsible for the division over the Canadian Wheat Board on 
the prairies. He is responsible for this comedy of errors entitled Bill 
C-72.
<P>
	Reform has called for constructive changes to the Canadian 
Wheat Board. Our vision for the Canadian Wheat Board would not 
only give it a fighting chance, it would give it good odds of being a 
first class, farmer controlled marketer with a great chance to be a 
success story in the 21st century.
<P>
	The truth is that our opposition in the next election campaign 
will be the Liberals and the NDP suggesting that Reform is trying 
to destroy the board. That is not true, as are their allegations that we 
would hurt medicare and seniors pensions. We have shown in our 
fresh start document that they are wrong on medicare, health care 
and seniors pensions. They are also wrong on the Canadian Wheat 
Board.
<P>
	Ours are the only proposals that will bring peace to a very 
divided farm community. Ours are the only proposals that will 
ensure the viability of the board in the future in a climate where 
farmers want to market through the board rather than have to 
market through the board, such as members opposite are proposing.
<P>
	This bill cannot possibly pass through the House of Commons. 
This is a matter of each party's putting its position on the record, 
and I thank the House for the opportunity.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy ChrÃ©tien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
very pleased to take part in the debate on Bill C-72, an act to amend 
the Canadian Wheat Board Act, commonly referred to as the CWB.
<P>
	It is important to look at this bill in the current context, but it is 
also appropriate to go back in time and look at the historical 
context. When the government created the Canadian Wheat Board, 
Canada, like every other country in the world, was going through a 
major economic crisis. It was in the 1930s, more than 65 years ago, 
that the federal government established the Canadian Wheat Board. 
At the time, there was widespread famine, and men and women 
often worked just to put food on the table. Some people starved 
during this period called the Great Depression.
<P>
	Western farmers had great difficulties making ends meet. They 
were often stuck with their crop, because they could not sell it at a 
fair price. The government, like a good father, created the Canadian 
Wheat Board and gave it a monopoly. All the grain had to go 
through the CWB.
<P>
	At the time, the creation and the existence of the Canadian 
Wheat Board seemed justified. It would still be justified today were 
it not for the fact that, over the years, the government lost touch 
with the grassroots. This is especially true of the current Liberal 
government, which is totally out of touch with the grassroots. It 
seems this government only listens to financial interests, to those 
who contribute to its campaign fund.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10151"> 10151 </A></B>
<P>
	Western farmers are very upset. Earlier, I was listening to the 
Reform Party member who said: ``If you want war in western 
Canada, you will get it with grain producers because they are so 
upset''.
<P>
<B>(1105)</B>
<P>
	I think he exaggerated. There will not be war, well maybe a 
verbal one, but that will not be all that bad. I can tell you that, of all 
the amendments and proposals we put forward in the Standing 
Committee on Agriculture, very few were approved, although 
some of our motions were very interesting, but the Liberals, with 
one exception, after consulting the great one himself, the minister 
that is, turned around 48 hours later and passed the motion 
requiring the election of 10 farmers, and 10 was the number put 
into the bill.
<P>
	Sixty years ago, there was a need for the Canadian Wheat Board. 
I think there still is today, but the government should wake up and 
make some changes. A good number of motions have been 
introduced, and it could accept a few of them.
<P>
	It should also be remembered that the Canadian Wheat Board 
has a monopoly, in the sense that a grain producer living on the 
border with the United States would not have the right, nor did he 
before, to sell his crop or a part of it for more than his American 
neighbours.
<P>
	The Canadian Wheat Board undertakes to buy wheat and barley 
from any registered grain producer and is expected, obviously, to 
get the highest price possible, domestically or abroad, for this 
wheat and barley.
<P>
	All wheat and barley for human consumption must go through 
the Canadian Wheat Board. Even in Quebec, if you need an amount 
of wheat for human consumption, not for feed, you must go 
through the Canadian Wheat Board.
<P>
	There will be 15 on the board of directors. That is already an 
advantage. Before, with four or five, there were always one or two 
that had to be reappointed. But the Canadian Wheat Board has 
often been directed by three people. Now, there will be 15, 10 of 
them because of the efforts of the opposition, of the Bloc 
Quebecois, with the support of the Reform Party. Our Liberal 
friends did not want to include this in the bill so, after 48 hours of 
consideration, they consulted the great one himself, who said: ``All 
right, the west is making such a fuss that we will give them 10''.
<P>
	I myself would have preferred to see 12, of course, as the Reform 
Party would have, but the Liberals wanted to hang on to the 
possibility of rewarding the faithful, because the five others will be 
appointed by the governor general in council. Although the 
parliamentary secretary to the agriculture minister was naturally 
not too happy about it, I asked senior officials: ``Would you tell us 
the salaries of those now sitting on the Canadian Wheat  Board?''. 
At this point, I would urge all my colleagues in the House to listen 
very carefully.
<P>
	Did you know, Mr. Speaker, that the president of the Canadian 
Wheat Board earns quite a bit more than you do, even though he 
does not have to go to the polls? His salary ranges from $115,000 to 
$144,000. I guarantee you, and you can check this out, that the 
incumbent is not a Conservative, but a Liberal. His assistant earns 
between $110,000 and $129,000, as do the commissioners. Indeed, 
it is often a choice spot to dump a member in order to vacate a 
riding, as will be done in the coming weeks and days, after the 
Prime Minister calls an election on Sunday.
<P>
<B>(1110)</B>
<P>
	Someday perhaps the hon. member for Malpeque will be sitting 
on one of these commissions, earning $144,000 a year, without 
going to the people, because he knows full well that there is a 
Conservative wind, and a very strong one at that, blowing on Prince 
Edward Island. He might be tempted to take a job like that.
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary is smiling; I know he once 
condemned such appointments, but that is what political patronage 
is all about. That is why we in the Bloc Quebecois have always 
denounced, and quite vigorously so, these appointments.
<P>
	Do you know who the chair of the employment insurance board 
of referees in my riding is?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>Mr. ChrÃ©tien (Frontenac):</B> The sister of the Liberal candidate 
in Frontenac-MÃ©gantic.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. ChrÃ©tien (Frontenac):</B> She is a fine young lady, who was 
recently appointed through the good offices of this government. 
But the essential qualification, if I may use that word, is to be a 
Liberal.
<P>
	Another problem with the blueprint for change to the Canadian 
Wheat Board is that it applies to all the provinces. And the hon. 
member for Malpeque supported this, knowing full well that Prince 
Edward Island produces potatoes rather than wheat or barley. When 
I asked the secretary of state whether he could promise that 25 per 
cent of wheat board members would come from Quebec, he said: 
``That is out of the question. You grow hardly any wheat and barley 
in Quebec''. Why include us on the board if basically there are only 
three provinces, plus a small portion of British Columbia-say 
three and a half provinces-where a serious effort is made to mass 
produce wheat and barley?
<P>
	We have submitted, and I will conclude on this, very positive 
amendments to improve the Canadian Wheat Board Act, not to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10152"> 10152 </A></B>
<P>
give satisfaction to Liberal politicians but to please western grain 
producers. Incidentally, the number of elected representatives was 
finally set at 10. I should remind the House however that the chief  
executive officer, the real boss of the Canadian Wheat board, will 
be appointed by the government, and that I will not stand for.
<P>
	Therefore, while supporting the first group of motions put 
forward by the Reform Party, the official opposition will be voting 
against Bill C-72 as a whole.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jerry Pickard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I find this debate 
a little questionable. I am hearing a debate not with regard to the 
merit of the bill or the consultation that has gone on or the efforts 
that have been put forward to make sure that everyone involved has 
had their voice heard; I am hearing mud slinging on a grandiose 
scale. Maybe that is because the election is coming up.
<P>
	I heard the Reform member a few moments ago suggest fresh 
start. Reform members told us when they came to the House of 
Commons that they were going to work in some reasonable 
fashion, bring their points forward and debate issues on merit. 
However, that is the last thing they have seemed to do in the last 
year. It has really been sad the way they have attacked and carried 
out arguments which may be politically motivated. The reality is 
there was major concern about the administration and governance 
of the Canadian Wheat Board and changes had to be made within 
the wheat board act.
<P>
	There is no question that we set out to have hearings across the 
prairies to make sure that hundreds of organizations and 
individuals with concerns were able to come forth to the prairie 
panel that was structured to go across the prairies, listen to 
concerns, listen to everyone's input, give every organization an 
input so that we would have a pretty clear picture of what those 
governance changes should be and what changes should occur 
within the act. The minister then decided that he would structure 
the recommendations, listen to what people had to say and give the 
public a chance to respond again. The next step in the process was 
to take the recommendations of the panel and give the public an 
opportunity to respond.
<P>
<B>(1115)</B>
<P>
	These measures take time. That is why the minister has not 
jumped into the frying pan. He has looked at the concerns 
expressed to him, dealt with them carefully and formulated a very 
good package. In this way the whole structure of the wheat board is 
dealt with in a very appropriate way in accordance with the 
testimony brought to the grain panel. That was put into a bill which 
the agriculture committee of the House took across the prairies, 
listening to the concerns of witnesses in Alberta, the Peace valley, 
Saskatchewan, Manitoba, as well as every major organization in 
Ottawa. The committee  really did an important job of consultation 
and listening to the concerns of interested groups.
<P>
	At that time the government brought forward several 
amendments to take into consideration all of the issues that had 
been raised by individuals as well as larger organizations. All were 
dealt with. Quite frankly, to go through a process where 7, 8, 10, 12 
months are used to listen to people and get their concerns on record 
and then formulate a bill is a daunting task. I was very disappointed 
when in committee to hear the opposition attack officials who had 
rigorously worked to formulate the ideas. Did they attack the 
merits of what was being proposed? No. They just did not like it.
<P>
	I am certain that no matter what was put forward, the Reform 
Party would have been against it. That has been their position all 
along. Even if very good points are involved, they do not admit that 
anything is positive. There was a tremendous amount of political 
posturing which I do not think has been the high point in this case.
<P>
	However, we are dealing with two motions which have been put 
forward as amendments. The motion would remove the reference 
to the Canadian Wheat Board Act being binding on Her Majesty in 
right of Canada or a province. This section of the bill was included 
to provide greater clarity, since the legal interpretation is that it is 
already the case and the act is binding on the provinces. It remains 
important that all participants in the industry be clear that the act is 
binding on the provinces. In that way we can make sure the proper 
selling arrangements, which have always been with the Canadian 
Wheat Board, are maintained. That was the reason it was included. 
To remove that portion is against the whole nature of the bill. 
Therefore, we cannot support the changes to that clause.
<P>
	Section 18(1) of the Canadian Wheat Board Act currently states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Governor in Council may, by order, direct the Board with respect to the 
manner in which any of its operations, powers, and duties under this Act shall be 
conducted, exercised or performed.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Currently amendments to section 18 of the act are being put 
forward.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(1.1) The directors shall cause the directions to be implemented and, in so far as 
they act in accordance with section 3.93, they are not accountable for any 
consequences arising from the implementation of the directions.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(1.2) Compliance by the Corporation with directions is deemed to be in the best 
interests of the Corporation.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1120)</B>
<P>
	The directive power already exists in the Canadian Wheat Board 
Act. The powers already conferred on the Canadian Wheat Board 
by Parliament are not being diminished by this bill. Therefore there 
is a continuing requirement to maintain the government's ability to 
give direction to the Canadian Wheat Board. This power has  been 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10153"> 10153 </A></B>
<P>
used only rarely and there is no reason to expect that it would be 
used any more frequently in the future.
<P>
	The provisions in clause 10 simply ensure that when such 
direction is given, it will be implemented and provide that the 
directors, officers and employees will not be held liable for 
carrying out directions given to the corporation by the government. 
According to section 3.93(1)(a) of the bill, directors, officers and 
employees must act honestly and in good faith with a view to the 
best interests of the Corporation. Section 10 defines complying 
with the government directive as being in the best interest of the 
corporation.
<P>
	We have to make certain that people who are working for a 
corporation such as this have legal protection as long as they are 
acting in good faith and within the law. We cannot support the 
amendments brought by the Reform Party on this point.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am here 
today to speak at report stage of Bill C-72, the legislation that the 
Liberals have brought in to change the Canadian Wheat Board.
<P>
	Quite frankly, I am surprised that this legislation ever made it to 
the House. It should not have. It does not do what farmers in 
western Canada want done with the board. It does not even do what 
the Liberal government said it wanted to do to the wheat board.
<P>
	Throughout committee and during clause by clause, it became 
very clear that this is extremely bad legislation. It is not legislation 
that should ever have found its way to the House. I am disappointed 
that it did. It does not do, by the way, what the panel that studied 
the wheat board and travelled across western Canada said it should 
do. It does not even come close. That panel recommended that the 
wheat board become accountable to farmers.
<P>
	This legislation, if looked at on the surface, does that to some 
extent in a very minimal way. Clearly the government and the 
government appointees will control what happens to the board.
<P>
	The amendments that we, the Reform Party, presented would 
have done something had they not been rejected by the 
government. They would have gone at least a little way toward 
fixing some of these problems. However quite honestly, this is a 
piece of legislation that cannot be fixed.
<P>
	As we know, this legislation will never come to a vote in the 
House, nor should it. It will be thrown out. Whether we have a 
government led by Preston Manning coming back, a government 
led by Mr. ChrÃ©tien or a government led by somebody else, we will 
have to start again. I realize that I have used the names of members 
and I will refrain from doing that.
<P>
	This legislation will not do what farmers want. A study done by 
the Saskatchewan government showed that 56 per cent of farmers 
want the freedom to either market  through the board or directly, 
either through a grain company or on their own to another country, 
the United States or wherever. It does not do what that study 
indicated.
<P>
<B>(1125 )</B>
<P>
	It does not honour the results of the plebiscite held in Alberta. 
That plebiscite showed that 66 per cent of farmers wanted dual 
marketing, as its commonly called, or wanted a choice to either 
market through the wheat board, or through a grain company or 
somewhere else as they choose.
<P>
	That is what the panel that was set up by the government 
recommended. It recommended that barley be sold freely and 
farmers have a choice either to sell through the board or on the 
open market as they choose, whether inside the country or outside. 
The government did not honour the recommendations of its own 
panel.
<P>
	In a survey in my constituency of Vegreville done by 
TeleResearch Inc. roughly 85 per cent of farmers polled by this 
professional pollster-and I tabled the report with the committee 
so the government knows what it showed-are in favour of having 
a choice, dual marketing, marketing either through the board or on 
their own for barley. It was slightly lower for wheat but not very 
much. In the Beaver River constituency even a higher percentage 
wanted to have that choice and did not want the monopoly.
<P>
	This bill will not do what farmers in either Vegreville 
consistency, which I represent, or in the constituency that the hon. 
member for Beaver River, Deb Grey, represents.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member has done it again. Will 
he please not refer to sitting members of the House by their names, 
but by their riding?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoit:</B> Mr. Speaker, I apologize for that. I do not know 
what it is with names today. I have been here three and a half years 
and I have never been stopped from using a name before. Here I am 
on probably the last day of the sitting of this House and I start using 
names. Perhaps I am getting into the campaign mode.
<P>
	If we are going to have apologies, the apologies clearly should 
come from the Liberal government for ever pretending that this 
legislation does what farmers want. Members can look at the 
amendments that we are debating today and they are not going to 
fix this bill and make it something that is acceptable.
<P>
	Most farmers want a wheat board which is accountable to 
farmers. Whether farmers support the wheat board monopoly as a 
large portion of farmers do, or whether they support a dual 
marketing system where we have the wheat board operating and 
farmers who want to market through the board can choose to do 
that or those who choose not to can also do that. In either case what  

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10154"> 10154 </A></B>
<P>
farmers want is a wheat board that answers to the farmers. This 
legislation will not make that happen.
<P>
	The board is partially elected. In committee the Bloc proposed 
that 12 out of the 15 directors be elected. The Liberals came back 
with 10 and that was put in the bill. The board has 10 members 
elected, which is at least a majority. What difference does it make 
if they do not have the power to make the changes that should be 
made to the board? They are given very limited power. The 
government keeps its hands very tight on the board under this 
legislation. The directors have virtually no power to make further 
changes to what the wheat board does and to give a choice to 
farmers on how they market their grain.
<P>
	The government has prevented this in different ways, partly 
through its appointments on the board of the chair and CEO. Partly 
through those appointments it keeps control, but also through a 
screening mechanism which makes it that any change the Canada 
Grain Commission decides is not quite right for some reason would 
be prevented.
<P>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
	Even if the majority of the board supports these changes, if the 
grain commission, under the control of the minister, decides 
changes should not happen, they will not happen. Clearly these 
changes are not what farmers want and we will find that out during 
the election campaign.
<P>
	This is going to come out I believe very clearly during the 
campaign. This is not what farmers want. I believe the Liberal 
government will get that message much clearer than it has to date, 
obviously, during the campaign.
<P>
	Other concerns that we worked on at committee are with regard 
to the absolution from responsibility that this legislation gives to 
the management of the board and even to employees of the board.
<P>
	If I were an employee for the Canadian Wheat Board, not one of 
the commissioners, not one of the appointed board members and 
not the appointed CEO or the appointed director of the board, and 
we have a lot of competent people who work for the board, I would 
be very concerned when I look at this legislation. Legal opinions on 
this legislation have not been clear. It seems that this legislation 
could easily make it so that the employees could be held 
responsible for mistakes made where the directors or the 
management of the board normally would be held responsible.
<P>
	This legislation should have never been here in the House. I am 
at least pleased that it will never come to a vote because it does not 
deserve a vote, quite frankly.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Malpeque, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
representative from the Reform Party tries to accuse me of not 
being a western farmer and I admit that. I am not a western farmer.
<P>
	I have had tremendous experience out west with western farmers 
and I feel quite confident in terms of speaking about this great 
institution, the Canadian Wheat Board. I take issue with a couple of 
points the member for Vegreville mentioned. He alleged that there 
is not producer control and we are not giving farmers choice. We 
are, and that is what this legislation is all about. It is enabling 
legislation giving producers choice and giving the board more 
flexibility.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> You did not read it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Easter:</B> The member says I did not read it. I will quote to 
him a section from the act which does show that the board of 
directors does have extreme control over the Canadian Wheat 
Board. Section 3.9(2): ``The president is the chief executive officer 
of the corporation and has, on behalf of the board, responsibility for 
the direction and management of the business in the day to day 
operations of the corporation with authority to act, subject to a 
resolution of the board, in all matters that are not by this act or by 
law specifically reserved to be done by the board of directors or the 
chairperson''.
<P>
	That shows the kind of power the board has over the chief 
executive officer and president. This is enabling legislation. I am 
proud to say as a member of the agriculture committee that we 
went out and listened to producers and made changes accordingly.
<P>
	This has been an exercise in consultation and listening to 
producers. Bill C-72 is about changing the Canadian Wheat Board 
and giving it the tools to be a better marketing institution for 
western grain producers.
<P>
<B>(1135)</B>
<P>
	Since I have been president of the National Farmers Union I 
have always held strong views on the Canadian Wheat Board. I 
have had the opportunity to study it, to go to the offices. I have 
listened to western producers over the past two decades. They have 
told me of their support for this marketing institution.
<P>
	The Canadian Wheat Board is an institution that works, that 
maximizes returns to producers in the international marketplace. It 
is an institution that sets up a system to allow us to compete with 
products from other countries in the international market rather 
than have us compete with ourselves. It does this by using the three 
pillars of single desk selling, pooling of returns and government 
guarantees.
<P>
	I ask Reform members to listen closely to this. I know they do 
not want to listen to the good facts and the good points this 
government is moving forward with. I quote Robert Carlson of the 
National Farmers Union in the United States when he appeared 
before the House of Representatives agriculture committee. He 
complained that they do not have a marketing institution of this 
calibre: ``From a competing farmer's perspective, we in the U.S. do 
not have a vehicle like the Canadian Wheat Board to create 
producer marketing power in the  international grain trade. We 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10155"> 10155 </A></B>
<P>
basically sell for the best price among our local elevator companies 
and lose our interests in our grain after that point.
<P>
	``Our export trade is dominated by a few large corporations that 
are interested in buying low and selling high to enhance the 
earnings of their owners who are not generally the same people 
who produced the grain traded.
<P>
	``The stated goal of free trade proponents in agriculture is to 
have a grain trade without national borders, without internal 
subsidies, without quotas or tariffs and without pooling price 
enhanced mechanisms like the STEs. That would be a great world 
for grain buyers but a grim world for producers who would be fully 
at risk economically''.
<P>
	He added that often producers in various countries tend to attack 
each other in the name of free trade when they feel producers 
elsewhere have an advantage. He concluded: ``If we destroy the 
various institutions that farmers in many countries have built to 
help themselves survive economically, we will have nothing left 
but producers standing bare among the ruins of structures that once 
empowered and protected them in a marketplace dominated by 
giants''.
<P>
	Mr. Carlson has said it all. He talked about this structure, the 
Canadian Wheat Board, which empowers producers. As a 
government we are looking at the tools to make that board more 
flexible. I believe the commissioner approach is the best one. This 
involves the appointment of commissioners for their expertise in 
marketing. I conceded on that point after I heard from producers 
that they want to elect a majority of producers to the board so they 
can control their own affairs with this enabling legislation. We have 
conceded and 10 producers will be elected to that board.
<P>
	It is clear when we look at this legislation that we have listened 
to and accommodated the wishes of producers. I recommend to 
Reform members opposite who constantly attack the board that 
they read this document, the annual report of the Canadian Wheat 
Board, which table after table shows clearly how the Canadian 
Wheat Board lays out all the information. No international grain 
trader lays out information like that. It talks about where the 
markets are. It talks about the final prices that are paid and clearly 
shows that the Canadian Wheat Board compared to any other 
marketing institution in the world is clearly able to maximize 
returns to Canadian producers.
<P>
<B>(1140 )</B>
<P>
	What this legislation is all about is ensuring that the Canadian 
Wheat Board is able to do that into the next century, giving more 
power through enabling legislation to those producers in order that 
they may control their own destiny with the guarantee and the 
back-up of the Canadian government supporting them in their 
efforts to  build the kind of economy and prosperity which 
producers can build in this great country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Allan Kerpan (Moose Jaw-Lake Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am happy to see there are some farmers on the other side 
of the House. Not too long ago there was a debate on agriculture in 
this Chamber and there were on our side something like 15 farmers. 
On the other side there were something like 15 or 18 lawyers.
<P>
	That is part of the problem we have. The lawyers, the 
bureaucrats and the politicians always tell farmers what is good for 
them, rather than it being the other way around. That is the root of 
the problem.
<P>
	I want to touch on a comment which the parliamentary secretary 
made. He said members of the Reform Party probably would not 
vote for this bill regardless of what was in it. When I first heard 
about some of the changes with the elected directors I considered 
very seriously supporting the bill. I did a survey in my riding which 
showed very clearly that the majority of farmers would like to 
continue with the wheat board monopoly.
<P>
	I am happy to be a member of a party in which I can vote for the 
wishes of my constituents without repercussions. I considered 
voting for Bill C-72 until I started to look at what was in the bill. At 
that point my thoughts changed.
<P>
	I am pleased to know that this bill will not pass during the 35th 
Parliament. That is good. I have spoken to a lot of people and 
neither side is happy. The people who are on the side of a dual 
marketing system think the bill has not gone nearly far enough. The 
people on the other side, the Sask Wheat Pool, the NFU and some 
of those groups, think it has gone too far.
<P>
	Obviously the issue is far from settled. It needs to be talked 
about and reworked in the 36th Parliament.
<P>
	The problem in agriculture is bigger than the Canadian Wheat 
Board. There are a lot of other issues which need to be tied together 
and come to grips with in order to make agriculture a viable 
business going into the next century. An example that comes to 
mind is transportation.
<P>
	We could consider what happened this past winter with the grain 
tie-ups in western Canada. The minister did very little to solve 
those problems. It is another example of where the minister has 
been completely lacking.
<P>
	The Liberal member for Souris-Moose Mountain brought 
forward a private member's bill which would give more 
responsibility to the railways. That is good. I like that kind of 
thinking.
<P>
	Another problem is that the government has not put in a system 
whereby the railways will be penalized for lack of movement and 
rewarded for good performance. That is something we must come 
to grips with.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10156"> 10156 </A></B>
<P>
	I support the hon. member for Souris-Moose Mountain. Of 
course when those things happen the government accuses us of 
bickering and being critical of all legislation brought forward.
<P>
	I would like to speak about consultation for a minute. I find it 
interesting that the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food set up a 
panel to travel the country to consult with farmers and to listen to 
farm groups. When the report came back it was not a good report in 
the minister's eyes. He did not act on the recommendations of his 
committee.
<P>
<B>(1145)</B>
<P>
	It reminds me of so many other committees that have taken place 
in this Parliament and in previous parliaments where some good 
thinking members go out on the road, listen to people, bring back 
recommendations, and the government of the day fails to act on 
them. Millions of dollars are spent on all kinds of reports that are 
put on shelves to collect dust. That is a serious problem.
<P>
	As the farmers in my riding of Moose Jaw-Lake Centre and I 
see it, the number one concern we would like to see changed about 
the wheat board is that it have a fully elected board of directors. 
People agree that is far enough for now. We might want to get into 
something else later but at least we would have control over the 
directors. They will be accountable to us. If they do not do what we 
say as a majority we will get somebody else. It is very much like 
the House. That is good part of our system.
<P>
	If on June 2 the people of Canada decide they do not agree with 
what the government is doing they will kick it out.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoit:</B> It is a wonderful thing to think about.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Kerpan:</B> Absolutely. The member for Vegreville is smiling. 
He has every reason to.
<P>
	It is good this piece of legislation will not pass this week. We are 
all assuming there will be an election call this weekend. That is 
also good. For those of us who come back in the 36th Parliament it 
is critical that we as a Parliament, not just as the government and as 
the opposition, work together to solve the issues in western Canada 
and indeed right across the country.
<P>
	In the last 3.5 years I have seen very little action on major issues 
by the minister of agriculture. Maybe there will be a new 
agriculture minister in the 36th Parliament. Maybe it will be 
someone from a different party.
<P>
	I firmly believe there is hope and a bright future for agriculture 
but it has to come from the grassroots up.

<B>(1205 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gar Knutson (Elgin-Norfolk, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
today marks an important step in introducing Canada's first ever 
federal legislation for the protection of endangered species.
<P>
	Bill C-65 is an important bill. This government believes that 
preventing species from becoming extinct is an honourable 
purpose, a purpose that will ensure that our children and 
grandchildren inherit a country as rich in wildlife as the one we 
enjoy today.
<P>
	Furthermore, by preventing animals from becoming extinct, we 
also ensure that we have a healthy environment for ourselves. 
While it may seem irrelevant at times whether the grizzly bear 
disappears or the loggerhead shrike disappears, they in and of 
themselves can become indicators of damage that we are doing that 
affects us as human beings and the globe as a whole.
<P>
	Some people have said that this bill goes too far and that it puts 
too high a value on nature. The government disagrees. Others have 
said that it does not go far enough in protecting the needs of 
endangered species. Again, the government disagrees. The attempt 
of the bill is to strike a balance between the various interests on the 
planet. The Government of Canada believes that we have the right 
balance.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10161"> 10161 </A></B>
<P>
	This bill is based on the premise that the needs of the economy 
can be integrated with the needs of ecology, that we can protect 
endangered species and still have secure jobs and a healthy 
growing economy. This reflects the government's commitment to 
sustainable development.
<P>
	This bill also recognizes that nature does not exist in a vacuum. 
People and jobs are also part of the equation. If we take away the 
jobs, people will build up resentments and defiance. We need their 
acceptance to buy into the laws for protecting the environment.
<P>
	There are five important aspects of this legislation. First, we 
have a bill that creates an independent panel of experts, scientists to 
give us the facts about the status of endangered species in Canada.
<P>
	What the bill attempts to do is to take politics out of the 
designation of which species are at risk. It is important to note that 
science and not politics, hearsay or uninformed opinion will 
determine what species are at risk, what species need help and what 
must be done to provide that help.
<P>
	This independent arm's length group of experts is called the 
Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada or 
COSEWIC for short. This will build upon 20 years of experience 
and provide for legal standing for this organization.
<P>
	COSEWIC will make recommendations to the government 
which will produce a list of species receiving immediate 
protection. It will use its expertise and will also draw on the 
traditional knowledge of aboriginal Canadians to assess and 
identify species to be listed.
<P>
	Each year the official list of species at risk in Canada will be 
made public. In fact, this list was made public last week. The 
picture it painted underscores the critical need for this legislation. 
COSEWIC told us that the number of endangered species in 
Canada has risen dramatically in the past year from 276 to 291, an 
increase of 15 species in the space of one year. This situation 
cannot be allowed to continue.
<P>
	Had the Canadian endangered species act been in place when 
COSEWIC's list came out, this would have been the basis for 
demanding recovery plans for every species identified as 
endangered or threatened. These recovery plans would have been 
implemented in a timely fashion. All parties affected by the plan, 
such as landowners, industries, citizens, government would have 
been involved in the development and implementation of a plan. 
Without this legislation, the future of these species is in limbo.
<P>
	Second, the bill recognizes that no single jurisdiction can meet 
the needs of all endangered species. Fish swim, birds fly and they 
do not recognize political boundaries. This is why we need 
partnerships and why it is very important that all governments 
agreed to a National  Accord for the Protection of Species at Risk in 
Charlottetown in early October 1996.
<P>
	In October all governments in Canada made commitments to 
establish complementary legislation and programs to protect 
endangered species. The accord builds upon legislation that already 
exists in four provinces: New Brunswick, Manitoba, Ontario and 
Quebec.
<P>
	The bill also establishes a council of ministers as a mechanism 
for co-operation among federal, provincial and territorial 
governments with the goal of preventing species in Canada from 
becoming extinct as a consequence of human activity.
<P>
	With this bill the federal government is doing its part. The 
legislation respects the traditional and constitutional roles that each 
jurisdiction has played in wildlife protection and conservation. 
New provisions have been introduced to more clearly recognize 
provincial and territorial authorities with respect to the 
management of endangered wildlife species.
<P>
<B>(1210 )</B>
<P>
	Third, international cross-border animal species are better 
protected. The bill recognizes the importance of working 
co-operatively with other countries for the conservation of 
endangered species.
<P>
	As part of our committee hearings we learned that the grizzly 
bear roams from northern Manitoba into southern Alberta and 
southern British Columbia. It is protected in the United States but 
would only be protected in Banff National Park in the Canadian 
jurisdiction. This bill will help deal with issues like this one. The 
bill also gives us the ability to take immediate action to protect 
animal species in imminent danger as they move across our 
borders.
<P>
	Earlier this month the Minister of the Environment signed a 
framework for co-operation with the United States Department of 
the Interior for the protection and recovery of wild species at risk. 
This agreement helps us build on the excellent relationship we have 
with the United States on the management of wildlife across the 
border.
<P>
	Together our two countries manage several migratory birds and 
other species. Our success in the recovery of the majestic whooping 
crane is a symbol recognized around the world of co-operation and 
partnership between different jurisdictions that share a common 
goal.
<P>
	The two countries agreed to exchange information, to work 
together on recovery plans and to build a partnership with all levels 
of government, the private sector and the public for the 
conservation of wildlife and the ecosystems on which they depend. 
A workplan will be presented to the Minister of the Environment 
and the Secretary of the Interior by December of this year.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10162"> 10162 </A></B>
<P>
	This legislation builds upon the voluntary efforts of a wide 
range of people in Canada, many of whom joined the Minister of 
the Environment when he tabled this bill last October. The 
Government of Canada sees the necessity and the benefits of 
working together on behalf of all our fellow creatures. This is very 
good news indeed. When it comes to a bird sitting on a rock, 
Canadians do not want to see politicians arguing over who has 
jurisdiction over the rock. They want us to work to make sure the 
bird can live and fly free. We have put nature before jurisdictional 
disputes.
<P>
	Fourth, this bill will generate more public involvement in our 
quest for a better protection of species. Canadians can take part in 
all stages of the process, from proposing species for listing, to 
developing and implementing recovery plans, to participation in 
the enforcement of the act.
<P>
	All information relating to work under the act will be made 
available through the establishment of a public registry. This will 
allow all Canadians to judge whether species are being protected 
from extinction and whether social and economic concerns of 
resources users and communities are being fairly considered.
<P>
	Partners essential to the national effort include provinces, 
territories, private landowners, farmers, industry, the 
environmental and scientific communities, aboriginal peoples and 
individual Canadians. Each has an important and essential 
contribution to make. Of particular note are aboriginal peoples 
whose traditional stewardship of the lands has always included the 
protection of wildlife.
<P>
	The Government of Canada recognizes the important 
contribution that farmers, ranchers and landowners have made to 
the protection of endangered species in Canada. Operation 
burrowing owl in the prairies is one of many examples of how the 
agricultural sector has worked in partnership with governments and 
environmental groups to protect species on the brink of extinction. 
These types of partnerships are exactly the sorts of agreements that 
are encouraged through the Canadian endangered species act.
<P>
	Individual Canadians can call for investigations and they will 
have access to the courts for legal redress if they feel measures are 
not being adequately enforced. Civil actions will allow citizens to 
take action to ensure that governments live up to their 
commitments. It helps to ensure the government's accountability. 
We saw in the United States that when a government failed to 
enforce its environmental obligations, citizens actions rose and 
stepped into the vacuum that was left when governments did not do 
their job. However if governments do their job, there should be no 
need for citizens actions.
<P>
	I realize this provision of the bill has been criticized as leading 
us down a slippery slope toward the American model. In that 
country the public's right to sue over environmental issues has been 
blamed for holding up  development and a lot of other things. But 
comparing the legislation before us with the American legislation 
is like comparing apples and oranges.
<P>
	Safeguards against civil actions which are frivolous or vexatious 
have been built directly into the legislation. Before a citizen can 
launch an action he has to apply to the government for an 
investigation and then prove in court that the government has acted 
unreasonably before he can move forward with his own citizen 
action. This presents a very high barrier to prevent frivolous civil 
litigation.
<P>
	Fifth and finally, this legislation is a product of over two and a 
half years of consultation. Public meetings were held from coast to 
coast. Discussion papers were issued and an industry and 
environmental task force spent nearly a year developing key 
proposals, 80 per cent of which are reflected in this bill. We have 
heard from the fishing and forestry sectors. They have addressed 
their concerns. In addition, 94 per cent of Canadians support the 
legislation. The government has received nearly 80,000 letters and 
petitions on the issue. Public involvement has been and will 
continue to be a key feature of the legislation.
<P>
<B>(1215)</B>
<P>
	A three-year review period has been built into the legislation to 
enable the Government of Canada to review early progress and to 
make necessary adjustments to the legislation.
<P>
	The amendments tabled today help to ensure the protection of 
endangered species in Canada remains fair, equitable and balanced. 
As we in government are watching for possible threats to our 
wildlife and providing the necessary remedies, Canadians will be 
watching us. They will not let government or industry slide 
backward. Nor should they. They will hold all legislators to 
account. We owe it to future generations to make sure the wildlife 
existing in Canada in the 20th century is still here in the 21st 
century and beyond.
<P>
	Just last week experts told us that the Monarch butterfly, a 
backyard treasure known to every Canadian child, is in danger. 
There can be no clearer message to the House. We need the 
legislation and we need it now.
<P>
	The Government of Canada is fully committed to providing 
effective protection to species at risk in this country. I call on all 
members to support the bill.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (GaspÃ©, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I welcome 
this opportunity to speak to Bill C-65, but I would like to add that I 
am speaking on behalf of the hon. member for Laurentides. This 
bill was supposed to be passed yesterday, and today, the hon. 
member had to go to her riding on business.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10163"> 10163 </A></B>
<P>
	I am pleased there was unanimous consent for having the 
amendments standing in the name of the hon. member for 
Laurentides recorded as such, because she did all the work, and 
she did an excellent job.
<P>
	To get back to Bill C-65, we are now considering the report stage 
of Bill C-65, an act respecting the protection of wildlife species in 
Canada from extirpation or extinction.
<P>
	This bill comes as a result of a promise the Liberals made in their 
red book nearly three and a half years ago. It has taken the Liberals 
all this time to draft this bill, although as soon as she was elected, 
the Deputy Prime Minister made it one of her pet projects. Today, 
the Liberals are bringing back the bill just to show they have some 
interest in wildlife and the environment. Why? Because the Liberal 
record on the environment is pretty thin, and they must put 
something on the table at the last minute, to look good before an 
election is called.
<P>
	The Liberals, who promised us the moon as far as the 
environment is concerned, have now stooped to campaign tactics. 
On every environmental issue, especially the reduction of 
greenhouse gases, the Liberals have been marking time. From the 
Deputy Prime Minister to the current minister, the Liberals have 
been incapable of delivering the goods. All environmental groups 
agree that their record is miserable.
<P>
	It is all talk and no action on the other side of the House. They 
make pretty speeches. They even said at a number international 
events that Canada was a world leader on environmental issues. 
What a joke. What a charade on the part of the Liberals.
<P>
	The biggest role they ever played is ``motor mouth'', which also 
means all talk and no action. Their record is just words and more 
words that have no beneficial impact on the environment. The 
reason for their miserable record must be sought-I see the 
Speaker is smiling-among senior ministers who have 
considerable influence in cabinet. It is clear that ministers who 
have connections with the business and financial communities lead 
the pack in this cabinet and the result is that the Minister of the 
Environment and this whole issue are not even given the time of 
day.
<P>
	We should also consider the influence of lobby groups. 
Obviously, environmental groups and the greens cannot compete 
with business and industry. Unfortunately, the cabinet ministers 
with clout are directly connected with the industry and business 
lobbies. They give them their undivided attention.
<P>
	Recently I saw a documentary on the important issue of reducing 
greenhouse gases. Ottawa has set up a representative group which 
is supposed to submit proposals for reducing these gases.
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
	This task force, which included a number of environmental 
groups, literally had a number of avenues of reduction closed to it, 
particularly avenues providing for restrictions and a possible tax on 
carbon. These proposals were completely ruled out as a result of 
industry pressure, which came in the form of a powerful lobby, 
known as the Friday Group. There was no further mention of 
voluntary measures, and the tax on carbon disappeared.
<P>
	In the meantime, the Prime Minister was to be seen on Alberta 
rostrums in the company of the provincial minister of natural 
resources and industry executives. Then came the tax deal of nearly 
$6 billion accorded this same industry.
<P>
	From this report it is clear now why Canada will not achieve its 
reduction objectives and meet the commitments it made at the Rio 
summit.
<P>
	Bill C-65 arises from a proposal by the former minister, which 
was released in August 1995. At that point, the task force was set 
up bringing associations with diverging interests-ecologists and 
industry-to the same table for a rare meeting. The group did 
important work and produced a bill for the minister. A national 
agreement on the protection of species was signed in October 1996 
in Charlottetown between the federal minister and the provincial 
and territorial ministers.
<P>
	The minister tabled his bill in the House on October 31, 1996. 
This was the start of the Bill C-65 saga, a long tale dotted with the 
discontent of everyone and the improvisations and incompetence of 
the minister and the parliamentary secretary.
<P>
	With the tabling of the bill, environmentalists and groups made 
it known to the government that Bill C-65 was totally inadequate 
and amounted to very little in the way of species protection. Groups 
immediately began pressuring the minister to amend the bill to 
bring it more into line with their vision. They wanted the federal 
government to have all the powers over species and their habitats, 
regardless of jurisdictions or ownership.
<P>
	Environmental groups have this idea that the federal government 
must be the national protector and that, with this status, it can 
ignore other jurisdictions. These groups should change their view 
on this issue, because the federal government is far from getting a 
passing grade when it comes to the environment.
<P>
	Moreover, the cuts made to the department show how little the 
Liberals care about the environment. Because it is so far away, the 
federal government is definitely not the ideal level. It is not capable 
of protecting or preserving the environment.
<P>
	You realize that for us, members from Quebec, it is difficult to 
buy the national approach put forward by these groups. In Quebec, 
we have had very adequate  environmental laws and regulations 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10164"> 10164 </A></B>
<P>
since 1989. The federal government even patterned some of its own 
legislation on ours. Anything that results in encroachment, 
interference and duplication is unacceptable to us.
<P>
	In addition to these environmental groups, the industry also 
expressed its discontent. People in the mining, forestry and 
agricultural industries strongly condemned the bill.
<P>
	And let us not forget the aboriginal people, who said the bill does 
not recognize their skills and knowledge. Finally, the provinces and 
territories jointly sent a letter to the minister, condemning the 
violation of the national convention principle, and the involvement 
of the federal government in their field of jurisdiction. This letter 
was not sent by Quebec alone.
<P>
	Against the background of this widespread discontent, the 
committee undertook a clause by clause review of the bill. About 
100 amendments were moved by members representing all the 
parties. The amendments of the Bloc Quebecois primarily sought 
to protect existing jurisdictions. We wanted to make sure the 
provinces would be able to manage and to control the species on 
their territories.
<P>
<B>(1225)</B>
<P>
	Unfortunately, all our amendments were defeated by the Liberal 
majority on the committee. Led by the parliamentary secretary, 
who shares this national, Canadian vision of the environment, the 
Liberal majority rejected our proposals, falling back instead on 
equivalency agreements and bilateral agreements with the 
provinces to manage the various species, with the federal 
government always having the upper hand.
<P>
	That is unacceptable to us. While the list of species at risk in 
Quebec may not be very extensive at present, Quebec does have 
legislation to deal efficiently with this issue. In fact, according to 
the premier of Quebec, who strongly condemned the bill, the 
purpose of the national agreement was to enable the federal and 
provincial governments to agree on which species to protect and 
nothing more. That is what the agreement was all about.
<P>
	From the moment the federal government starts interfering with 
essential habitats, it encroaches on areas outside its jurisdiction. 
Finally, the amendments put forward by the minister today do not 
remedy in any way the encroachment problem. Bloc members will 
oppose these amendments and the bill itself, since our amendments 
will be rejected by the Liberals as usual.
<P>
	I thought the Charlottetown accord was about co-operation 
between the provinces and the federal government. Once again, the 
federal government, which is about to call an election, is 
encroaching on Quebec's jurisdictions, and this will not do any 
good.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, Bill C-65 is a glaring 
example of the prejudice of the Liberal government against people 
who make their living off the land. It regards us all as thoughtless, 
irresponsible and uncaring people who have to be restrained by big 
mama government from despoiling the environment, killing every 
living thing, all non-human life forms, and, as an aside, from 
shooting ornery neighbours before breakfast with our unregistered 
firearms.
<P>
	Bill C-65 dismisses co-operative effort in favour of coercion by 
the urban elites who just know they are morally and intellectually 
superior to farmers, ranchers and woodlot owners. Instead of 
offering consultation and co-operation to rural people, the 
government has opted to threaten them with fines and jail terms.
<P>
	The abundance of proposed amendments to the bill should give 
some indication of its defectiveness. I draw the attention of the 
House to Motion No. 86. It refers to a paragraph under section 
59(3)(b) wherein the government is prohibited from disclosing the 
name of a plaintiff in an environmental action.
<P>
	This is so appalling that I initially thought it was a misprint. This 
is on par with provincial proposals of snitch lines for welfare 
cheaters. It is fundamental to a civil society that accusers not have 
anonymity except in cases where identifying them might endanger 
their lives. I hardly think a farmer accused of killing a swift fox 
would take out a contract on his accuser. It is a fundamental 
principle of justice that an accused must have the right to face his 
or her accusers. Even murderers have that right.
<P>
	The bottom line is that with guaranteed anonymity there is 
absolutely nothing to deter someone, whether an environmentalist 
or a neighbour with a grievance, from filing a frivolous complaint, 
a vexatious complaint. There is no penalty, no economic sacrifice, 
not even community disapproval for making an underhanded move 
against someone who may or may not have done something against 
the act. I do not understand how this provision managed to slip 
through committee.
<P>
<B>(1230)</B>
<P>
	Motions Nos. 88, 91 to 100 and 104 to 109 propose the deletion 
of sections 60 to 76 of the act. These are the sections which give 
private citizens the right to file civil suits if they believe that the 
Canadian Wildlife Service is lax in the performance of its duties.
<P>
	When the state introduces legislation to protect what it considers 
to be the interests of society as a whole, then it should also take 
whatever action is necessary under that legislation to ensure its 
effectiveness, not delegate the right to individuals who might have 
their own agendas.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10165"> 10165 </A></B>
<P>
	We do not need U.S. style government by litigation in Canada. 
These sections open the door for harassment of land owners by 
eco-vigilantes. It is unreasonable and unfair to expect farmers, 
ranchers and woodlot owners, many of whom are struggling to 
make a living, to defend themselves against well financed 
environmental groups, many of which are partly funded by 
government.
<P>
	Within this group I wish to draw particular attention to section 
65 which allows third parties to participate in court actions, get 
this, ``in order to provide fair and adequate representation of the 
private and public interests involved''. Really. This is from the 
government whose original discussions of the background material 
leading to this bill were held only in cities across Canada.
<P>
	I quote Nancy Greene Raine on this little exercise in 
consultation, Liberal government style: ``It is a sad day when 
legislation can be drafted without the input of the people who will 
be affected''.
<P>
	I would like to backtrack a little and comment on section 52. 
That section authorizes warrantless search and seizure. This sounds 
familiar. I would almost think it was written by our Minister of 
Justice with his well known disdain for due process and individual 
rights as exemplified in the same type of provisions in Bill C-68. 
Perhaps he and this government just do not like rural people or 
perhaps the Liberals are on a power trip.
<P>
	One of the worst features of Bill C-65 is that if a land owner 
loses all or part of his or her livelihood due to a government or 
private action on behalf of endangered species, a requirement to 
fence out water holes for example, there is no firm provision for 
compensation. This is also typical of the government's attitude 
toward ordinary citizens in other matters.
<P>
	If a government is going to encourage individual Canadians to 
inform on or launch lawsuits against their neighbours in the name 
of the greater good, then fairness would dictate that provisions be 
put in place for those affected to recover all the costs they incur as a 
result of such action if and when the courts rule that they are not 
guilty of an offence under the act.
<P>
	This lack of provision for just treatment of affected people could 
actually endanger the very creatures which the legislation is 
designed to protect. This House should be aware that there are 
already U.S. real estate advertisements certifying that land being 
offered for sale is free of endangered species. How can they be so 
sure? Why would they want it to be free of endangered species? 
Maybe somebody took a bit of underhanded action to see that there 
were no endangered species left on the land and maybe the reason 
they have made this certification is that nobody would want to buy 
a piece of land if they knew there were kangaroo rats on it.
<P>
	Because of this sort of thing, there is a very strong feeling now in 
the United States that its 21-year old environmental protection act 
has been beneficial only to  one predatory species, namely lawyers, 
but not beneficial to endangered species.
<P>
<B>(1235 )</B>
<P>
	In January the hon. member for Davenport was quoted as 
follows: ``We have to take a soft approach at first if people are 
going to accept this type of regulation''. There is a slip of a Liberal 
lip. The scary part of this is not so much the deviousness expressed 
by the member but that he probably sincerely believes that Bill 
C-65 represents a reasonable and soft approach.
<P>
	In the moments I have left I would like to read to the House a few 
quotes from a brief presented to the standing committee by the 
Canadian Cattlemen's Association. This paragraph says it all: ``The 
legislation before the committee represents a U.S. approach to 
endangered species protection. It relies heavily on regulation and 
enforcement and contains very little to encourage voluntary 
co-operation and partnerships. In our view the legislation in its 
current form will create conflict between land owners and 
conservation groups and will be detrimental to the future of 
wildlife on private lands''.
<P>
	Further the brief states: ``This bill erodes the rights of individual 
Canadians, particularly with respect to their rights to own and 
enjoy property. We believe the erosion of property rights is 
damaging to the cause of wildlife and endangered species and the 
record of government in protecting species over which it has direct 
control and which are not on private land, for example the Atlantic 
cod and the Pacific salmon, does not create a lot of confidence in its 
ability to maintain and develop long term protection measures''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy ChrÃ©tien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, the 
government is playing a childish game only hours before an 
election is called.
<P>
	It is introducing bills in the House that it knows full well will die 
on the Order Paper when an election is called, probably on Sunday 
afternoon in Shawinigan.
<P>
	Barely a few minutes ago we were debating a bill apparently 
eagerly awaited by western grain producers, Bill C-72, that the 
Pinocchio crowd promised would be passed in this 35th 
Parliament, and that is going to die on the Order Paper.
<P>
	A few hours later, in order to look good, the Minister of the 
Environment is introducing Bill C-65, which, on the face of it, 
seems quite commendable. When we examine it closely, however, 
we see that, once again, the government is on the wrong track.
<P>
	I will read you the title of the bill and you will understand how 
very commendable it is: an act respecting the protection of wildlife 
species in Canada from extirpation or extinction. Are you opposed 
to this? Of course not, neither am I. But a clause by clause  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10166"> 10166 </A></B>
<P>
examination of the bill shows that the Minister of the Environment 
is on the wrong track, and I will tell you why.
<P>
	I will begin by giving an example. The government has taken 
so-called positive action with respect to certain endangered 
species. Listen carefully while I tell you about the case of cod.
<P>
	Barely three years ago, realizing that cod were declining in the 
Gulf and on the Atlantic coast, this government's fisheries minister 
took a positive step: a cod moratorium. Exactly what was needed.
<P>
	A few years later, however, on the eve of an election, the cod 
have returned in staggering numbers. They are so large they are 
hanging off the edges of our plates. So, with an election about to be 
called in a few days, the fisheries minister authorizes cod fishing. 
Brilliant if you want to win votes, but for the environment, for the 
dwindling cod supply, it is a terrible move.
<P>
<B>(1240)</B>
<P>
	Another example is the peregrine falcon, the swiftest bird in the 
world. This is the bird you see in period films which is trained to 
attack on a signal from his owner. It is endangered here, and not 
because people destroy the nests or kill the birds. The problem goes 
much deeper than that; it is the environment, the gases we release 
into the atmosphere, the heavy metals, mercury in particular. What 
happens is that the female lays eggs whose shells are so thin that 
when the parents sit on them they break. It is a problem caused by 
pollution.
<P>
	What did the Deputy Prime Minister do during her 18 months as 
Minister of the Environment? She did nothing about this. What is 
the new, and always dapper, Minister of the Environment doing 
about this? Nothing. He would like to protect endangered species, 
but he has forgotten that four provinces are ahead of him in this: 
Quebec, Ontario, Manitoba and New Brunswick. They already 
have their own rules, their own legislation to protect endangered 
species. Now he would like to overlap with them, duplicating 
departments, duplicating regulations, and then to tell us that this 
will cost less. How very clever.
<P>
	Quebec created a protective agency in 1989, not under a 
sovereignist government, but the government of Robert Bourassa 
himself, who played on the same team as the Liberals. So here we 
go, more duplication. Quebec, Manitoba and New Brunswick 
represent at least 60 per cent of Canada's land mass. Once again, 
this is not such a clever move by the Minister of the Environment.
<P>
	What is even worse is that the federal government will be 
appropriating areas that do not come under its jurisdiction. It is not 
a rare thing to see the federal government come stomping into the 
provinces with the attitude of: ``Gang way and make room for me''. 
It will, for example, be responsible for transborder regions.
<P>
	Let me give an example of an animal that moves between 
provinces or between countries, the hare. If you study natural 
history, you will see that hares do not range much more than about 
a square kilometre. But if a hare lives near the U.S. border, might it 
not occasionally cross the border without a visa? Yes. I am taking 
the hare as an example, because its territory is very limited.
<P>
	Now, let us take the case of a wolf. The territory of a wolf or 
coyote is 100 times as big, or 100 square kilometres. So a wolf will 
tend to cross back and forth from the American side to the Quebec 
and Ontario sides. So it could be called a transboundary species. 
However, that is impossible, because it is not a migratory bird like 
the duck.
<P>
	I would like to add the following for the benefit of those who are 
listening at home. When you go hunting in the fall and you want to 
hunt partridge, hare, black bear or deer, you need a Quebec licence. 
But if you want to hunt duck or snow geese, you have to go to the 
post office-the post office, that is a good one-to buy a federal 
licence for migratory birds. I agree migratory birds should be 
managed, at least under our present system, by the federal 
government. But hares, foxes, wolves, black bears and deer are a 
provincial responsibility.
<P>
<B>(1245)</B>
<P>
	Another point that bothers me is those appointments. As you 
know, and I see you are smiling again, I am allergic to patronage 
and these appointments made by the governor in council or, as it 
says so neatly in Bill C-65, on the recommendation of our Minister 
of the Environment, who does not know much about saving 
endangered species. He only listens to his officials. He will be 
responsible for appointing the nine members who sit on this 
committee.
<P>
	Of course they will be remunerated-the same old story-after 
being appointed for political reasons, something I saw in my own 
riding. The president of the EI board of referees-you know who I 
mean because I think I told you that yesterday-is the sister of the 
Liberal candidate in the riding of Frontenac-MÃ©gantic. She may 
be competent, but she is a Liberal first and foremost.
<P>
	The former president had to be replaced, for some important 
reason. There was no competition, and the same procedure must 
have been used to appoint the returning officer in your riding for 
the next election, which will be called on Sunday, for June 2.
<P>
	I repeat, it is truly appalling that the government should use 
political appointments to protect endangered species.
<P>
	Bill C-65 also refers to federal land. I would appreciate it if the 
Minister of Environment said ``On my land in Canada''. For 
instance, in Mauricie Park or Forillon Park in the GaspÃ©, they say 
no moose or partridge shall be shot on this land, but if the moose or 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10167"> 10167 </A></B>
<P>
partridge move out,  well, the federal government did not buy the 
whole country.
<P>
	We have deer on our farm. When the hunting season starts, a 
friend of the returning officer for my riding goes deer hunting on 
my property. If the deer crosses the street and is no longer on my 
property, I cannot tell the hunter: ``Go ahead and shoot it, it is over 
there''. I will have to tell him: ``You only have the right to hunt on 
our property''.
<P>
	So I suggest the federal government mind its own business. Sure, 
it can protect endangered species, but it should first look where the 
problem is and then try to deal with it.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak at report stage of Bill C-65 to the Group No. 1 
amendments.
<P>
	The amendments in Group No. 1 deal with three of the major 
areas of concern. It does not allow for the co-operative approach 
but instead chooses the punitive approach in dealing with a threat 
to an endangered species.
<P>
	The second is the area of compensation. There is not any 
acceptable form of compensation provided for in this legislation.
<P>
	Third is the area of search and seizure. It allows an anonymous 
accuser to start a process against someone who has threatened, in 
their minds, an endangered species.
<P>
	These amendments deal with all those areas. Many of them were 
proposed by myself, others by the member for Swift 
Current-Maple Creek-Assiniboia, our critic in the environment 
area, the member for New Westminster-Burnaby, the member for 
Skeena and other Reform MPs.
<P>
<B>(1250 )</B>
<P>
	Several of the amendments in this grouping are from the 
government. That shows clearly that the bill was not very well 
thought out. That was something we found on examining the bill 
and the amendments moved by others. This grouping affects the 
three major areas of concern with this legislation.
<P>
	I would first like to talk a little bit about Bill C-65, the 
endangered species legislation. I do not think anyone would argue 
against the intent of the bill. The government brought in the bill to 
deal with concern over endangered species. I believe everyone in 
the House shares those concerns.
<P>
	However, when looking at the bill realistically and thinking it 
through, if it passes, even with the amendments that we are 
debating today, it would probably make things worse for 
endangered species than not having the bill at all. Let me explain 
what I mean.
<P>
	Let us think of a farmer, rancher, someone in the forestry 
industry or someone who has commercial property on the outskirts 
of a town that finds an endangered species on their property or in a 
habitat that could possibly support one of the endangered species 
on the list.
<P>
	For example, an endangered species or habitat that would 
support an endangered species is discovered on the property. The 
person knows the legislation in place is heavy-handed and would 
not allow for the species to be protected in a co-operative way. The 
penalties include fines of up to $1 million and even more 
important, that person could be forced to cover the legal costs of 
the case.
<P>
	That individual could be forced to spend money to fence off a 
portion of property that would support the endangered species with 
no compensation. Perhaps the accuser is anonymous, a neighbour 
who maybe has a quarrel with that individual, who could go to the 
authorities and that neighbour's name may well never be disclosed. 
What do members think they would do facing this type of cost, 
penalty and breach of normal judicial procedure?
<P>
	In many cases these people may think, much as they would like 
to protect the species, that with the threat that was brought about 
because of this legislation they just cannot take a chance. 
Supporting their families is more important than providing a 
habitat for an endangered species. In many cases, I believe, they 
would destroy the habitat and possibly even destroy the species.
<P>
	That is not what I want and I am certain that is not what the 
government wants. However, that is exactly what this legislation, if 
it were to pass, would most likely do. It is wrong and we must 
protect against that.
<P>
	Some of the amendments that Reform has brought in would go a 
long way to doing that if they were to pass. The amendments that I 
propose deal with the issue of a co-operative approach. More than 
one of my amendments propose that if the property owners or users 
who have the endangered specie or habitat on the property can 
demonstrate that they voluntarily will protect those species, along 
with others who are interested, then the punitive part of the bill, 
which is most of the bill, would not come into effect. That gives 
some protection against the heavy-handed approach of the 
government in this legislation.
<P>
<B>(1255 )</B>
<P>
	I have put forward amendments in the area of compensation, as 
did the hon. member for New Westminster-Burnaby. Those 
amendments would ensure that the land owner or land user would 
not have to bear the entire burden of the expense.
<P>
	The bill includes unusual and unacceptable search and seizure 
measures. It also allows an anonymous accuser to turn in a 
neighbour. The members for Swift  Current-Maple Creek-Assi-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10168"> 10168 </A></B>
<P>
niboia, Skeena and others have put amendments which would help 
in those areas.
<P>
	This legislation has not been well thought out. The intent is 
good, but it has not been well thought out. The best thing would be 
to scrap it. Whichever party forms the next government should deal 
with this issue in a much more effective manner. That is exactly 
what will happen if the Reform Party forms the next government. I 
hope the Liberals will do that if they form the next government.
<P>
	There are over 100 amendments which will not deal properly 
with all of the issues that have to be dealt with.
<P>
	On behalf of the people who depend on the land to earn their 
livelihood, whether they are farmers, ranchers, people in the 
forestry and mining industries, or people who have commercial 
property on the edge of a town which could lose its value as a result 
of this legislation, I say that we should throw it out of the House. If 
that does not happen, then let us pass the amendments which have 
been moved. At least they will help in dealing with these problems.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to take a few minutes to speak to Bill C-65, although 
everyone knows obviously that we are simply keeping the House 
occupied.
<P>
	We expect the election to be called at any moment, and today, 
yesterday, the day before yesterday and for the past week, the 
government has been using every means at its disposal to gain 
time, to pass the time. Now they put before us a bill we know full 
well will not get beyond the walls of this House. It will never 
receive royal assent or come into force.
<P>
	While it contains a mechanism for inclusion on the list of species 
at risk and a recovery plan for species at risk, the bill contains over 
100 clauses that should be completely reviewed and returned to the 
drawing board, because they bear no relation to the expectations of 
those consulted.
<P>
	The committee consulted many organizations. However, it did 
not take the representations and observations of these consultations 
into account. This is not the first time the government has behaved 
this way. We have seen this behaviour in the case of other bills, 
where consultation was simply a matter of form, and served either 
to spend money or to expend people's energy. In terms of time, it 
cost a lot. Were the opinions considered? Absolutely not.
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	This bill should be totally reworked for other reasons as well. It 
is not only a matter of consultation. The bill does not honour a fine 
promise the government made as enunciated by the Prime Minister, 
who said, in the speech from the throne on February 27, 1996, and I  
quote: ``The federal government will propose to the provinces a 
much strengthened process to work in partnership, focussing on 
such priorities as food inspection, environmental management, 
social housing, tourism and freshwater fish habitat''.
<P>
	The action taken by this government was totally contrary to the 
remarks of the Prime Minister. Instead of including provincial 
authorities in the process of designating and re-establishing 
threatened and endangered species, the government is excluding 
them. Yet another broken promise.
<P>
	Bill C-65 does absolutely nothing in that regard. Worse still, the 
actions of the Liberal environment minister seem very suspicious. 
First, he convenes a meeting of the provincial ministers of the 
environment to get an agreement in principle on the protection of 
endangered species. However, just four weeks later, the minister 
tables his bill which, in many respects, is totally contrary to the 
agreement in principle that he just obtained.
<P>
	Let me quote Quebec's Minister of the Environment. Even 
though he attended the meetings and signed the agreement, the 
minister said: ``We could not remain indifferent to the fact that this 
agreement opens the door to overlap between some future federal 
act and the legislation which has been in effect in Quebec since 
1989 and which works very well. We risk creating more red tape 
instead of dedicating ourselves to what really matters to us: the fate 
of endangered species''. This is what the Quebec Minister of the 
Environment wrote to his federal counterpart.
<P>
	Time proved him right. Just look at the bill before us. It creates 
all sorts of overlap. The main objection from Quebec to this bill is 
that the federal government keeps changing the rules by extending 
the territory where a given species is found. This is important when 
it comes to determining the applicable jurisdiction. The federal 
government even tries to gain more power by extending the scope 
of the definition of ``federal land''.
<P>
	The bill requires co-operation between the federal government 
and the provinces when, in fact, several provinces oppose this 
legislation. Once again, the federal government wants to impose its 
own jurisdiction, after promising harmonization. Therefore, this 
bill directly threatens the jurisdiction of the provinces, under the 
pretence that the government wants to meet the requirements of the 
international convention on biological diversity. The Liberal 
government is trying to interfere in an area of provincial 
jurisdiction.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	This government is increasing overlap. In all areas, particularly 
regional development, there is extensive interference by the federal 
government. It goes over the provinces' heads. It negotiates 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10169"> 10169 </A></B>
<P>
directly with municipalities and with community, humanitarian and  
tourist organizations. It has no use for provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	This bill is also troubling because it leaves the way open for the 
federal government to negotiate directly with municipal 
administrations, as I was saying earlier. This gives the minister the 
power to interfere in environmental matters because the 
implementation, and I do mean implementation, of measures and 
programs related to wildlife conservation can cover a wide range of 
activities without necessarily respecting constitutional authority.
<P>
	More specifically, the minister will be able to sidestep provincial 
governments by once again negotiating directly with 
municipalities. The Bloc Quebecois introduced several 
amendments in this regard providing for greater provincial 
involvement, but they were ignored by the Liberal majority.
<P>
	I would also like to speak about the discretionary authority this 
bill gives the minister. In fact, the Minister of the Environment 
calls all the shots with respect to implementation. He may make 
appointments to the Committee on the Status of Endangered 
Wildlife in Canada. He has the authority to decide whether or not 
species are included on the list. He decides whether or not to 
implement a recovery plan. All decisions therefore rest with him.
<P>
	The minister himself is responsible for the composition of the 
Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada. We 
know that it will have nine members and that the minister may 
appoint whomever he wishes. This is another opportunity for this 
government to reward friends of the regime, major contributors to 
the Liberal Party slush fund, or perhaps to cheer up Liberal 
candidates defeated in the election.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to participate in this debate on Bill C-65 and 
on the amendments. Before I offer a critical analysis of this bill I 
want to say that the Reform Party and I support unequivocally the 
responsible protection of endangered species. However, we do not 
support Bill C-65 in its present form. When I speak to the bill I 
speak also to the amendments that are coming.
<P>
	Before I outline why we take this position I will tell the House 
that there has been a significant outcry from within and outside my 
riding in opposition to this legislation.
<P>
<B>(1310 )</B>
<P>
	I quote Mr. Roy Staveley, acting senior vice-president of B.C. 
Hydro: ``The next issue I would like to touch on is public 
involvement. B.C. Hydro agrees that Canadians should have 
opportunities to share knowledge and participate in efforts to 
protect and recover species at  risk. The most effective way of 
doing this is by maintaining an open and transparent process. We 
feel that the Canadian endangered species protection act needs 
more provisions for consultation with affected parties throughout 
the process, from listing of species to preparation and 
implementation of recovery plans.
<P>
	``The protection of species at risk will best be attained through 
partnerships with key stakeholders. However, as currently written, 
the proposed legislation results in duplication of federal, provincial 
and territorial regulatory authorities. This would be inconsistent 
with the harmonization and intergovernmental approaches to 
environmental protection or the national accord and will likely 
result in jurisdictional disputes, duplication, poor enforcement and 
administration, public confusion and inefficient allocation of 
scarce resources''.
<P>
	I like very much the way the hon. Stephen Kakfwi, minister of 
lands and renewable resources of the Government of the Northwest 
Territories summarizes this: ``I suggest that the fundamental 
problem presented by the proposed legislation as tabled in 
Parliament is that it is inconsistent with both the spirit and the 
intent of the hard work done by all jurisdictions, including the 
federal government, to establish a co-operative national approach 
to protecting the interests of endangered species. The irony here is 
that the best intentions have been asserted but this in turn has given 
rise to the erosion of the best plans''.
<P>
	The outcry is also locally heard in my constituency of 
Cariboo-Chilcotin. Let me read to the House some of the letters I 
have received. A resident in Williams Lake stated: ``This 
legislation will do very little to address concerns about endangered 
species but goes a long way to starting a war in the courts and opens 
the door for groups with no concern for the social and economic 
impact or the inviability this act would bring to working people, be 
they forest workers, farmers, ranchers or miners. The courts and 
lawyers are going to have a heyday with this one''.
<P>
	From the city of Quesnel, council members passed a resolution 
opposing Bill C-65 due to a lack of any requirement to consider 
social, economic or community impacts; due to a lack of any 
requirement to provide redress for affected workers in their 
communities; due to a lack of any guarantee that workers, 
communities or other affected stakeholders will participate in 
recovery plan design.
<P>
	From the village of Clinton the council stated: ``Bill C-65 raises 
some significant concerns for the major industries of British 
Columbia, mainly forestry and mining. These two industries are 
the backbone of the economy in British Columbia and will be put at 
severe risk with the implementation of Bill C-65. Council believes 
that Ottawa should listen''.
<P>
	I could not agree more with this comment. Ottawa should listen 
to what the people of Canada are saying  about Bill C-65. The 
people and the municipalities from all walks of life that I have just 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10170"> 10170 </A></B>
<P>
quoted have legitimate concerns and they are rightly justified in 
feeling as they do. They know that Bill C-65 is a bad piece of 
legislation and they want this government to listen and to respond 
to what they are saying.
<P>
	Some of the reasons Bill C-65 is a bad bill have already been 
mentioned in the statements I have just read but let me elaborate 
for the House on some of them. These are the reasons Reform 
cannot accept Bill C-65 in its present form.
<P>
	First, the committee on the status of endangered wildlife in 
Canada, a nine member board appointed by the minister, will 
decide what species are at risk, how much risk, where the habitat is 
crucial and advise the minister on what should be done to help the 
species recover.
<P>
<B>(1315 )</B>
<P>
	There is no guarantee that effective stakeholders will participate 
in the recovery plan design. This means that private land owners 
could be forced to make special provision for some endangered 
species. For example, a rancher may have to fence off an area of his 
land to protect an endangered species nesting ground from grazing 
livestock. Unfortunately Bill C-65 offers no compensation to 
rancher for the use of his material and time or for leaving 
productive land dormant or for the drop in the value of his property.
<P>
	Let me tell the House a story of a situation that happened in 
Ontario about five years ago that relates to this point.
<P>
	Mrs. Strumillo-Orleanowicz owned a 100 acre parcel of 
undeveloped land near Smiths Falls, Ontario. To start up a business 
she planned to sever a building lot. Unfortunately the Minister of 
Natural Resources denied her permission to do this. Why? Mrs. 
Strumillo-Orleanowicz' neighbour owned land next door to her 
property that was inhabited by the endangered loggerhead shrike. 
To help protect the bird, the province designated 123.5 acres 
around the shrike's home as its critical habitat. As a result Mrs. 
Strumillo-Orleanowicz could not sever or develop her land to make 
a profit. Her creditors foreclosed on the property and she lost 
everything. The government gave her no compensation.
<P>
	Bill C-65's second flaw is that it jeopardizes the rights and 
livelihood of responsible land owners by expanding the rights of 
activist groups to go to court to stop resource development. It is 
interesting that those who turn in a neighbour can remain 
completely anonymous, not allowing the accused to face the 
accuser.
<P>
	For example, under section 60 of the legislation, a bureaucrat or 
an eco-vigilante could sue a forest worker, rancher, land owner or 
company that he or she thinks has harmed an endangered species or 
its habitat. This means  that there is a possibility that the courts will 
be filled to overflowing with actions against land owners.
<P>
	How will land owners respond to this possibility of being taken 
to court? Their reaction will be a negative one and endangered 
species will come out on the losing end. For example, according to 
cattle producers who spoke to the environment committee, land 
owners will have to seriously consider ways of reducing their 
exposure to legislative actions and loss of income and value 
resulting from constraints on use. The obvious and cheapest route 
will be to eliminate wildlife habitat on their land and specifically 
habitat that is attractive to species that could at some point be listed 
as threatened or endangered. There is evidence that the American 
endangered species law has already had this undesired effect in 
some areas of the United States.
<P>
	The third flaw of Bill C-65 is that it tramples the basic principles 
of justice. For example, under the bill authorities could seize 
private property and provide no compensation if the property is 
considered a critical habitat for an endangered species.
<P>
	In addition, Bill C-65 allows bureaucrats to search and seize 
private property without a warrant if, by reason of exigent 
circumstances, it would not be feasible to obtain a warrant. This is 
a characteristic of the government which is very frightening where 
the government is prepared to thwart the historic rights and 
privileges of people to impose its own view of the way things 
should be. This provision is completely unacceptable to Canadians.
<P>
	Reform has put 42 amendments to Bill C-65. These amendments 
would require the minister to consider the socioeconomic impacts 
prior to recommending what action should be taken. We would like 
to have compensation, a commitment to the preservation of 
endangered species and we would like the co-operation of all 
stakeholders involved.
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Godin (ChÃ¢teauguay, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
am pleased to speak to Bill C-65, the Canada Endangered Species 
Protection Act.
<P>
	Although there were a few federal laws allowing the federal 
government to intervene in order to protect these species, there was 
no federal legislation directly devoted to protecting endangered 
species. This was not the case in Quebec, which has had its own 
law since 1989, or in other provinces such as Ontario, Manitoba 
and New Brunswick, however.
<P>
	In 1978, a body was created which brought together certain 
organizations such as government agencies, the provinces, certain 
territories, four federal bodies, and three national conservation 
organizations.
<P>
	Before this bill was tabled, the Minister of the Environment 
brought his provincial counterparts  together in Charlottetown to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10171"> 10171 </A></B>
<P>
draft this bill. We are often told that there was an agreement in 
principle but, four weeks later, this agreement in principle was 
obtained without the bill, or the texts per se, being tabled and we 
know there was an enormous difference.
<P>
	The Quebec Minister, David Cliche, made the following 
statement on November 26, 1996: ``The federal minister has just 
tabled a bill in the House which worries the province of Quebec 
considerably. I must place this in its context, for it shows the 
difficulties of federal-provincial relations. I recently defended the 
interests of Quebec in relation to the environment and wildlife, 
while representing Quebec at Charlottetown. We reached 
agreement, and even signed a document to the effect, as I have 
already said, that if the federal government tabled legislation for 
the protection of endangered species under federal jurisdiction, it 
ought to respect the jurisdictions of the provinces, and in particular 
of the territories''.
<P>
	Mr. Cliche went on to say: ``We thought we had reached 
agreement with Ottawa on the following principle, a simple one 
besides, and this is where all of the problem lies in this bill, I 
believe: If we agree that a species is endangered, it is up to the level 
of government with jurisdiction over the territory and the habitat of 
that animal to ensure that it is properly protected in its natural 
habitat''.
<P>
	Once again, we have before us a bill that I might describe, in a 
nutshell, as an attempt by the federal government to use the 
convention on biological diversity to justify encroaching on a 
provincial jurisdiction and centralizing powers at the federal level. 
But as we can see, that is not the case. They are trying to enact a 
law that goes against existing provincial legislation. Again, in yet 
another area, we will end up being governed by two acts, which 
will just create more enforcement problems.
<P>
<B>(1325)</B>
<P>
	What major problems are we looking at? There are four of them. 
First, we submit that Bill C-65 is a direct threat to provincial 
jurisdiction. This is the fundamental problem with this bill. The 
government is interfering in an area of provincial jurisdiction and, 
with this bill, tries to tell the provinces what they should do from 
now on.
<P>
	As I said a moment ago, under the pretence of attempting to 
comply with the terms of the international convention on biological 
diversity, the Liberal government is trying to interfere in provincial 
areas of responsibility. That is the first problem with this bill.
<P>
	Second, Bill C-65 ignores the distribution of powers provided 
for in the Constitution-I will come back to this in a moment-and 
the usual interpretation of this provision, because it is based on a 
much broader definition of territory and overlooks the fact that, 
under the Constitution, the federal government and the provinces 
share responsibility for certain species.
<P>
	The third major problem is that Bill C-65 gives the Minister of 
the Environment broad discretionary powers to decide, among
<P>
other things, who will be appointed to the COSEWIC. We will 
recall that this is the committee established in 1978, whose work 
was done on a voluntary basis. With this bill, the members of this 
committee will not only be selected by the minister but they will 
also be paid.
<P>
	Finally, the fourth major problem is that Bill C-65 excludes 
provincial authorities from the designation and recovery of 
threatened and endangered species. This attitude directly 
contradicts what was said by the Liberals, more specifically in 
statements by the Minister of the Environment and the Prime 
Minister and in the throne speech, which were all about 
harmonization and partnership.
<P>
	If we look at the Constitution, the protection of species and their 
habitat is not included in the division of powers under the 
Constitution Act, 1867, which is to be expected. It is not clearly 
defined.
<P>
	However, under this act, the provinces have jurisdiction over the 
management of public lands belonging to the province, in section 
92 on property and civil rights,and over all matters of a merely 
local or private nature. These powers are sufficiently broad to 
enable the provinces to pass legislation on plants and wildlife, both 
on provincial public land and private land.
<P>
	In other words, we see that although the Constitution Act, 1867, 
does not clearly define these responsibilities, the provinces have as 
much jurisdiction over land as the federal government. Today, the 
government wants to pass legislation that would practically 
eliminate provincial responsibility and establish federal 
responsibility once and for all, as we have seen in so many other 
instances. In fact, we have the same problem with respect to 
duplication and overlap.
<P>
<B>(1330)</B>
<P>
	In concluding, I want to say, as I said earlier, that the members of 
this committee, which has been existence since 1978, at the time 
worked on a volunteer basis. They will now be paid, which will be 
an additional expense. Furthermore, they will be selected by the 
minister.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
it is a pleasure to speak on the endangered species act.
<P>
	In British Columbia, maybe more than any other province in 
Canada, environmental protection, endangered species legislation 
and legislation concerning everything from the protection of bears 
to whatnot are on the political agenda routinely. These issues crop 
up in our papers. We have environmental writers. We have quite a 
movement in British Columbia of people concerned about the 
environment. Perhaps it is because of our ocean habitat, the rivers 
or the salmon. I do not know what it is. Maybe it is the salt air. 
Whatever it is, people are concerned about the environment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> Are the Liberals endangered out there?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Perhaps they are concerned about Liberals being an 
endangered species. Just because we are on the eve of an election 
we cannot assume that. I know for sure the Tories are, but I do not 
want to get rhetorical here.
<P>
	I would like to mention two or three concerns of people about 
environmental legislation. There is broad consensus in British 
Columbia for public information and education on the environment 
being near the top of everyone's list of political concerns. Who 
knows why that is?
<P>
	My riding gets 60 or 70 inches of rain a year. Everything from 
how manure is handled on dairy farms  to the way logging roads are 
constructed in nearby mountains are key environmental concerns 
because what we see up the road today is likely to be washed down 
into our fields the day after. They are political concerns and real 
concerns of the people in my area.
<P>
	There is also the other side. Another group of people have 
concerns about this type of legislation being so intrusive and 
restrictive on their economic activity that they cannot go about 
doing any modern activity without being called down by the 
government or being called on the carpet for supposedly harming 
the environment. If we take it to the extreme, too many people 
breathing in the lower mainland causes some kind of harm to the 
environment but we understand we have to deal with it the best we 
can.
<P>
<B>(1335)</B>
<P>
	The legislation as currently proposed is not the best way to deal 
with the endangered species problems in Canada. It is too intrusive. 
It does not take into account safe economic activity on land, 
whether it be farming, ranching, logging or whatever it might be.
<P>
	I will refer to an example from my background. Before I came to 
this place I was a logging contractor. I spent my life in the woods 
working close to the environment. About 10 years ago the issue of 
the spotted owl, an endangered species by definition, became a big 
problem in the lower mainland. To those who are not aware, the 
spotted owl's supposed territory is all the rain forests of the Pacific 
northwest including the United States and extending a few hundred 
miles into the coastal rain forests of British Columbia.
<P>
	The United States has similar endangered species legislation. 
The concern there for the spotted owl was so overwhelming that the 
forests were shut down. Logging was curtailed. Logging towns 
became ghost towns. Tens of thousands of people lost their jobs. 
The spotted owl was a happy little owl but the damage it caused 
economically totalled billions of dollars.
<P>
	The spotted owl scare worked its way north into British 
Columbia. The spotted owl patrols began. University students, 
hopefully biology majors, were hired on summer vacation. Late at 
night they would go two by two into the woods, because it was 
environmentally safe to do so, where we were logging and would 
park their campers. At night they would broadcast tape recordings 
of spotted owls hooting. If they thought they heard another spotted 
owl respond in the distance, if they heard it hoot in the background, 
they would tick on their chart that there was another spotted owl 
somewhere. It was close by. Although they did not see it they knew 
it was there. They would say they heard an owl hoot in the night 
and would therefore shut down the logging in the entire drainage. 
Who knows if there were spotted owls? Nobody ever saw them but 
maybe they were there.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10173"> 10173 </A></B>
<P>
	To show how silly it was, not only did the area extend several 
hundred miles into British Columbia but they had on their charts 
that spotted owls maintain their nests between 2,500 feet of 
elevation and 3,500 feet of elevation. That is prime logging area. 
A lot of the logging I did was at those levels of elevation and a 
lot was done up to 4,500 feet.
<P>
	This is true confession time. One day we were building road in a 
valley. No one had ever seen or heard of a spotted owl there. 
Nobody really knew what they looked like. We came upon a nest in 
a tree and, scout's honour, it was a spotted owl's nest. There was 
such an animal and it was in the tree. We shut down all the logging. 
We shut down the road building and went to the environmentalists 
in the forest service office to tell them we had seen a spotted owl. 
We had been to the mountain top and saw the spotted owl.
<P>
	They were pretty excited. Then they looked at their maps and 
said: ``Wait a minute. You are building road at 4,000 feet. That is 
not the range of spotted owls. They only go to 3,500 feet. That can't 
be a spotted owl''. We argued with them that it was a spotted owl, 
that we had seen it and that they should come to see it. They looked 
again and said: ``No. Our range of spotted owls only goes to 3,500 
feet so it cannot be a spotted owl. Build the road right over top of 
the tree''. We refused to do that. We managed to get around the tree 
and save the spotted owl. This shows how ridiculous it can be at 
times to ask a modern industrial society to make allowances for 
spotted owls. Then when one is found and because it did not fit into 
some imaginary criteria they did not care about it.
<P>
<B>(1340)</B>
<P>
	The other spotted owl site is in a logging area where I spent my 
youth with my parents. The universities come to investigate the 
spotted owl that has built a nest right beside the main logging road 
where 40 to 50 loads of logs go by every day. The university people 
drive right up to the bottom of this big tree. They all stand there 
with their binoculars and look at this spotted owl who gets along 
just fine in an area where there has been logging going on for the 
last 40 years.
<P>
	The legislation should not go through in its current form as it has 
too many flaws. In British Columbia the devastation cannot be 
overstated. Roads can be built through an entire valley system at a 
cost of millions. The company we contracted built the roads. After 
the roads were built they came in to check if there were any spotted 
owls. After the road is built and the work is done they say: ``I think 
I heard a spotted owl hoot so there is no logging allowed in this 
valley''. Business cannot be done like that.
<P>
	I remember saying to them: ``If there are endangered species tell 
us and we will work around them, but do not make arbitrary rules 
and put us in a position where we spend a lot of money that you 
cannot compensate us for''. Reasonable compensation has to be 
worked into the  legislation so that farmers, ranchers and loggers 
are able to do their work while they protect the environment.
<P>
	I do not believe the legislation does that. That is why the 
amendments are necessary. We are grateful the bill will not pass in 
this session of Parliament.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to take a few minutes to talk to Bill C-65. I think I could 
fairly summarize my thoughts by saying, something my colleagues 
have said as well, that I consider this another major intrusion by the 
federal in areas of jurisdiction of the provinces, and this of course 
includes Quebec.
<P>
	I have looked at two quotes from letters the Quebec minister of 
the environment sent to his colleague in the House of Commons, 
one of which concerns the section on interpretation. Mr. Cliche 
said, and I quote: ``Thus the federal government's definition of 
federal land for the purposes of the bill has no relation to reality. 
We never understood that the management of fish stocks or inland 
or coastal waters navigation meant that the federal government had 
jurisdiction over all aquatic ecosystems, along with the seabed and 
subsoil below and the airspace above these waters''.
<P>
	Here is another quote from this same letter regarding the 
measures to protect listed species: ``Furthermore, it seems 
incongruous for the purposes of the bill to liken the migratory 
travel of species from one country to another or their geographic 
distribution on either side of a border to the import and export of 
goods and services. In introducing a new notion, that of cross 
border species, the federal government could be giving itself 
extended jurisdiction over the vast majority of species in a 
province''.
<P>
	It seems clear to me that the Government of Quebec does not 
support this bill any more than the Bloc Quebecois, since, as I have 
just said, it is another intrusion into an area of jurisdiction that does 
not belong to the federal government. However, as it always does, 
the federal government is trying to find a breach to slip through. 
This is what we consider to be the aim of this bill-an attempt to 
meddle in provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
<B>(1345)</B>
<P>
	Quebecers are not the only ones to think the bill is not all that 
great, native peoples do too. I had the pleasure of looking at the 
brief presented by the native peoples. In short, they feel that the bill 
does not really take their needs into account and that they are being 
largely ignored, as is usually the case.
<P>
	Finally, I have been made aware of the native approach to 
endangered species. Canadians are probably to be blamed for the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10174"> 10174 </A></B>
<P>
disaster as a whole. The natives' philosophy, as told by their elders 
and the younger generations, is that the earth is their mother. The 
birds,  the plants and the animals are their brothers and sisters. 
They believe that water and streams are rather like the blood 
vessels of mother earth.
<P>
	They have a philosophy of tremendous respect for nature as a 
whole, including the fauna and the flora. They believe this bill 
shows no respect for either their culture or their approach to the 
environment.
<P>
	I have noticed that it is the economic development practices, 
which can not longer be sustained by the ecosystems, that are 
endangering species. It is not native peoples, it is not campers, it is 
not nature loving individuals who are endangering species. It is not 
people who respect nature who are threatening endangered species, 
but rather economic development methods and practices.
<P>
	I saw some pretty terrible things when visiting aboriginal people 
in parts of Canada that are the subject of native land claims. For 
example, in Nisga'a, Chilcotin and Carrier-Sekani territory, some 
clear cutting is being done and it is extremely destructive. I think 
clear cutting is the main reason for the extinction of some species.
<P>
	My Reform Party colleague was laughing at the fact that we 
wanted to save part of a forest just because we heard a owl hooting. 
I think there might be a reasonable compromise between the two 
extremes, but clear cutting is certainly not contributing to the 
protection of endangered species.
<P>
	The same goes for mining, another area of economic 
development which victimizes aboriginal people. I am thinking 
here about the Dene in the Northwest Territories, in Nunavut, who 
are being squeezed by diamond mines. Mining exploration 
endangers plant and animal life. Endangered species are certainly 
threatened by this type of exploration.
<P>
	The same situation exists near Voisey Bay, in Innu territory. The 
people there object to the drilling taking place in a region with what 
may be one of the richest mines in the world. Once again, their 
opinion is being overlooked, the lands they claim as theirs are 
being invaded and the natural resources on these lands will be 
pillaged. Once the natural resources have been plundered-the 
forests cut down and the mines exhausted-we turn to the natives 
and tell them: ``Now, we are willing to consider your land claims''. 
Mining activities and clear cutting have a major impact on 
endangered species.
<P>
	I could talk about the hydro projet included in the Northern 
Flood Agreement, in Manitoba, which was harmful to the Crees in 
the province. This week, we passed Bills C-39 and C-40, which 
will compensate natives for the flooding of their land, but the 
creation of an artificial lake probably ten times too large, for the 
purpose of producing electricity, means that groups and species are 
certainly being threatened by this uncontrolled economic 
development project.
<P>
	As far as the east coast is concerned, I would also like to mention 
the extensive fishing in the area where we find the Micmac, a 
people which calls itself people of the dawn. Today, fish stocks 
have dwindled and natives can no longer fish, something that has 
always been part of their traditions.
<P>
	These are examples of our disregard for native people. Yet, our 
First Nations are very concerned with nature and, consequently, 
with endangered species. They do not feel they are to blame for the 
disappearance of these species.
<P>
<B>(1350)</B>
<P>
	In fact, I have noticed how some native communities have great 
respect for species in general, especially endangered ones. For 
example, on the reserve of the Walpole Island First Nation, there 
are 37 varieties that are now on the list of endangered species. 
These 37 varieties have grouped together, instinctively, in the 
location where they are the least endangered, that is, on a native 
reserve.
<P>
	Another example I can mention is Akwesasne. These natives 
have invested money to buy an island to protect the great blue 
heron. So, we see that natives are concerned with this issue, and it 
is unfortunate that the bill briefly mentions first nations here and 
there in the first 19 pages and then not at all at the end.
<P>
	Consequently, we recognize the federal government's style in 
this bill; it is often more fiction than fact, full of smoke screens, 
saying we must take care of aboriginal people because this is 
important. However, the more time passes, the less we take care of 
them, and their claims and their importance are totally disregarded 
in a bill such as this one.
<P>
	You know that Quebec wants to achieve autonomy. Every time 
one of our jurisdictions is invaded, we protest. It is the same thing 
for aboriginal people. They really want native self-government. 
What this bill says, basically, is: ``We will make tests and, from 
now on, the federal government will have a say on endangered 
species. We are stepping in. We do not need you, we are taking 
charge''. There have been major clashes with aboriginal people, 
who strongly disagree with all this.
<P>
	It seems to me that, once again, the government's fiduciary 
relationship with aboriginal people is being weakened by the kind 
of legislation we have before us. Again, in this case as in many 
others, Quebec and the aboriginal people find themselves on the 
same side of the issue, in the sense that both have very serious 
concerns about Bill C-65. Amendments have been put forward but 
they have been defeated. As a result, this bill, if passed, will enable 
the federal government to encroach on Quebec's jurisdiction while 
ignoring the aboriginal communities.
<P>
	For all these reasons, the Bloc Quebecois cannot support such a 
bill. We like having certain jurisdictions;  we really want to hold on 
to them and do not want to see the federal government encroach on 
them. The aboriginal peoples are in the same situation as us. They 
<P>

<B><A NAME="10175"> 10175 </A></B>
<P>
do not want the federal government go over their heads and impose 
a bill that does not provide for any distribution of powers.
<P>
	That is just about all I had to say. For these reasons, naturally, the 
Bloc Quebecois will oppose Bill C-65.
<P>
	<B>Mr. StÃ©phan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, it is with emotion that I address this bill on endangered 
species.
<P>
	As a community, we must be aware of the importance of the 
ecosystem. We must also realize that human beings are but one 
element of biodiversity, and that it is vital to ensure a balance 
between fauna, flora and human beings.
<P>
	However, statistics show that many species are endangered. 
Many are already extinct, and I am quite afraid that many more will 
meet the same fate. This truly concerns me because, if we do not 
protect the fauna, the flora and all these endangered species, it will 
have an impact on our lives, 40 years from now, even though we 
may not always know all these species.
<P>
	Our planet is currently losing 50 species per day. This is 
enormous. Given the time it took to reach this point, one might 
conclude that the world will end in a few thousand years, which is 
really soon.
<P>
<B>(1355)</B>
<P>
	So, we cannot overstate, to the international community, the 
importance of wildlife.
<P>
	Let me go back to policy, and the bill itself. While it is important 
to protect endangered species, we must also do so in the 
appropriate manner. In Quebec, we have our own approach.
<P>
	Once again, I have the feeling I am saying the same things as 
always: the federal government is interfering in Quebec's areas of 
jurisdiction.
<P>
	I remind the House that the former Minister of the Environment 
had created all kinds of working and consultative groups to come 
up with a bill that would make the federal government a leader in 
that area. The minister introduced her bill in the spring of 1995. It 
created an outcry, primarily among environmentalists. One of the 
main objections to the minister's bill had to do with the fact that the 
legislation would only apply to federal territories.
<P>
	Environmental groups argued that only four provinces had a law 
on endangered species and that, consequently, the federal 
government should legislate for the whole country. I want to point 
out that Quebec has had an act on endangered species since 1989, 
and Ontario, Manitoba and New Brunswick also have legislation on 
this.
<P>
	One year later, the current environment minister met with his 
provincial counterparts, in the hope of reaching  an agreement in 
principle to harmonize protection and conservation policies on 
wildlife. The meeting took place in Charlottetown, on October 2, 
1996. Even though he signed the agreement in principle, Mr. 
Cliche, Quebec's Minister for the Environment and for Wildlife, 
issued an independent press release, in which he said: ``We cannot 
remain indifferent to the fact that this agreement opens the door to 
overlapping between the future federal act and the legislation 
which has been in effect in Quebec since 1989 and which is 
working very well''.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> My colleague, you will have about seven 
minutes left if you wish to continue after oral question period.
<P>
	It being almost 2 p.m., we will now proceed to statements by 
members.

	<B>Mr. Harold Culbert (Carleton-Charlotte, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Atlantic Canadians are very supportive of endangered 
species. They know that preventing species from becoming extinct 
is an honourable purpose. At the same time, Atlantic Canadians 
want to ensure that endangered species legislation does not have an 
undue negative impact on our aquaculture and traditional fishing 
industries.
<P>
	I believe that the proposed endangered species act has struck the 
right balance between the two objectives. The bill proves that we 
can integrate the needs of the economy and the needs of ecology.
<P>
	The government has shown that we can both protect endangered 
species and still have secure jobs and healthy, growing economies.
<P>
	The product of two and a half years of consultations, with many 
additions and changes, the endangered species act is fair, equitable 
and balanced. I congratulate the Minister of the Environment and 
the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans who have demonstrated that 
working together in order to achieve common goals is always a 
formula for success.

likely my last statement in the 35th Parliament. I will use it to 
speak to farmers about the government's record regarding key 
issues affecting them. Reality speaks clearer than words.
<P>
	To grain farmers: The Crow benefit subsidy was taken away. The 
reward? Grain moves even slower than before while farmers pay 
twice as much.

<P>
	To cattlemen, who ask for nothing from government, and indeed 
to farmers in the west, in Ontario, in Quebec and in Atlantic 
Canada: You get Bill C-65, the endangered species legislation. The 
government legislation could impose huge costs and fines up to 
$1 million.
<P>
	To dairymen, many of whom have supported this government: 
You may be forced to produce below the cost of production for six 
months due to a bungling of implementation dates on subsidy cuts.
<P>
	On voting day I urge farmers to look beyond the nice words and 
to vote based on the policy and the record of each political party. If 
farmers do this I doubt that much of the farm vote will go to the 
Liberal government.

	<B>Mr. Gilles Bernier (Beauce, Ind.):</B> Mr. Speaker, June will mark 
the end of my activities as the member for Beauce in the Parliament 
of Canada. During my three terms of office, I have represented with 
conviction all the causes commended to me by the citizens of 
Beauce. I have carried out my duties dispassionately, but 
energetically and with conviction.
<P>
<B>(1400)</B>
<P>
	I thank the members of my staff and my family, who were very 
supportive of me. I believe I have been a worthy representative of 
the inhabitants of Beauce both in the Parliament of Canada and 
elsewhere. I have tried to be consistent in the positions I have 
adopted and credible in the actions I have taken. As a member of 
Parliament, I did my best, trying always to be visible, available and 
accessible. Representing Beauce for 13 years has been a hectic and 
eventful experience, but it has also been very rewarding and 
uplifting.
<P>
	I therefore leave with wonderful memories of my 13 years in 
Parliament, of all these colleagues with whom I have worked, the 
clerk, his team and Hill employees.
<P>
	To you, Mr. Speaker, I offer my best wishes for success and good 
health. Thank you for your efforts on behalf of everyone here.

	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, last fall I 
had the pleasure of visiting Castle Mountain in Alberta, a sacred 
site of the Blackfoot nation.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois takes exception to the treatment of the 
Blackfoot in this issue. This mountain is on the point of being 
declared a historic site. The problem is  that it is located within 
Banff National Park, that the Blackfoot nation opposes this plan 
and that the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development 
has clearly taken a position, by indicating that he was prepared to 
return this mountain to them as reserve land.
<P>
	It is a shame that the Minister of Canadian Heritage is still 
turning a deaf ear to the demands of this first nation. We see this as 
one more stain on the already tarnished record of the government 
with respect to native issues.

	<B>Mrs. Anna Terrana (Vancouver East, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
British Columbia regiment, Duke of Connaught's Own, is 
headquartered in my riding of Vancouver East. The armoury is over 
100 years old, is a municipal and provincial heritage building and 
houses a spectacular museum. The regiment is very proud of 
having been the recipient of several Victoria Crosses and having 
participated in both world wars.
<P>
	At present the Duke of Connaught's Own Regiment is 
participating in peacemaking and peacekeeping missions and in 
training reservists and cadets. Over 100 cadets meet every week 
and find an alternative to cruising the often dangerous streets of 
downtown Vancouver.

banquet where I met very proud people who contributed a lot to our 
country. Among them was Col. John Toogood, the honorary 
colonel of the regiment, who retired after 59 years in the military.

for a brilliant career. I salute them.

	<B>Mr. Brent St. Denis (Algoma, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 1914 a 
black bear cub was acquired by Dr. Goulbourn from a trapper in 
White River, Ontario, a community located in the new riding of 
Algoma-Manitoulin. The bear was named Winnie and eventually 
made its home in the zoo in London, England where it went on to 
become the inspiration for the much loved character Winnie the 
Pooh.
<P>
	The connection between White River and Winnie the Pooh is not 
well known. Fortunately, this is about to change. A group of 15 
hardworking grade 8 students from St. Basil's School in White 
River are about to embark on a journey to England to visit the 
London Zoo in order to raise awareness of the real origins of this 
world famous bear and to take in the sights as well.

determination to promote the history of their community. I wish 
them a very safe, enjoyable and educational voyage.
<P>
	In closing, I invite all hon. members to visit the beautiful

Speaker, on behalf of the Portuguese Canadian community living in 
my riding of Lambton-Middlesex, I would like to take this 
opportunity to express my gratitude to the Minister of Citizenship 
and Immigration who announced in the House on April 21 that 
effective May 1, 1997 citizens of Portugal will no longer be 
required to obtain visitor visas in order to visit Canada. I know 
there are many Portuguese Canadians in my riding and throughout 
Canada who will welcome this announcement which will certainly 
smooth arrangements to have their relatives and friends visit.
<P>
	Over the years the Portuguese Canadian community has 
contributed enormously to the social and economic development of 
my riding of Lambton-Middlesex and to Canada as a whole. I am 
certain that these exemptions for visitors from Portugal will 
continue to nurture this relationship to the benefit of citizens of 
both countries.

war in Algeria is still claiming innocent victims. Over 60,000 
people have already died since this war began five years ago.
<P>
	Last Tuesday, 95 inhabitants of a small village south of Algiers 
were killed by an armed group claiming to be Islamic 
fundamentalists. Unfortunately, this barbaric act was not the last, 
for we learn today that Tuesday night another 42 people, including 
17 women and three babies under a year old, had their throats cut in 
a village 100 kilometres to the south of Algiers.

	<B>Mr. John Duncan (North Island-Powell River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in early 1996 the minister of Indian affairs appointed an 
interim band council at Lac BarriÃ¨re reserve and appointed a 
mediation team led by Justice Paul who recently resigned pending 
an RCMP investigation.
<P>
	Doing a 180-degree turnabout, the minister last week reinstated 
the band leadership that he rejected in 1996. Having done that, he 
then called Lac BarriÃ¨re the most dysfunctional reserve in Canada. 
Meanwhile a forensic audit of Lac BarriÃ¨re is still trying to account 
for $20 million in lost funds and there remain allegations of sexual 
abuse.
<P>
	The minister has re-endorsed the old leadership despite the 
problems that developed in the community during its 
administration. The minister has abandoned the people in this 
community, which is totally disheartening for those who are trying 
to end the abuse, unaccountable spending and poverty at the 
community.

what is personally convenient.

	<B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, today is the 
82nd anniversary of a tragic event: the Armenian genocide.
<P>
	Members of the Bloc Quebecois strongly believe that this crime 
against humanity must not sink into oblivion. Year after year, we 
want to mark this sad anniversary. In fact, the recognition of the 
Armenian genocide was the subject of a motion brought forward by 
my colleague from Ahuntsic on April 23, 1996. Unfortunately, 
Liberal members seemed reluctant to face the facts since they 
managed to water down the motion by having the notion of 
genocide taken out of it.
<P>
	The execution and deportation of nearly two million Armenians 
under the Ottoman Empire from 1915 to 1923 was the first major 
genocide of this century. This day to remember the victims of the 
Armenian genocide reminds us of the importance of fighting 
against the impunity still enjoyed today by some governments.

were massacred in 1915 yet it has not recognized this massacre as a 
genocide. The United Nations defines genocide as the direct 
physical destruction of another racial or national group.

prevail.

intellectual leaders of the Armenian community in Constantinople 
were taken from their beds and imprisoned, tortured and killed.
<P>
	Armenians in the Turkish army were all killed. Men over 15 
years of age were gathered in cities, towns and villages, roped 
together, marched to uninhabited locations and killed. After a few 
days the women and children and remaining men were marched 
from Anatolia to the Syrian Desert where they were left to die. On 
the way they were attacked by Turkish mobs.

massacred. We must never forget these crimes against humanity 
perpetrated by the Turkish authorities in 1915.

products.
<P>
	Recently the agriculture minister agreed to a scheduled phase out 
of the consumer subsidy, but now he assures dairy farmers that the 
$12 million agreed upon to delay the price pass through until 
February is off because he was ``unable to persuade his cabinet 
colleagues''. We could blame the minister. Once again he has failed 
in a commitment made to farmers. But is the problem not really 
greater than the minister himself?
<P>
	It was the Liberals who were going to protect supply 
management, then they signed it away in NAFTA. It was the 
Liberals who were going to keep the Canadian Wheat Board, but 
negotiated it away at the World Trade Organization talks. It was the 
Liberals who were going to keep the Crow benefit, but they 
eliminated it 18 months after gaining government.

minister is more disturbing than anything we could have imagined. 
According to this newspaper, the trust which is managing the 
minister's assets has established no less that seven branches in 
Barbados, for a total of 13 branches in various tax havens.

minister to stem the growing use of tax havens. We even made 
recommendations to him that would have made these tax havens 
less attractive.

	We have been fortunate in this country that at least every four 
years or so we as Canadians can and must evaluate the record of our 
politicians. It is high noon. The streets are quiet. Let the showdown 
begin.

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="AUDITORGENERAL">AUDITOR GENERAL</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I always thought it was the opposition in a Parliament 
which had a shadow cabinet, not the party in power.
<P>
	On a more serious note, yesterday, the auditor general had much 
to say about how the government fiddles its financial statements, 
but the Liberals turned a deaf ear. They preferred not to hear his 
comments. It is understandable that, with the elections 
approaching, the government would want to avoid hearing 
anything that might cast light on the way the Liberals have 
managed the public funds. As they say on the Hill, and how 
appropriate it is: ``When the going gets tough, the Liberals go into 
hiding''.
<P>
	By skipping a meeting with the auditor general on the 
government's accounting practices, what are the Liberals trying to 
hide, to cover up? What are the Liberals trying to hide, when we 
see that the auditor general told them yesterday that their 
accounting practices were dubious?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the government has 
nothing to hide from the auditor general. The auditor general 
looked over our books and he gave us a clear statement that they 
were in good shape. The hon. member should be well aware that 
there was no reservation by the auditor general on the accounts.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, a statement like that is surprising, when we know that the 
Liberals did not want to hear it yesterday. It is a bit surprising when 
one knows that what the  auditor general would have said, if he had 
the chance, is: ``I fear that the credibility of the government's 
financial statements and of the budget is questionable''. That is 
pretty clear.
<P>
	The Liberals did the same thing last year. They are repeating the 
same dubious accounting practice of cooking the books, fiddling 
with the deficit, in order to look better on the eve of an election. 
That is what they are trying to do.
<P>
	If they are repeating the same offence and continuing to thumb 
their collective noses at the recommendations of the auditor 
general, are we to conclude that the government has now acquired 
the habit of playing with the figures to its heart's content, ignoring 
the most elementary principles of accounting?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I remind the hon. 
member that he should read the auditor general's statements. Take 
a look at them.
<P>
	The auditor general gave us a clean opinion on his audit 
statement of the government accounts.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Leader of the Opposition, BQ): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, I have read the French version, and I have read the English 
version; they both said the same thing. It could have been debated 
yesterday with our honourable colleague, if he had deigned to show 
up at the Public Accounts Committee, which he did not.
<P>
	And the Liberals are going to seek another mandate by saying 
that they have managed our taxes well, while the auditor general 
says the opposite, that the Liberals have been manipulating the 
figures in order to make their financial statements look better, 
adding expenditures that will not even be made until after the 
election onto the deficit of previous years.
<P>
	Let us take the example of the Canadian Foundation for 
Innovation, which is used to hide $800 million this year. What 
confidence and what credibility can we have in a government 
which treats comments made by the auditor general in a totally 
flippant and irresponsible manner?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, let me remind the hon. 
member that this government is not spending today and paying for 
it tomorrow. It is setting up a reserve fund and that innovation fund 
is going to be paid out over the next little while. We have made that 
commitment and acknowledged that at the time we made it.
<P>
	This government has not followed the example of the previous 
governments where we found out some years  later that we had a 
deficit of $42 billion instead of $32 billion. We are not making 
commitments and then paying for them later. We are making 
commitments now and we are recognizing those commitments. 
<P>

<P>
	I would ask the member about this building which he is sitting 
in. When was it expensed? It was expensed in the budgets of 1917 
and 1918 when it was built and we have used it for the last 80 years. 
We are doing the same thing with the innovation fund. We are 
setting it up. We have made that commitment. It is there and it will 
be used over the next few years.

	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-RiviÃ¨re-des-Prairies, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I have a question for the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	When he left the room where the Standing Committee on Public 
Accounts that was supposed to be sitting late in the afternoon 
yesterday, the auditor general described the GST harmonization 
formula which, as we know, gave $1 billion to the maritimes, as a 
political decision. This squares exactly with what we have been 
saying about that formula since it was announced. It we fully apply 
the McKenna formula to Quebec, Ottawa owes Quebec $2 billion, 
which the Quebec government has been asking for, as was 
demonstrated in black and white in the last provincial budget.
<P>
	Why is the government persisting in not treating Quebec the 
same way as it is treating the maritimes?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we are treating the 
Quebec government exactly the same way under those regulations 
as we are treating every other province. If the Quebec government 
had lost funds on the harmonization of the GST and the QST we 
would have compensated it. It did not lose funds.
<P>
	As I said yesterday in the House, the Quebec government 
accounts show clearly that the numbers went from $5.1 billion to 
$5.4 billion to around $6 billion. That represents an increase every 
year since harmonization. It has not cost Quebec any funds at all. 
The Quebec accounts show that.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-RiviÃ¨re-des-Prairies, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, Mr. McKenna was at the ChÃ¢teau Champlain, in 
Montreal, at 12.30 p.m. today, no doubt in order to praise the merits 
of his province in the taxation area and thus rob us of our 
businesses and our jobs.
<P>
	Does the government find it normal that the premier of a 
province should use some of the money paid by Quebecers to come 
and draw Quebec's businesses away, businesses that Montreal 
needs so badly to counter poverty?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member's 
question should be addressed to the premier of the province he has 
indicated. It is not the policies of the Government of Canada he has 
complained about but the policies of the province of New 
Brunswick. If he has problems with the provincial politics I suggest 
he bring those up in provincial parliaments.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="LIBERALPARTY">LIBERAL PARTY</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, don't 
you just hate getting junk mail? I got some this morning from the 
Liberals. Although they would not answer our questions yesterday 
I think they are trying to give us some hints about what they are 
planning for the upcoming election.
<P>
	For example, on the cover of their pre-election brochure they 
feature six young children. I wonder if this means the government 
plans to reannounce its national day care program, the one it 
promised it would bring about last time but failed to deliver. Maybe 
these kids are some of the hundreds of thousands from families that 
have been driven from the middle to the low income bracket 
because of this government. Maybe they are supposed to represent 
the $20,000 per head of debt that men, women and children bear 
because of Liberal-Tory overspending.
<P>
	Which one of these policies is the government planning to run 
on? Which policy will the Liberals bring before the Canadian 
people in the upcoming election?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as we have found over the years, the selective reading 
habits of the Reform Party did not permit the hon. member to take a 
look at what is probably one of the most significant initiatives 
taken on behalf of children in the last decade, the announcement of 
a major investment in a child benefit that will ensure that every 
child in a low income family will receive a guaranteed benefit from 
the Government of Canada.
<P>
	It provides a basic income flow for poor children in this country. 
It will put income into the hands of their parents so their parents 
can make the best choices about their education, their nutrition, and 
so on. That is the Liberal way of doing things, giving choice to 
people to help their children. That is the real issue.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10182"> 10182 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, by the 
government's own account, over a million children live in poverty 
in this country. There is no national day care program after the 
government promised it.
<P>
	I am looking through the Liberal list of achievements page to see 
where it says that the Liberals fulfilled their promise on the GST, 
but it is strangely absent. I am looking for the section on national 
unity, but I cannot find it. Could that be because the government 
came within 50,000 votes of losing the country?
<P>
<B>(1430)</B>
<P>
	What about health care? It speaks about $300 million in a new 
health care initiative, but it does not mention, for some reason, that 
it has cut $7.5 billion.
<P>
	Is the government planning to hoodwink Canadians once again, 
just like it did in 1993, or is my brochure missing some pages?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I find it exceedingly bizarre that the hon. member, while 
he seems to be poring over the literature of the government with a 
microscope, totally ignores the literature of his own party.
<P>
	The last so-called Reform budget was going to totally decimate 
the entire pension plan of Canadians. It was going to reduce 
payments to the disabled, children and low income families. It was 
going to totally and completely rewrite the social structure to give 
tax breaks to high income earners and higher taxes to the low 
income earners.
<P>
	I would suggest the hon. member change his reading habits.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Reform Party is the only party that has a plan to save the Canada 
pension plan.
<P>
	The chairman of the committee on the government side who 
comes from Winnipeg said that in 15 years the Canada pension plan 
will be in trouble because of the government's initiative. Is it any 
wonder when Liberal MPs secured their own MP pension that they 
are not concerned about Canadians' pensions?
<P>
	The government cannot run away from its record. Look at the 
GST promise, the day care promise, the NAFTA promise. There 
have been 37 tax increases. The country has the worst jobless 
record since the great depression. Look at Somalia, Airbus, the 
Krever and the Pearson scandals.
<P>
	After that pathetic record of incompetence and duplicity why 
should Canadians trust the government for another four years?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am very proud of having served as a member of this 
government. First, it has been able to restore the confidence and 
trust of Canadians in  government. That is something the Reform 
Party has never, in its wildest dreams, had the notion of doing.
<P>
	Second, unemployment has been brought down from the high 
levels it was at in 1993. More than 750,000 jobs have been created.
<P>
	Interest rates have been brought down to a 30 year low.
<P>
	We have restructured government and restructured the finances 
of the country which has given us a platform from which to launch 
into the new century.
<P>
	We approach these issues with pragmatism and reality, not with 
ideology and rhetoric, which seems to be the only stock in trade of 
the hon. member.

	<B>Mr. StÃ©phan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Minister of Transport.
<P>
	Canadian Airlines is still having problems despite the assistance 
provided by the federal government. If the company cannot sell 
Inter-Canadian, it will shut down operations in Quebec in less than 
five weeks, killing 500 jobs.
<P>
	What is the federal government going to do about this potential 
closure, after agreeing in the last few months to postpone the last 
payment on the $120 million loan it extended to Canadian in 1992, 
and after granting Canadian last February a reduction in fuel taxes 
of $20 million a year over the next four years.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the situation with respect to the regional subsidiary of 
Canadian Airlines is fairly straightforward. The company has 
proposed selling the airline. This happened only a few days ago. 
There is, I believe, at least a 16-week period before there would be 
developments that would involve the government.
<P>
	At the present time it is simply a private company offering to sell 
a company which has frequently been sold. It was once known as 
Quebec Air. It has frequently been purchased by other companies.
<P>
	It appears to be a normal readjustment within the airline industry 
where one company might move from ownership of one group to 
ownership of another. At the present time there is no cause for the 
government to step in.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. StÃ©phan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
are we to understand from the minister's comments that all Quebec 
taxpayers are good for is to pay tens of millions of dollars that the 
federal  government then gives to Canadian, and that they do not

have the right to say anything when this company shuts down its 
operations in Quebec two months later?
<P>
<B>(1435)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as I indicated to the hon. member, this is a private offer of 
a Canadian company to the market generally. It is not a question of 
taxpayers' money being involved.
<P>
	The hon. member seems to be under the misapprehension that 
Canadian is owned by the Canadian government. It is not. 
Canadian Airlines is a private corporation.

	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
appears that the Prime Minister is about to call an election. So far 
we have not heard what the issues might be. There are no new ideas 
from the Liberal side and no platform.
<P>
	It is a little bit like the corn flakes commercial. I think Liberals 
are going to run on ``try me again for the first time'' to see if maybe 
people will buy it. I do not think the people are going to buy $24 
billion in tax increases since the government took power, another 
$110 billion added to the $500 and some billion national debt and 
1.4 million unemployed. With a shameful economic record like 
that I wonder what the Liberals are going to run on.
<P>
	The government should not be going cap in hand asking for the 
votes of the electorate. It should be going cap in hand apologizing 
to the electorate. What possible reason could the government use 
for going to the people at this time in a federal election?
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> We want to get rid of the Reform Party.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if the hon. member is trying to use the metaphor of a 
cereal box, which I am very glad he has the time to spend reading in 
comparison to his hon. colleague, I would suggest that the 
appropriate variation for the Reform Party would be crack, pop and 
fizzle.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I said crack, pop not crackpot. I just want to make 
that clear.
<P>
	The hon. member is the one who seems to be getting all agitated 
about an election. It was his party that rushed out to get its platform 
before the people. It is his leader who has been campaigning across 
the country. It is his members who are standing up in an apologetic 
fashion declaring their mea culpas to their constituents.
<P>
	We are here governing. We want to make sure that the country is 
in good hands and continues to be in good  hands. If and when and 
how the election is called, we fully expect to have the mandate to 
continue as the government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
maybe their idea of governing is that a goody a day will get the 
voter to play. I am not sure whether they will get away with it.
<P>
	When the Liberals announce their platform I can see it now: The 
theme music from <I>Mission Impossible</I> coming on the screen as the 
son of red book gets trotted out and they try once again to make 
believe that this time they really, really mean it.
<P>
	Are they going to try to defend the actions of some of their 
ministers, while if their outspoken backbenchers speak out they get 
kicked out of the party? Will they defend that? Will they talk about 
the huge MP pension plan? Will they talk about the Somalia 
inquiry? Will they talk about the Pearson airport deal? Maybe the 
Airbus pay-off, I wonder if that is what they will talk about. Maybe 
it will be free trade. I think it is going to be long term, stable 
funding for the CBC.
<P>
	This is a comedy from Air Farce. Surely they cannot be running 
on this. In this literature the Liberals are saying that Canadians are 
in good hands. Well, good hands my foot. Why would Canadians 
vote for four more years of this kind of a government?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member talks about the observation he makes of 
members on the government side. If he took a look around him it 
would look like the retreat from Moscow. Never have we seen such 
a bedraggled group of people in total surrender and defeat, pulling 
themselves back with all the resignations and all the evictions.
<P>
	We have declared a new party called independent members made 
up of the rejects from the Reform Party that their hon. leader has 
thrown out.
<P>
	I would hope that at some point during this question period that 
the Reform Party might, in its last gasp here in the House, get down 
to some serious questions about the issues at stake, the great 
matters really affecting public policy and get off their platform.

for the Minister of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	On March 31, the federal government stopped its financial 
contribution to the Quebec agricultural day haul transportation 
assistance program. So, this year, the government of Quebec will 
have to finance all by itself  the program, which will be cut by 40

<P>
per cent, or $330,000, because of the federal government's 
withdrawal.
<P>
	Since this successful program provides vital transportation 
services for some 150,000 person-days a year in Quebec, why is the 
minister reluctant to renew the federal government's financial 
contribution?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robert D. Nault (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is always 
interesting to hear members opposite talk about jurisdiction.
<P>
	This is very much a provincial jurisdiction. The Government of 
Quebec and members opposite have asked us to withdraw from 
areas of provincial jurisdiction and that is what we are doing.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. RenÃ© Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, for the hon. 
member's information, I would like to point out that it was a 
federal-provincial agreement and not a question of the federal 
government taking over from the province. An agreement is 
usually reached because we want to do business together.
<P>
	The federal government had already reduced its financial 
contribution from 50 per cent to 40 per cent, and now it is down to 
nothing.
<P>
	Does the minister realize that his refusal to maintain the federal 
contribution to this program will mostly affect small farmers trying 
to recruit help and thousands of low-income seasonal workers?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robert D. Nault (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, yes, we are 
aware of that. It is why we have made an offer to the provincial 
government and the farming community as a whole. Human 
Resources Development is very interested in looking at proposals 
for doing this in a different way than it has been done in the past.
<P>
	Once the proposal is put to us, we will look at the issue and a way 
of delivering it in a different fashion than it was delivered in the 
past because that entered into provincial jurisdiction which is 
against the policy of the party opposite.

patronage, keeps claiming that he appoints only good 
Liberals-and that an oxymoron if ever I heard one-to all of the 
patronage positions he fills.
<P>
	If all the Liberal hacks in patronage positions are so good, why 
are the Canadian taxpayers shelling out $50,000 for VIA Rail's 
president to take an eight-week course at Harvard?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, VIA Rail is a crown corporation for which I am 
responsible for reporting to the House. I do not have a day to day 
responsibility for vetting every decision taken by VIA Rail. The 
hon. member has made an assertion which may or may not be 
correct, I do not know. I am quite willing to look into it for him, 
find out and report back to him.
<P>
	I would suggest that a party which constantly has supported the 
private sector and the concept of government getting out of active 
involvement in commercial operations should think twice before it 
encourages ministers to take day to day control of crown 
corporations or private companies.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, what I encourage the minister to do is privatize VIA Rail.
<P>
	Given that VIA Rail is subsidized in the amount of $600,000 a 
day, $50,000 might not seem like much money to the Prime 
Minister, his finance minister or the Minister of Transport. 
However it represents a four-year degree for a Canadian student 
who cannot afford an education because the Liberals cut education 
funding by 40 per cent.
<P>
	Can the Prime Minister or anyone else explain why Liberal 
patronage hacks get $50,000 for an eight-week Ivy League course 
while thousands of Canadian students cannot afford an education 
because of Liberal cuts.
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I answered this question the first time around by saying 
that I, as minister responsible for reporting to the House for VIA, 
do not take every decision of $50,000 or more for the railroad, nor 
in fact does the Prime Minister.
<P>
<B>(1445)</B>
<P>
	We have a crown corporation operating at arm's length from the 
government whose annual plan is reported through me to the 
House. We do not follow every decision prior to it being made.
<P>
	I will repeat what I have agreed to do, for the hon. member. I will 
ask VIA for the details surrounding the assertion of the hon. 
member to find out whether it is correct. Most assertions from his 
party are incorrect. If it is correct, I will bring information to him 
about it and whether there is justification for it.
<P>

corporation, which he admits has at least a $600,000 daily support 
from the state.

	I remind the minister that Egypt is a signatory to the United 
Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and, as such, has 
obligations to meet.
<P>
	Can the Minister of Foreign Affairs tell us if he will invoke the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child with his Egyptian 
counterpart to convince him to send back to Canada the eldest 
Robitaille child, who is seriously ill?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, certainly the responsibilities under the convention are 
setting a mandate but they do not have a legal, binding obligation. 
That is the difficulty.
<P>
	Within a matter of a day or two we will be engaged in finishing 
our negotiations with the Egyptian government on a new consular 
agreement. This would substantially enhance our ability to make 
representations on behalf of the Robitaille children.
<P>
	I understand the frustrations. I feel them as well, but we have to 
pursue it through the venues of the international forums we have. I 
will keep the hon. member fully informed of each step along the

	<B>Mr. Mauril BÃ©langer (Ottawa-Vanier, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Intergovernmental Affairs Minister.
<P>
	For several weeks now, people in eastern Ontario have shown in 
different ways their total opposition to the closure of Montfort 
Hospital.
<P>
	Since the federal government has assumed the mandate to speak 
for linguistic minority rights everywhere in Canada, could the 
minister tell the House what the position of the government is, 
regarding the closure of Montfort Hospital?
<P>
	<B>Hon. StÃ©phane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the position of the government is that linguistic 
minorities all across Canada should not only be entitled to basic 
services in their own language but should also have the right to 
control as many institutions as possible which are essential to any 
community, such as schools, colleges, hospitals, co-operatives.
<P>
	Like some of my colleagues, I informed the Government of 
Ontario of my position on the proposed closure of Montfort 
Hospital the very first day it was announced. As Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, I will keep asking the Government of 
Ontario to take into consideration the serious consequences for the 
Franco-Ontarian community of the closure of the only French 
language hospital in Ottawa.
<P>
	Premier Harris has proven to be a great Canadian by giving 
francophones of Ontario control over their schools. I do hope that 
he will be guided by the same principles in the case of Montfort, 
the only French language teaching hospital in Ontario.

	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 1992 a 
17-year-old was convicted in adult court for the murder of a father 
of four. He was sentenced to life imprisonment with no parole 
eligibility for 25 years.
<P>
	Thanks to the justice minister and Bill C-41, this young offender 
can be paroled after serving a mere 10 years. That is the Liberal 
record of getting tough on crime.
<P>
	My question is for the justice minister. Why send young killers 
into adult court for adult sentencing when adult penalties do not 
apply?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the hon. member for the question.
<P>
	As he is aware, a decision was recently rendered by the court of 
appeal. As an appeal could still be possible it would not be 
appropriate to comment on it.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10186"> 10186 </A></B>
<P>
	The record of the government and the minister is very clear. 
There have been more effective changes to the Criminal Code to 
toughen it up, changes to toughen up the young offenders law, 
changes to the Corrections and Conditional Release Act, and 
changes to help victims, than have been made in the history of 
the nation by any single parliament. That is something we are very 
proud of.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, how in the 
world could the parliamentary secretary claim they are getting 
tough on crime when they change the law so that it does not really 
make any difference if a young killer is transferred from young 
offenders into adult court? It simply does not make sense.
<P>
	Nevertheless I have a supplementary question. This 17-year old 
killer was convicted in 1992, two years before Bill C-41 was 
passed. This offender was granted the benefit of a law passed 
retroactively. Yet the justice minister claimed Bill C-45 could not 
be applied to Clifford Olson because of the principle of 
retroactivity.
<P>
	Why does retroactivity apply to killers only when it is in their 
favour?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as I 
have indicated, the government has brought forward many 
effective measures to improve efficiency and effectiveness. It has 
taken many measures to improve the criminal law. It is far more 
effective, efficient and legal than that contained in the Reform 
platform, Operation Crime Spank or whatever it is called.
<P>
	We have worked with the provinces, victims groups, police 
organizations, many other groups and individuals across the 
country to improve the criminal law. When it comes to the criminal 
law the Reform Party reminds me of proud parents watching 
10,000 marching soldiers and noting with pride that their son is the 
only one in step.

<P>
	The Department of Citizenship and Immigration has refused to 
grant a visitor's visa to Vedran Smailovic, the world renowned 
cellist from Sarajevo. Immigration officials rejected Mr. 
Smailovic's request for a visa because he does not have a valid 
reason to visit Canada, although he has been invited to come by a

to Vedran Smailovich, a man of peace?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and

not yet understood our immigration laws since 1993, we have a 
serious problem here. He is fully aware that the Privacy Act 
prohibits any public discussion of a particular case.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> The minister has 
discretionary powers in this matter, but this is not all. Canadians 
and Quebecers will judge this government harshly because of its 
discriminatory policy regarding visas.
<P>
	Mr. Smailovic has visited several countries and has never sought

	<B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
minister of agriculture will know that in a rare spirit of 
co-operation dairy producers, dairy processors and the government 
agreed that a move to one-price adjustment per year would occur 
on February 1. This scenario will leave dairy producers in a 
six-month period where they will be producing milk below their 
cost of production.
<P>
	What possible rationale can he give for announcing that the 
consumer subsidy phase out would start August 1 rather February 
1, 1998?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the provision the hon. gentleman is 
referring to was contained in the 1996 budget. Since the budget has 
been in the public domain and subject to public discussion, dairy 
producers and dairy processors have made the argument, which has 
behind it some considerable force of logic, that it would be more 
convenient and more economically efficient in our dairy system to 
consider any appropriate price changes at the beginning of 
February, not on January 1 but on February 1 as opposed to August 
1 which has been the tradition over a number of years.
<P>
	The recommendation of both the processors and producers is

<P>
	<B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, obviously 
the minister did not pick up on my tenor and tone very well.
<P>
	As I am sure he already knows, producers have agreed to forgo a 
2.1 per cent increase in the price of milk which amounts to a $40 
million saving to Canadian consumers. I am not talking about an 
endorsement of supply management but about keeping up his end 
of the deal.
<P>
	Will the minister agree to do that today? A lot of dairy producers 
would like to see him keep up his end of the deal.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the arrangements with respect to 
the phasing down of the dairy subsidy over a number of years is a 
matter that involves considerable technical consideration. It is not 
the sort of proposition that is just scribbled down on the back of an 
envelope.
<P>
	Accordingly I have had lengthy discussions with the dairy 
industry. I am scheduled to meet with the dairy farmers of Canada 
again later this afternoon. There is a good spirit of positive 
co-operation in trying to find the appropriate mechanism that will

the committee has endorsed the acceptance by Canada of the 20

<P>
	Given what I know of what the Minister of Health repeatedly

patent protection, I ask him what he is prepared to do about the 
situation. Is he not disappointed in the committee's report? Is he 
prepared to say at this time, if the government is not prepared to 
condemn the committee's conclusions, that the Liberals have 
finally, clearly, absolutely and truly broken their promise to the 
Canadian people with respect to Bill C-91?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
not wanting to concur with the preamble of the hon. member's

Bill C-91. Ministers will have an opportunity to examine it at a

<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question.
<P>
	A hunt under the migratory birds convention is simply illegal 
because the American Congress has not yet ratified the 
amendments to that convention. In terms of any hunt, we have to 
wait, hopefully sooner rather than later, for Congress to ratify the 
amendments to the convention.
<P>
	A few days ago we announced that last year there was a limited 
kill but it was not a successful program. The birds were to be left on 
the ground to scare the other birds. What happened was the birds 
were not left on the ground and, therefore, none got scared.
<P>
	This year we adjusted the arrangements. There are three fields 
which will hopefully attract those birds as they migrate from the 
south to the north in the hopes that the farmers' areas will not be 
afflicted as they have been in the past.
<P>
	It has the support of the round table of interest. It is the 
overwhelming consensus. Clearly we should listen to local 
interests in trying this method because last year the system did not 
work as well as we would have hoped. Then we can, obviously, at 
the end of the migration period review the situation for next year.

<P>
	<B>Mr. StÃ©phan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean):</B> Mr. Speaker, this is 
probably my last speech of this 35th Parliament. It went by very 
fast. It was very little time indeed, compared to all my hon. 
colleagues.
<P>
	I would like to take this opportunity to thank my constituents in 
the federal electoral district of Lac-Saint-Jean. As I said in my 
maiden speech, they have put their trust in me. They were not sure, 
in fact there was some controversy about it, whether they should 
put their trust in someone who did not have any experience in 
politics, wondering if it would lead to disaster if the riding of 
Lac-Saint-Jean was represented by a young, inexperienced person.
<P>
	A year later, I am pleased to note that we can trust our young 
people, notwithstanding their lack of experience. I think things 
have gone rather smoothly this past year.
<P>
<B>(1510)</B>
<P>
	I did not have time to bring certain projects to full fruition, 
including OpÃ©ration Maillage, a networking operation designed to 
bring together persons with different skills. It will probably not get 
under way before the election, but after, and I am very pleased 
because we will have successfully developed a new concept in 
Alma. People who have an idea for business, an entrepreneurial 
potential, and those who are looking for a business partner could 
get together and share their respective skills. Small businesses 
should emerge, that will create jobs.
<P>
	Second, we will recall that, on the evening of December 29, as an 
elected member faced with a problem, I called a public meeting 
and I said: ``You must take an active part, not only by paying your 
taxes and going to the polls every four years, but also by getting 
your ideas across''.
<P>
	As the saying goes, two heads are better than one. I have put my 
trust in the people, and they have come up with solutions: a dozen 
policy thrusts we have been working on since January. People came 
up with a number of concrete proposals. I am delighted with what 
is happening in my riding.
<P>
	Finally, it was a pleasure to work with my colleagues in the Bloc 
Quebecois, and I hope I will be able to continue to do so during a 
subsequent term. We hope so, and it is very likely we will, because 
we intend to run this campaign with a lot of determination.
<P>
	Sometimes people ask me: ``Do you really want to start 
campaigning again after just one year?'' I think it is wonderful for 
an elected representative to get back on the campaign trail just a 
year after being elected. During your first campaign, you are not 
too sure how everything works, but now, a year later, when I go 
back to my constituents, I will be able to tell them first hand about 
what happens in the House of Commons.
<P>
	I wanted to make this little aside since this will be my last speech 
in this 35th Parliament. I must say it was a wonderful experience, 
and I hope I will be able to repeat it in the years to come.
<P>
	Now, back to Bill C-65. I started my speech before oral question 
period and had to stop because of lack of time. I had started on my 
general comments, the reasons we more or less agreed or did not 
agree at all with the bill.
<P>
	Bill C-65 directly threatens areas under provincial jurisdiction. 
In fact, the Liberal government is using the requirements of the 
United Nations Convention on the Conservation of Biological 
Diversity as an excuse to encroach on areas under provincial 
jurisdiction.
<P>
	This comes as no surprise. It is the usual duplication story. 
Expertise has been developed in the provinces, including Quebec, 
where we already have legislation to protect biodiversity, 
legislation that goes back to 1989. The provinces had the expertise. 
They knew the field. Everything was fine. However, the federal 
government is now intruding on these jurisdictions. In fact, there is 
something in the Constitution about this, but unfortunately, they 
want the prestige. They want this federal institution to have some 
prestige.
<P>
	Actually, I find it hard to explain. Perhaps our colleagues 
opposite could explain the purpose of this intrusion, but I do not 
understand it at all.
<P>
	Furthermore, Bill C-65 respects neither division of powers 
provided under the Constitution nor its traditional interpretation, 
because it is based on a much  broader interpretation of the 
definition of federal territory and because the government does not 
respect the joint constitutional responsibility it shares with the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10190"> 10190 </A></B>
<P>
provinces with respect to certain species. This is in line with what I 
said earlier.
<P>
<B>(1515)</B>
<P>
	Third, Bill C-65 gives the Minister of the Environment broad 
discretionary powers, including that of appointing the members of 
COSEWIC, listing species identified as threatened or endangered 
by COSEWIC and implementing recovery plans.
<P>
	The same problem arises on the subject of interference in 
jurisdictions. The bill provides that the minister will have broad 
discretionary powers, including with respect to decisions on 
appointments to COSEWIC. It reminds me of a lot of other bills. 
When a committee is to be struck, it is always the minister who 
gets to appoint his buddies. I listened to my colleague from 
Frontenac speaking on this earlier. The situation is an unfortunate 
one because the little Liberal family will remain cloistered, not 
really open to the public. They appoint their buddies, their pals, to 
pay off their debts.
<P>
	I could go on at length because this really bothers me. What 
about all the Liberal candidates who were defeated in the 1993 
elections? I think some 40 of them are now working in the 
Canadian public service, simply because they had good contacts, 
they did the party a favour and are being paid back. That is 
democracy for you.
<P>
	This is all the time I have. I therefore wish you a fine election, 
Mr. Speaker. I hope to see you in September.

	<B>Mr. Bernier (MÃ©gantic-Compton-Stanstead):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
could you determine whether or not we have a quorum?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> No, we do not have a quorum. Call in the 
members.
<P>
<B>(1520)</B>
<P>

<P>
	<I>And the count having been taken:</I>
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> We have a quorum. Debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Francis G. LeBlanc (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point 
of order. I believe if you seek it you will find consent for the 
following:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That all motions at report stage of Bill C-65 be deemed to have been put and a 
recorded division requested and deferred once debate is completed for each 
grouping.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleague, let me understand. This morning 
we had a motion, by unanimous consent, that all motions were to be 
deemed to be moved and seconded.  Do I understand the hon. 
member correctly that he is adding something to that? Is there a 
word in there that I have missed? They are deemed to be moved and 
seconded.
<P>
	<B>Mr. LeBlanc (Cape Breton Highlands-Canso):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
you will have to bear with me. I am following instructions. They 
have been deemed to have been put and a recorded division 
requested and deferred once debate is completed for each of the 
groupings.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I understand. Does the hon. member have the 
permission of the House to put the motion?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Laurin:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask a question. We 
might agree to the motion being moved, depending on its content. 
But I believe that in the motion, my hon. colleague is asking that 
the motions be deemed moved and the divisions deferred.
<P>
	If the divisions are deferred, to when will they be deferred? If it 
is later today, that is one thing, but if it is Monday, that is altogether 
different. I would like the motion to specify when the divisions will 
be deferred to and then we will see if we can support it.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> To answer your question, dear colleague, usually 
all divisions are deferred to the end of the debate. If this is today, 
fine, if it is another day, this is fine too. Usually, it is at the end of 
the debate. Does this answer your question?
<P>
<B>(1525)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Laurin:</B> Mr. Speaker, in that case, I believe my colleague's 
motion is useless. He moved that the divisions be deferred. When 
the debate ends, we will ask that the divisions be deferred. Does 
this motion still serve any purpose then?
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My dear colleague, it is not up to the chair to 
decide when the debate will end, it is up to the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Laurin:</B> We could ask my colleague.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> We will put the question to our colleague and we 
will see if he has an answer.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keyes:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. Just for 
clarification for the House and the Bloc members opposite, what 
we are trying to do here is precisely what we have done in the past, 
with Bill C-44 for example. We can speed up debate on this 
particular issue, but at the same time group these amendments so 
that these amendments can be dealt with at the end, rather than 
individually throughout the whole period. We are speeding up 
debate so that everyone will have a chance to speak and then we are 
grouping these at the end of the day so that we can deal with them 
at once at the end.
<P>

<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I would put a question to the hon. member for 
Cape Breton-Highlands-Canso. Do you, my colleague, want to 
put it to a specific time? I think that is what the question is. If 
you could indicate this to me, we could get this straightened out.
<P>
	<B>Mr. LeBlanc (Cape Breton Highlands-Canso):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my understanding is it is until the next sitting day. Does that make 
sense to you?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> At the next sitting of the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Laurin:</B> If the motion moved by my colleague means that he 
wants to defer to the next sitting, then we support it.
<P>

<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Does the hon. member have permission to put the 
motion?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier (GaspÃ©):</B> To be even clearer, I understand that we 
have to vote, but the final vote can be deferred, this is fine. I still 
would like to understand the motion moved by the member for 
Cape Breton Highlands-Canso.
<P>
	There are five groups of motions. Does this mean that the 
divisions on Group No. 1, Group No. 2, Group No. 3, Group No. 4 
and Group No. 5 will only take place at the end? There will be no 
need to have five members rise to ask they be put to the vote.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Laurin:</B> That is right. They will all be deferred to Monday.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keyes:</B> Yes, Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is absolutely 
correct. We will move all those to the end of today when the 
Speaker will call for the bells to ring and then at that point we will 
defer the vote until Monday.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Does the hon. member have permission to put the 
motion?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> You understand the terms of the motion. Do you 
agree to the terms of the motion?
<P>

<P>
	First correction, it was not a householder. It was a 10 percenter. 
However, there is a mystery involved here. I demand that there be 
some attempt to solve this mystery.
<P>
	There were only two places where that 10 percenters existed 
yesterday on the Hill. One of them was in my office and the other 
was in boxes in the post office on the first floor of the West Block.
<P>
	It may be just a coincidence that the member for North

somehow obtained a copy of that publication.
<P>

he would be raising a question of privilege?

<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I understand there is a mystery here. I will tell you

	<B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to participate in this second round of debate on the 
amendments.
<P>
	This bill is one which presents a topic that most Canadians are in 
support of, the protection of endangered species. However, this bill 
as it is crafted creates many problems, problems for land owners 
and users, problems for those who have a sincere concern for those 
endangered species, because it not only threatens the land owners 
and the users and people who enjoy that land, it is also an 
endangerment to the species that are threatened themselves.
<P>
	This is a bill that clearly has not been carefully thought through. 
I would like to begin by reading a short statement from Mr. Jack 
Munro, chairman of the Forest Alliance of British Columbia. He 
says: ``Firstly, you have an approach in this bill that does not pay 
nearly enough attention to social and economic impacts. I am not 
suggesting that the protection of threatened species is not worth 
paying a price, but I am saying that we should assess that price and 
be sure that we come up with a fair way of deciding who pays. The 
furthest this bill goes is the reference in clause 38 to the need for an 
evaluation of costs and benefits of research and management 
activities. Presumably that includes social and economic costs such 
as lost jobs if timber harvest is no longer allowed in a particular 
area. But where something as crucial as people's jobs and way of 
life is concerned, we should not have to presume anything. The 
government should have to do much more than merely a general 
evaluation of costs and benefits''.
<P>
<B>(1535)</B>
<P>
	In my mind the great difficulty of this bill is the lack of thought 
that has been put into it. Unfortunately the Minister of the 
Environment has not given any thought to how much Bill C-65 
would cost land owners and taxpayers as a whole. When asked at a 
committee meeting in February what cost he would be willing to 
impose on an individual or society, the environment minister 
replied: ``I have not thought of that threshold''.
<P>
	No wonder Canadians are worried about the impact this 
legislation will have on their lives. The minister responsible for 
Bill C-65 has not even considered their needs. He has not even 
taken time to think through the possibility that Bill C-65 may have 
enormous negative  effects on the lives of Canadians, as well as the 
economic effect on our nation as a whole. This kind of tunnel 
vision is characteristic of this government as it attempts to legislate 
for the benefit of one special interest group after another, without 
keeping in mind the Canadian people as a whole and their needs 
and the benefits that they deserve and the enjoyment that they are 
entitled to.
<P>
	There is a flavour of the legislation from so many areas that this 
government presents that is of deep concern to me. I am concerned 
about a general attitude of moving responsibility of matters from 
the House, from Parliament, to the cabinet table with the increasing 
amount of discretion that is built into legislation for ministers and 
avoiding accountability to Parliament, to the elected 
representatives of the people.
<P>
	What I have just outlined are several flaws in this endangered 
species legislation, Bill C-65. For these reasons Reformers, while 
we are favour of the protection of these endangered species, cannot 
support this bill. It needs to be changed. It has to be changed to 
receive the support of the Canadian people. This bill needs to be 
entirely rewritten. It needs to go beyond the interests of special 
interest groups and their agendas.
<P>
	Therefore Reform has put before this House 42 amendments to 
Bill C-65. These amendments would require the minister to 
consider the social and economic impacts prior to recommending 
what action should be taken regarding endangered species. The 
government should ensure fair compensation to land owners and 
users. The government should ensure co-operation by all those who 
are concerned and there should be a commitment most of all to the 
preservation of endangered species. That certainly is not in this 
bill.
<P>
<B>(1540)</B>
<P>
	There is a threat to land owners and users who make their living 
and derive their income from these sources. If they are told that 
their land may be subject to being cut off or protected for an 
endangered species and their economic benefits may be taken away 
from them, what would be their reaction? The ranchers and the land 
owners have said the reaction would be simply to plough under, to 
destroy, to get rid of it so the threat would be taken away.
<P>
	That is not what we are trying to achieve. What we are looking 
for is a legitimate and fair means of protecting the endangered 
species of this country.
<P>
	I encourage the House to pass these constructive, fair and even 
handed amendments which the Reform Party has brought to Bill 
C-65.
<P>
	To state it briefly, we have three things in mind. We might 
consider them the three Cs for the endangered species. The first is 
there should be a commitment made by all to the preservation of 
endangered species. The second is there should be fair 
compensation for those who suffer a loss or who are deprived for 
some reason 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10194"> 10194 </A></B>
<P>
in  the course of the protection of endangered species. The third is 
there should be co-operation.
<P>
	There should be a commitment, there should be co-operation and 
there should be compensation. If these three Cs were adhered to, 
and if these objectives were written into the bill, Reform would 
have no difficulty in supporting it.
<P>
	I remind the House that Reform supports the responsible 
protection of endangered species but it does not support Bill C-65 
as it is written. This bill needs to be entirely rewritten. Therefore if 
the government refuses to pass Reform's 42 amendments, I will be 
voting against Bill C-65.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gar Knutson (Elgin-Norfolk, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
listened attentively to the comments of the opposition parties and I 
want to make a few comments about the first group of 
amendments.
<P>
	Members of the Reform Party made two main points. First, they 
felt this legislation was similar to the legislation in the United 
States and that we would have major upheaval similar to the 
upheaval the Americans have had in their forest communities 
because of the owl. I want to point out that this legislation is not at 
all like the legislation in the U.S. It is actually more similar to the 
legislation in Ontario and other provinces, where there have not 
been major disruptions. There has not been a major infringement 
on land owner rights.
<P>
	Members of the Reform Party should stop whipping up all of this 
misinformation regarding the bill. They should read it for what it 
is, do their research and appreciate that we are not in an American 
jurisdiction and the laws are applied quite differently.
<P>
	The other point they make concerns compensation. If they knew 
anything about Canadian law they would know that the right to 
compensation when a public authority takes away a private right is 
well founded in law and that people would be eligible for 
compensation, regardless of whether it is in this bill or not. It is a 
well founded principle in common law.
<P>
	The point more generally is that the protection of species can 
only be met through co-operation and partnership, since no single 
jurisdiction acting on its own can meet the needs of all endangered 
species. The beluga whale, the whooping crane and the horned owl 
do not recognize political boundaries.
<P>
	We will be able to protect species at risk only through a 
partnership with the provinces, the territories, municipalities, 
private land owners, farmers, the environmental and scientific 
communities, aboriginal peoples and individual Canadians. The 
co-operative approach has had many successes. The peregrine 
falcon, for example, last year nested in Toronto for the first time in 
over 40 years. It is making a comeback, thanks to the dedicated 
work of hundreds if not thousands of people at  all levels of 
government and in communities across the country.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	Biologists from Timber West Forests and MacMillan Bloedel 
have been working with provincial governments to relocate the 
Vancouver Island marmot to the Nitinat alpine tundra. The handful 
of marmots in the Nanaimo watershed represent the entire world 
population. The relocation project is an effort to restore the species 
to an area it may have once occupied. These are examples, and 
there are many more, of what co-operation has done and can do.
<P>
	In the Canadian context, we must begin with the understanding 
that species protection is a shared jurisdiction. It is not exclusive to 
either provincial governments or the federal government. All levels 
of government see the necessity and the benefits of working 
together on behalf of nature. There is a long history of co-operation 
with the provinces and territories to protect endangered species. 
Continued co-operation among all levels of government will be 
essential to the success of species recovery efforts.
<P>
	In Charlottetown last year agreement in principle was reached on 
the national accord for the protection of species at risk. The accord 
recognizes that co-operation and collaboration are crucial to the 
conservation and the protection of species at risk. Conservation of 
species at risk is essential to conserving biological diversity in 
Canada.
<P>
	Governments must play a leadership role in providing sound 
information and measures for conservation and protection. 
Complementary federal, provincial and territorial legislation and 
programs are needed to effectively address species conservation. 
Last but not least, Canadians must be involved.
<P>
	The accord commits governments to providing complementary 
legislation and programs that provide for an effective protection of 
species at risk in Canada. The accord recognizes the Committee on 
the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada as a source of 
independent advice on the status of species at risk nationally.
<P>
	Finally, the accord establishes a ministerial level council for the 
conservation of Canadian endangered species. This council will 
provide the political direction and energy necessary to make the 
accord a success.
<P>
	Four provinces, Manitoba, Quebec, New Brunswick and Ontario 
currently have endangered species legislation. Nova Scotia has just 
recently introduced an endangered species bill and the sky has not 
fallen. Other provinces and territories have programs specifically 
aimed at the protection of species at risk.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10195"> 10195 </A></B>
<P>
	The government, through Bill C-65, will meet its commitment 
under the national accord for the protection of species at risk. This 
legislation meets our international obligations on the Convention 
on Biological Diversity.
<P>
	In the same vein, the Minister of the Environment recently 
signed on behalf of the government a framework for co-operation 
and protection of the recovery of wild species at risk that occur in 
both the United States and Canada.
<P>
	The framework for co-operation will encourage partnerships 
with all levels of government in both countries and the private 
sector in endangered species recovery efforts. Both agencies will 
develop a joint work plan and an initial list of shared priorities 
species by December 1997. I say bravo to the governments in both 
the United States and Canada for making such an historic 
agreement.
<P>
	In recognition of the continental nature of endangered species 
and their habitat, Canada and the United States also intend to invite 
the participation of Mexico in the framework for co-operation. This 
cross-border co-operation is very important. For example, the 
monarch butterfly, added to our list at risk only last week, faces 
ongoing threats to its wintering habitat in Mexico. The monarch 
butterfly launches from two points in Ontario, one being in Long 
Point in my riding and then to Mexico where oftentimes it faces the 
danger of insecticides as well as a variety of other dangers. It is 
only through shared co-operation between Ontario and Mexico that 
we can properly protect the monarch butterfly.
<P>
	Bill C-65 reflects the importance of federal leadership in the 
protection and recovery of our international cross-border species at 
risk. The federal government will ensure that these species receive 
immediate protection on listing and will lead recovery planning 
efforts, both within Canada and with our international partners.
<P>
	This legislation is truly an example of co-operation. It does not 
replace action at the provincial level, it enhances it. It does not 
replace existing provincial frameworks, it enhances it.
<P>
	The bill represents the traditional and constitutional roles that 
each jurisdiction has played in wildlife protection and 
conservation. New provisions have been introduced to more clearly 
recognize provincial and territorial authorities with respect to the 
management of endangered wildlife species.
<P>
	In fact, in a letter to provincial governments, the federal 
government indicated its willingness and active interest in 
negotiating an equivalency agreement for the protection of 
international cross-border species. The bill recognizes that habitat 
protection is a fundamental requirement for the protection of a 
species.
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
	We have difficult challenges to face. Our wetlands have been 
reduced by 70 per cent to 80 per cent in some parts of Canada. Old 
growth forests are down by 85 per cent to 90 per cent in some areas. 
Tall grass prairie has diminished by 99 per cent since the earliest 
settlements. The less natural habitat we have, the more important it 
is to protect what is left.
<P>
	Under this bill, when a species is listed, anything that causes 
damage or destruction to its residence, whether a den, a nest or a 
burrow, will be prohibited. The legislation also goes beyond the 
protection of just the immediate residence of a given species. 
Recovery plans must address all threats to the survival of a species, 
including threats to critical habitat.
<P>
	We will rely on scientific experts to tell us what constitutes a 
critical habitat and what measures are necessary for its protection. 
We owe it to future generations to make sure that the wildlife that 
exists in Canada in the 20th century is still here in the 21st century 
and beyond.
<P>
	This is an important bill. I believe that preventing species from 
becoming extinct is an honourable goal, a goal that will ensure that 
our children and grandchildren inherit a country as rich in wildlife 
as the one we enjoy today. I call on all members of the House to 
support the bill.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (GaspÃ©, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it gives me great 
pleasure to speak to the motions in Group No. 2 on Bill C-65.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois moved some motions in this group. First of 
all, I would like to draw the attention of the members, and of our 
viewers, to some points. I see members from the other side waving 
at me, so I will reply with a similar motion.
<P>
	The Bloc moved several motions in this Group No. 2: Motion 
No. 2, Motion No. 16 on Clause 3, Motion No. 21 on Clause 5, 
Motions Nos. 24 and 26 on Clauses 7 and 8, Motion No. 44 on 
Clause 33 and Motions Nos. 49, 55, 64 and 68.
<P>
	The main purpose of theses motions is to repeat for the 
government, and enshrine in the legislation, the principle stating 
that there should be some joint action by the provinces and the 
federal government instead of a supremacy like the one the 
Minister of the Environment seems to be going after in Bill C-65.
<P>
	Let me remind the House that when the present environment 
minister developed Bill C-65-although develop might be too big a 
word-I see some of my colleagues turning around, but we never 
know how the environment minister might interpret something. Let 
me rephrase this. The minister initiated the process leading  to Bill 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10196"> 10196 </A></B>
<P>
C-65 during a meeting of provincial and federal ministers which 
took place in September 1996.
<P>
	That meeting resulted in the signing of an agreement in 
principle, a national agreement as they called it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> More like sweating.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier (GaspÃ©):</B> Yes, I am told that the minister and his 
colleagues sweated out an agreement in principle.
<P>
	I will come back to my own train of thoughts. This resulted in 
Bill C-65. It was presented as a national agreement, whereby they 
all agreed on a system to come up with a list of endangered species 
in Canada.
<P>
	The provincial environment ministers almost fell off their chairs 
when they learned, at the end of October 1996, a mere 30 days after 
the so-called national agreement, that the minister had brought 
forth a bill.
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
	In just thirty days, he came up with legislation that will allow 
him to decide how the list of species will be drawn up and which 
measures will be used to protect these endangered species.
<P>
	When it comes to protecting the environment, or threatened 
wildlife, everybody is in agreement. The Bloc Quebecois agrees 
that endangered species should be protected. The Quebec 
environment minister is also of the same opinion. However, what 
we disagree with is the process followed by the minister.
<P>
	In Quebec, we already have legislation to protect endangered 
species and regulations to protect them. Why is the Minister of the 
Environment in Ottawa giving himself the power to act on our 
territories? We were prepared to work in co-operation with him. 
Why does he want to go over the heads of the provinces? That is the 
rub.
<P>
	I have a few quotes I would like to share with the House. Bill 
C-65 came about because Canada wanted-and I think Quebec, as 
a future country, will do likewise-to comply with the UN 
international convention on biological diversity signed in 1992. 
This convention calls for signatory states to develop and enforce 
the legislation and other statutory provisions required to protect 
threatened species and populations. I am referring to article 8(k) of 
the convention.
<P>
	Was it necessary for Canada to have Bill C-65 apply from coast 
to coast, when four provinces already have provisions and 
legislation protecting their environment and threatened species? 
They already have regulations providing for the protection of these 
species. I think that, once again, Ottawa is looking for 
confrontation with the provinces, which do not want anyone 
interfering in their jurisdictions.
<P>
	In their red book, the Liberals said they had, and I quote: ``a 
vision of a society that protects the long term health and diversity 
of all species on the planet''. We  could live with that, since Quebec 
and other provinces, like Ontario, Manitoba and New Brunswick, 
already had their own legislation. All they had to do was to urge 
their provincial counterparts who did not have similar legislation to 
pass some or at least to exclude those provinces which had 
legislation. But that is not what is happening here. You will 
understand that the Bloc Quebecois cannot accept that the current 
Minister of the Environment is grabbing that much power.
<P>
	To make it quite clear what I mean when I say we represent the 
interests of Quebecers, I would like to quote the Quebec 
environment minister, Mr. Cliche, who signed the agreement 
establishing how the list of threatened species should be drawn up. 
But this was an agreement in principle basically indicating that the 
signatories agreed with the idea. It was then up to each of them to 
enforce it at home.
<P>
	On October 2, 1996, Mr. Cliche said: ``We cannot remain 
indifferent to the fact that this agreement opens the door to overlap 
between the future federal legislation and the act that has been in 
force since 1989-he is referring to the legislation in Quebec- an 
act that works well and has already proven useful. We risk creating 
more red tape instead of dedicating ourselves to what really matters 
to us: the fate of endangered species''. As you can see, whether it is 
the Bloc Quebecois, or the Parti Quebecois which currently forms 
the Quebec government, everyone wants to protect endangered 
species.
<P>
	However, we do not agree with the powers the minister is 
seeking with Bill C-65. If he wanted to make this legislation 
acceptable to the provinces and to the Bloc Quebecois, why did he 
not accept our amendments in committee, and why will he not 
accept the amendments that we are moving today, at report stage?
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
	Again, these amendments only seek to obtain some assurances, 
because there is a legal provision whereby none of this is formally 
spelled out. In other words, there is a procedural defect. The federal 
government is trying to interfere, to take responsibility over a 
greater territory on environmental grounds, but Quebec, Ontario, 
Manitoba and New Brunswick are not happy about this, because 
they already have their own legislation in place.
<P>
	In short, Bill C-65 gives very broad powers to the federal 
government regarding the protection of species and, to make things 
worse, this bill was concocted 30 days after an agreement was 
reached with the provinces. This about-face by the federal 
government irritated a number of provincial ministers.
<P>
	Again, after expressing his support for harmonization at the 
Charlottetown meeting, the current environment minister came up 
with an all encompassing bill that has too much impact on 
provincial jurisdictions. We ask  members opposite to come to their 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10197"> 10197 </A></B>
<P>
senses and to support the amendments proposed by the Bloc 
Quebecois.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
today we are debating Bill C-65 which attempts to bring in 
measures to protect endangered species.
<P>
	We have a rich natural environment in Canada, one of the richest 
in the world and we are very proud of it. It is an important part of 
our high quality of life. It is a wonderful heritage that must be 
preserved and protected for our children.
<P>
	The Reform Party's founding principle number five states: ``We 
believe that Canada's identity and vision for the future should be 
rooted in and inspired by a fresh appreciation of our land and the 
supreme importance to our well-being of exploring, developing, 
renewing and conserving our natural resources and physical 
environment''. In addition, Reform policies include a number of 
measures in the area of environmental reform including: 
sustainable development, co-ordinated action, pollution control, 
and environmentally sensitive zoning.
<P>
	Since environmentalists, forestry workers, farmers, ranchers and 
many other citizens play an integral role in the protection of 
endangered species, a variety of needs and interests must be 
respected and wisely balanced by our legislators and legislation.
<P>
	Bill C-65 gives the minister the power to make an emergency 
order to protect a species. Where this results in limiting the social 
or economic activities in an area, the losses and corresponding 
costs or financial burdens must be justly allocated.
<P>
	Many present land users want to have their rights and concerns 
fairly addressed concurrent with the implementation of measures to 
protect our natural habitat. These include lost property values, 
curtailment of recreational opportunities, and withdrawal of land 
availability for economic activity. I am not satisfied that Bill C-65 
is at all adequate on this important point. We need to find ways to 
ensure proper compensation for citizens who lose current land use 
rights. This will require close consultations with interested 
stakeholders from all parts of the country.
<P>
	It is very interesting to note that a framework agreement was 
worked out, as other speakers have referred to, with some of the 
provinces with respect to protection of endangered species. In fact, 
the agreement was worked out among federal, provincial and 
territorial governments about seven months ago and here we have 
Bill C-65 which absolutely violates the framework agreement 
which was worked out among all levels of government.
<P>
<B>(1605 )</B>
<P>
	We have to ask ourselves how we as federal legislators can retain 
trust, credibility and co-operation within the  federation if we enter 
into a framework agreement and seven months later attempt to pass 
a bill which violates and ignores the agreement that was put into 
place.
<P>
	I have in my hand two letters from environment ministers. In as 
nice a way as possible they point out the outrage and concern of 
provincial governments at this repugnant action by the federal 
government and by the federal environment minister.
<P>
	In a letter dated January 24, 1997, Mr. Graham, the environment 
minister for New Brunswick writes to the federal environment 
minister:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I have been requested, on behalf of provincial and territorial ministers responsible 
for wildlife, to pass on to you our comments respecting Bill C-65.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He goes on to talk about the co-operative work that has been 
done over the last 25 years between all levels of government to 
preserve and protect endangered species, and in fact all species of 
wildlife in Canada. He then writes:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Through continued co-operation and hard work over the past two years of all 
provincial, territorial and federal agencies responsible for wildlife, the National 
Framework for the Conservation of Species at Risk in Canada was developed. This 
was a landmark achievement considering the biological and political complexity of a 
country as large, and as diverse in species and lands, as Canada. Political support for 
this framework and a clear commitment to improved endangered species 
conservation in Canada was formalized with the endorsement of the National Accord 
for the Protection of Species at Risk by all ministers responsible for wildlife in 
Canada at a meeting in Charlottetown, P.E.I. on October 2, 1996.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The letter goes on to say that Bill C-65 violates the provisions 
and intent of this accord and sets out specifically where it does so 
and where the concerns lie. If other members wish to review this 
letter, I would be happy to table it in the House. The letter ends:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We believe the National Accord and Framework are the model of what we can 
achieve co-operatively together. Surely this opportunity should not be lost because 
we were unable or unwilling to work together and resolve our differences. We 
understand that the standing committee will complete their review in early February. 
Obviously, there is urgency in addressing these issues.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Unfortunately the concerns that were so clearly and so 
specifically brought to the attention of the environment minister 
and members of the environment committee were unaddressed.
<P>
	I have a letter dated March 26, 1997 from the environmental 
protection minister of the province of Alberta. The minister writes:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I am writing to you to express my growing concern about proposed Bill C-65, the 
Canada Endangered Species Protection Act. All provincial and territorial ministers 
responsible for wildlife in Canada have identified several major concerns in the bill. 
The Hon. Alan Graham recently wrote to the Hon. Sergio Marchi on behalf of my 
colleagues and myself outlining these concerns.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10198"> 10198 </A></B>
<P>
	Minister Graham's letter is the one to which I just referred.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Standing Committee on Environment and Sustainable Development has 
completed its deliberations, and unfortunately, the majority of the concerns raised 
were not resolved.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The minister asked that the outstanding issues and concerns 
brought forward by the provincial and territorial governments be 
resolved. The minister points out the need to pursue a co-operative 
and harmonious approach involving provincial and territorial 
wildlife agencies in a collaborative effort to amend this legislation. 
Unfortunately again these agreements and discussions and the 
results of them have been largely ignored in this legislation.
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
	The point of my intervention and to tie together and sum up the 
material I brought forward is simply that there are two different 
approaches at the federal level to issues relating to the interests of 
Canada and Canadians. This protection of endangered species is 
only one example of the two approaches.
<P>
	The old approach and unfortunately the approach practised by 
this Liberal government has been a father knows best, made in 
Ottawa, we will decide approach. It does not matter that other 
stakeholders have concerns. It does not even matter if clear 
agreements are simply tossed aside. The approach is that somehow 
this federal government and its ministries can just ignore the 
wishes and even discussions that were agreed to by other levels of 
government and put into place its own framework.
<P>
	There is a better approach. The Reform Party believes that the 
federal government needs to focus its efforts on 10 clear areas of 
federal endeavour and otherwise co-operate with the provinces. It 
must allow the provinces to order their affairs to meet the unique 
opportunities and needs of their own areas. It is very clear from the 
material I put forward that this approach can and does work well.
<P>
	I urge the federal government to respect the jurisdiction and the 
involvement of the provinces and territories and withdraw this 
legislation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to rise to speak to this bill that 
concerns my riding to some degree.
<P>
	This bill may, at first glance, affect my riding since 
Berthier-Montcalm is located between Montreal and 
Trois-RiviÃ¨res. This riding includes all the islands of Sorel and 
Berthier where, every year, many migrating birds, some of which 
are endangered, come to spend a few days or a few weeks before 
leaving for other places.
<P>
	Unfortunately, even though it deals with endangered species, I 
have to say I am not in favour of this bill. It is not because its 
subject matter is not important, not  because it is not dealing with 
fundamental issues, but simply because I feel Bill C-65 does not 
respect provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	It is not the first time the federal government has tried to 
interfere in this area of jurisdiction, probably because it wanted to 
keep its 1993 election promises, its red book promises. This will no 
doubt remind you, Madam Speaker, of the time when the minister 
talked about ``a vision of a society that protects the long-term 
health and diversity of all species on the planet''.
<P>
	I am sure you remember that phrase from the red book. Although 
that vague commitment on endangered species can be interpreted 
in a number of ways, the red book contained more specific 
commitments which the government has not met. I would have told 
the government to forget about its promise, since this is an area of 
provincial jurisdiction. But, once again, the government has 
decided it wants to legislate in this area.
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	Hon. members will remember that, in Spring of 1995, the kite 
and flag lady, the current Deputy Prime Minister, then the 
environment minister, introduced a bill along the same lines as the 
bill before us today.
<P>
	At the time, there was such an outcry in the environment 
community and also in the provinces and among the people who 
have to enforce the law that a year later, after a cabinet shuffle, the 
new environment minister decided to call a meeting of 
environment ministers to try to reach an agreement.
<P>
	Indeed, on October 2, 1996, in Charlottetown, a famous city 
which has often left its mark on Canadian history, an agreement in 
principle was reached. However, if you were to compare the 
provisions of Bill C-65 with the so-called agreement in principle 
reached on October 2, 1996, you would soon realize that they are 
completely different.
<P>
	Either we do not speak the same language in this country or we 
do not understand the same things. However, a bird is a bird and a 
whale is a whale, but we do not seem to understand the same things 
when a bill has to be drafted to ensure the agreement comes into 
force.
<P>
	This is so true that on December 2 of the same year, the Quebec 
environment minister, David Cliche, wrote to the current federal 
Minister of the Environment to indicate that there were in fact 
some inconsistencies between the agreement in principle that was 
reached and the bill. I will not read the whole letter, because I know 
the minister has a copy, but for our viewers and the many Liberal 
members who are carefully listening, I would like to quote parts of 
the letter sent by Mr. Cliche.
<P>
	It says: ``Nor was it ever agreed that ratification of a treaty by 
Canada changed anything in the distribution of jurisdictions and 
gave the federal government exclusive  jurisdiction to implement 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10199"> 10199 </A></B>
<P>
the treaty''. The purpose of the treaty is still to protect endangered 
species.
<P>
	Further on, he adds: ``Under the pretext of protecting species at 
risk, the bill is in fact an attempt to rewrite or reinterpret the 
Canadian Constitution and the way it gives certain powers to 
various levels of government''. This is a minister of the Quebec 
National Assembly writing to the federal Minister of Environment 
to tell him: ``Listen. There are several differences between what we 
agreed upon and what there is in the act, in particular a marked 
difference in jurisdictions.''
<P>
	He says a little further: ``Thus the federal government's 
definition of federal land for the purposes of the bill has no relation 
to reality. We never understood that the management of fish stocks 
or inland or coastal waters navigation meant that the federal 
government had jurisdiction over all aquatic ecosystems, along 
with the seabed and the subsoil and the airspace above these 
waters''.
<P>
	The federal government took advantage of this legislation to 
provide more than was necessary and to try once again to go 
against Quebec's views, even on issues that I think are quite 
neutral, on which we could easily agree if people would truly 
respect the agreements in principle that have been hammered out 
and the Canadian Constitution. This is a minimum and this is not 
asking too much but, at this stage, it seems to be extremely difficult 
to agree on these factors.
<P>
	On Bill C-65, the Bloc Quebecois will be true to its mandate to 
protect Quebec's interests and those of the true Parliament in 
Quebec, that is, the National Assembly, since that is what all men 
and women of Quebec identify with. It was quite natural for us to 
propose amendments to the bill that would reflect that.
<P>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
	One motion requires co-operation between all levels of 
government. I understand that a migratory bird landing in the 
riding of Berthier-Montcalm can take off and land again in the 
riding of BeausÃ©jour. I can understand that and I think it requires 
co-operation between all levels of government.
<P>
	Motions Nos. 16, 24 and 26 call for the recognition of provincial 
primacy. Why? Simply to respect the Canadian Constitution. 
Nobody can accuse us, as members of the Bloc, sovereignists, 
nationalists and all the other ist-words, of not wanting to respect 
the Canadian Constitution in this House, the Constitution the 
Liberals across the way signed in 1982 and whose 15th anniversary 
they celebrated not too long ago. We did not celebrate that 
anniversary for other reasons.
<P>
	I think it is just normal to want to respect the Constitution which 
gives each level of government certain responsibilities, but it 
seems to be difficult.
<P>
	I will read to you Motion No. 24 so you understand that what we 
are asking is really not complicated. Here is what it says:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``(3) Notwithstanding subsection (2), no responsible minister may enter into an 
agreement under that subsection with an organization or person in a province unless 
the minister advises the provincial minister of that province of the responsible 
minister's intention to enter into the agreement with the organization or person, as 
the case may be, and the provincial minister informs the responsible minister that the 
government of the province does not object to the responsible minister entering into 
such an agreement with that organization or person.''</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It is crystal clear. In other words, we are saying to the federal 
minister that, if he wants to enter into agreements with 
organizations in Quebec, for example, he must simply inform the 
environment minister of that province.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, I could have spoken all afternoon about these 
important motions, but you are indicating to me that my time is up. 
Am I right? May I have the unanimous consent of the House to 
conclude my remarks? I need five or ten more minutes to finish my 
argument on these motions, if the House agrees.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> Is there 
unanimous consent of the House?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> Madam Speaker, I knew what I was saying 
was so interesting that I would easily have the unanimous consent 
of the House. I thank my colleagues, particularly the member for 
BeausÃ©jour who is smiling. For a minute I thought he was going to 
start applauding.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robichaud:</B> We are holding back.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> You are holding back, are you not?
<P>
	I was saying that with Motion No. 24 that we introduced, when 
all is said and done, it was very clear that the Government of 
Quebec had a say in all sorts of agreements that the federal 
government could conclude with respect to the bill on endangered 
species.
<P>
	There is another motion that is extremely important and that is 
along the same lines. I understand that the Chair has grouped the 
Bloc Quebecois's Motions Nos. 2, 16, 21, 24, 26, 34, 35, 44, 49, 55 
and 64 together because they are all similar. That is the logic we are 
using in the amendments to make it clear that provincial 
legislatures have the last word on agreements concluded with 
respect to endangered species.
<P>
	I would like to take this opportunity to point out the excellent 
work done by the member for Laurentides, who examined the issue 
in extraordinary detail. I think she had an extremely good grasp of 
the problems. She showed great initiative throughout. She took the 
time to consult her colleagues in the National Assembly so as to 
have a very clear position, to truly represent the greater interests of 
Quebec.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10200"> 10200 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
	When we defend the interests of Quebec, they are always 
paramount in our eyes because they affect us deeply. That is why 
we are here. The day after the election, we will still be here to 
defend the interests of Quebec, and all the more so, considering 
how things will be after the election.
<P>
	That being said, Motion No. 44 says:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(l.l) Where a provincial minister advises the Minister that the government of the 
province does not wish subsection (1) to apply in the province in respect of a wildlife 
animal species in so far as individuals of the species are found on lands in the 
province that are not federal lands, this subsection shall not apply to the species-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	So, here again, the purpose of the proposed amendment is to 
allow the provincial government to exclude species that the federal 
government would perhaps like to protect, but that the province, for 
all sorts of reasons, would not, or vice versa. All the motions we 
introduced are really along these lines, that is they seek to make it 
possible to establish very clearly the provinces' jurisdiction in this 
sector, which, in any event, comes under provincial jurisdiction. 
Yet the federal department wants to pass legislation in this area. We 
will allow it, with some extremely important modifications that 
will set things out clearly so that the agreement will be a good one.
<P>
	Immediately after sovereignty is achieved, Quebec will want to 
have agreements with the federal government and with the other 
provinces. I believe we are capable of demonstrating this with a bill 
such as the one we have before us at present.
<P>
	I do not want to take too much advantage of a good thing this 
Thursday, so I shall finish with this, a quote from the Quebec 
Minister of the Environment, David Cliche, who put Bill C-65 into 
its proper perspective with a concrete example. A bill which seems 
very ordinary at first glance, with which everyone ought to agree in 
order to protect little sparrows, can have some effects that are 
extremely important for the economy of Quebec when it is put into 
application.
<P>
	On November 26, 1996, David Cliche said the following: ``With 
Bill C-65, the federal government, under the pretext of protecting 
the harlequin duck-to take but one example-could intervene 
directly in our energy policy by saying that, in order to protect the 
harlequin, the Minister of Natural Resources could exclude a given 
river from hydro-electric development and rational use. This is a 
flagrant example of federal intervention in our areas of jurisdiction, 
an inconceivable intervention, and an unacceptable Canadian 
interference in our jurisdiction''.
<P>
	You see, this is just an ordinary little bill on which everyone 
agrees. We must protect the little sparrows, the whales and so on, 
from extinction. However, the  government could use this to 
encroach upon jurisdictions which are even more clearly provincial 
and even stall a sector of Quebec's economy, like the example I 
gave, for hydro-electric power.
<P>
	I have almost finished. He also said: ``The federal minister-I 
will not name him, because he does-has just introduced in the 
House of Commons a bill which has raised concerns in Quebec. I 
want to put this into context because it illustrates the difficulties of 
federal-provincial relations. Recently I represented Quebec in 
Charlottetown and I defended its interests in the area of 
environment and wildlife. We had an agreement. We had even 
signed an agreement whereby if the federal government introduced 
legislation on the protection of endangered species under federal 
control, it ought to respect provincial jurisdictions, especially 
territorial jurisdiction. We thought we had an agreement with 
Ottawa on the following principle, which is simple: If we agree that 
a species is endangered, it is the responsibility of the government 
which has jurisdiction over the land on which the endangered 
species is living to take action to protect its habitat and, hence, the 
species itself''.
<P>
	The minister added: ``The main problem Quebec has with this 
bill is that the federal government is changing the rules of the game 
completely by no longer establishing that the territory on which a 
species lives is also important for determining which jurisdiction 
applies. Instead, the federal government is trying to grab more 
power by extending the scope of the definition of federal land''.
<P>
	I could have quoted the minister more extensively, but this short 
excerpt allow us to clearly see that there is a problem. It shows 
especially that the presence of the Bloc Quebecois in this House is 
useful to make the connection between what happens in Quebec 
and what happens in Ottawa. Again, the Bloc Quebecois is here to 
defend Quebec's interests. We do so very well and we will continue 
to do so after the elections.
<P>
	I thank you for your co-operation and also for your smiling 
attention. I believe it was a smile of approval and I thank you for it.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak to the Group No. 2 amendments to Bill C-65.
<P>
	In my opinion, the amendments in this second group will not do 
very much to fix this legislation, which is clearly flawed. I would 
like to present some of the questions that I have received from 
farmers and ranchers in my part of the country and from outside of 
Alberta as well. I have grouped the questions which I think should 
be asked before the bill goes any further.
<P>
	I will refer to some letters, including a letter from the Alberta 
minister of environmental protection, Ty Lund, as well.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10201"> 10201 </A></B>
<P>
	What is Bill C-65? It is the government's new endangered 
species legislation. It is an attempt, and I think a very sincere 
attempt, to protect endangered species. As I go through my 
presentation, I am going to comment on what is likely to happen 
if this legislation, even as amended, is put in place.
<P>
	How was the bill born? Where did it come from and why? The 
groundwork for Bill C-65 was laid by the Mulroney government at 
the Rio conference. In 1992 Canada signed a global agreement that 
in part agreed to protect endangered species. Canada agreed to put 
some type of legislation in place that would protect endangered 
species. I believe this is a response to the commitment made by the 
Government of Canada.
<P>
	However, several things in the process that brought this 
legislation to the point it is now really are not acceptable to many 
Canadians. Some of them have been expressed by the Bloc 
members who feel that the government has really ignored the 
wishes of the province of Quebec. That has been backed up by the 
Alberta minister of environmental protection, Ty Lund.
<P>
	I want to read part of the letter he wrote to me regarding this bill. 
``I am writing to express my growing concern about the proposed 
Bill C-65, the Canada Endangered Species Protection Act. All 
provincial and territorial ministers responsible for wildlife in 
Canada have identified several major concerns in the bill''.
<P>
	The Hon. Alan Graham recently wrote to the Minister of the 
Environment on behalf of my colleagues and myself outlining 
these concerns. I have a copy of that letter. It was referred to earlier 
by my colleague from Calgary.
<P>
<B>(1635)</B>
<P>
	The Standing Committee on the Environment and Sustainable 
Development has completed its deliberations. Unfortunately, the 
majority of the concerns raised were not resolved.
<P>
	The amendments tabled on March 21, 1997 by the federal 
government do not address the issues and leave us with a bill which 
destroys the national approach outlined in the national accord for 
the protection of species at risk.
<P>
	The Alberta minister makes clear what is happening. The group 
of amendments which we are debating do not answer the questions 
and the concerns of the environment minister.
<P>
	The environment minister went on to say that Alberta is 
committed to fulfilling its role, as outlined in the national 
framework for the conservation of species at risk. The minister 
fully expects to honour the commitments that he made on behalf of 
the people of Alberta in that agreement.
<P>
	He states: ``I believe that the approach of co-operative programs 
and the complementary legislation  proposed in the framework is 
the only way to ensure endangered species conservation''. He goes 
on to say that the co-operative framework has not been followed in 
the development of this legislation. That has to be a concern. Bloc 
members have indicated that it is a concern to them. The New 
Brunswick minister who wrote on behalf of all the ministers to the 
federal Minister of the Environment made it clear that they are not 
happy with the process or the bill. The Alberta minister has 
supported that view.
<P>
	The government has taken a heavy-handed approach. It is the 
federal government and it will say how things are run in the country 
and to heck with what the people in the provinces feel. This is one 
more demonstration of that approach. I understand why Bloc 
members are upset. We in Alberta are every bit as upset.
<P>
	Western Canadians have revolted against the approach taken by 
past Liberal and Conservative governments. That is the reason the 
Reform Party is here today. We expect the provinces to have more 
say in more areas. We expect the federal government to not take 
this heavy-handed, interventionist approach which it has taken in 
so much legislation, including Bill C-65.
<P>
	Why are my constituents and others complaining about Bill 
C-65? There are many reasons, some of which I outlined this 
morning.
<P>
	Canadians want to protect endangered species with a 
co-operative approach. That co-operative approach has worked 
very well in the past in dealing with protecting certain species. For 
example, it has worked in the burrowing owl project. The Ducks 
Unlimited program has done much to build up the duck population.
<P>
	It has been a co-operative effort. It has not taken heavy-handed 
legislation. It has not taken the threat of fines. In this legislation the 
fines run up to $1 million. They can be levied against a land owner 
or a land user. The co-operative approach has not involved 
legislation which would require a land owner to spend money to 
fence property which happens to be the habitat of an endangered 
species. It has not taken that for Ducks Unlimited to work well or 
for the burrowing owl operation to work and other projects like 
them. Those people have taken a co-operative approach. This 
heavy-handed, interventionist approach is wrong. That is one of the 
major reasons people are complaining about this bill.
<P>
	Another reason is that there is very little allowance for 
compensation.
<P>
<B>(1640 )</B>
<P>
	It is totally inadequate. That again could force land owners or 
land users to spend money out of their own pocket to fence off an 
area to protect an endangered species. Land owners or land users 
could lose the productive capability of property with no 
compensation. In other words, they can be required to set this 
property  aside. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10202"> 10202 </A></B>
<P>
They could be kept from using the property yet there is no 
compensation.
<P>
	What kind of country is this where people can be denied the use 
of property, lose economically and receive no compensation? That 
is unacceptable. That is another thing that the people who I have 
talked to are revolting against.
<P>
	As well, because of the way this legislation is set up, people can 
launch anonymous complaints. They can have their identity kept 
anonymous, the complaint lodged and action taken against that 
landowner or the land user.
<P>
	Even someone committing a crime as violent as murder has the 
right to face the accuser in court and to know who the accuser is. 
Yet under this legislation Canadians are being denied that same 
right. It is completely inappropriate. That is another thing 
Canadians are revolting against when it comes to this bill.
<P>
	Further, there are the search and seizure measures which are very 
similar to those in Bill C-68, the so-called gun bill, which are 
unacceptable and which really put aside some of the basic, judicial 
procedures we accept in our justice system but that really are not in 
this legislation.
<P>
	This package of amendments in Group No. 2 will do nothing to 
deal with any of these concerns in a meaningful way.
<P>
	The best thing the Liberals could do with this legislation is to let 
it die. However, they should learn from it. Should they be 
government after the election, they can come forward with new 
legislation. If the Reform Party is government, then we will bring 
in legislation that will take a much different approach from this 
heavy-handed one.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (MÃ©gantic-Compton-Stanstead, 
BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, my colleague for BeausÃ©jour seems to be 
speculating about my chances to be back here, in this House, after 
the election. I would like to reassure him. I know he is about to 
leave us to assume other duties we do not know anything about yet. 
I wish him well. I suspect we will soon have a new Senator 
Robichaud in the other place.
<P>
	That said, it is a pleasure to speak to Bill C-65 dealing with 
endangered species. It is a very serious bill that interferes in areas 
of provincial jurisdiction. I will get back to this.
<P>
	It seems quite fitting to be discussing endangered species just 
hours from an election call. I want to draw a parallel with this 
absentee government, whose mind is elsewhere these days. One 
only has to watch Oral Question Period to realize that the ministers 
would rather be doing something else than answering questions.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	Considering the way this government's piecemeal approach, I 
can say, like my colleague from the Reform Party, who just 
announced that his party would form the next government, that the 
Liberal government opposite is certainly an endangered species 
nowadays.
<P>
	Our fellow citizens across Canada, and particularly in Quebec, 
are in a position to know we must get rid of this government. In 
fact, I would say the greatest threat is not that this government 
could be out, but that it could come back for another mandate, since 
we see, as I mentioned earlier, that the main concern of this 
government these days is to announce good news that the official 
opposition had been demanding throughout its mandate.
<P>
	This week there was the manpower agreement announced by the 
human resources development minister, after 32 years of 
negotiations, I might add. If this is not a record in terms of 
stretching out negotiations, it is certainly a good average. At this 
rate, not many colleagues in this House will see the results of the 
next negotiations dealing with who knows what, endangered 
species perhaps. At the rate negotiations are going, the very future 
of this federal government, of this institution, is in danger.
<P>
	Consider the intergovernmental affairs minister's attitude when 
the Quebec government asked for an amendment to the 
Constitution establishing linguistic school boards. The contempt of 
this government is obvious as election day nears.
<P>
	When it is not delaying a decision it should be taking now, such 
as the one on linguistic school boards, the government is 
announcing amendments to a bill that has yet to receive royal 
assent-and I am referring to the tobacco bill. The Prime Minister 
has succeeded in this incredible feat of announcing, even before 
Bill C-71, the Tobacco Act, received royal assent, that it would be 
amended next fall. It is quite an achievement. If ridicule could kill, 
we would no longer have a Prime Minister.
<P>
	That being said, I would like to deal briefly with Bill C-65 to 
point out how this bill is right in the tradition of this government. In 
their speeches, government members and the Prime Minister, who 
is here occasionally for question period, keep harping about how, 
these past few years, their government has been most open to the 
decentralization of our federation.
<P>
	But each time the government introduces a new bill, it proves 
otherwise. Back home we have an expression for that. We say the 
Prime Minister talks from both sides of his mouth. On the one 
hand, we are being told the government is more open to 
decentralization, but, on the other hand, whenever the government 
introduces a bill, like Bill C-65, it tries to centralize even more. 
The official opposition objects to this intrusion in a provincial 
jurisdiction. In 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10203"> 10203 </A></B>
<P>
the area of the protection of endangered  species as in many others, 
Quebec has already taken its responsibilities.
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	Since 1989, there has been a law concerning endangered species. 
There was a consensus in Quebec and all stakeholders asked their 
government, the Quebec government, to take action, which it did 
by adopting a bill that satisfied the aspirations and desires of the 
Quebec people.
<P>
	It was the same thing in Ontario, Manitoba and New Brunswick, 
the province you are from and of which you are justifiably so 
proud, Madam Speaker, which all adopted legislation on 
endangered species.
<P>
	But the federal government, as it usually does, decided not to 
take into account the desire of the provinces to take things into their 
own hands and solve their problems by talking to each other to 
ensure that their respective laws are in sync. But no, the federal 
government decided to barge in and take this area of jurisdiction 
away from the provinces so it could impose its own views and 
decisions.
<P>
	That is the essence of that bill. That is why the official 
opposition will take its responsibilities and defend Quebecers' 
interests as it always does when Quebec's jurisdiction is 
questioned, when Quebec's interests are threatened. And I know, 
Madam Speaker, that you are proud of the official opposition. We 
will vote against this bill and ensure that it will die on the Order 
Paper, so that we will not hear about it anymore, not only during the 
election campaign, but ever again.
<P>
	I would also like to point out that the government, by invading 
this field of jurisdiction, is creating more problems than it is 
solving, as is usually the case. It would have been much more 
productive and efficient if the government had simply asked the 
provinces to reach an agreement in this matter, if it had recognized 
that a lot of work had already been done since similar laws have 
been adopted in Ontario, Manitoba, New Brunswick and of course 
Quebec, in 1989. The enforcement of these laws takes necessarily 
into account the needs of the people.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, you are indicating that my time has expired. 
Since I respect the rules of the House, I will comply with your 
order and end my speech.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, it is my 
pleasure to speak to Bill C-65 and the Group No. 2 amendments 
before us that reference habitat and other necessities to protect 
endangered species across the nation.
<P>
	The bill is asking for a balance in legislation across the country. 
It is also asking for co-operative federalism where provincial 
government, municipal governments and local agencies are able to 
work with our national government and at the same time co-operate 
with other  countries touched by bird migration across the 
continent. That may even involve the rest of North America, South 
America and other adjacent lands that form part of the bird 
migration patterns of the world.
<P>
	When I think of one side of the balance where we must do 
everything possible to protect the endangered species, in terms of a 
cause it is good and noble we are working toward that. When we 
consider the aspect of protecting endangered species, we must 
ensure we take into consideration the players that will be involved. 
Private land owners, provincial lands, federal lands and adjacent 
nations need co-operative agreements.
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	I have looked at the legislation and have considered some of the 
content of the amendments in terms of habitat. Recently I saw a 
discussion of the specific bill on television. The person on the side 
of protecting all endangered species made a noteworthy comment 
at the time. He said that the legislation provided for protection of 
birds if they land in national parks, on federal buildings or on 
Parliament Hill. I thought maybe that was the way it was.
<P>
	Subsequently I received a letter from the Minister of 
Environment, as have other members of this assembly, in which he 
outlined the concerns of the provinces. He indicated that Bill C-65 
was more encompassing than just federal lands, national parks, 
federal buildings across the nation and Parliament Hill. The 
legislation was actually intervening, overlapping and interfering 
with provincial jurisdiction and responsibility. That is a major 
violation by the federal minister.
<P>
	The federal minister signed an accord with the provinces on 
September 25, 1996 called ``A National Framework for the 
Conservation of Species at Risk''. The accord was signed with the 
idea provinces would be able to administer, take the major 
responsibility and be independent from the federal government for 
writing legislation that would take away from the autonomy of the 
provinces or their responsibilities. An agreement was reached by 
all the provinces.
<P>
	They agreed to participate in the Canadian Endangered Species 
Conservation Council to co-ordinate activities and resolve issues 
for the protection of species at risk in Canada.
<P>
	They agreed to recognize the Committee on the Status of 
Endangered Wildlife in Canada as a source of independent advice 
on the status of species at risk nationally and to establish 
complementary legislation and programs that provide for effective 
protection of species at risk throughout Canada.
<P>
	The agreement listed a long list of specific kinds of things the 
provinces would commit to doing. They would refer any disputes 
that may arise under the accord to the Canadian Endangered 
Species Conservation Council for discussion.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10204"> 10204 </A></B>
<P>
	The provinces agreed, with the expectation that federal Minister 
of the Environment would write legislation to facilitate that kind 
of co-operation. That did not happen.
<P>
	Subsequently we received letters from the Minister of the 
Environment, as mentioned by my colleagues from Vegreville and 
Calgary North, indicating that the federal government did not live 
up to its commitment and has written legislation that duplicates and 
adds to the legal tangles or actions to be put in place by regulations 
to protect endangered species. That is unacceptable.
<P>
	In a time when provinces have matured to a point where they can 
take on responsibilities such as these, we should decentralize and 
give them the responsibilities. If there needs to be umbrella 
legislation to facilitate co-ordination or to fill in some of the 
blanks, the legislation would be acceptable.
<P>
<B>(1700 )</B>
<P>
	As the chairman of the provincial ministers, the minister from 
one of the maritime provinces points out very clearly that Bill 
C-65, even with the amendments of groups one to four and those 
introduced by the government to try to deal with matter, falls short 
of co-operative federalism. It is just not there. The minister, the 
government and the Liberal caucus have missed the point being 
made by the provinces.
<P>
	Recently there has been similar legislation to try to foster 
co-operation between the federal Minister of the Environment and 
the provincial ministers of environment. The legislation dealt with 
a variety of developments that would take place on the rivers of 
Alberta or on any other river across this nation.
<P>
	The province of Alberta wanted to put a dam on a river. We went 
through about 20 years of studies and hearings. Finally we decided 
to build a dam on the Oldman River in the Three Rivers area. At the 
point when the decision was made and construction had even 
started, the federal Tory government found a piece legislation to 
allow it to intervene and start the whole process of hearings again. 
It cost a lot of money and delay. Fortunately the provincial 
government was able to work through that and proceed with the 
building of the dam, which will be a great asset to our province for 
many years ahead.
<P>
	The lesson we learned was that the federal government had 
duplicate legislation that added difficulty to the process. It 
complicated and delayed the project, and it cost many dollars for 
the province of Alberta to answer interveners and so on and 
delayed construction. We learned a lesson. The legislation was 
changed.
<P>
	The federal government was able to write legislation that 
avoided overlap and duplication. We thought the House of 
Commons learned something but I guess it has not. With Bill C-65, 
the federal government has written legislation that infringes on the 
rights and responsibilities of provinces. I do not know if the 
bureaucrats are at  fault or who it is. You would think we would 
have learned something and would not do that again.
<P>
	I recommend in my remarks, which are probably my final 
remarks with regard to this legislation, that the government rethink 
its position. If it really wants to work with the provinces, as it says 
clearly in this supporting document which was passed around to all 
members of Parliament, then it better back off and put in place 
some kind of umbrella legislation that facilitates the provinces in 
doing their job. Then there would be no overlap or intervening 
process to take away from local autonomy.
<P>
	How can this kind of thing work for farmers who are affected? A 
major concern of my constituents is that if an endangered species is 
found on a piece of land, no compensation is listed here. The 
government only promises that a person who provides land for 
conservation will be recognized for that. It will be a donation of 
environmentally sensitive land and a partnership.
<P>
	My final statement is this. Why should one individual landowner 
have to take all of the cost to provide the land? That is the 
responsibility of all Canadians when endangered species are being 
protected.

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I rise to speak to Bill C-65.
<P>
	I want to point out right off that the bill before us exemplifies 
this government's approach to all legislation. Having sat here for 
some time now, we in the official opposition, the Bloc Quebecois, 
have accumulated a fair amount of knowledge about parliamentary 
life. We are more experienced. This is the result of three and a half 
years of parliamentary debate. And now we have a new ability: the 
ability to assess, based on facts, to what extent the legislation 
passed by the Liberal Government of Canada complies with the 
provisions of the Constitution and respects provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	Since it took office, this Liberal government tried repeatedly, 
through several bills tabled in this House, to meddle in areas of 
provincial responsibility, ignoring their respective jurisdictions as 
well as the terms of  federal-provincial agreements. In addition, as I 
was able to see for myself while participating in several debates on 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10205"> 10205 </A></B>
<P>
the reorganization of the Department of Industry, the Federal 
Office of Regional Development, the Federal Business 
Development Bank, now the Business Development Bank of 
Canada, this government took every opportunity, every time a bill 
was introduced, to give itself, the department or the minister 
responsible more powers, thereby gaining more and more control 
in recognized areas of provincial jurisdiction, without going 
through the federal-provincial consultation process.
<P>
	You will understand that, with the legislative experience it has 
gained, the official opposition now knows how to get in the way of 
the government's efforts to take powers away from the provinces 
by disregarding provincial jurisdictions.
<P>
	What does the government propose today? Bill C-65, the Canada 
Endangered Species Protection Act. I want to make four general 
observations before dealing more specifically with the bill.
<P>
	First, when we read the bill, we realize that, as usual, the 
provinces' jurisdiction and responsibilities are completely ignored 
and overlooked.
<P>
	Later on, I will point out some major contradictions by referring 
to statements made in the red book, and also by the environment 
ministers, both the former one, who is now the Deputy Prime 
Minister and Minister of Canadian Heritage, and the current one. 
This government, which always claims to want to co-operate and to 
establish partnerships with the provinces, does just the opposite 
with its bills. This government tries to get its hands on power. It 
gives itself special powers, at the expense of the partners it claims 
to respect.
<P>
	Second, this bill does not take into account the sharing of 
powers. The sharing of powers in areas that come under provincial 
jurisdiction has always been a burden for the federal government.
<P>
<B>(1720)</B>
<P>
	Even though the government tries, as it has always done, to 
convince Quebecers of its desire to create a partnership with them, 
it invariably comes up with bills that give increased power to its 
ministers, or that confirm such power.
<P>
	The provisions of the bill make it clear that the minister is giving 
himself a very broad discretionary power. This from a government 
which always claims to seek partnerships with others. Yet, it gives 
itself, through its own mechanisms, its department and its minister, 
very broad discretionary powers. In fact, after the talks on the 
internal trade agreement, this government went so far as to add to 
the bill things that had not even been mentioned in the discussions 
with the provincial ministers.
<P>
	But such is the way of this government. We all know that. 
Everyone knows the federal Liberal government, particularly in 
Quebec, given its pattern of the last 30 years, which consists in 
promising one thing but doing just the opposite once in office.
<P>
	This bill provides that the minister will appoint COSEWIC 
members. Later, I will define the COSEWIC, this committee set up 
to protect endangered species. The minister alone will make these 
appointments. It gives himself the power to do so. This government 
shares everything but, in the end, it always includes a little clause 
saying that ``as a minister, I will appoint those who will sit on the 
committee''. In discussions between the ministers and the 
provinces, they always say ``we are acting in good faith, we will 
make sure that everyone is represented, that there is representation 
from all parts of the country and everyone is included''.
<P>
	So what happens? They table a bill in which the minister has the 
authority to appoint people without consulting his partners. Is that 
partnership? Is that respect? They said in the course of discussions 
and negotiations that they would reach an agreement on committee 
membership. So the bill is tabled, and what does it say? It says the 
minister will appoint the members himself.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robichaud:</B> While respecting all parties concerned. 
Perhaps Bloc members are not mentioned, but that does not mean 
that-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> The minister will determine 
his own powers. I heard my Liberal colleague react, obviously, 
because the truth is not always pleasant to hear. Earlier, the hon. 
member for MÃ©gantic-Compton-Stanstead welcomed our 
colleague, who will probably be appointed senator one of these 
days. The Liberals need people to get a majority in the Senate and 
ensure they control the proceedings. They need people who are 
dedicated, and our colleague, this very lively Acadian, will 
probably be one of several future senators, and more power to him.
<P>
	Not only will the minister determine who will be appointed, but 
the bill on threatened and endangered species also says that the 
minister even has the power to decide which species will be 
designated as threatened or endangered. No ifs or buts. Some 
provinces and organizations across Canada have been involved in 
this for a long time, since 1978, but I will get back to that. And the 
minister proposes federal legislation that did not exist before.
<P>
	Provincial legislation exists in Quebec, Ontario, New Brunswick 
and Manitoba. But for the first time, the federal government goes 
and walks all over an area which, as far as jurisdiction is 
concerned, belongs to the provinces. So what does it do? It not only 
tables legislation but gives the minister the power to circumvent 
everyone and decide for himself which species will be designated 
threatened or endangered.

<P>

<B><A NAME="10206"> 10206 </A></B>

<B>(1725)</B>
<P>
	He will also have the power to decide whether or not to 
implement recovery plans once species are designated. He will 
have the decisive vote.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, you are signalling my time is up, although I 
thought I had 20 minutes. May I have the unanimous consent of the 
House to finish my speech? If there is unanimous consent, I would 
like to continue my speech.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> Does the hon. 
member have unanimous consent to proceed? I remind the House 
we have only five minutes left.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> I can finish my speech in 
five minutes.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> Is there 
unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> There is no 
unanimous consent.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> Democracy has spoken on 
the other side; the name of democracy on the other side is no.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier (MÃ©gantic-Compton-Stanstead):</B> Cheap!
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> Theirs is a no society, a

<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I thought it would be appropriate to say a few words on 
the endangered species act. I am tempted to make references to 
those across the way, with the election coming and so on. I could 
get into it for ages and we would all have great fun with it.
<P>
	This is a very serious bill. It is always difficult when there is a 
certain amount of emotion involved. We want to protect animals, 
wildlife and various endangered species in the country. We do not 
want to see anything being harmed or eradicated, not even 
members over there. We have to keep a few of them around. I 
cannot keep myself away from it.
<P>
	There are problems with a bill like this one. The government 
may have intended to come out with something very meaningful 
and something very worthwhile in terms of protecting endangered 
species. However, either because it was ill conceived or because for 
some reason it was put out the way it was, we have problems with 
it. People in communities, business, different organization and 
sports groups have problems with the bill.
<P>
	In a lot of other government legislation I have discovered 
through the committees I have sat on that there seems to be a very 
bad tendency. It is a style of government that caused me to get into 
government to  hopefully see some change in it. There are 
committee meetings to study legislation at that level and to get 
input from people who say what they like or do not like and what 
they want included, yet the government is not prepared to listen.
<P>
	I have participated in a couple of studies by committees when 
the input from the population, the voters, the taxpayers, has been 
overwhelming and the government for whatever reason chose to 
ignore it. I do not know why the government spends the money it 
does for consultation with the public if it is not prepared to listen. 
We heard a lot of concerns raised by industry, ranchers, farmers 
and people who go into the woods for recreation. Even they feel 
they may have problems.
<P>
	We put forward a lot of amendments. We want to support the bill 
but we simply cannot do so in its present form. We get into a real 
conundrum when the government says it is doing this to protect 
endangered species and anybody voting against it does not want to 
protect them. That is not true.
<P>
	In their heart of hearts members know that. It might be a little 
difficult for them to admit it on the eve of the election but they 
understand it. When we return to the House after the election in 
whatever make-up it is, maybe we can learn to work a little better 
together. I hope government, whichever government it is, will 
bring forward legislation and will listen to people. Hopefully it will 
listen to the points raised by the opposition and the public but it 
does not mean they will be automatically accepted. Sometimes of 
course there are at least two points of view in the public domain. 
These things have to be considered.
<P>
<B>(1730)</B>
<P>
	There were a lot of good amendments brought forward on this 
bill and they were rejected out of hand. That is very unfortunate. 
Had the government made these amendments to the bill, it would 
have found support. We could have moved the bill through the 
House quickly, even on the eve of the election.
<P>
	I hope when we return after the election that those members 
opposite will have learned to co-operate, perhaps with the 
opposition or perhaps as the opposition. I shall look forward to that.

	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.)</B> moved that Bill C-375, 
an act to amend the Agreement on Internal Trade Implementation 
Act, be read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10207"> 10207 </A></B>
<P>
	He said: Madam Speaker, I am pleased to speak to Bill C-375, 
which would allow the completion of the agreement on internal 
trade.
<P>
	The agreement on internal trade was signed in 1994. At that time 
several deadlines were set by the legislation. Almost all the 
deadlines have passed and agreement has not been reached. Clearly 
there is a problem which must be dealt with. It is important that we 
complete this agreement.
<P>
	I would like to explain what this bill would do. First I will give a 
little background on the events which led to the agreement on 
internal trade and the implementation bill, which is the legislation 
that Bill C-375 would amend to allow the completion of the 
agreement on internal trade.
<P>
	If we take a look at the sequence of events we will see that the 
committee on internal trade is comprised of trade ministers from 
federal, provincial and territorial governments. The agreement on 
internal trade, as I mentioned, was signed in 1994 by the federal, 
provincial and territorial governments. The agreement states that 
all governments will commit to work together to break down 
barriers to internal trade. That is the basic principle of the 
agreement on internal trade. The barriers which prevent free trade 
between the provinces will be brought down.
<P>
	We live in a country which has free trade agreements with the 
United States and Mexico. Goods move relatively freely between 
the countries, yet we have barriers between provinces which do not 
allow the free movement of goods. Clearly that is unacceptable.
<P>
	The present formula that the committee uses to reach an 
agreement, whether it is an agreement on completing the deal or an 
agreement on the dispute settlement mechanism, is a formula of 
unanimity. In other words, the agreement on internal trade 
stipulates that a consensus is required. However, consensus is not 
defined. The way this committee has chosen to interpret consensus 
is unanimous consent. Most areas are left incomplete after almost 
three years. To complete any area it requires unanimous consent 
from the federal government, the representatives from the 
provinces and the representatives from the territories.
<P>
<B>(1735)</B>
<P>
	When was the last time we had unanimous consent on any type 
of an agreement like that in this country, a consent which in some 
cases may cause some difficulties with certain groups in the 
provinces? Although, all provinces and territories have agreed that 
completing the agreement on internal trade will make things better 
for those living in every province.
<P>
	Unanimously all governments involved have agreed that 
completion of the agreement on internal trade will make things 
better and yet the completion has not happened.
<P>
	Clearly this unanimous consent formula is not going to work. 
My private member's bill, Bill C-73, simply changes the formula 
and puts in place the Reform policy on this issue. Instead of 
requiring unanimous consent it will require consent of at least 
two-thirds of the provinces and territories which includes at least 
50 per cent of the population.
<P>
	Then when the provinces are negotiating settlement in any one of 
these areas that are left incomplete the impossible task of getting 
unanimous consent will be removed and instead the requirement 
will be there for agreement from a majority of provinces and 
territories including a majority of Canadians, which is a much more 
reasonable formula and a formula which I believe if implemented 
would lead to the completion of the agreement on internal trade in 
all areas. There are many experts who agree with that, as I will 
demonstrate later.
<P>
	I would like to read through the actual Reform policy on this 
issue. The policy is that in order to break the deadlock which has 
prevented the completion of the agreement on internal trade and the 
removal of internal trade barriers, the Reform Party proposes to 
amend the approval formula of the committee on internal trade, 
used to approve sections of the agreement on internal trade and the 
dispute settlement mechanism, by replacing the requirement for 
unanimous consent with the following. First, allow the current 
unanimity base voting formula, eight months, to resolve the 
deadlock experienced in completing the agreement on internal 
trade. Let us give the unanimous consent formula another try but 
limit it to eight months.
<P>
	Second, if sections of the internal trade agreement remain 
unresolved after eight months, then the unanimous ratification 
formula will be replaced by a formula which allows ratification on 
the basis of at least two-thirds of the provinces and territories 
representing at least 50 per cent of the Canadian population.
<P>
	Third, if sections of the agreement are not completed within one 
year of implementing the two-thirds/fifty formula, the federal 
government shall move unilaterally to use its constitutional powers 
to complete the agreement on internal trade.
<P>
	Clearly the change proposed in my private member's bill will 
lead to the completion of the agreement on internal trade in all 
sectors. The impact of that will be dramatic indeed.
<P>
	I will speak a little on the possible impact. I will refer to several 
experts in this area and different groups which have found this to be 
such an important issue that they have written substantial 
documents outlining what they feel the impact of removing the 
barriers would be on Canadians.
<P>
	The Canadian Chamber of Commerce in a substantial document 
released approximately a year ago said that just by increasing trade 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10208"> 10208 </A></B>
<P>
between provinces by 10 per cent would lead to 200,000 new jobs 
in Canada.
<P>
<B>(1740 )</B>
<P>
	We know the Liberal government has failed on its promise to 
deliver jobs. The unemployment rate has been above 9 per cent for 
so many months that people have lost count, the highest level since 
the Great Depression.
<P>
	We have had this situation where the unemployment rate has 
stayed above 9 per cent and the government has not done what it 
should to complete the agreement. I know that the Minister of 
Industry would like to see the agreement completed. I believe he is 
sincere in wanting that. It is so hard to figure why it has not 
happened when the agreement was signed almost three years ago.
<P>
	I think 200,000 jobs would be some incentive for the 
government to get serious about completing the deal. However, it 
has not happened. The Canadian Chamber of Commerce is 
disappointed.
<P>
	The Fraser Institute put out a substantial paper on the issue. It 
said that trade barriers between provinces costs Canadian families 
$3,500 a year. Again, it is so difficult to understand why the 
government would not work hard to remove the barriers. As we 
know, since it came to power in 1993, the average Canadian 
household income has dropped by $3,000. If this agreement had 
been implemented in 1994 after it was signed by the provinces the 
$3,000 that was lost to these Canadian families would have been 
replaced with increased income resulting from the removal of these 
barriers.
<P>
	It is difficult to understand why the government has not taken 
this more seriously.
<P>
	Other think tanks and groups that have studied the issue have 
determined that these interprovincial trade barriers cost Canadian 
companies and Canadians between $6 billion and $10 billion a 
year. That is a lot of income because of a problem that should not 
be there and which really makes no sense.
<P>
	We have the agreement that was signed in 1994, a formula that 
clearly does not work. However, after three years nothing has been 
done about it.
<P>
	On speaking to representatives from the different provinces I 
know many provinces are absolutely committed to the completion 
of the agreement. Granted, most provinces have certain areas they 
are really concerned about because the province may be a net loser 
in a particular segment of its economy. But each province has 
recognized that overall the people would benefit from the removal 
of the barriers. There may be some losers in each province, but the 
numbers and the amounts lost would be very small compared to the 
net gain in each province.
<P>
	What have the Liberals said on this issue? We can look at their 
red book where this was mentioned. In both throne speeches it was 
said that it was important to remove barriers to interprovincial 
trade. The 1996 prebudget report from the finance committee had a 
section on the removal of interprovincial trade barriers which 
acknowledged the impact on the economy and on jobs by removing 
these barriers to trade. Yet what has been done? Clearly not enough. 
The barriers are still there.
<P>
	The industry minister introduced Bill C-88, an act to implement 
the agreement on interprovincial trade. The act passed third reading 
in the House in June 1996.
<P>
<B>(1745 )</B>
<P>
	I do not know why the lag in time between the agreement being 
completed in 1994 and the implementation legislation being passed 
in 1996. It does not really show a commitment on the part of the 
government that match the words it used in the red book and in its 
throne speeches. Clearly the two do not gibe. I cannot answer why. 
However, it does show a huge failure on the part of the industry 
minister.
<P>
	If I were running against the industry minister in his Ottawa 
riding I would be out talking about the barriers to the free 
movement of labour into Quebec. Quebec labour has a lot more 
freedom to move people to work in Ontario but it is pretty much a 
one way street. I would be telling all the potential voters in the 
minister's Ottawa riding about this and about the failures of the 
industry minister in this area.
<P>
	He spoke the words, signed the agreement in 1994 and finally in 
1996 got around to passing the implementation agreement. 
However, that is where it stalled. Deadline after deadline has 
passed, deadlines that were supposed to lead to the completion of 
the agreement, but it has not happened. I do not know why but I 
would be out there bringing that up in the minister's riding.
<P>
	Why are barriers to interprovincial trade so harmful? Why does 
it cost who knows how many jobs? It is enough that 200,000 jobs 
would be created if trade increased by 10 per cent. There are 
several reasons. Just imagine being a company in Canada. I have 
talked with the CEOs of several companies in Canada that want to 
do business with people and businesses in other provinces. 
However, they find the barriers to trade between the provinces and 
the territories do not allow that to happen freely.
<P>
	In fact, they say that they have far more access to companies and 
people in the United States than they do with people and businesses 
in other provinces. Some top notch companies in this country, high 
tech in some cases, have told me that they should be moving to the 
United States because if they operated there they would have free 
access to all provinces, something they do not have operating from 
one province of Canada. Is that not absurd? However, that is what 
we have.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10209"> 10209 </A></B>
<P>
	I have also spoken to the owners of companies that have moved 
to the United States. They just gave up. They wanted to do 
business with all of Canada but there are too many barriers under 
the current system. By moving their companies to the United 
States they were able to do business much easier and in a less 
expensive manner with all provinces freely. That is the kind of 
absurdity that these barriers produce. We are losing jobs as a result 
of these barriers being in place.
<P>
	A second way that these barriers really have an incredible 
negative impact on companies is on the small companies that want 
to do business internationally so they can grow. I have companies 
like that in my constituency. A prime example is a company that 
manufactures tanks in Lloydminster, Universal Industries. It has 
complained it is so difficult to do business in Saskatchewan. 
Lloydminster is a border city. The business is in a city that 
straddles the border between Alberta and Saskatchewan. To do 
business in Saskatchewan it has to jump through so many hoops 
that it is hurting its business. It would be able to operate a lot more 
effectively if it went to the United States where it would have open 
access to all Canadian provinces.
<P>
	We have to get rid of these barriers. Canadians can no longer 
afford the jobs that are lost. They can no longer afford the $6 billion 
to $10 billion that is lost each year as a result of these barriers being 
in place. They can no longer afford the loss in family income of 
$3,500 a year. That income would replace the $3,000 per family a 
year that has been lost as a result of Liberal policies. This one 
change would go an awful long way to removing these barriers and 
to allowing the benefits of jobs, the benefits of added income, the 
benefits of added take home pay and the benefits of businesses 
growing in the country so that they can compete better in other 
countries.
<P>
<B>(1750)</B>
<P>
	These benefits are being denied due to a lack of action on the 
part of the government. I have taken the action necessary here. This 
private member's bill, should it ever be enacted, would go a long 
way toward the elimination of these barriers.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Richardson (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I thank you for the opportunity to speak to Bill C-375, an 
act to amend the Agreement on Internal Trade Implementation Act. 
I would like to thank the hon. member for his hard work in 
presenting his case to support this.
<P>
	This bill reflects worthy intentions and concerns which I am sure 
the hon. member will share. Most of us in the House are very 
directly aware of the importance of trade to Canada. Each of us 
represents constituents who are in some way involved in trade, be it 
business, banking, retailing, agriculture, construction or some 
other exchange of goods and services, capital or labour. Canada is a 
trading nation.
<P>
	Trade, the efficient exploitation of our natural resources and 
effective use of our innate abilities and skills, has enabled us to 
grow and prosper both as individuals and as a nation. We trade, 
both internationally and internally.
<P>
	Internationally, we operate in an increasingly exciting world 
market, one that is continuing to become more and more open, 
dynamic and demanding. We have benefited, and will continue to 
benefit, from the opening of that market and the opportunities it 
gives us to sell and to make the best of ourselves and what we have.
<P>
	Internally, we are blessed with being an economic union that has 
a high degree of coherence and integration. The relative openness, 
freedom and efficiency of our domestic market, compared to 
international markets in many other parts of the world, has served 
us well. Our internal trade is worth over $300 billion a year and 
accounts for 1.9 million jobs.
<P>
	In many, indeed most, areas or sectors of economic activity, our 
internal market has made it possible to develop the abilities and to 
increase the areas of competitive advantage, expertise and 
experience. It has given Canadians, business and industry the basis 
on which to become strong and effective competitors in both 
foreign markets and against foreigners and foreign suppliers here at 
home.
<P>
	That said, it remains evident that our domestic market is not 
quite perfect. In the past, national business, industry and 
professional associations have cited numerous examples of 
companies, businesses or individuals being unable to invest or 
supply goods or services in certain parts of the country.
<P>
	Many individual workers have found that their ability to work 
anywhere in the country is hampered by the fact that some local 
authorities refuse to recognize their qualifications, skills or 
experience. Such problems are not unnatural where jurisdiction 
over trade, commerce and economic matters are shared between 
different levels of government.
<P>
	That was one of the reasons why the federal, provincial and 
territorial governments negotiated the agreement on internal trade 
in 1994. That agreement reflected the readiness of governments in 
Canada to try to deal with the problems of conflict, overlap and 
duplication of their measures without entering into discussion of, 
or affecting, their respective constitutional powers. The substance 
of that argument treats how governments agreed to exercise their 
respective powers. It does not change those powers.
<P>
	The agreement on internal trade, as the minister of industry 
emphasized in 1994, was a consensual agreement. It is important to 
remember in considering this bill that the basis of the agreement on 
internal trade was voluntary acceptance by each of the 
governments that signed it. That is the main reason for the 
weaknesses  and shortcomings of the agreement and perhaps why it 
has failed to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10210"> 10210 </A></B>
<P>
live up to the expectations of many since it came into effect in July 
1995.
<P>
	Those weaknesses have been analysed and reported a great deal 
in the last year. The hon. member who proposed the bill before us 
has elaborated on several at length and on numerous occasions. 
What he has said is not without basis and many of his criticisms of 
the agreement are backed in very respectable and respected 
quarters.
<P>
<B>(1755)</B>
<P>
	When they testified before the House committee concerning the 
Agreement on Internal Trade Implementation Act, the Canadian 
Chamber of Commerce, the Canadian Manufacturers' Association, 
the Certified General Accountants Association of Canada and 
others all identified a range of problem areas: the decision making 
process; the dispute settlement mechanism; the exceptions and 
exemptions; the putting off of issues to future negotiations; and the 
failure to meet the deadlines set for those negotiations.
<P>
	The intent of this bill is to correct at least one of those problem 
areas, the decision making process. Unfortunately the proposed 
changes cannot accomplish that. Indeed, no action by this House 
alone can change that agreement.
<P>
	The question might be asked then, why did the government 
introduce the Agreement on Internal Trade Implementation Act last 
year and why was it passed into law? The short answer is that the 
legislation the House passed was necessary to give the government 
the tools it needed to meet its own responsibilities, obligations, and 
commitments under the agreement.
<P>
	The fundamental flaw of the bill before us is that it fails to 
recognize that simple fact. The legislation could not and did not 
pretend to make the agreement binding on any of the other parties. 
The provinces and the territories are bound to the agreement on 
internal trade by their acceptance of and signature to that accord. 
Changing the Agreement on Internal Trade Implementation Act, as 
the bill proposes, could not affect how the agreement works.
<P>
	This bill is inappropriate because it fails to recognize that the 
agreement on internal trade is a consensual agreement and not just 
a federal creation. Besides that, the proposed amendment is 
unviable because it is based on simplistic analysis and cloudy 
assumptions regarding constitutional powers. It unwittingly mixes 
apples and oranges where it joins the exercise of federal 
constitutional powers with proposals being negotiated among the 
provinces in the context of the agreement on internal trade.
<P>
	Many, if not most, matters under the jurisdiction of the 
agreement are sectors or areas where jurisdiction is shared with the 
provinces. Some areas are exclusively  within provincial 
constitutional power. Where provinces are negotiating a proposal 
but one or more do not agree, this bill would have the federal 
government impose a majority view on all.
<P>
	If the matter under negotiation were clearly or even arguably 
within provincial jurisdiction, the ability of the government to 
impose a solution would at best be open to challenge in the courts. 
Instead of being a way around the impasse, this amendment is more 
likely a recipe for protracted legal wrangling. It could make 
matters worse, but the intention of the person submitting this bill 
are honourable.
<P>
	Even if, suspending all critical faculties, we were to allow that 
the kind of action envisaged by this amendment might be legally 
sustainable, it is not necessary. The government already has the 
power to regulate under sections 91 and 121 of the Constitution Act 
where it considers that doing so would be desirable and practical. 
Not only would the amendment be unnecessary but it would have 
the perverse effect of restricting government's ability to act in the 
national interest by limiting its powers in two ways.
<P>
	First, the amendment makes the exercise of that power 
contingent on a majority of the provinces being in favour. The 
government's record in consulting interested parties before taking 
action speaks for itself. However, limiting our ability to take 
actions in areas within our jurisdiction to the approval of the 
majority of provinces as this bill would do is an unreasonable and 
unnecessary constraint.
<P>
	Second, the amendment would further constrain the 
government's ability to take action in circumstances where both 
sections 91 and 121 of the Constitution Act would be invoked. 
Given the intent of the bill, the specific linkage would limit even 
further the practical scope of the kind the government action 
envisaged. It is difficult to determine whether that particular 
linkage is intentional or inadvertent. It is certainly poor drafting.
<P>
	It is clear that there are several reasons this bill does not merit 
the support of the House. First and foremost it is not viable. It is 
inappropriate. It is unnecessary. It is poorly conceived and drafted. 
But the intent is honourable.
<P>
<B>(1800 )</B>
<P>
	There is another reason this bill is wanting. It is coercive and 
divisive in a context where co-operation is necessary to achieve 
practical results for workers and companies.
<P>
	In summary, this bill would amend section 9 of the Agreement 
on Internal Trade Implementation Act, the section that gives the 
government authority to make orders pursuant to the dispute 
settlement procedures of the agreement on internal trade. The 
intent is to fix unilaterally a major AIT weakness by applying to or 
in all provinces any measure under negotiation in the AIT on  
which the provinces cannot reach consensus but for which there is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10211"> 10211 </A></B>
<P>
majority support, that is, two-thirds of the province and 50 per cent 
of the population.
<P>
	The bill misconstrues both the nature of the AIT and the real 
scope for unilateral action under federal constitutional powers. 
New personnel and financial resources would probably be required 
to enforce any regulations made under the agreement.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (TÃ©miscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
glad to see you in the Chair. It is now my turn to speak to Bill 
C-375, an act to amend the Agreement on Internal Trade 
Implementation Act.
<P>
	The purpose of this bill is to ensure that amendments can be 
made, even if they do not have the approval of all the provinces, by 
having a system in which at least two thirds of the provinces 
representing 50 per cent of the population would be enough to 
make these amendments.
<P>
	It is a bit much to see that, on the one hand, they say no to a bill 
promoting trade between the provinces, something that should 
benefit the provinces, and that here in Ottawa, they want to pass a 
bill to impose interprovincial trade on the provinces against their 
will. There is something wrong here. Obviously, it smacks of the 
old logic that Ottawa has a monopoly on truth: ``We know what is 
good for you, and we will make sure that is what you get''.
<P>
	What is worse, this is not the only sector in which this refrain 
comes up. We know very well that, when you talk about seven 
provinces and 50 per cent of the population, seeing how a 
consensus is arrived at in Canada, Quebec is often left standing on 
its own and often gets a raw deal.
<P>
	I am surprised to see a Reform member sponsoring this bill. 
Three and a half years ago, when we first arrived here, I recall 
meeting these members at a luncheon designed to help us get to 
know each other's respective positions a bit better and being told 
they were for decentralization.
<P>
	I think they are getting ready to deliver the same message during 
the next election campaign, but it is not very consistent with what 
we see here: ``Yes, Canada must be decentralized, the provinces 
must be given more power, and so on. The provinces are in the best 
position to decide what is good for their future''.
<P>
	On one of the very last bills in private members' business, we 
heard a member of this same party say: ``No, in the end we are 
changing course and siding with the Liberals''. It is unbelievable 
how Ottawa can change people in a few years. This seems to be a 
dynamic that runs through all of the federal machinery. For us, this 
is a highly centralizing trend, one with no consideration for the 
provinces. Once again, there is talk of putting in place clauses in 
favour of domestic trade.
<P>
	It is common knowledge today that, in the world of politics, the 
world of economics, and the world in general, people know that 
this is an era of opening up borders and encouraging the free 
circulation of goods and services, of capital, or of individuals. 
When it is good for economic activity, people reach agreement and 
liberalize trade.
<P>
	So why would this be done against the will of some people? Why 
at some point would it be said: ``No, some provinces do not agree, 
but we are still going to impose this decision upon them, because 
Ottawa has decided it would be a good thing to do''?
<P>
	How could the federal government decide something is good, 
and a province decide otherwise? What gives it more right to 
decide what is good and what is not?
<P>
	This represents a return to that political paternalism that exists in 
Ottawa, that supremacy some people want to give this Parliament 
over the provinces.
<P>
<B>(1805)</B>
<P>
	This bill is hard to accept. I am certain that this desire for 
centralization which we often see expressed here will be one of the 
issues openly discussed in the coming weeks, and will go beyond 
domestic trade.
<P>
	I come from a region of Quebec, TÃ©miscamingue, in Abitibi, a 
magnificent region I would invite you to visit if you have the 
opportunity. The people in the regions are increasingly anxious for 
decentralization, and not just toward the provinces. For us, when 
we in Abitibi-TÃ©miscamingue speak of decentralization, we think 
of Abitibi-TÃ©miscamingue, not necessarily of decentralization only 
toward the provinces.
<P>
	We know, for instance, that all federal regional development 
agencies have become agencies for political propaganda. They say 
they are there to help businesses become more competitive. In fact, 
the provinces already have similar structures. In the regions we are 
trying to have our own tools. We want to control these tools for 
economic development and we want to see them used by people, by 
our businesses where they are needed.
<P>
	There are regions in Quebec and Canada which specialize in 
certain fields. In the agricultural sector this varies considerably. 
Some provinces are much better in the dairy sector and in poultry 
and egg production, while other provinces are good in beef and 
there are even different regions within these provinces.
<P>
	The point is that the decision making power should be much 
closer to the grassroots. We have natural units and territories that 
have formed over the years. That is where the real power should be. 
They are close to the people. It is normal for national policies to be 
determined in parliaments. We hope that will be the case in the 
Parliament of Quebec, obviously. Everyone knows we are 
sovereignists and that we believe the national Parliament should be 
the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10212"> 10212 </A></B>
<P>
Parliament of Quebec, but we must  decentralize to let our regions 
manage their own development.
<P>
	So we have a measure that goes in the opposite direction. Ottawa 
is going to decide how interprovincial trade will be conducted, if it 
is to implement provisions that promote trade. However, there may 
be major differences of opinion. What about construction or 
government procurement?
<P>
	In fact, there is quite a discussion going on in Quebec around this 
bill. We have dairy producers challenging the provisions on 
margarine colouring and butter. This is quite an issue. There are 
provincial authorities which are also accountable to the voters and 
as a result under pressure to do something.
<P>
	I do not understand why people who are profoundly federalist 
and say they want to decentralize want all this to be decided here in 
Ottawa. We should leave it up to the provinces. When the provinces 
think it would be useful, they can conclude bilateral trade 
agreements. They can also enter into agreements among 
themselves. When all this has been done, then the government can 
go ahead but it should not impose such agreements, and this applies 
to both economic issues and constitutional issues.
<P>
	The seven and fifty formula, which involves imposing on others, 
is certainly not the way to build and develop a country. This is what 
will happen in the coming years to bring us back to the situation 
that has long existed. Canada and Quebec will be two different 
entities, but imposing things against the will of one of the two 
founding peoples will mean political catastrophe for Canada.
<P>
	I therefore do not recommend this route, except for Canada's 
own future within its own provinces. If it obviously works for 
everyone, people will agree at that point.
<P>
	In conclusion, I simply want to mention as well that it is 
important to understand Canada's trade dynamic, which is much 
more along north-south lines now than east-west. So trade is 
developing more toward the south now. I know there is a certain 
nostalgia. Some want trade to go along east-west lines, even force 
it to do so to some extent. This is perhaps the desire underlying all 
that. We all know that trade is now naturally developing much 
more between north and south.
<P>
<B>(1810)</B>
<P>
	I close by expressing my great disappointment at the 180 degree 
about-face taken by a member of the Reform Party. I can hardly 
wait to watch these members explain their support for 
decentralization in the upcoming elections, when the aim of this 
bill is totally the opposite.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Mr. Speaker, I wonder if you could make a ruling 
from the chair as to whether it is all right to call  you Mr. Speaker 
while you are in the chair because Mr. Speaker is Mr. Speaker. Is it 
all right to address you in that manner, Mr. Speaker?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Speaker (Lethbridge)):</B> On the hon. 
member's point of order, I want to make it very clear that Mr. 
Speaker is Mr. Speaker and I hope the hon. member will adhere to 
that understanding.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
a pleasure to address you as the Speaker today. It is a temporary 
honour, but I must say you do look good in the chair.
<P>
	I want to talk for a few minutes about this private member's 
initiative by the member for Vegreville. He has put together the 
essence of the Reform Party's position on internal trade barriers 
into one neat package.
<P>
	This bill will not become law and we are not going to have a 
chance to vote on it. However, this bill is important because it 
details what we would do if we were to form the government, or 
perhaps I should say when we form the government.
<P>
	The Reform Party says there are 10 roles the federal government 
must maintain and in fact should strengthen in order to encourage a 
strong national government. One of the areas in which it should be 
strong is in the ability to strike down internal trade barriers.
<P>
	The federal government should be involved in 10 essential areas. 
If we are going to have a nation, then we have to have a strong 
federal government. One of areas is the ability to regulate 
international trade or to enter into international trade agreements. 
Other areas are national defence, customs, the justice system and 
so on. Some areas are obvious but one many people do not think 
about is the ability to strike down internal trade barriers. If we 
cannot have a common trading market in our own country, how can 
we keep our country together? Economic ties will help us keep this 
country together.
<P>
	One of the disappointments has been the inability of the Liberal 
government to conclude an internal trade agreement. The 
framework agreement is there and it sounds good. We were all very 
excited when in 1994 the government brought forward this internal 
trade agreement. We supported it. We thought that good, this is 
what we have been saying all along. The Reform Party has been 
firm on this from the beginning; it never changed its view. We must 
have a strong ability to strike down internal trade barriers.
<P>
	But what do we see? All the easy ones are done right away. It is 
easy to talk about a few parts of the trade agreement, but when it 
comes to the tough stuff, the ones which grate between provinces, 
look what has not been signed. There are blank pages on the energy 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10213"> 10213 </A></B>
<P>
side. There are blank pages on the agriculture side, another 
contentious issue. There are blank pages when it comes to 
municipalities and academic institutions, the so-called  MASH 
group. There are blank pages in the natural resources sector.
<P>
	There must be a free trade zone between the provinces but the 
federal government allows these trade barriers to stand. What is the 
cost of that? A lower standard of living and less trade between 
provinces. It is ironic that it is sometimes easier to trade north and 
south, as far down as Mexico in my part of the country, than it is to 
have free trade between the provinces. What a sad development.
<P>
	Is it any wonder that the federal government relies almost 
exclusively on the export market for job creation. And I do too. I 
love export markets. It is a great opportunity for export companies. 
There is a danger in that. All job growth, for example, has been in 
the export market. There has been no job growth in Canada of any 
kind in the domestic market.
<P>
<B>(1815)</B>
<P>
	What kind of a message does that send down the road? What if 
there is an international downturn? That can happen and will 
happen. It is inevitable that it happens from time to time. The 
country would become totally reliant on international trade. If the 
country still has its own trade barriers, has not developed a strong 
national economy and has an export based economy only, when the 
downturn comes it will hurt and hurt a lot. This is why the federal 
government should adopt the step by step proposal of the member 
for Vegreville on what we should enforce as our national trade 
policy.
<P>
	They should be given another little shot at it and told to listen up. 
All provinces should be told that we will have a national free trade 
economic zone. They have agreed to it. They have the framework 
agreement. They have been squabbling among yourselves for three 
years, which is not good enough. They should be given another few 
months to get it settled. They should think of Canada now instead 
of their own neighbourhoods. They should get with it and sign it.
<P>
	The second proposal would be to change the ratification formula 
from unanimity, which is very hard to get when they are protecting 
their own turf, to a formula where two-thirds of the provinces and 
territories representing at least 50 per cent of the Canadian 
population would be used to pass sections that are contentious.
<P>
	Why is that important? I have talked about job creation. The 
member for Vegreville talked about the cost per family of some 
$3,500 as a result of the trade barriers and the inability to trade 
freely between provinces. It causes poor business decisions to be 
followed and endorsed by the government.
<P>
	In times past a brewery would be put up in one province because 
it could not sell in the next one. In those kinds of decisions they felt 
it was better to have a company headquartered in one province and 
another one  headquartered across the river in the next province 
because it helped to get jobs, grants and business influence. That 
should not be the case in Canada.
<P>
	We should say we are a free trade zone. The labour market 
should move freely to where it can find work and the best jobs. We 
have intellectual property that travels freely between the provinces. 
We have standards that keep us together as a nation. We should 
make sure in the energy sector, a valuable part of Canada domestic 
trade, that there are no barriers to trade. As we enter into the North 
American power grid with the provinces and the Americans, one 
province should not be pitted against another trying to sell at a 
cheaper rate and undercutting.
<P>
	It should not be like that. We should be free to trade energy in 
Canada. When we get on the international power grid there is no 
use back biting one another. We should work together because we 
are a small player in the big scheme of things. We should work to 
protect our agricultural industry. It is amazing to me that one of our 
most valuable industries, the agricultural community, does not 
have free trade between provinces.
<P>
	I remember earlier in Parliament asking members of the Bloc 
Quebecois what they thought would happen if Quebec separates. 
What will happen to the dairy industry, one of the most important 
agricultural industries in the entire province of Quebec? National 
agreements allow for trade of milk products from coast to coast. 
They had better get in on the agricultural deal. If they think they 
will get a better deal by pulling Quebec out of the country, they 
should think again. The dairy farmers in my region will say if 
Quebec is not part of the national scheme it does not get to sell 
them industrial milk.
<P>
<B>(1820 )</B>
<P>
	I hope Bloc members tell their farmers the truth in upcoming 
federal election campaign. They are far better off staying in Canada 
and trying to work out a good deal with all the provinces than going 
on their own and finding out that the butter they are shipping to 
British Columbia will not get past their border because we will 
produce our own.
<P>
	I am just saying in general that it is better for those in agriculture 
and energy to be part of a strong national system and a strong 
national government that protect their rights internationally and 
allow them a huge trading bloc within Canada. I hope they are 
paying attention and are telling that to their farmers.
<P>
	Overall the reason this matter is important is that it is one of the 
10 key areas the Reform Party says we need to have a strong 
national government. We cannot weaken the federal government by 
taking away its ability to control the common economic market and 
farming it to the provinces. It is something that must be maintained 
in Parliament.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="10214"> 10214 </A></B>
<P>
	The ability to strike down barriers to trade is something that 
we will strengthen. We will take advantage of our constitutional 
right to do so. The federal government needs to flex its muscles 
a little to try to get an agreement. The provinces need to know 
that a Reform government will make sure the common economic 
market will be maintained in all of Canada.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke-Lakeshore, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak to private 
member's Bill C-375.
<P>
	The bill serves as a timely reminder of how important trade is to 
Canada, not only international trade but domestic trade. From its 
very beginnings Canada has been a trading nation. Trade is the 
lifeblood of the country. The well-being of all Canadians depends 
on our ability to create and profit from competitive trading 
environments, both internationally and at home.
<P>
	For this reason the federal and provincial governments during 
1993 and 1994 negotiated the agreement on internal trade. The 
purpose of the agreement was to create a framework for continuing 
co-operative efforts among governments to open up the domestic 
market.
<P>
	It established a set of rules and a work program aimed at 
ensuring the free flow of goods, services, people and capital, and at 
more generally governing trade and trade disputes between 
provinces and territories.
<P>
	The agreement on internal trade came into effect on July 1, 1995. 
It is no secret there are problems with the agreement. From the start 
the government recognized that the agreement was only a first step. 
We have accordingly consistently sought to bring other 
governments to agree to make it a more effective instrument for 
economic growth.
<P>
	The Minister of Industry at every meeting of the committee on 
internal trade pressed his provincial colleagues to ensure the work 
mandated by the agreement was done within the deadlines set. He 
has repeatedly challenged the other parties to the agreement to 
consider seriously ways to improve both its scope and the way it 
operates.
<P>
	Recent studies and reports by business organizations such as the 
Chamber of Commerce and by other observers have underlined 
many of the agreement's weaknesses. They have pulled few 
punches in identifying the reluctance of various provincial 
governments to live up to the spirit or the letter of their 
commitments. Most of the observers identified the decision 
making process of the agreement. that is its requirement for 
consensus as a major impediment to progress.
<P>
	The bill reflects an attempt to address that issue. The intent is 
understandable. The bill unfortunately is neither realistic nor 
practical.
<P>
	As most hon. members will recall, last year we considered and 
passed the Agreement on Internal Trade Implementation Act which 
the bill proposes to amend.
<P>
	The government introduced legislation in 1995 because we were 
then and remain today firmly committed to making the agreement 
work. The agreement enables the federal government to meet its 
obligations under the agreement on internal trade. That legislation 
was necessary to give the government the appropriate authority and 
specific tools to act within its own areas of direct responsibility.
<P>
	However it is most important to recognize that the Agreement on 
Internal Trade Implementation Act and the agreement on internal 
trade are quite different and distinct instruments.
<P>
<B>(1825)</B>
<P>
	One is legislation by and for one government within its own 
jurisdictions and powers. The other is a collectively achieved 
accord on how all the government parties to it will exercise their 
respective powers within their own jurisdictions.
<P>
	The agreement on internal trade was the outcome of a difficult 
process of negotiation among the federal government, the 
provinces and territories during 1993-94. It was, however, 
successful, with a consensual outcome which all the governments 
accepted and which all signed.
<P>
	The authority of the agreement on internal trade does not derive 
from federal legislation. Rather, the authority of the agreement on 
internal trade derives from the commitments, obligations and 
undertakings which all governments accepted when they signed it. 
That is a fundamental point which the bill before us fails to 
recognize.
<P>
	Simply put, no one party to the agreement on internal trade can 
on its own amend that agreement. That is what this bill is 
attempting to do and that is why this bill is flawed.
<P>
	There are therefore two main reasons why this bill is 
inappropriate. First, it cannot accomplish what it wishes to do. 
Second, it directly conflicts with the fundamental basis on which 
the agreement was negotiated.
<P>
	The Canadian business sector has a legitimate expectation that 
the agreement on internal trade should deal effectively with 
internal trade barriers and impediments. It has a legitimate 
expectation that the agreement should also deal with the burden 
and extra costs imposed by conflicting, overlapping and duplicate 
regulatory requirements. Dealing definitively with internal trade 
issues is not a simple task.
<P>
	It is easy to read sections 91(a) and 121 of the Constitution and 
conclude that what is needed is bold and decisive action by the 
federal government; easy but simplistic and ultimately ineffective.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="10215"> 10215 </A></B>
<P>
	It is simplistic because unilateral federal action could not 
address some areas that are exclusively within provincial 
jurisdiction like labour market mobility or local government 
spending on subsidies and other incentives. It is ultimately 
ineffective because it fails to recognize how this country works 
best.
<P>
	Permanent, practical and effective change is best achieved when 
based on acceptance and co-operation among government, not on 
the basis of legalism and coercion.
<P>
	All governments in Canada must work together to ensure that the 
national economy is strong and efficient, producing new products, 
services, jobs and growth opportunities. It is important to that end 
that all governments be pressed to make the agreement on internal 
trade work better.
<P>
	The agreement belongs to all its parties. Its implementation is 
the responsibility of all its parties, not just that of the federal 
government.
<P>
	While I cannot support the bill before us for the reasons I have 
outlined, I hope its message will not be lost on other governments. 
This government certainly can be counted on to continue to try to 
co-operate and work with others to strengthen and improve the 
agreement on internal trade. We look to others to work with us.
<P>
	This bill is not viable. It is inappropriate. It is unnecessary. It is 
divisive and it is poorly drafted. I stand as a member not being able 
to support this private member's bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoit:</B> Madam Speaker, there are a couple of minutes left 
in the hour. If I could get unanimous consent, I would like to make 
a couple of wrap-up remarks.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> Does the 
House agree?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoit:</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to make clear that this 
is consistent with what Reform members have said all along, that 
we believe in decentralization in many areas. We have talked about 
those over the years.
<P>
	One of the Bloc members intimated in his speech that we were 
changing our direction. That is not true.
<P>
	From the time this political party started in 1987, the leader of 
the party and others have said that there are certain areas where we 
have to strengthen the role of the federal government. The member 
for Fraser Valley East mentioned some of those areas. One of them 
is certainly the area of freeing up trade between the provinces.
<P>
	Government members who have spoken recognize the need for 
freeing up trade and yet, curiously, they said that we do not really 
have to do anything to make that happen. They feel that it is just 
going to happen. I suggest  that it will not happen. I also suggest 
that the Canadian Constitution allows the federal government to 
take a stronger role.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> The period 
provided for the consideration of Private Members' Business has 
now expired. Pursuant to the Standing Orders, the item is dropped

	It being 6.30 p.m., the House stands adjourned until 10 a.m.
