<P>
	April 21 marks the anniversary of the death of Stuart, 
affectionately known by his family as Stu Buddy. It is hoped that by 
establishing a national organ donor day more Canadians will be

signed by a number of Canadians from Delta and Vancouver, B.C.
<P>
	The petitioners would like to draw to the attention of the House 
that managing the family home and caring for preschool children is 
an honourable profession which has not been recognized for its 
value to our society. They also state that the Income Tax Act 
discriminates against families who make the choice to provide care 
in the home to preschool children, the disabled, the chronically ill, 
or the aged.

	The petitioners therefore pray and call upon Parliament to pursue 
initiatives to eliminate tax discrimination against families who 
decide to provide care in the home for preschool children, the 
disabled, the chronically ill, or the aged.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="LAWCOMMISSIONOFCANADA">LAW COMMISSION OF CANADA</A></H3>
	The House resumed from October 17, 1995, consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-106, an act respecting the Law Commission of 
Canada, be read the second time and referred to the Standing 
Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, we are 
now at the second reading stage of Bill C-106, an act to create, or 
rather to exhume, the Law Commission  of Canada. The Minister of 
Justice now wants to revive this useless creature, which cost 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15565"> 15565 </A></B>
<P>
taxpayers $105 million over its 20 years of existence and which 
made only a few recommendations that were adopted by 
Parliament.
<P>
	The Law Reform Commission created in 1971 was responsible 
for reviewing Canada's laws on an on-going and systematic basis. 
The research work done by the former commission was divided 
into three main areas: substantive criminal law, criminal procedure, 
and administrative law. In its last year of existence, the 
commission had a budget of $5 million.
<P>
<B>(1015)</B>
<P>
	In addition to its members and employees, the commission hired 
a number of outside consultants.
<P>
	The commission spent over 82 per cent of its budget on salaries 
and on special and professional services. This small organization 
was very costly. Most of its staff consisted of university researchers 
and lawyers hired as consultants for short periods. The emphasis 
was on research and not on efficient management. Research 
programs that were out of touch with reality and astronomical costs 
were the two main reasons why the government of the day pulled 
the plug on the old commission.
<P>
	With Bill C-106, the Minister of Justice is about to make a 
monumental mistake. The minister is showing the federal 
government's inability to manage responsibly. Therefore, he is 
giving us another good reason to vote Yes on October 30.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice intends to sink millions of dollars into a 
revived law reform commission. This shameful waste must be 
vigorously denounced.
<P>
	I am appalled to see that the Minister of Justice has still not 
recovered from acute consultitis. Not only has he been consulting 
left and right since receiving his mandate but he now wants to 
create an organization dedicated to consulting. As silly as this may 
sound, the Minister of Justice is nonetheless taking himself 
seriously.
<P>
	Let me read you the first paragraph of the bill's preamble. It 
reads: ``whereas, after extensive national consultations, the 
Government of Canada has determined that it is desirable to 
establish a commission to provide independent advice on 
improvements, modernization and reform of the law of Canada, 
which advice would be based on the knowledge and experience of a 
wide range of groups and individuals''.
<P>
	The government of Canada has determined that it is desirable to 
waste $3 million per year on this consulting commission. It has 
determined that it is desirable to appoint 29 of its federalist friends 
to this commission.
<P>
	It seems obvious to me that the Minister of Justice and his 
government are taking us for fools. Let me tell you that, whatever 
the consultation minister's views on the  matter, Bloc Quebecois 
members will not let him table something as half baked as this 
without denouncing it.
<P>
	Did he expect that we would be too busy during the referendum 
to notice he was pulling a fast one on us? Perhaps he assumed that 
the miller could not look after the mill and the oven at the same 
time.
<P>
	As I said a moment ago, the minister's condition is going from 
bad to worse. His bill provides that all those involved are to consult 
one another. I consult you, you consult me, we consult each other. 
At a cost of $3 million per year, this makes for a very expensive 
consultation process.
<P>
	Clause 5 of Bill C-106 states, and I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(1) The Commission shall</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(<I>a</I>) consult with the Minister of Justice with respect to the annual program of 
studies that it proposes to undertake;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(<I>b</I>) prepare such reports as the Minister, after consultation with the 
Commission and taking into consideration the workload and resources of the 
Commission, may require;</BLOCKQUOTE>
	And that is not all. Clause 18 provides for the establishment of 
the Law Commission of Canada Advisory Council, and clause 19 
states, and I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Council shall-advise the Commission on any matter relating to the 
purpose of the Commission, including the Commission's strategic directions 
and long-term program of studies and the review of the Commission's 
performance.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This silliness goes on in clause 20, which reads, and I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>For the purpose of advising and assisting the Commission in any particular 
project, the Commission may establish a study panel presided over by a 
Commissioner and consisting of persons having specialized knowledge in, or 
particularly affected by, the matter to be studied.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Between obtaining advice, consulting and acting on this advice 
and the results of consultations, I wonder when the commissioners 
will find the time to do their job, to justify an annual budget of $3 
million. This is outrageous.
<P>
<B>(1020)</B>
<P>
	This bill does not even have the merit of being an original piece 
of legislation. It is almost a carbon copy of the Law Reform 
Commission Act, which was repealed three years ago. The two 
texts are so similar that you might think they are one and the same. 
For example, the provisions dealing with the goals and objectives 
of the commissions, both the former one and the one being 
proposed, are substantially identical. I hope that the minister is not 
serious when he claims that the future commission will be different 
from the old one, because their goals and objectives are identical. 
The only difference is the purported independence of the new 
commission. I will get back to this.
<P>
	If you read the two legal texts side by side, you come to the 
following conclusion. The former commission's  mandate was to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15566"> 15566 </A></B>
<P>
study and review Canada's acts and legal rules, while the proposed 
commission will study and review Canada's law.
<P>
	The former commission was set up to eliminate anachronisms 
and flaws in the law, while the proposed commission will provide 
advice to eliminate the rules of law which have become obsolete, as 
well as the flaws in the law.
<P>
	The former commission was to develop new methods and 
concepts related to the law, while the proposed commission will 
provide advice to develop new legal perspectives and concepts.
<P>
	It is six of one and half a dozen of the other. We were told that 
justice department officials worked on this legislation for two 
years. It is unthinkable that they would have spent so much time to 
come up with this result. The only new element proposed by the 
minister is the commission's advisory body, which will include 24 
members. The minister wants to bring back to life an organization 
which should not be revived.
<P>
	The reasons the previous government disbanded the former 
commission are essentially the ones for which the Bloc Quebecois 
cannot now support such a waste of public money. The previous 
government had come to the conclusion that the services provided 
by the former commission could be adequately obtained by 
transferring to the justice department the responsibility of 
commissioning research work from non governmental 
organizations, under specific mandates. The Minister of Justice and 
his department were to seek the opinion of researchers and 
professionals on a factual basis. Consequently, the Law Reform 
Commission was disbanded and the resources to be kept were 
transferred to the justice department.
<P>
	Interestingly, that department currently has a division called the 
Law Reform Division. This division was formed after the old 
commission disappeared. The financial resources of the former 
commission were therefore added to the budget of Justice. The 
division had an budget of $1.5 million the first year and $2 million 
the next. At the present time it has three full time employees and 
one part time.
<P>
	The minister wishes to create a new commission when there are 
already competent staff in place capable of meeting the 
government's requirements. The law reform division does a good 
job of carrying out the task for which it is intended. The minister 
can very readily mandate this law reform division to carry out all 
projects focussing on orienting or reforming Canadian law or to 
seek innovative solutions to endemic problems. Ironically, in May 
1994 it was this division which assumed responsibility for 
distribution of a questionnaire to 884 individuals or organizations 
concerning the creation of a new law reform commission.
<P>
	The department got back 126 responses to its mailing of 884 
questionnaires. So much for the extensive consultations referred to 
in the preamble to the bill.
<P>
	The minister would have us believe that his commission will be 
independent in nature. This is clearly indicated in clause 3, which 
states as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The purpose of the Commission is to study-the concepts-of the common 
law and civil law systems-with a view to providing independent advice on 
improvements, modernization and reform-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This is total nonsense. The partisan character of the process to 
appoint the five commissioners is obvious. These positions are 
clearly rewards for good and faithful service. The five 
commissioners will in fact be appointed by the Prime Minister on 
the recommendation of the Minister of Justice. It goes without 
saying that these commissioners will be paid royally. Certainly, the 
annual commission budget is evaluated at $3 million. As well, the 
commissioners' appointments will be during pleasure, in other 
words they can be dismissed if they are found unsuitable and do not 
toe the party line.
<P>
<B>(1025)</B>
<P>
	After appointment, the commissioners will in turn appoint the 
members of the advisory council. There will be 24 of them, and 
they also will hold office during pleasure.
<P>
	These 29 persons will therefore make up the Law Commission of 
Canada. With 29 partisan appointments, the Minister of Justice is 
setting up his own fan club. To be a member, all you have to do is 
be in the good graces of the Minister of Justice and be willing to go 
through three million dollars a year. This will be a fan club of 
intellectuals philosophizing on legal niceties. They will be so 
disconnected from reality that the Minister of Justice will not take 
long to realize his error and will put an end to this nonsense.
<P>
	In looking at the reasons the old commission was dissolved we 
can understand why there ought not to be another. The old one was 
strongly criticized by the office of the Auditor General of Canada 
in the House. In 1985, it carried out an in depth analysis of the 
operations and administration of the defunct commission. In his 
report, the auditor general was critical of the commission's project 
management.
<P>
	The following is very illuminating: ``Since 1972, the 
commission has not revised its original research program or 
submitted a supplementary or a second program, despite extensive 
changes in its work. Also significant delays have occurred in 
carrying out its research program and significantly more resources 
have been committed to it than were envisaged in 1972. For 
example, none of the estimated completion dates was met, and 
many of the original projects are still in progress 10 years after 
their originally stated completion dates''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15567"> 15567 </A></B>
<P>
	The auditor general went on to say that the program's 
effectiveness was not measured, there was a lack of guidelines 
concerning project management and a lack of control and 
supervision.
<P>
	Clearly, the Minister of Justice never bothered to read the auditor 
general's report. He should have. The former commission, 
however, was rather proud of its record. In 1991, in the 
commission's twentieth annual report, the president at the time, 
Gilles Létourneau, eager to justify the commission's existence, 
wrote that on the occasion of its twentieth anniversary, the 
commission could be proud of the impressive number of its 
achievements, especially in the legislative field, that the 
commission was far more than an agency that made 
recommendations to Parliament on how to improve Canadian laws, 
that, in fact, it had initiated extensive research in various areas of 
the law, producing 33 reports, 63 working papers, 78 published 
studies and more than 300 supporting documents.
<P>
	I would be curious to know where all those documents are 
gathering dust. It is all very well to say that the commission 
produced reams of documents, but to what purpose? In 20 years 
only three proposals for legislation were accepted by Parliament. 
The explanation is simple. A commission that operates in tandem 
with governments cannot hope to amend or improve the law if its 
amendments or reforms are not part of the legislative agenda of the 
government of the day.
<P>
<B>(1030)</B>
<P>
	The auditor general's report is very informative about this aspect 
as well, and I quote: ``The commission, however, is not satisfied 
with its impact on legislative changes and readily acknowledges its 
modest record in comparison with that of other law reform 
commissions. Because of its statutory independence, it establishes 
its own programs and has not been asked by the Minister of Justice 
to carry out specific research activities. Therefore, the 
commission's areas of research and study often have not been high 
priority areas for government legislative agendas''.
<P>
	The dissatisfaction of the commissioners at the time seems to 
indicate that the former commission was more in need of direction 
and controls than independence and broad, poorly defined 
mandates. The Department of Justice never played its role as a 
supervisory body. The situation was allowed to deteriorate to the 
point that the government no longer had a choice. It had to get rid 
of the commission and merge some of its resources with the 
Department of Justice, leading to the creation of the law reform 
division.
<P>
	I must say the approach taken by the Minister of Justice is not 
very sound. He calls the future commission a new and improved 
law reform commission of Canada. If he really wanted 
improvements, he would leave things as they are. He already has a 
new and improved commission within his own department. I fail to  
understand the justification provided by the Minister of Justice, 
because, aside from handing out goodies to friends, the future 
commission has no reason to exist.
<P>
	Upon tabling the bill, the minister stated that Canada's legal 
system faced complex problems that deserved more than a legal 
solution. Effective and long-term solutions required an approach 
that considered legal, social, economic and other aspects. The 
federal government was of the opinion that an independent and 
multidisciplinary law reform body was essential to this process.
<P>
	The future commission will never be independent, since it will 
be a fan club of the Minister of Justice. Even assuming that 
appointments to the commission would not be partisan, the 
Minister of Justice is heading straight for disaster. A more or less 
independent commission would operate exactly like the former 
commission, in other words, without controls and without 
supervision.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice has not learned from the mistakes of the 
former commission. He preferred to ignore the auditor general's 
report which was very critical of the commission. He still does not 
realize that his department already has a division that is concerned 
specifically with law reform.
<P>
	Those who ignore the mistakes of the past are doomed to repeat 
them. And that is exactly what the Minister of Justice is doing 
today. His ignorance will cost us three millions dollars annually. 
Another good reason to say yes on October 30.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to say that in these days, when we find so little to agree 
on with our friends from the Bloc, I would recommend to 
Canadians the extremely well researched and cogent arguments put 
forward in the paper by my hon. colleague who preceded me. Many 
of the points that were made should be persuasive to this 
government.
<P>
	Unfortunately, one gets the impression in this House, and it is 
more than just an impression, that what we say and do here in 
debate is simply smoke and mirrors and window dressing and hot 
air, because the course of the government is set and the government 
members, who are in the majority, stand up and support it 
invariably. The excellent, well-reasoned considerations that should 
be taken into account before these pieces of legislation are foisted 
on Canadians simply go by the by.
<P>
	However, it is my duty to represent the people of Canada, 
particularly the people of Calgary North who elected me, by 
putting forward my concerns and my objections to this piece of 
legislation.
<P>
<B>(1035 )</B>
<P>
	When our country is in real difficulty with respect to public 
safety and the workings of our criminal justice system, I find it 
passing strange that the thing on the top  of the justice minister's 
mind is allowing the politically appointed parole board to 
investigate itself if it decides to do that. He is setting up a bunch of 
political appointments to make recommendations to the minister 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15568"> 15568 </A></B>
<P>
about what he should do about the law. I do not think there is any 
question in the minds of Canadians what should be done about the 
law. However, apparently the justice minister is so unsure that he is 
going to need some extra advice, for which we have to pay millions 
of dollars.
<P>
	Just so the Canadian public who are watching this debate are 
clear on what we are talking about today, we are debating Bill 
C-106. This reinstates a body that was formerly called the law 
reform commission and is now being resurrected and reincarnated 
under the name of the Law Commission of Canada.
<P>
	The Law Commission of Canada will have five members, a full 
time president and four appointed commissioners to assist the 
president. In addition, unless these five people find themselves 
bereft of ideas, they are going to be ably assisted by a further 
government appointed body called the Law Commission of Canada 
Advisory Council, with 24 additional patronage appointments.
<P>
	Bill C-106 reinstates a failed body, this law commission of five 
people and an additional 24 people to advise them. Apparently the 
idea of this is to provide ``independent'' advice on needed 
improvements, ``modernization'', and reform of Canadian law. 
Again, we need to make it abundantly clear that the people of 
Canada are not leaving the government in the dark about the 
improvements and reforms that are needed in Canadian law. Why 
they have to work hard to shell out another $3 million a year to 
have the obvious stated, if in fact it is stated, is beyond the 
comprehension of any hard working and overtaxed Canadian I can 
think of.
<P>
	This additional spending of $3 million a year is touted as a great 
improvement because the old disbanded law reform commission 
cost a whole $4.8 million a year, so we are actually saving $1.8 
million with this new, streamlined version of the Canadian law 
commission. I do not think it takes a cynical Canadian to figure out 
that $3 million in budget almost invariably creeps up. If $3 million 
is the bottom line, Canadians have to wonder what the top line is 
going to be.
<P>
	The old law reform commission grew into a very significant 
bureaucracy. It is the nature of government to suspect and be 
concerned that the same thing is going to happen again, because 
these five commissioners and 24 advisers to the commissioners are 
going to need some administrative assistance, which is going to be 
another consideration.
<P>
	In the justice minister's introduction of this bill he said 
something that to me was extremely curious. He said ``This will be 
an independent and accountable body working at arm's length from 
government''. That is a  direct quote. Canadians should know that 
these five commissioners are being appointed by the cabinet of this 
government on the recommendations of the justice minister. Tell 
me and any other logical Canadian who might happen to be 
listening to this debate how a body directly appointed by the justice 
minister has even the feeblest chance of being independent. Give 
Canadians some credit for intelligence here.
<P>
	The minister then said, in the same twinning of words, 
``independent and accountable''. I know that logic is not taught 
much these days, but it begs the question of how a body can be both 
independent of government and accountable to government at the 
same time. It is just not possible. In fact the whole way this is set 
up, independent is about the last thing this body is.
<P>
<B>(1040)</B>
<P>
	The Minister of Justice has a history of encouraging politicized 
bodies to endorse his predetermined positions. We saw that in the 
debate on Bill C-68 and we have seen it in other debates. He will 
get up and say that a certain group really supports this legislation. 
Well yes, the group is funded by the government. One wonders 
what group would not know what side its bread was buttered on. Of 
course it will not bite the hand that feeds it. It will be a cheering 
section for the very body that gives it dollars to keep going.
<P>
	If we are going to talk about independence, let us at least be 
honest. Let us at least be reasonable. Let us at least be logical. Let 
us have something that will carry an ordinary judgment. This is not, 
in any way, shape, or form, an independent body.
<P>
	In a news release before Bill C-106 was introduced in the House, 
the headline read: ``Minister of Justice Announces Creation of a 
New Law Commission''. Since this thing has already been created, 
why are we wasting our time debating it? We all know it is a done 
deal. This debate is just a formality. The thing has been created. It 
has been announced publicly. The public knows. Canadians have 
been told. The objections we are going to be bringing forward in 
the debate will mean nothing. It is nice that the opposition has a 
chance to fire at this thing, but it is done.
<P>
	I find that repugnant in a democratic system. I would like to 
think that the work and the research I do in examining bills and 
issues counts for something. But it is very clear to all Canadians 
that it does not.
<P>
	How independent is the commission? Clause 5 of the bill 
requires that the Law Commission of Canada consult with the 
minister before setting its agenda. That does not seem to me to be 
independent. I suppose that good Liberals will say that the 
commission does not have to listen to him. He is only the guy who 
appointed them and gave them this wonderful patronage position in 
the first place. He is only the guy who pays their salaries. He is only 
the guy who will request reports from them. This consultation in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15569"> 15569 </A></B>
<P>
setting the agenda really means that the commission is told by the 
justice minister: ``This is what we want you to do''.
<P>
	The commission is required by clause 5 to submit to the minister 
reports that are required by the minister. It is a creature of the 
minister. There is nothing independent about it. It is in the 
legislation, to be seen clearly by anybody who looks at it. This is 
nothing more than an extension of the minister and his department 
doing work the justice department has already been contracting 
out. It is an unnecessary, far from independent body.
<P>
	How independent is it? The complete commission is under the 
control of the minister. In the legislation it states clearly that these 
appointments to the commission and to the advisory body to the 
commission are held at the pleasure of the cabinet. Independent, 
when the cabinet can fire them out the door at its pleasure? Give me 
a break.
<P>
	The commission is appointed by the justice minister. The 
advisory council, in clause 18, which is made up of 24 members, is 
appointed by the deputy minister and by the commission itself. The 
commission is appointed by the justice minister and its advisers are 
appointed by the commission and by the deputy minister, who is 
the right hand man to the justice minister. This is hardly 
independence.
<P>
<B>(1045)</B>
<P>
	There is already legislation coming forward from the justice 
department. One wonders how it has managed so far without the 
commission. The whole point of having a justice ministry is to 
make sure that we have proper legislation to protect the rights and 
property of citizens.
<P>
	Legislation is supposed to be developed within the Department 
of Justice. It does the research and drafts legislation. Why does the 
minister have to appoint a select group of advisers to know what 
the country needs to protect the lives and property of Canadian 
citizens? Is he not listening to Canadians?
<P>
	The minister talks a lot about consultation. We have heard him 
use this term in a glowing endorsement when he was talking about 
other legislation he brought forward previously in the House. Now 
the minister has another stick to beat us up with. He can say that the 
Law Commission of Canada which he appointed, can tell what to 
do and controls, although this will never be said, says that we 
should do this.
<P>
	Canadians who have not listened to the debate, who have not 
examined the legislation, who do not know that the commission is 
anything but independent will be fooled by it. Canadians think it is 
another expert body they can be impressed with, the Law 
Commission of Canada, not the minister's commission with people 
who are manipulated and give him the answers and endorsements 
he wants.
<P>
	Laws should be developed by elected legislators who are closely 
reflecting the wishes and the interests of the people they represent, 
period. They should not be developed by appointed flunkeys of the 
justice minister. This back door elite group of hand picked Liberal 
policy makers have no business developing law for Canada.
<P>
	The people of Canada elect representatives to do that. That is 
why we get the big money. Why are we also getting millions of 
dollars to have other people tell us what laws we need? What are 
we doing here? Elected representatives are well able and should be 
seeking all the time the views of researchers and knowledgeable 
citizens throughout Canada. We do not need to appoint these people 
and pay them to tell us what they think.
<P>
	Law professors spend almost half their time in research; that is 
part of their mandate. They are quite happy to pass on to elected 
representatives the wisdom, the knowledge and the 
recommendations they have come up with. We do not need to pay 
for them.
<P>
	We already have far too many boards and commissions in 
Canada. The money that pays these people does not grow on trees. 
People work darn hard for the tax money that the government 
gobbles up. They do not want to pay a bunch of people to do a job 
they have already elected people to do. It is ridiculous.
<P>
	It is an insult to Canadians who are already hard pressed. They 
are worried about their jobs. They are worried about their futures. 
They are worried about having to pay their mortgages. Now they 
have to pay a law reform commission $3 million a year.
<P>
	The government does not have this money. It gets it from the rest 
of us who are working. It is a shame that in these hard economic 
times we would even think of asking Canadians for a few more 
million dollars so we can have a nice little group of appointees for 
the justice minister.
<P>
	The parliamentary role should not be given to outsiders. Private 
members' bills, for example, have been developed in the House. 
The justice minister might consider that a very accurate law 
commission. I sat in the House last evening when a member asked 
for permission from other members of the House to withdraw a 
private member's bill because he said that the government had 
introduced legislation which essentially covered-and he was 
satisfied that it fully covered-the concerns and the 
recommendations he made in his private member's legislation. 
Here is a law reform commission at work that is already being paid 
properly within the system. This is the parliamentary role and it 
should not be given to anybody else.
<P>
<B>(1050)</B>
<P>
	One wonders if the justice minister is saying that he cannot 
always control and influence what his colleagues in Parliament do, 
so that is not good enough, and if he would rather have 
recommendations from people whom he can control.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15570"> 15570 </A></B>
<P>
	It is just another chance for political activists to be rewarded 
by government appointments and get on the government payroll. 
It is another haven for Liberal political appointees. The justice 
minister insults the intelligence of Canadians to claim that this 
is anywhere close to being an independent commission. The 
justice minister's fingerprints are all over the whole thing. He 
picks the appointees. His top assistant and his appointees appoint 
the group that advises the appointees.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ablonczy:</B> It may be funny to the hon. member for Halifax 
but it is not funny to Canadians. They are paying for this nonsense.
<P>
	The justice minister has a say in setting the agenda of his 
appointees. He will have in subclause 5(2) flexibility in how he 
deals with the commission's recommendations. In other words he 
has the flexibility to totally ignore them, which is exactly what 
happened in the past.
<P>
	The legislation does not say how he has to respond. They are just 
gathering dust, more reports to gather dust while the money rolls in 
for the people who have been appointed to do a bit of work.
<P>
	I close my presentation by making the minister an offer that I 
feel he should not refuse. The Reform caucus will willingly take on 
the onerous task of providing the minister with advice on needed 
improvements and reforms to the laws of Canada. I speak in favour 
of this generous offer.
<P>
	First, it is the perfect solution for the justice minister. It will save 
hard pressed and tax weary Canadians the $3 million a year the 
justice minister would have to pay his hand picked advisers. We 
will do it at no extra charge. We cannot get more generous than 
that.
<P>
	Second, it would allow the justice minister to help the Liberals 
keep another red book promise, which so far has been sadly broken, 
to base appointments on merit rather than on patronage. Who 
would have more merit in advising the justice minister than 
Reformers?
<P>
	Third, the justice minister can be sure that Canadians are really 
setting the agenda, not his appointed dependants.
<P>
	Fourth, the proposals will be brought forward in the House of the 
people for open scrutiny and debate from day one, not hatched 
behind closed doors and pushed through by forced votes from 
Liberal backbenchers. It will be truly independent of government 
and fully accountable to the people of Canada, which is exactly 
what it should be.
<P>
	Fifth, last but not least, the minister can be absolutely certain 
that he is receiving truly independent advice.
<P>
	Voters elect at great consideration and cost their own 
representatives to legislate to ensure peace, order and good 
government in our country. If we could be allowed to do our job 
responsibly and take into account the  concerns and advice we 
receive from Canadians every day, the justice system would make a 
lot more sense and do a lot better job for Canadians.
<P>
	As members might have guessed, we strongly oppose the 
Liberals' appointing people from their approved list of friends to 
do our job as members of Parliament and we oppose Bill C-106.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The first three interventions 
had 40-minute maximums without questions or comments.
<P>
	We will now go to the next stage of debate at second reading of 
Bill C-106, an act respecting the Law Commission of Canada, 
where members for the next five hours will have 20-minute 
maximums for their speeches and be subject to 10-minute question 
and comment periods.
<P>
<B>(1055 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it is passing strange to hear some of the comments I have heard this 
morning. It is nearly 90 years since Benjamin Cardozo wrote his 
famous essay ``Ministries of Justice''.
<P>
	For those who do not know better, it was said that Mr. Justice 
Cardozo was the greatest jurist never appointed to the Supreme 
Court of the United States. Then Herbert Hoover, in what some 
have said was his greatest act as president, appointed Mr. Justice 
Cardozo in his twilight years to the Supreme Court of the United 
States.
<P>
	When he wrote 90 years ago he was making the case for an 
independent law commission. Its members would neither be civil 
servants because they were too close to the minister, too much 
under ministerial supervision, nor legislators because they were too 
much concerned with the exigent here and now of reading the flow 
of papers and attending to the details of legislation. He wanted 
people with a long vision and a detachment from politics. This is 
why he made the case.
<P>
	His ministry of justice was not a ministry in our sense. It was an 
independent body of law commissioners to take a long view to try 
and establish the necessary relationship between positive law as 
written and the society it was supposed to serve.
<P>
	When he wrote he was undoubtedly reminded of the words of his 
great friend, we understand from different legal tradition because 
Cardozo was the son of immigrants who had come from different 
legal tradition, Mr. Oliver Wendell Holmes who said: ``The life of 
the law has not been logic; it has been experience''.
<P>
	At the time Cardozo wrote the legal system in the United States, 
Great Britain and parts of the then British Empire, now the 
Commonwealth that received the common law tradition, the law 
was essentially known as black letter law. From the vibrancy and 
creativeness of the early days of the common law it had 
degenerated into  Lord Eldon's, it was said, juridical conservatism: 
the pursuit of precedents divorced from social reality, the pursuit of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15571"> 15571 </A></B>
<P>
logical interpretations divorced from what happens in the daily 
lives of citizens.
<P>
	In its creative period the common law was a law in full 
evolution. By the 19th century it had decayed into a rigid 
formalism. This is from what Cardozo had wanted to break away, 
and this is what those countries that followed him, in a very belated 
way the United States, have tried to achieve.
<P>
	The law is more than the study of precedents. Precedents can be 
studied by law students cramming for examinations. However our 
society is evolving. In fact at the turn of the century, we lived in a 
revolutionary period in the world community as dramatic as the 
Thirty Years War and the late 17th century western European 
society, a world in revolutionary change with laws that are 
increasingly out of date.
<P>
	I think one of the ironies that I encountered in my 
pre-parliamentary career, visiting many countries that sought my 
advice, was the knowledge that with the help of visitors from other 
countries and experts provided by the Canadian International 
Development Association, CIDA, their laws would probably end 
up more up to date and more relevant than Canadian laws.
<P>
	We advise countries abroad because we believe in the free 
market economy and we believe the free market economy to be 
properly achieved with liberalization and rationalization of the 
legal system. We advise many other countries on how to update 
their laws. The curious thing is that dynamic element sometimes 
produces commercial law, laws on transactions involving 
foreigners, that are better and more up to date than our own, than 
American laws or the laws of other countries exporting their 
economic ideas. That is a sort of contradiction that frankly is 
unacceptable in our society.
<P>
	I spoke of the period of legal positivism, the pursuit of the black 
letter law, the pursuit of precedents at the cost of reason, which is 
fortunately behind us as a legal theory taught in law schools.
<P>
<B>(1100 )</B>
<P>
	The legal realist movement focused on the gap between the law 
in books and the law in action; the law as written in some bygone 
age and the law in action and how it was actually applied. It is a 
movement that is peculiarly North American although there are 
continental European counterparts.
<P>
	It leads directly into the school of sociological jurisprudence 
whose founder was the great Dean Roscoe Pound of the Harvard 
law school followed by the Commonwealth writer Julius Stone and 
by the man who had the distinction of teaching two American 
presidents, Gerald Ford and Bill Clinton, and Bill Clinton's wife, 
Myres McDougal. The notion is that law exists to do other things 
than to give a pre-defined answer to new  problems, that it is in 
constant evolution, that law exists to solve social problems, that 
there is a necessary policy element inherent in law and that the only 
way to get good legal decisions and good laws is to study society.
<P>
	The intellectual framework of a good jurist today includes much 
more than logic and much more than the study of precedents. It 
includes a necessary acquaintance with economics, a necessary 
acquaintance with the driving forces in commerce, in business in 
our society, a knowledge of the sociology of the state, of human 
relations. This is the necessary intellectual equipment of a good 
lawyer today and it is basically what Cardozo spoke of when he 
referred to the need for creating ministries of justice.
<P>
	Legal research would have to be carried on anyway. I asked the 
Minister of Justice two days ago what had happened when the 
Conservative government made the decision to cancel the law 
reform commission, whether he had buried research. He said no, 
they had to carry it on within the department.
<P>
	In terms of cost saving we are dealing with essentially the same 
thing, civil servants. However, civil servants do not have that 
freedom from the exigent here and now of daily departmental 
practice that Cardozo said was a necessary element in the process 
of law reform.
<P>
	In looking to the formation of the law reform commission again 
we are responding to the challenge today of a law responsive to 
society, Canadian society and the society of the world community, 
in continuing almost revolutionary change in terms of the social 
forces moving within us. It requires a group of people independent 
from the government and of high intellectual distinction.
<P>
	I said to the minister when he introduced this bill: ``Your big 
problem is cherchez l'homme or cherchez la femme, look to the 
right people. Whom are you going to get?'' He said: ``Whom can 
you think of?'' He recognizes the need for creative appointments. 
This is where opposition party members can help. Give the 
minister names. I said I could give him a couple of names from the 
past including Mr. Justice Rand, our greatest liberal judge on the 
Supreme Court of Canada. He gave us a bill of rights before we had 
the 1982 charter; somebody like that in his creative periods.
<P>
	I also took the opportunity to cite somebody well known to many 
members of the House, the late Jean-Luc Pepin who died only a 
couple of weeks ago in the prime of his life. He was a non-lawyer. 
This is one of the valuable things in this bill. We do not limit the 
choice of members of this commission to lawyers. We recognize, 
as the French have done and the Germans have done, that even on 
supreme courts, constitutional courts, non-lawyers have a role to 
play and should be included, and they are.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15572"> 15572 </A></B>
<P>
	I had the honour of being chief advisor to Jean-Luc Pepin in 
the preparation of his report on the Constitution along with John 
Robarts, Léon Dion and John Meisel. If his report had been 
adopted many of our problems of federalism today would have 
been resolved before.
<P>
<B>(1105)</B>
<P>
	The quest goes on for the right people. Please, the invitation goes 
to members of the government and members of the opposition to 
put forward the names. This is intended to be independent. It will 
only be independent and courageous if we get the right people. The 
minister is on the right track. They do not have to be lawyers. It is a 
challenge. We have given so much time to Quebec issues that very 
much of our creative energy in other areas has been pre-empted. If 
we do not modernize our own laws the problem of economic 
recovery will be very much accentuated.
<P>
	I see no point in my telling Chinese audiences, as I did from 
1980 onwards, or audiences in other countries that if you want a 
free market economy, you need streamlined, up to date laws that 
respond to the exigencies of the society you are living in. There is 
no point telling these people that if we do not do it at home. This is 
the message in the law reform bill. Please see the large issue, see 
the necessity for this and take the steps to ensure the choices will be 
excellent ones.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to speak to Bill C-106 today. I 
listened to my hon. friend from Vancouver Quadra make his 
presentation. I have the utmost respect for him. He is a man of 
much accomplishment in his career. He is certainly an academic 
and has contributed a lot to his profession and has many 
accomplishments.
<P>
	I have one fear, though, as I listen to the hon. member, that the 
average Canadian is not getting a grasp or is not able to understand 
exactly what the member is saying. I want to bring this debate away 
from the level used by hon. member from Vancouver Quadra, a 
level which, no disrespect intended, was far above the average 
Canadian.
<P>
	The hon. member talked about the people who should be 
involved in this commission. I will use some of his words and 
reflect on what he said. He said the law commission should be 
comprised of people in the law profession and people of high 
intellectual distinction.
<P>
	Nowhere in his presentation has he indicated in any way that the 
opinions reflected by the minds of average Canadians should be 
represented in the commission. That has been the problem with the 
Minister of Justice's decisions and the government's bills in the 
two years I have been in the House. Nowhere in the bills introduced 
has there been any sense of realism between what is in the bill and 
what is on the mind of the average Canadian.
<P>
	As parliamentarians we have a profound responsibility first and 
foremost to represent the concerns and the opinions of average 
Canadians. This recreation of the law commission is certainly far 
from that.
<P>
	The predecessor to the law commission was abolished by the 
Tories in 1992. The Tory government was never known to be frugal 
but for some reason it found the commission a luxury it could not 
afford, which was a surprise considering its record of spending. It 
had grown as a quite natural progression into a large bureaucracy.
<P>
<B>(1110 )</B>
<P>
	The Tory government in its wisdom decided it could get the 
same advice from outside sources at a better price. No doubt those 
outside sources were Tory advisers because the old line parties 
have a habit of rewarding their friends after they get into 
government. I have no doubt that this recreation of the law 
commission is another form of thanking Liberal friends for their 
participation in helping them get to government. We have seen this 
over and over again.
<P>
	The law commission was established in 1971 to review Canadian 
federal laws and to make recommendations for the improvement or 
modernization of reforms within the justice system and develop 
new approaches that would be responsive to the changing needs of 
Canadian society.
<P>
	In all honesty we have not seen a lot of evidence that the former 
law commission responded to the concerns of average Canadians. 
Its recommendations and work seemed to come out of some 
academic legal nirvana in which the recommendations were made 
on behalf of the people of Canada because, in all honesty, as the 
people formerly of the law commission would probably rightly 
determine, the Canadian people do not really have the wherewithal 
to make up their own minds and make reasonable choices about 
how the justice system in Canada should operate.
<P>
	At its elimination in 1992, the commission had a budget of about 
$5 million and a staff of about 30. That was a lot of money. Now 
the Liberal government wants to revive this law commission. It has 
set a budget with a benchmark of about $3 million a year. It says 
the money will come from existing government resources. Anyone 
who believes that tale I honestly think believes in the tooth fairy; a 
wilder belief is maybe the Liberal government will some day get its 
spending under control.
<P>
	The Liberal government is simply adding another level of 
bureaucracy to government operations. We have seen over and over 
again commissions with budget overruns like it is the natural thing 
to do.
<P>
	The Canadian people have no reason to believe this commission 
will not be independent. It will not be accountable to the 
government except to the wishes of the Minister of Justice.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15573"> 15573 </A></B>
<P>
	My hon. friend from Calgary North spoke earlier about this 
so-called independence. She pointed out very clearly how this 
commission would operate. There is no doubt the terms of 
reference for setting up this commission will be at the absolute 
direction of the Minister of Justice. Despite what the Liberals have 
said there is no substantive evidence to back up the claim that this 
will be a truly independent body. We have no reason to believe 
that. The Canadian people have no reason to believe that.
<P>
	We have seen how the Minister of Justice operates. We have seen 
what he does when he wants to give some sort of credence to some 
of the ludicrous bills he has introduced. He goes out in the field and 
gathers together some of his political friends who happen to form 
associations and he gets them to back him up on his decisions.
<P>
	The Canadian public is not buying that any more. The Minister 
of Justice now wants to give some extra support to some of the 
decisions by setting up the law commission. He will then stand in 
the House and present a bill without any reality of what the 
Canadian people believe. He is going to present the bill. He will 
stand up and say: ``I would like to inform the House that the law 
commission has recommended that this reform be made to the 
criminal justice system''. Recommended. I have every reason to 
believe that the law commission will simply be a rubber stamp for 
the Minister of Justice. It is a very dangerous situation for this 
House of Commons and for the criminal justice system in Canada.
<P>
<B>(1115)</B>
<P>
	The bill will permit the governor in council to appoint-and how 
many times have we heard that word-a president and four other 
commissioners and an advisory council consisting of 24 members. 
I have every reason to believe that every single member of the law 
commission will be a card carrying member of the Liberal Party of 
Canada. There is no possible way that a law commission set up by 
this government, by appointment of the Minister of Justice, can be 
independent.
<P>
	There is no doubt that more Liberal appointees will be feathering 
their nests at the expense of taxpayers. The Liberal government 
knows that it will have to fight an election in two years. The 
Liberals want to keep their friends; it is only natural.
<P>
	The justice system in Canada cannot afford to have a rubber 
stamp law commission which is held up as an advisory board to 
help the Minister of Justice put through the law reforms his 
cappuccino friends in Toronto want. We cannot afford that.
<P>
	I doubt that when the commission is set up the justice 
department's budget will be reduced by an appropriate amount. I 
would like to be able to look into the future to see whether the 
justice department's budget will be  reduced by $3 million. I do not 
believe the figure of $3 million, but I would like to see the 
reduction. I do not think it can happen.
<P>
	If the Liberals have proved anything, it is the ability to 
mismanage taxpayers' money. Whenever I start talking about 
Liberals and budgets, I have to remind Canadians that using the 
Liberals' numbers of 1993, in their term of office the national debt 
will increase by $100 billion to some $650 billion. The interest 
payments will rise by some $10 billion to around $55 billion. This 
is ample evidence that Liberals do not know how to manage money. 
This gives more credence to the fact that I doubt very much the 
budget of the Department of Justice will be reduced by the amount 
which will be spent to finance the law commission.
<P>
	There is no compelling reason to re-establish the law 
commission. Law reform is possible without the creation of 
another government agency which will be supported by Canadian 
taxpayers. As I stated earlier, the commission will be nothing more 
than a mouthpiece for the Minister of Justice. No doubt he is 
desperately seeking some official body to back up his autocratic 
decisions on gun control and the death penalty. What better way to 
save his image than to spend $3 million a year to establish a panel 
of yes people beholden to the Minister of Justice, prepared to put 
forward or support his personal decisions?
<P>
<B>(1120 )</B>
<P>
	We should be getting our spending under control some day, but 
most definitely it will not be within the term of office of this 
government. Consider that the commissioners, the president, the 
board of advisers are going to be appointed by this government, by 
the Minister of Justice himself no doubt-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stinson:</B> That is the only job creation they know.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harris:</B> Mr. Speaker, could this possibly be part of the new 
Liberal job creation program? I thank my hon. colleague for 
bringing that to mind.
<P>
	The commissioners' work can in fact be done in the private 
sector. I would like to suggest that more average Canadians be 
involved when it comes to making reforms in the justice system. 
The hon. member for Calgary North offered the services of the 
Reform Party of Canada free of charge to the government. We 
would not charge $3 million; we would work for nothing on this.
<P>
	If the Reform Party were part of this commission for nothing, at 
no charge, it would be possible to have a truly independent body at 
no cost to the government and no cost to the taxpayers. We would 
pick 24 Reformers out of here and we would form the commission 
at no charge. We would give input to the Minister of Justice which 
truly represented the views of the Canadian people, not the views 
which come from his friends in Toronto. They would be views that 
were representative of the Canadian people all across the country.
<P>

<P>
	There have certainly been enough questions raised lately about 
just how Canada's criminal justice system is supposed to work. 
There have been many instances. There are cases out in B.C. 
recently where a band of militant natives held the RCMP at bay 
for a number of days. The people in B.C. were saying: ``My God, 
what is going on when people can draw arms against our country 
and hold a whole province and the national police force at ransom 
with seeming impugnity?'' We saw the same thing at Ipperwash.
<P>
	We see serious criminals who have committed violent acts being 
let out on parole and day passes and for what reason? For reasons 
that just boggle the mind of the average Canadian, only to have 
criminals go out and kill, rape and maim again.
<P>
	These are the concerns on the minds of the Canadian people, not 
some airy-fairy ideas that come from the minister's friends in 
Toronto. These concerns come from average Canadians. These 
concerns are not going to be addressed by the people he appoints to 
the law commission. They will be there only to do his bidding and 
not the bidding of the Canadian people.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, you can probably imagine that I do not support this 
bill either. In confusion, in conclusion-
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> It is a confusing bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harris:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is no wonder that I stumble on my 
words. The word confusion comes up right now because I am so 
confused about the motives of this bill. The minister is not telling 
the people what he is planning on doing.
<P>
	I am confused about how this bill has come into the House to be 
debated and will come to a vote when we found an announcement 
that the minister is going to create this law commission. What does 
this debate count for? Anything? Is this a waste of time? Surely the 
government must have some other business to put forward.
<P>
	We are going to waste time debating something that is already a 
done deal. If this deal is already a done deal as we saw by the 
announcement the other day, that means I have wasted my time in 
the House. The hon. member for Vancouver Quadra has wasted his 
time in this House. The member for Calgary North has wasted her 
time in this House. The Bloc member who spoke on this has wasted 
her time. Could we not be doing something more constructive than 
debating a bill that apparently already is a done deal?
<P>
<B>(1125)</B>
<P>
	I join with my Reform colleagues and the hon. members from 
the Bloc in opposing this bill in the strongest possible terms. It is 
inconsequential. It will not achieve any realistic reform to the 
criminal justice system. It cannot in the form it is proposed.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The Chair never engages in 
debate but certainly if I can be of any assistance to any member of 
any party at any time, let there be no confusion that on the 
government's Bill C-106, the member for Prince George-Bulkley 
Valley does not support the government's bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harris:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order I want to make it 
clear that I do not support Bill C-106.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough-Rouge River, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member in his remarks questions why we would 
be debating this bill today when as he suggests it is some kind of a 
done deal. He knows full well that the bill is not passed until it is 
passed.
<P>
	I am sure the hon. member would not for the world miss an 
opportunity nor would his colleagues have missed the opportunity 
to take the time of the House and tell Canadians how undeserving 
and unworthy this bill was of support. Having taken all his time to 
do this, something he figures was not worth his time in the first 
place nor worth the time of this House, maybe he will not find it 
worth his time to reply to my question. We will see.
<P>
	This bill which sets up this renewed law commission states very 
clearly in clause 6 that the commission is accountable through the 
minister to Parliament for the conduct of its affairs. That is a fairly 
clear statement, that this commission is accountable to Parliament. 
It is Parliament that will make decisions about changes in law.
<P>
	I am wondering what his comment is, what he thinks about the 
very clear statement that this commission is accountable to 
Parliament and not anybody else. It is accountable to Parliament. 
Does he believe what is written in the law on which he will have a 
chance to vote?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harris:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the question. Clause 6 
does say that, but let us examine what accountable through the 
minister to Parliament really means. In other words, Parliament 
will have no opportunity to question members of the law 
commission, only the minister. That is sort of a misleading 
explanation of accountability.
<P>
	We all know that unfortunately the Liberal Party has a majority 
in this House. Quite frankly, on very few occasions do I see the 
Liberal Party or any of the ministers really paying any attention to 
what the opposition members say. Every amendment that we ever 
put through to the Minister of Justice has been defeated by the 
government. This indicates that the Liberals have a clear agenda 
that they are going to follow regardless of what arguments the 
opposition members bring up in the House.
<P>
	The idea of the law commission being accountable to Parliament 
through the minister really is just a smoke and mirrors thing. The 
only way that could work would be if we had a minority govern-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15575"> 15575 </A></B>
<P>
ment, where the  government did not have an absolute majority in 
the House.
<P>
	If our party put amendments or recommendations for the 
criminal justice system to the law commission, if the minister did 
not want it to happen it simply would not happen because of the 
majority in this House. Although I appreciate the structure of the 
words in clause 6, I believe they are totally unworkable as far as 
accountability is concerned.
<P>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
	<B>Ms. Jean Augustine (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime 
Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of Bill C-106, an act 
respecting the Law Commission of Canada. In doing so, I want to 
focus on one particular aspect of the approach to law reform 
embodied in the legislation: the emphasis on consultation in the 
bill.
<P>
	If I may, I would take a minute to define the term 
``consultation''. Consultation is a word that over the years has been 
sucked into the chilly abstract vocabulary of social and 
organizational planning and also has become a part of the technical 
jargon of experts and specialists. Sometimes in the House the word 
``consultation'' seems to take on a negative connotation.
<P>
	In talking about consultation in the bill, I am talking about 
consultation as a living, social process, the antithesis of arbitrary 
rule, and what is in a positive sense the soul of the democratic 
system of government; that is, asking what one thinks and getting a 
response and acting on the response.
<P>
	When parties bring their policies before the public at election 
time or other times, that is consultation on the most basic scale. 
The building of democracy consists in large part in consulting ever 
more broadly and thoroughly, involving all who have a stake in the 
process. By consulting one looks at all the players, all those the end 
result of consultation would affect.
<P>
	All members of both Houses at this moment are working in a 
mode of consultation. We are doing the nation's business in a 
consultation mode. That is, when we are considering something 
that is before us we see the importance of consultation, the 
importance of sharing with the stakeholders and getting the views 
of all stakeholders and bringing this to the discussion.
<P>
	The agenda of law reform is set by the challenges of the times. It 
is a continuing task of renovation, identifying existing problems 
and new trends, and of dealing with the areas of the law in which 
time and change have revealed gaps and insufficiencies. That task 
was once handled for the most part by lawyers and legal 
professionals, toiling in the framework of the royal commission or 
other temporary bodies. It was shouldered by a permanent law 
reform commission, which operated from 1972 until 1992, when it 
was abolished by the  previous government to the general dismay 
of the legal profession.
<P>
	In the election platform of 1993 we said we would reverse that 
action. At the same time, we recognized that we should do more 
than restore the previous commission in a form identical to that 
prescribed in the early 1970s. We wanted to give that reform life 
and energy.
<P>
	The agenda of law reform is shaped in direction and detail by the 
social and economic environment of the time. That agenda has 
been utterly transformed since the structure and approach of the 
previous commission was laid down by Parliament nearly a quarter 
of a century ago. Times have changed. It is different. We are in 
different times because Canada is different. First of all, there has 
been a far-reaching social transformation. In 1971 we were a 
country of 21 million. In 1995 we are approaching 30 million in 
population. The demographic and cultural composition of our 
population is different, 1971 to now. We are also 25 years further 
down the road in terms of our democratic evolution.
<P>
<B>(1135)</B>
<P>
	Consultation has now been incorporated by custom and 
institution into our way of life and our way of doing things. 
Canadians of our time, including the generation that grew up with 
the charter of rights and freedoms, take it for granted that they will 
have a part in the making of policies that affect their lives. 
Meanwhile, transformations in technology, trade, and industrial 
structure have made the Canadian economy more complex.
<P>
	As a result of change at all these levels, the inadequacies that 
make law reform necessary reveal themselves not only in the 
courtroom but in other settings. They emerge in the marketplace, 
the workplace, the home, the scientific laboratory, the social 
welfare centre, and at the centres of learning of about a dozen 
disciplines. These trends have made it more important that law 
reform become a co-operative enterprise informed by expertise in 
many fields.
<P>
	The process that has brought this bill before us today has been 
open and consultative from the start. The Minister of Justice knows 
the benefit of consultation. This process began with two original 
consultations. They brought together representatives of the 
academic community, the judiciary, provincial governments, and 
also non-governmental organizations with an interest in law 
reform.
<P>
	The process continued in 1994 with the distribution of a 
consultation paper on the structure and modus operandi of the new 
commission. That document went to over 800 groups and 
individuals and to all members of the two chambers of Parliament.
<P>
	To illustrate the breadth of the consultation, the organizations 
involved included, to name a few, the Canadian Medical 
Association, the Elizabeth Fry Society,  the John Howard Society, 
women's groups, multicultural groups, aboriginal associations, et 
cetera. Of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15576"> 15576 </A></B>
<P>
course the process also allowed the full and active participation of 
experts in law. The Canadian Institute for the Administration of 
Justice held a nation-wide consultation with judges on the proposed 
law commission. The federal Department of Justice conducted a 
consultation with legal academics from all provinces. In addition, 
the subject has been discussed at meetings of the ministers 
responsible for justice in the federal, provincial, and territorial 
governments and at other meetings involving both the legal and 
non-legal communities. That is consultation.
<P>
	The legislation now before us has been shaped by many hands 
and moulded by experience in many fields. It is the product of 
consultation. It proposes an instrument for doing the work of law 
reform in the same mode. That commitment is reflected on every 
page of this bill. It starts with the first paragraph of the legislation, 
which says the advice the commission will provide will be based, 
and I quote, ``on the knowledge and experience of a wide range of 
groups and individuals''.
<P>
	The first of the five guiding principles in the preamble is that the 
commission's work should be open and inclusive of all Canadians. 
This approach is also expressed in the organizational design of the 
new law commission. Clause 7, which deals with organization, 
says, in effect, that the five commissioners need not be lawyers or 
judges or other legal professionals. Indeed, it specifically states 
that the membership should be representative of the 
socio-economic and cultural diversity of Canadian society.
<P>
	As an aside, I heard from the other side that we should have a 
number of parliamentarians sitting on that commission. Of course 
there are opportunities here for the full participation of the 
diversity of Canadian society.
<P>
<B>(1140 )</B>
<P>
	The four part time commissioners would live wherever their 
homes are, where their full time jobs and occupations require them 
to be. This means that at the executive level the commission would 
be linked personally and directly with the concerns of main street 
Canada.
<P>
	Clause 18 describes the advisory council of the commission, 
which will comprise 25 people serving on a voluntary basis-I 
repeat, voluntary basis-appointed by the commission. Like the 
commission members, the members of the council itself would be 
generally representative of the diversity of Canadian society. Its 
members will advise the commission on such things as strategic 
issues, review of its annual report, agenda setting and performance 
review. A varied blend of training and experience will be applied to 
the basic shaping of the process as it responds to the issues of the 
day.
<P>
	Clause 20 allows for an even further extension of the 
commission's connections with other disciplines and backgrounds. 
Under this clause the commission can bring in voluntary experts 
and specialists in any aspect of law reform to serve as members of 
temporary study panels. I am stressing the words ``temporary'' and 
``voluntary'' because the Reformers who spoke earlier seemed to 
miss that in the bill.
<P>
	Clause 23 is important in this regard. It ensures the products of 
work done in this mode will not disappear into a vault but will 
emerge without delay into the public domain for inspection and 
discussion. The minister must table any commission report to the 
two chambers of Parliament in session within 15 days of receiving 
it.
<P>
	In short, the commission created by this bill will be itself part of 
a wider network of collaboration in the work of law reform. It will 
allow us to renew and extend the architecture of law on the basis of 
an expert understanding of the complex issues involved. It will 
permit us to do so efficiently, effectively, and at a manageable cost.
<P>
	This bill is a blueprint for a law commission that will meet the 
needs of our time, a body that will be known not only for the legal 
soundness of its products but also for the relevance of its work on 
the issues of our time. This bill will meet an urgent need. It 
deserves our support. It deserves the support of all the members of 
this House.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Mary Clancy (Halifax, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am delighted 
to join in the debate in this area. The area of law reform is one of 
special interest and special concern to those of us who have in the 
past been involved in the legal profession. It should be of interest to 
all of us as legislators.
<P>
	Having been here all morning, I have listened, sometimes in 
shock, to some of the comments that have come particularly from 
the members of the third party with regard to a need for this bill. It 
may be a good time to talk about why this bill is being brought 
forward.
<P>
	I first want to note that one of the hon. members for Calgary 
noted this bill ``has the justice minister's fingerprints all over it''. 
Well, it is his bill. I would hope it would have his fingerprints all 
over it. I wonder whose fingerprints should be on it if not those of 
the Minister of Justice. The Minister of Justice, in his usual well 
thought out way, has indeed brought this bill forward. We would 
not mind the solicitor general's fingerprints on it either, but as it 
happens this bill is brought forward by the Minister of Justice.
<P>
<B>(1145 )</B>
<P>
	I want to talk about the law commission because tremendous 
things have come from bodies of this nature both at the national 
level and in various provinces where these bodies exist.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15577"> 15577 </A></B>
<P>
	I listened, more in sorrow than in anger, to members opposite 
talk about Liberal flunkeys. I think of the people who have served 
on law reform commissions. Those comments ill serve anybody 
who wishes to be a public servant. In particular, I think of 
members of the former law reform commission, Mr. Justice 
Linden, for example. I recall Mr. Justice Linden's coming to a 
parliamentary committee where he and I crossed swords in an 
admirable debate on a bill which his commission had brought 
forward.
<P>
	Mr. Justice Linden was then of the Ontario high court, as it was 
known. He is now with the appeal division of the Federal Court of 
Canada. He is the author of a torts textbook which all of us in the 
House who went through law school had the pleasure to read. We 
were taught very well by Mr. Justice Linden through his 
publications, textbooks and articles. To refer to him as a Liberal 
flunkey does a great disservice to the bench, the bar and Canadians 
who serve their country.
<P>
	In my province of Nova Scotia one of the many lawyers and lay 
persons who have served so well on law reform commissions is the 
former dean of Dalhousie Law School, Professor William Charles. 
He was known across Canada as a law teacher. He was one of the 
founders of the University of Victoria law school when the 
University of Victoria asked Dalhousie law school to send 
professors to help it start a law school. He is unparalleled in his 
respect across the country in legal circles as someone learned in the 
law, a law reformer, a law teacher and a legal administrator.
<P>
	I think of the current president of the University of Calgary, 
Murray Fraser, another former acting dean and associate dean at 
Dalhousie Law School. He was the first dean of the University of 
Victoria law school. He served on the Law Reform Commission of 
Canada back in the middle seventies before he went on to Victoria.
<P>
	In Nova Scotia, where politics are taken with pabulum, the 
Fraser family would be taken aback to hear President Fraser 
referred to as a Liberal flunkey or a flunkey of any kind. That kind 
of pejorative talk is unfortunate.
<P>
	It is perhaps because certain political parties are new to the 
legislative process that it behoves those of us who have been 
around a little longer to talk about-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stinson:</B> Far too long.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> Not according to the people of Nova Scotia.
<P>
	The people on the Law Reform Commission of Canada and the 
various provincial law commissions have a job quite different from 
that of legislators. I have served for seven years in the House. Mr. 
Speaker, you and I served together on a legislative committee, 
which I am sure will go down in your memory, when we were in 
opposition.
<P>
	Legislative committees are one of the areas along with the 
Chamber where parliamentarians from both sides of the House can 
make their wishes, their policy concerns and their concerns 
generally for the development of legislation heard. That is what we 
are here for, no question.
<P>
<B>(1150 )</B>
<P>
	A law commission is instituted for those areas that 
parliamentarians, busy with their daily jobs, do not have time to 
delve into. The vast majority of members are not lawyers, which is 
a good thing. The vast majority of members are certainly not 
academics and, heaven knows, the vast majority of members are 
not what one could call intellectuals. Consequently we are not in 
the business of doing the kind of legal research, exploration and 
prognostication-look it up-that leads to legislation in good 
government and prods governments to move in ways in the best 
interests of the country.
<P>
	That is why people of the calibre of Mr. Justice Linden, 
Professor William Charles and President Murray Fraser have 
served at the provincial and federal levels along with hundreds of 
other Canadians. They have served with one desire and one desire 
only, to do good for their country.
<P>
	For members of the opposition to use this bill, which fulfils a red 
book promise, as some sort of partisan stick with which they think 
they are beating the government not only cheapens the process 
when we consider the source but it says to Canadians we do not 
want their participation in the public process.
<P>
	We on this side of the House do not say that. Three million 
dollars for this law commission is a low price to pay for the 
tremendous contribution of the people who will serve on this 
commission. What a low price to pay for the tremendous work they 
will do, for the hours of research, for the incredible gift of their 
thoughts, hard work and dedication to Canada.
<P>
	It reminds me of a bit of a cliché about optimists and pessimists, 
certainly something that has been repeated often; the idea that an 
optimist sees a glass half full and a pessimist sees a glass half 
empty. When it comes to the boards and commissions that help us 
run the country, that advise the government, prod the government, 
in many cases boards and commissions at arm's length from the 
government with quasi-judicial functions on behalf of the people of 
Canada, the glass from my point of view is more than merely half 
full, it is full.
<P>
	How very lucky we are in Canada that there are legions of 
citizens delighted to fulfil this role when many of them could be 
making more money and certainly taking a whole lot less abuse in 
other endeavours.
<P>
	Having dealt summarily with the unusual and perhaps 
ill-informed comments from the other side, I will talk a bit about 
the bill. What is the commission created for? It is to fulfil the needs 
of the government and Parliament  for independent, broadly based, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15578"> 15578 </A></B>
<P>
strategic advice on legal policy and law reform issues. That seems 
to me a fairly straightforward and clear statement of intent.
<P>
	Independence means not connected to the party in government or 
the party in opposition. I realize there are many times when the 
third party does not really behave like a political party. If a party 
has not been in existence very long and does not have much history, 
it really does not understand how political parties behave. 
However, according to the office of the Chief Electoral Officer, it is 
a political party. It may be tragic. It may be unfortunate but it is a 
political party. It appears to be a political party with more than its 
share of empty barrels. As a political party it is not considered 
independent.
<P>
<B>(1155)</B>
<P>
	The hon. member for Calgary suggested her party could do this 
independently. It may well be its neophyte status in Parliament that 
under the rules of Parliament, even being the third party, it does not 
qualify as independent. There are other adjectives such as strategic, 
legal, et cetera, which it may not qualify for as well. I would not 
comment on those, heaven forbid.
<P>
	I remind members of the third party as well as my trusting and 
beloved colleagues on this side of the House that keeping red book 
promises is very important.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stinson:</B> It is called patronage with a capital <I>P</I>.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> A three syllable word, well done. When I sat on the 
other side of the House and saw the law reform commission 
disbanded, I along with many of my colleagues was very unhappy. 
I knew how important it was to the development of legislation.
<P>
	One of the things the law commission does is provide a critical 
eye and a distinctive perspective on modernizing the law. The word 
modernizing is very important. Words like modernize, progressive 
and forward looking along with independent and strategic may not 
be words familiar to some of our colleagues.
<P>
	The commission will have five guiding principles. It will 
approach the law from a multi-disciplinary perspective, and this is 
very important. As I said before, one cannot leave the making of 
the law and the creativity of law reform merely to lawyers or 
legislators. One needs to bring in people from all walks of life, to 
listen to them, to hear what they need.
<P>
	When I taught law I used to tell my students the law is a reactive 
social science. In general law will come into existence to react to a 
specific need, to specific a situation.
<P>
	Sometimes, as in the case of human rights law, the law is 
proactive. For many of us, especially those enamoured of human 
rights law and who see this as one of the brightest lights in our 
parliamentary careers, the law then becomes proactive.
<P>
	In general it is reactive and it is the job of a law commission to 
delve into the hearts and minds of the people in a way that 
legislators and lawyers in the legislatures do not have the time to 
do. They have a specific job which they will be doing all the time 
whereas legislators, contrary to the rather superficial responses of 
the third party, have other things to do.
<P>
	We as legislators and as members of Parliament have casework, 
committee work, political work, travelling back and forth to our 
ridings. It is a massive job, which I do not have to tell anyone here, 
including members of the third party.
<P>
	Consequently if one is to serve the people as one should with the 
law reform commission one needs people who will dedicate all 
their time to the particular necessities and exigencies of law 
reform.
<P>
	This seems a fairly simple statement and a fairly simple concept 
to grasp. Obviously it is not in some cases, but I can do only what I 
have been asked by the people controlling the debate. The chips 
will have to fall where they may, in empty barrels or elsewhere.
<P>
	There are five guiding principles. I have talked about the first 
one, a multi-disciplinary perspective being open and inclusive by 
making its work more accessible and understandable to all 
Canadians. This is something that is very dear to my heart.
<P>
<B>(1200)</B>
<P>
	I taught undergraduates in several universities in Nova Scotia in 
areas of law, family law, legal status of women, law and aging, and 
environmental law. I always found it terribly important to 
demystify the legal process for the majority of Canadians.
<P>
	A legitimate complaint that comes to us both as legislators and 
lawyers is that the law is mumbo-jumbo. There are legal 
documents and pieces of legislation that the average Canadian does 
not understand what we are on about. Part of the work of the law 
reform commission is to make the law more accessible and 
understandable for Canadians and to utilize innovative research, 
consultation and management practices through new technologies.
<P>
	As we approach the millennium we have exploding technology 
in the country. We are one of the leading countries on earth, if not 
the leading in certain high tech areas. Except for the people trained 
in those particular disciplines, to the vast majority of Canadians a 
lot of this is very mystifying.
<P>
	How much more mystifying is the regulatory and legislative 
process that surrounds us? Ergo, how much more necessary is it to 
have the law reform commission take on the job of making sure 
that as the legislation is brought forward to the government it will 
be less mystifying to Canadians?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15579"> 15579 </A></B>
<P>
	Another important point is being responsible and accountable 
to key groups affected by law reform through partnerships that 
build on existing knowledge and expertise. Since it came into 
power two years ago the government has talked about the question 
of partnerships. We talked about partnerships between business 
and government. We talked about partnerships between interest 
groups and government. It is one reason we have seen massive 
consultations in all sorts of areas between the government and the 
people. The people of Canada appreciate that consultation because 
the previous government of not so blessed memory had no history 
of consulting with Canadians except in a very few cases.
<P>
	A law commission gives an opportunity for Canadians to come 
forward with their concerns about developing areas and the things 
they would like to see. They can come forward to help develop law 
in areas that provide for good government. In effect it is a tool of 
democracy. It is one when we were in opposition we were very 
distressed to see removed. It is one that we promised in the red 
book we would reinstate. I could not be happier that we are 
fulfilling this promise, fingerprints of the Minister of Justice or 
not.
<P>
	Next is the achieving of cost effectiveness in operation and the 
recommendations and advice it provides. This goes back to the well 
meant but misguided comments of my colleague on the other side 
who talked about the cost. The cost for Parliament to do the work of 
the law reform commission in time, in person hours-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harris:</B> Reform Party members will do it for nothing.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> They will do it for nothing. It is probably like 
throwing in 10 per cent of their salaries and all that stuff. I notice 
some of them are not talking about the pensions over there.
<P>
	That is not what Parliament was elected to do. If my hon. 
colleagues do not understand that perhaps they need job 
descriptions. Parliament was elected to represent the people, to 
debate in the Chamber, to review legislation in legislative 
committees, to deal with various and sundry public policies in 
standing committees, et cetera, to do constituency work, and to 
deal with our political duties.
<P>
<B>(1205 )</B>
<P>
	I can only say that if members of the third party feel they have 
the time-and I am not even going to get into the questions of 
expertise-to be a law reform commission, thank the powers that 
be we are in government and there is little or no danger of that ever 
taking place under the current government.
<P>
	I am delighted to support the legislation. I am delighted we are 
fulfilling a red book promise. I am delighted there will once again 
be a law commission to serve the needs of Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened to the hon. member for Halifax who mentioned 
quite truthfully that there was not a vast number of lawyers in the 
House and that there was not a vast number of intellectuals. I agree 
with her. The problem is that we have a vast number of Liberals in 
the House. That is where the problems come from.
<P>
	The hon. member spoke about the benefits of establishing the 
law commission. Let us go back and look at the history of the law 
reform commission holding hands with the Liberal government. 
For example, the law commission came into being in 1971. Lo and 
behold in 1976, and I assume at the suggestion, advice and 
direction of the law commission which is there to represent the will 
and the opinions of the people, we find section 745 of the Criminal 
Code was amended in the House to eliminate capital punishment in 
Canada, to provide for the eligibility of first degree murderers 
given a life sentence of 25 years to apply for early parole after 15 
years. These provisions were brought forward by the member for 
Notre-Dame-de-Grâce who was a Liberal and still is a Liberal, 
working hand in hand with the Liberal appointed law commission.
<P>
	Poll after poll has shown when polls are taken in an honest 
fashion of average Canadians, something that the Liberal 
government does not relate to, that they would support capital 
punishment and always have. Poll after poll has shown that 
Canadians are disgusted with the fact that violent murderers given 
life sentences can apply for early parole and in most cases get it 
after 15 years. Poll after poll has shown that the people of Canada 
do not appreciate these parts of the law.
<P>
	How can the member for Halifax stand and say that the law 
reform commission, holding hands with the Liberal government, is 
reflecting the will of the Canadian people? I should like to ask her 
some specific questions.
<P>
	These are some of the things Canadians have told us are wrong 
with the justice system, some of the things that would have been 
fixed if the law reform commission had been an effective body that 
listened to the will of the people.
<P>
	First is the delay in implementing the use of DNA testing, which 
at the insistence of our party the government finally got around to. 
Had the law commission prior to being disbanded in 1992, and 
maybe it did, recommended to the government of the day that DNA 
testing be brought in, perhaps we would not have had to wait so 
long and perhaps some of the murderers who have gone free 
because we did not have access to this way of gathering evidence 
would be behind bars right now.
<P>
	If the law commission was so effective, how come it took us 
until 1995 to deal with the drunken defence used in the courts? 
Why did it take us that long if the law commission was so good?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15580"> 15580 </A></B>
<P>
	I talked about parole eligibility. If the law reform commission 
was so good, why has it not closed the loopholes in parole 
eligibility? What about violent criminals being let out of prison 
early? If the law reform commission was so good, why do we have 
violent criminals walking the streets because some parole board 
has screwed up its decisions? Who is charged with fixing those 
mistakes?
<P>
<B>(1210 )</B>
<P>
	Let us talk about what upsets Canadians most of all, the grand 
idea of condoning plea bargaining in our justice system. Canadians 
are fed up with seeing people accused of crimes plea bargaining 
away the more violent sections of the crime in order for the courts 
to give a lesser sentence and get a sure conviction.
<P>
	If the law reform commission is so good, why do we have so 
many things wrong with the criminal justice system? The fact 
remains that the laws of the country are made by lawyers for 
lawyers with little regard for the opinions, concerns and wishes of 
Canadians. If it were not that way we would not have so many 
problems with the justice system.
<P>
	Canadians have had enough with law commissions and a Liberal 
government that treat criminals as if they have special rights. In 
1982 the Liberal government brought in a Constitution and in the 
section on rights granted more rights to people who break the law 
than to people who keep the law. That is an absolute disgrace and 
the legislation will not change a thing.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the comments of the hon. 
member because what I hear in them is a real cri du coeur. I 
understand his being upset about certain situations that he 
perceives to be developing in the country. There are several things 
to consider but let me deal with a number of comments he made.
<P>
	With regard to the problem of there being a Liberal government, 
I would only say to the hon. member that the government was duly 
elected in a very democratic process. A majority of Canadians 
elected a majority of Liberals. We are here to represent the wishes 
of our constituents, just as the hon. member is here to represent the 
wishes of his. It so happens that a majority of Canadians picked this 
Liberal government. I understand he does not like it. I understand 
he does not agree with it, but there it is. It is a fait accompli and 
unfortunately he will have to deal with it. I suspect he will have to 
deal with it after the next election as well, but we will wait and see.
<P>
	There is a real misconception in the land with regard to criminal 
activity. This is not to minimize the criminal activity that takes 
place but unfortunately some of our hon. colleagues in the third 
party are overly influenced by American television and American 
newspapers. The crime rate is not rising in this country over all. It 
is rising in the United States; it is not rising here. As a matter of  
fact in certain sectors it is dropping, but good news unfortunately is 
not something the third party deals in.
<P>
	I will certainly not deal with the member's meanderings on the 
issue of capital punishment. As my constituents well know I have 
been against capital punishment from the first time I ever heard of 
it. I will continue to be against capital punishment for the rest of 
my life. The people of Halifax know well what my feelings are on 
this and other issues, never having been one to hide my opinions.
<P>
	I go back to what the hon. member said about the law 
commission. With the greatest of respect it shows he does not 
understand it. The law reform commission is not the House of 
Commons and the House of Commons is not the law reform 
commission. They are two separate entities with two separate jobs. 
The law reform commission is there to research and recommend. 
Then the government and the House of Commons can accept or 
reject its recommendations. In many cases those recommendations 
are accepted; in other cases they are rejected.
<P>
	They talk about it being hand and glove with the Liberal 
government. I merely ask the member to take any list of the 
previous members of the Law Reform Commission of Canada, or 
of those provinces that have law reform commissions, and he will 
see people who have served their country, served their province and 
served their community in ways the third party would like very 
much to be able to emulate.
<P>
<B>(1215 )</B>
<P>
	We are talking about people who are eminent members of their 
communities, holders of the Order of Canada, people who have 
been honoured by non-partisan members of their community. I for 
one find this disappointing, tragic, and I would go so far as to say 
despicable, that they would cast aspersions on the characters of 
such a large group of public servants, of people who serve Canada.
<P>
	Why would these people cast aspersions on people who wish to 
serve their country? Why is membership on a federal board or 
committee, a provincial board or committee, or a municipal board 
or committee something that should taint you? I am appalled that 
anyone would suggest this. I am appalled that there is such a 
narrow and angry and sad view of public service in this country by 
the hon. members of the third party, that they do not rejoice in the 
opportunity to serve Canada, in the opportunity to stand up and say 
how lucky we are to be in the House of Commons or how lucky our 
constituents are to be able to serve their country.
<P>
	If they do not feel that way, I can only say we feel on this side of 
the House a great sorrow for them at the loss in their public 
participation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15581"> 15581 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Ms. Shaughnessy Cohen (Windsor-St. Clair, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is always a pleasure to follow the member for Halifax, 
if only because very often there is nothing left to say so I can speak 
much more briefly.
<P>
	First of all, I want to comment on how this bill fits in with the 
overall Liberal vision and the overall Liberal plan for Canada. I 
think the Reform Party is shortsighted when they criticize this bill 
only on the limited grounds they have set out. In reality, justice 
issues in many respects are economic issues. I say this because I 
come from a community, Windsor and Essex county, that has 
prospered as it leaves the recession. We are probably on the leading 
edge of recovery from the last recession.
<P>
	I have noticed at home, and our city leaders and our citizens have 
noticed as well, that as our community becomes more prosperous, 
as we have more jobs, as we have a healthier community 
economically, we have a healthier community in other ways. When 
we look at the health of the community and we look at how we have 
been affected by this recovery from the recession, or partial 
recovery from the recession, what we see is that violent crime has 
gone down, other forms of crime have decreased, and the pressure 
of social problems has lessened. This is because the community is 
in better shape economically.
<P>
	In the early 1980s, when the last great recession hit, I was 
practising law in Windsor, not as a young lawyer but as a new 
lawyer. I did a bit of matrimonial law in addition to my regular 
criminal practice. It was devastating, because as there were layoffs 
at the auto plants and at the feeder plants it seemed there were more 
marriage breakdowns. As there were more marriage breakdowns, it 
seemed that my practice in what were then called juvenile 
delinquents, young offenders, increased in terms of criminal law. It 
seemed to me also that I had to deal with more domestic violence in 
my practice.
<P>
	Subsequently, when I began to prosecute I found the same thing. 
With economic waves and downturns and the economic 
roller-coaster we have experienced in the recent past in Windsor, 
domestic violence and other forms of violence increased. There 
were more robberies, more property offences, more break-ins. You 
could see and palpably feel the link between economic health and 
social health in our community.
<P>
<B>(1220 )</B>
<P>
	When Reform talks about the justice system they should do so 
within the greater framework of economic development in our 
communities. A community with a healthy economic base and with 
active ongoing economic development is a community that is going 
to be healthy in other areas. This is part of the Liberal program for 
healthy communities.
<P>
	The law commission is a very small part of this. I would like to 
point out that this is not something we have just recently pulled out 
of the air; this is something for which we set aside money in our 
February 1995 budget. In their joint wisdoms, the Minister of 
Justice and the Minister of Finance agreed that setting aside a 
relatively small amount of money out of the overall budget for the 
work of the law commission was an important part of moving 
Canada forward, moving forward into communities like Windsor, 
Tecumseh, and St. Clair Beach to make them healthier.
<P>
	The law commission allows us to reach into individual 
communities and into the broader Canadian community for advice 
and help as to how we can improve our justice system. As we are 
increasing the number of jobs in the country, over 400,000 since we 
were elected, as we are making the country economically more 
viable and as we are making it more prosperous, we are also 
looking at and dealing with aspects of our criminal justice system 
and our justice system in general that can be improved.
<P>
	The Reform Party complains about the way the commission is 
set up. In reality, the commission is doing what the Reform Party 
has asked us to do. It is allowing us to go to what they call the grass 
roots. In reality, of course, the Reform Party's grass roots are 
people who think like them, who are not a majority of the country. 
They have a fundamental problem with democracy, which allows 
the majority of a country to rule.
<P>
	We are not satisfied with that either. We know that not everyone 
who voted for us agreed with every single thing we wanted to do in 
the red book. We know that the people of Canada who voted for us 
did so because of the overall thrust of our policies, and they may 
have some disagreements. We are not satisfied with that. We are 
setting up structures that allow us to reach out to find out what is 
going on, what people are thinking and where we can go.
<P>
	The Reform Party derides the efforts of the former law reform 
commission, which was summarily executed by the Conservative 
government. Deride that as it will, in fact this is not the old law 
reform commission; this is a new law commission, and it is a 
commission with a difference. This commission has a special 
mandate, which is very different from that of the old law reform 
commission.
<P>
	When the law reform commission was eliminated there was a 
cry from many parts of the country, from groups that had benefited, 
who had been able to persuade the law reform commission that new 
advances were required and changes were required in the law and 
who saw that come to fruition in legislation. However, this law 
commission, with its special guiding principles-which are not just 
stuff we are talking about, they are actual principles we have put 
into the legislation-has a very real difference, which will allow us 
to tap into what all Canadians are thinking about our justice 
system.
<P>
	This law commission is mandated to take a multi-disciplinary 
approach to law reform and to the legal system. Like the Liberal 
government, it sees the  justice system as part of a broader social 
and economic environment. It is mandated to look at what people 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15582"> 15582 </A></B>
<P>
have to say from a social work perspective and at what people have 
to say from labour. It is mandated to look at what people have to 
say who are concerned about violent crime in our communities. It 
is mandated to take a look at what probation officers have to say, at 
what parole officers have to say, and at what the people on the 
street have to say. It is mandated to be open and inclusive by 
making its work more accessible and more understandable to all 
Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1225 )</B>
<P>
	The member for Halifax indicated that she has always believed 
there is a need to demystify the law. Any of us who have worked in 
the law know that is the case. We can work in an ivory tower, 
prepare our mumbo-jumbo and talk to each other with our special 
language and never communicate that to Canadians or to our 
clients. If it is a mystery, it is somehow something only a specialist 
can deal with.
<P>
	We are not content to have that carry on. The Reform Party talks 
about that all the time. Yet it criticizes us for making a law 
commission that is open, inclusive, and makes its work accessible 
and understandable to all Canadians.
<P>
	This law commission will utilize innovative research, 
consultation and management practices by utilizing new 
technologies, something that, as good as it was, the old law reform 
commission was not very good at doing. It will be responsive and 
accountable to key groups that are affected by law reform through 
partnerships that build on existing knowledge and expertise.
<P>
	This is an interesting one, because this again contrasts with what 
the Reform Party says and what it does. The Reform Party loves to 
talk to us about special interest groups. It loves to accuse the 
government of being captive to the special interest groups. What it 
means is that we listen to groups it does not listen to. Its special 
interest groups, like the American National Rifle Association or 
certain alleged wildlife organizations or the people who I like to 
call the gunners, are of course not special interest groups. That is 
not what Reform members mean; they can listen to those special 
interest groups.
<P>
	There are lots of special interest groups out there. There are 
groups that are interested in the welfare of human beings. There are 
groups that are interested in benefiting mankind and their fellow 
Canadians. The law commission will give them a place to go, so 
they do not have to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars 
lobbying parliamentarians who are busy with other aspects of their 
work. It gives them a place to go and be heard. It also gives the 
individual a place to go and be heard as well. I cannot see how the 
Reform Party could object to that.
<P>
	The law commission is mandated to be cost effective in its 
operations and in the recommendations and advice it provides. The 
last law commission, indeed many of the vehicles that governments 
have used in the past to advise them, did not have to worry about 
budgets or about making recommendations the government could 
implement in a cost effective manner. We are mandating this group 
to do so. We are telling them to come to us with a project or a piece 
of legislation and think of the economic impact that will have as 
well.
<P>
	I would suggest that this bill is part of good Liberal government 
in Canada. It is part of what the majority of Canadians elected us to 
do.
<P>
	I will never forget what the little person from the Reform Party 
who ran against me said. When Reform became the 
government-quite a leap of fancy-it would listen to Canadians. 
Here we are providing the vehicle to not just listen to Canadians but 
to go out and shake them and ask them what they think about this, 
so that we can incorporate their views into our overall scheme. 
When we try to do that, where is the Reform Party? Politics as 
usual. It is here heckling and arguing but it has not bothered to take 
a look at what this bill really does.
<P>
	On that point, I would like to comment on something else I heard 
today, which is the use of what I would call fear tactics and 
fearmongering to try to scuttle a bill of the importance of this one.
<P>
	When Reform members talk about violent crime, when they feed 
the myth that violent crime is on the upswing in Canada, they do 
their own constituents a disservice. It is not for them to create a 
false environment and then try to force the government to operate 
within it. It is not for them to set up a straw dog in order to knock it 
down. It is up to them, as a responsible third party, to focus on 
problems that actually exist in society.
<P>
	There is no question that violent crime exists in Canada. There is 
no question that violent crime that exists at any level is 
unacceptable. However, it is wrong to suggest that it is growing and 
this government is doing nothing about it. It is also wrong to 
suggest that a law commission made up of people from every 
aspect of our greater Canadian community will do nothing about it.
<P>
<B>(1230 )</B>
<P>
	This bill responds to Canadians. I would like to compliment the 
Minister of Justice for what he said when he announced this bill. It 
sets out a real Liberal and a real Canadian attitude to law reform. 
He said: ``Canada's legal system faces complex legal issues that 
require more than a legal solution. Effective long term remedies lie 
in an approach that includes not only legal but social, economic and 
other disciplines as well. The Government of Canada believes that 
an independent, multi-disciplinary law reform body is essential to 
this process''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15583"> 15583 </A></B>
<P>
	I would suggest that is good common sense. I would suggest 
that the Minister of Justice is right on. That is the Liberal vision. 
That is the Canadian vision.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Russell MacLellan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am very pleased to have this opportunity to express my support for 
Bill C-106.
<P>
	The legislation we are considering responds to the urgent need 
for a permanent body to advise the government on the 
improvement, modernization and reform of the laws of Canada. As 
this bill makes clear, there are many requirements to be met if this 
work is to succeed. We must have openness of process and the 
focusing of a multi-disciplined expertise on these issues.
<P>
	Something else that is required is a close attention to the matter 
of costs by the commission both in its methods and in its goals. 
This was a concern expressed by the Reform Party. It is this aspect 
of the legislation I want to concentrate on today.
<P>
	In the context of this bill, there are two aspects to the challenge 
of efficiency. One is the need for the commission itself to meet the 
test of cost effectiveness, both in its organizational architecture and 
in its approach. The other is the requirement that the commission's 
work contribute to the cost effectiveness of the Canadian legal 
system in general.
<P>
	The structure of the commission supports these goals. Four of 
the five commissioners will serve on a part time basis. The 
members of the advisory council will serve without pay. So will the 
members of the temporary study panels that the commission will 
create to provide expert assistance on the specific issues of the day. 
Hon. members will also find that the administrative and the 
operational arrangements visualized in the bill reflect the concerns 
for costs.
<P>
	The legislation steers the commission away from the pitfall of 
trying to do everything itself. As the preamble makes clear, it will 
promote partnerships with a wide range of interested groups and 
individuals, including the academic community.
<P>
	The commission will save money by sharing services wherever 
practical. For instance, the previous commission maintained an 
in-house library. The new commission will make use of existing 
facilities. This approach is implicit in the administrative apparatus. 
The commission will be served by a secretariat of no more than 
eight people.
<P>
	Unlike its predecessor body, the commission will not retain a 
significant body of full time researchers but will make greater use 
of contract help. There are several advantages to this arrangement. 
The most obvious is that one avoids having to hire an in-house 
expert specialist for every issue or alternatively, to expend time in 
bringing in-house staff up to speed on new agenda items.
<P>
<B>(1235 )</B>
<P>
	Hon. members will also note that the bill designates the 
commission as a departmental corporation. This too impinges on 
cost effectiveness. It allows the commission to receive gifts, 
bequests and other donations from outside sources and to 
reimburse some costs through the sales of its publications.
<P>
	The important question is what it will all cost. The government 
said as early as in the red book and has kept saying since that the 
commission will operate on a budget of $3 million a year, all of 
which will come from funds already voted. This is Spartan fare 
indeed considering that the previous law commission operated on 
approximately $5 million a year in its last operating year. Ten years 
ago it would not have been possible to tackle a task of this 
magnitude within these limits. What makes it possible today is the 
structure and the modus operandi outlined in the bill. What in turn 
makes that possible is new technology.
<P>
	The bill before us recognizes the importance of that factor. The 
preamble incorporates as a guiding principle the requirement that 
the commission use new technology wherever appropriate in order 
to achieve, and I quote from the bill ``efficiency in its operations 
and effectiveness in its results''. The commission will do so in 
every phase of its operation.
<P>
	For example, a large part of law reform is research, the 
painstaking gathering, sharing and storing of information. The use 
of modern information technology will make it easier and cheaper 
to do all of these things. The same technology will cut other costs 
down to size.
<P>
	For example, law reform is envisaged in this legislation as a 
consultative process in which people from many fields and regions 
will present their viewpoints and reason together. In the days when 
that required a convergence of experts from all over Canada to one 
location, that activity alone would bite large holes into the 
operating budget. Today fortunately, we can achieve that meeting 
of minds at a much lower cost by making intelligent use of 
information technologies, for example through on-line networking, 
teleconferencing and video conferencing.
<P>
	These new tools can also lighten the administrative load. The 
birth of a new organization no longer has to mean the making of a 
new multi-layered mini bureaucracy. On-line networking for 
example makes it possible for organizations to share personnel, pay 
and other services. The commission will take full advantage of 
these opportunities.
<P>
	This bill is a mandate for the pursuit of efficiency, both in the 
internal workings of the commission and the interpretation of its 
mandate.
<P>
	As the bill says, one function of the commission will be to 
recommend measures to make the legal system itself more efficient 
and economical. As the commission  considers which of various 
options for reform to recommend, it will give full weight to the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15584"> 15584 </A></B>
<P>
element of costs, both the immediate ones and those associated 
with downstream economic and social impacts.
<P>
	The importance of this part of the commission's role has 
influenced every aspect of its design. It is reflected, for example, in 
the emphasis in this bill on the multi-disciplinary approach to law 
reform, one that involves not only lawyers but also economists, 
scientists and other experts. Efficient solutions can only come 
when we see the problem in the whole context. This applies with 
full force to law reform.
<P>
<B>(1240 )</B>
<P>
	The failure to take costs into effect leads to system overload. It 
weakens the administration and enforcement of the law. It 
undermines the confidence and credibility that sustains the law. 
Because the law touches on every aspect of our national life, it is 
detrimental to our national well-being if we do not take these cost 
factors into account.
<P>
	Cost effectiveness, the quality of achieving a high ratio of output 
to input has achieved something of the status of a common cause. It 
is the recognized prerequisite to Canada's competitiveness on 
world markets. It is the key to the sustainability of the social 
programs which are this country's pride and its strength. It is vital 
to the efficiency of the legal system which has the infrastructure for 
everything else.
<P>
	The cost effectiveness component will also allow us to bring 
together legal and other experts, scientists and scholars, through 
these technological advances to allow them to be part of improving 
the law in Canada. This is going to open up the whole process of 
law reform and the appreciation of the law in this country.
<P>
	By spending less we are really going to be able to do more. Most 
of all, it is going to put us back in the lead of all western nations as 
a country that has a law reform commission or a law commission as 
it is in this case. In our modern society we have to have laws which 
are going to evolve with society. No law can be looked on as a law 
that will rest in its exact form for an indefinite period of time. We 
constantly must be looking at our laws and appraising the needs of 
society for changes in the laws.
<P>
	If, as some members have said, this can be done through the 
Department of Justice, then of course we are blind to the context at 
which we must look at our law. We must look at our laws separate 
and apart from the Department of Justice so that recommendations 
can come to the department from outside. That is by far the 
healthiest way of approaching this.
<P>
	Today in our society and in the world we must be conscious of 
the strength of the rule of law. People look to our laws and they 
look to our society. Part of our society is the fabric of our laws. 
When investment takes place it not only looks at the economic 
climate but it also  looks at the stability of our system and the 
forthrightness of our laws.
<P>
	This bill is going to do a great deal to enhance an already 
tremendous respect for the Canadian justice system throughout the 
world. I am very pleased we are dealing with this bill today.

	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (for the Minister of Finance, Lib.)</B> moved that 
Bill C-105, an act to implement a convention between Canada and 
the Republic of Latvia, a convention between Canada and the 
Republic of Estonia, a convention between Canada and the 
Republic of Trinidad and Tobago and a protocol between Canada 
and the Republic of Hungary, for the avoidance of double taxation 
and the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on 
income, be read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Walker (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity 
to speak today at second reading of Bill C-105.
<P>
	Bill C-105 implements reciprocal income tax conventions 
between Canada and Latvia, Canada and Estonia, Canada and 
Trini-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15585"> 15585 </A></B>
<P>
dad and Tobago and a protocol  to the current income tax treaty 
between Canada and Hungary.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	These tax conventions or treaties, as they are also sometimes 
called, and their amending protocols, are similar to other 
conventions already approved by this House.
<P>
	Tax conventions two main purposes: firstly, to avoid double 
taxation of income and, secondly, to prevent tax evasion. However, 
not all tax conventions require Parliament approval. Certain tax 
agreements require no legislative measure when the Income Tax 
Act already contains equivalent provisions.
<P>
	For example, an agreement respecting the profits of airline and 
shipping companies confirming the exemption they are entitled to 
under the Income Tax Act would not require legislative 
authorization.
<P>
	On the other hand, double taxation conventions all require 
parliamentary approval, because they change the effect of national 
legislation, specifically the Income Tax Act. The same criteria 
apply to amending protocols.
<P>
	This is why we are considering Bill C-105.
<P>
	A few minutes ago, I mentioned conventions that have already 
been approved. Those in Bill C-105 are no different. They are part 
of a series of tax conventions dating back to 1971, when reform of 
our tax system necessitated Canada's developing a network of 
double taxation treaties with other countries.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Bill C-105 continues along this path. Canada now has double 
taxation treaties in place with 55 other countries. This point brings 
me to a related topic, the selection of countries for reciprocal tax 
treaties. How does the government decide with which countries to 
negotiate tax treaties? Are there benefits to having tax treaties with 
other countries? Let me take a moment and review this process. 
Canada does not need any legislative authority to negotiate and 
sign a tax treaty relationship with a country. Legislation comes 
later, such as with this bill, when measures in the ensuing 
convention differ from those affected by our Income Tax Act, as I 
have explained.
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
	A tax treaty with a specific country is usually pursued because 
the government wants to encourage foreign investment in Canada 
and investment by Canadians abroad or as a result of budget 
measures.
<P>
	The 1992 budget announced Canada's willingness to reduce its 
withholding tax on direct dividends to meet with the national 
norms. The 1993 budget subsequently announced Canada's 
willingness to eliminate the withholding tax on specific royalties to 
ensure the competitiveness of our technological industries.
<P>
	There are three primary factors to be considered when 
negotiating a tax treaty with a country: how much Canadian 
investment is planned for that country, Canada's desire to 
encourage economic reforms there, and that country's interest in 
expanding its trade and economic relations with Canada. The tax 
treaties in Bill C-105 meet each of these three criteria.
<P>
	Bill C-105 is neither earth shattering nor housekeeping 
legislation. Rather, it is the workaday legislation that addresses the 
dual issue of fair taxation and good international relations.
<P>
	In this era of governments reappraising their roles, particularly 
their economic roles, and an increasingly interdependent open, 
global economy, reciprocal trade tax treaties make sense. They 
certainly do not hinder economic competition, which for Canada is 
an important factor of life.
<P>
	Canada is above all a trading nation and we must keep expanding 
our trading boundaries and therefore our relationships with other 
countries.
<P>
	A few items apply to all four treaties in this bill. First, while tax 
treaties vary from one country to another, these proposed 
conventions are similar to other treaties already concluded by 
Canada. They are patterned on the model double taxation 
convention prepared by the Organization for Economic 
Co-operation and Development.
<P>
	Second, each treaty has been negotiated individually and has 
taken into account the relevant policies in each country.
<P>
	Third, Bill C-105 provides an equitable solution to the double 
taxation problems that exist between Canada and these countries. 
Double taxation occurs when international transactions result in the 
same income being taxable in the hands of the same person by 
more than one nation.
<P>
	In addition, the protocol brings the convention with Hungary in 
line with current Canadian tax policy, particularly with regard to 
the rates of withholding tax.
<P>
	Here are some of the technical aspects of Bill C-105 that apply to 
the treaties with Estonia, Latvia and Trinidad and Tobago. There 
will be a withholding tax rate of 5 per cent on dividends paid to a 
parent company and on branch profits and 10 per cent on interest 
and royalties and management fees in the case of Trinidad and 
Tobago. A 15 per cent rate of withholding tax will apply on other 
dividends.
<P>
	The conventions also provide for a number of exemptions in the 
case of interest. For Estonia and Latvia a zero rate will apply to 
interest paid to the governments, the central banks, the Export 
Development Corporation and from sales made on credit.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15586"> 15586 </A></B>
<P>
	For Trinidad and Tobago a zero rate will apply to interest paid 
for government indebtedness and on loans or credit from the 
Export Development Corporation or its equivalent there and to 
interest paid to pension funds.
<P>
	Canadians will benefit from any future changes extended by 
Estonia and Latvia to other OECD member countries with respect 
to the withholding tax on copyright and patent royalties. Trinidad 
and Tobago will maintain the exemption on copyright royalties. 
Pension payments and annuity payments in the case of Trinidad 
and Tobago will be taxed at a maximum rate of 15 per cent in the 
source country. However, war pensions in Trinidad and Tobago will 
be exempt.
<P>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
	In addition, social security pensions will be taxed in the 
originating country and the withholding tax rate on annuity 
payments will be dropped to 10 per cent.
<P>
	Also with respect to Trinidad and Tobago, the two-year 
exemption for visiting teachers will no longer exist and seasonal 
workers will not have to pay Canadian tax if they earn under 
$8,500.
<P>
	I turn now to the protocol negotiated with Hungary. For 
historical purposes I should mention that Income Tax Act 
amendments in 1976 increased the rate of withholding tax paid to 
non-residents from 15 per cent to 25 per cent unless reduced by a 
tax treaty.
<P>
	The existing treaty between Canada and Hungary reduced the 
withholding tax rate to 10 per cent on dividends paid to a parent 
company and 15 per cent in all other cases. However, that 
convention was negotiated before the 1992 budget announced 
Canada's willingness to reduce its withholding tax on direct 
dividends to 5 per cent. The revised protocol before us today 
reduces that rate and the rate of branch tax to 5 per cent by 1997. 
There are no changes in the rates of withholding tax on other 
dividends.
<P>
	Tax treaties such as this are important tools for countries. The 
benefits they provide in helping to stabilize tax systems foster 
international trade and investment which are very important in 
today's global environment.
<P>
	Canada will not lose any revenue from the concessions in these 
conventions. Not only will Canada gain from increased trade and 
investment, we will gain from the reduced withholding tax rates 
and other concessions.
<P>
	There is nothing in the view of the government contentious in the 
bill. By passing this legislation the number of countries with which 
Canada has tax arrangements will increase to 57.
<P>
	I urge my colleagues to give Bill C-105 speedy consideration so 
that we may get on with more pressing issues.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to rise to express the Bloc Quebecois' assessment of Bill C-105.
<P>
	As the government spokesperson said before me, this bill is not 
controversial, it is a matter of course in trade relations between 
countries.
<P>
	The bill concerns the implementation of conventions between 
Canada and various countries, including Latvia, Estonia, Trinidad 
and Tobago, and Hungary to avoid double taxation and prevent 
fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income.
<P>
	It is a very technical bill that was first negotiated by officials in 
Canada's diplomatic corps and public service, and we are ratifying 
the treaties they concluded, with this bill.
<P>
	As the government spokesperson put it so well, this sort of thing 
is standard between sovereign countries, countries that want to 
promote trade. The bill is based on the standards defined by the 
OECD, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and 
Development.
<P>
	You might be wondering why I wanted to speak on behalf of the 
official opposition. Because this bill, which has been described as 
arising as a matter of course, could serve as an example, a point of 
comparison, for the events that could occur the day after a yes vote 
in the referendum in trade and economic relations between Canada, 
the United States, Quebec and other countries in the world.
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	In their trade, diplomatic and political relations, countries look 
after their own interests, as the opposition member clearly pointed 
out. In a proposal like the one before us, before concluding a treaty 
or an agreement-and there are now such treaties and agreements 
with 55 countries in the world-, we look after Canada's interests. 
We look at these countries' investments in the Canadian economy 
and at Canada's investments in the countries with which we have 
treaties.
<P>
	At some point, after assessing our trade and economic interests, 
we sign a treaty. So there is nothing contentious in all of this. 
Negotiations take place, the various countries check their laws, and 
it is quite normal to sign an agreement so that Canada and its 
partners can maintain and improve their regular trade and 
economic relations.
<P>
	In the debate currently taking place in Quebec and Canada on the 
prospect of a sovereign Quebec, economic and trade arguments are 
often on the agenda. Just the day before yesterday, the Minister of 
Finance claimed that Quebec's sovereignty would threaten 1 
million jobs in that province. When we examine the finance 
minister's speech, we see that these million jobs would be  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15587"> 15587 </A></B>
<P>
threatened if trade between Canada and Quebec and between the 
U.S. and Quebec was reduced to zero.
<P>
	Can trade between Canada, Quebec and the U.S. be reduced to 
zero? Will Quebecers and people in Jonquière stop buying Ford 
cars if these cars meet their requirements? Will people in the U.S. 
stop-
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Flis:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thought we were debating Bill C-105, an 
act to implement tax conventions between Canada and Latvia, 
Estonia, Trinidad and Tobago, and a protocol for the tax treaty with 
Hungary. I find it very difficult to see how what the hon. member is 
saying is relevant to the bill.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The hon. parliamentary 
secretary of course is a very experienced parliamentarian. The 
question of relevance does come up from time to time in the House. 
In the past few days it has come up and possibly in the days to come 
it will come up more often. It is good that we are reminded of it and 
we should be mindful of it.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The question of relevance is raised from time to time. It was 
probably raised a bit more often this past little while and it is likely 
to come up more often yet in the weeks to come. While I wish to 
remain sympathetic to both sides I just want to say that the hon. 
parliamentary secretary reminded us of the need for relevance and I 
hope we will be mindful of this requirement in all our remarks. I 
will be monitoring the debate very closely.
<P>
	The hon. member for Jonquière still has the floor.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Caron:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very happy that the hon. 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Foreign Affairs called 
me on relevance because I thought it was rather obvious. Here is a 
country, Canada, with 28 million people. This country may well 
rank sixth in the world in terms of per capita gross domestic 
product, given purchasing power parity. This is based on 1991 
figures.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	This country, this great country which is a member of the G-7 
and the international jet set, sees fit to enter into trade relations 
with countries that I would not describe as small-I will not use 
this qualifier often used by our friends opposite, because it evokes 
little people and conveys the somewhat pejorative idea of being of 
minor importance-but rather as countries with not as large a 
population as Canada.
<P>
	Latvia, for example, has a population of 2.6 million; Estonia, 1.5 
million; Trinidad and Tobago, 1.3 million; and Hungary, 10 
million. While these countries do not have the economic prestige 
and stature of Canada, as it stands and as our friends opposite see it, 
Canada has negotiated tax treaties with them based on the OECD 
model. This is normal. Earlier, the spokesperson for the  opposition 
said: this is normal; this is the way things are done between 
civilized countries of the world, that is those countries which look 
after their best interest.
<P>
	We did not see or hear anything from Latvia, Hungary, Trinidad 
and Tobago to the effect that Canada is too big, that its economy is 
too strong, or that it will impose unacceptable conditions to those 
countries.
<P>
	I do not know for sure, since we do not have newspaper articles 
from Latvia, Hungary, Trinidad and Tobago, and all the other 
countries, but we do not feel that Canada acted improperly with 
sovereign nations.
<P>
	The point which I am making is that, right now, English 
language newspapers in Canada are constantly saying: ``If Quebec 
becomes a sovereign nation, Canada will not deal with it because 
Canada is twice as big as Quebec. You will not count at all on the 
North American market. You will probably not be able to trade any 
more. Americans will probably stop buying your aluminum or your 
paper, and you will stop buying their cars, their refrigerators and 
IBM computers. You will have to go down on your knees and pay 
twice the price, because the United States is too big. Americans 
will not comply with international standards; they will try to crush 
you''.
<P>
	When I look at the bill before us this morning, I realize that this 
will not be the case. We are talking about Latvia, Estonia, Hungary, 
Trinidad and Tobago. We are talking about countries which do not 
have close relations with Canada, which have not been part of 
Canada for 130 years; there is no problem with these countries. 
Canada does some trading and has good diplomatic relations with 
these countries, and there is no problem when the time comes to 
sign conventions.
<P>
	However, when they are talking about Quebec, which has been 
part of Canada for 130 years, they kowtow to the U.S. They seek a 
statement from the U.S. secretary of state, in the hope that he will 
say: ``Should Quebec become sovereign, we may decide to 
renegotiate NAFTA, we may impose additional conditions; your 
cultural industry may be crushed; American movies will flood the 
Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean market, which is 98 per cent French. 
Movie theatres showing French language movies will close; French 
language newspapers will have to be highly subsidized and may 
even have to stop publishing. It will be the end of the world''.
<P>
	When you see bills such as this one, which is described by the 
government's spokesperson as being the normal thing to do, 
without any problem, you tell yourself: ``Indeed, there is no 
problem signing commercial treaties with Latvia, Hungary or any 
other country. Why then should there be problems if Quebec 
becomes a sovereign nation''?
<P>
	I think it might be worthwhile to use some examples. If they had 
said ``We will make an exception for Latvia and Estonia, because 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15588"> 15588 </A></B>
<P>
they were part of the soviet block for a long time, because they 
lived through difficulties,  because they are small countries which 
valiantly defended their sovereignty, which survived the soviet 
empire's steamroller, which maintained their language, which 
maintained their cultural identity, which defended themselves, and 
which succeeded against all odds in becoming sovereign as soon as 
the soviet empire loosened its hold slightly. If they have succeeded 
in doing so, it might then have been said that we Canadians, 
rightfully considered the boy scouts of the world, are prepared to 
defend widows and orphans everywhere in the world.''
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	As soon as Estonia and Latvia were free of the Soviet Union, the 
first thing they did was to demand sovereignty and seek 
recognition. We could have said ``We will give Estonia and Latvia 
special treatment, we will help them, we will support them because 
this is an acknowledgment of their contribution to the world 
balance of democracy.'' But no. We echo what the spokesman for 
the opposition said just now: ``It is a matter of interest. We have 
investments over there; they probably have some here. We sign. No 
problem. A matter of interest. Not a matter of politics. Not a matter 
of feelings. Not a matter of anything at all. Not of acknowledging 
countries which have succeeded in gaining sovereignty, which have 
lived through 50 years of communism and the Russian steamroller. 
Which have survived all that. No, just a matter of interest. Well, all 
right then.
<P>
	Take the example of Hungary. We know what happened in 
Hungary in the 1950s, an attempted revolt against the Soviet 
empire. The Hungarians were crushed. Canada took many of them 
in, to its credit. Although I was very young at the time, I remember 
it because it made a strong impression upon me. But the bill does 
not say ``We are entering into a protocol with Hungary because it 
did great things during the 1950s and because there are many 
Hungarians in Canada and so we will help them now''. No. They 
say: ``No, we signed a protocol with Hungary because it is in our 
interest to do so. Hungarians have investments in Canada, and we 
have investments in Hungary. We want to continue to trade with 
them, so we sign agreements. That is how things work at the 
international level''. The same for Trinidad and Tobago. In fact, the 
opposition critic explained that some harmonization was necessary 
in our trade with Trinidad and Tobago. No problem at all.
<P>
	So I read this bill and, speaking on behalf of the official 
opposition, I say: ``We have agreements with Latvia, Estonia, 
Trinidad and Tobago, Hungary and 55 other countries in the world. 
Wonderful''. So I start off by saying: ``There are certain things that 
are done involving large countries and small countries. Small 
countries which Canada does not seem to look down on, which it 
respects because they are sovereign''. That is the beauty of 
sovereignty: you get respect. Whether you are big or small, when 
you are sovereign, you are respected  because there are 
international conventions and practices, and the rules of the game 
are clearly
<P>
established. And that is why certain countries want to become 
sovereign. Today, Quebec is one of those countries. I say country, 
because to me, Quebec is a country.
<P>
	Look at Quebec. When you see Quebecers and hear them talk 
and look at their history, you realize that, like it or not, Quebec is 
different from other parts of Canada. This is not to denigrate the 
people of Newfoundland, Franco-Ontarians, Westerners and 
British Columbians, but Quebecers are a bit different, and today, 
some of them are saying: At the international level, we are going to 
make this country a sovereign state. And now, one of the arguments 
being made in this debate is that Quebec will be in for hard times.
<P>
	Daniel Johnson said: ``Oops, if you become sovereign, there go 
92,000 jobs''. The very next day or three or four days or a week 
later, when they had a chance to think about it, they realized that 
92,000 jobs was perhaps not impressive enough. So a respected 
federal finance minister told Quebec: ``92,000? Probably more like 
one million''. Not 900,000, not 900,100 or 909,150 but one 
million. That is impressive. We are ``millionaires'' in terms of job 
losses. He is not saying: ``Oh, you will not lose one million jobs'', 
but: ``You might lose one million jobs'', because if you ever do, 
since you are not big guys but little guys, with a small economy, 
you will definitely not be in the big league. If you are little, maybe 
Canada, which is bigger than you, or the United States, which is 
bigger than you, will say, we do not trade with the little guys, we 
only trade with the big guys.
<P>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
	So then there would be no more trade with Canada, no more 
trade between Quebec and Canada, no more trade between Quebec 
and the United States-this means a million jobs. Obviously it is a 
million jobs, if nobody buys what we produce and we do not buy 
what others want to sell us. Obviously, in trade and in production, 
there are going to be losses, but that is the way it works.
<P>
	How does it work internationally? It works the way it does in this 
bill. Countries, states, make treaties and agreements based on their 
interests. That is how it works. For sure, some people are touchy 
because of certain events, they are unhappy, they say that things are 
going to work differently, and we hope this is not the way it is 
going to be.
<P>
	The Leader of the Official Opposition, Lucien Bouchard, will 
come and start negotiations. Maybe people will say they do not 
want to negotiate with us, they do not like us, we are demagogues, 
we are ethnic, we are out to do a number on ourselves and we are 
shrinking our economy. We will say to them: well, we had a vote, 
we want to reach an agreement with you, and we will reach it even 
if we do not reach it on the basis of  the friendship that still 
developed over the years and centuries.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15589"> 15589 </A></B>
<P>
	Quebec and Canada, and Quebec and the United States are not 
the same as Quebec and Latvia. With all due respect to Latvia, it is 
not the same. I see a member opposite listening intently and rolling 
his eyes skyward saying: ``Oh, what clever remarks''. The hon. 
member was born in Hull, and I congratulate him on it. There are 
members like us; the hon. member for Québec-Est was born in 
Penetanguishene, Ontario. There are still ties. Perhaps there are ties 
between my hon. colleague opposite and people in Quebec. 
Perhaps he has ties with people living in Latvia and Estonia.
<P>
	But it is not on that basis that we want to negotiate. We do not 
want you to negotiate with us because you like us, because we were 
with you for 130 years. It is not on that basis that we want to 
negotiate. We want to negotiate on the same basis as that in Bill 
C-105, which is not contentious and poses no problems. This basis 
is the interests of nations negotiating as equals because they are 
sovereign. This is the way things are done at the international level.
<P>
	We in Quebec think we can do as well as Latvia, as Estonia, as 
Trinidad and Tobago. Why? For two good reasons. The first reason 
is that, if you look at what is currently happening in the world, 
according to some theories, the most populous countries, the 
countries with the largest domestic markets, are those that do best.
<P>
	Then look at the most populous countries in the world and see 
how they are doing. Let us look at the U.S., which has the highest 
GDP. I will not talk about the other countries for fear of being 
accused of discrimination: ``You said that France was No. 4 or 5. 
You are discriminating against the U.S. You like France a little less 
than the U.S. What is the matter?'' ``Would a Bloc member say that 
he liked France less? He is more of a Franco-American; he is not a 
francophile''. In a campaign like the one under way, one must be 
prudent.
<P>
	However, if we look at the world's countries on the basis of their 
GDP per capita and their population, we see Switzerland, with 6 
million people, in second place, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg 
in third place, Denmark, Austria, Belgium, Sweden, Iceland, 
Norway, the Netherlands, Finland- Did I mention any poor 
countries? These countries are among the top 20, and the top 10 
include four or five countries with populations of five, six or seven 
million. Population is no longer as important a factor as it used to 
be.
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	Empires expanded. The British Empire, that my hon. colleague 
opposite is so fond of, expanded to increase business opportunities 
for British merchants who wanted to gain access to the market in 
India, Africa and so on. In those days, this was important, but it is 
no longer the case today. The size of any given country is not 
relevant.  I am not theorizing. This is a fact confirmed in the 
economic accounts of respected countries such as Switzerland, 
Luxembourg, Denmark, Austria, Belgium, Sweden, and Iceland, 
which are not as large as some others.
<P>
	The Austrian population is certainly not as large as the Chinese 
population, yet Austria does very well for itself. Back in 1991, 
Austria ranked 10th in terms of per capita gross domestic product. 
That is not bad at all. This country, a former empire, has had its 
problems and suffered greatly during the second world war. Today, 
Austria is a player.
<P>
	What I mean by that is that globalization is giving smaller 
countries the change to enter the global markets. It is not up to their 
neighbours to decide whether or not they can enter these markets. 
There are international regulations for that as the OECD has 
regulations governing treaties between various countries or tax 
conventions. There are rules.
<P>
	The size of the country is no longer the determining factor. The 
main thing is to gain access to international markets. Second, and 
this is a major factor, there must be a demand for what you 
produce, your products must be well made and you must have what 
the economists call a niche of your own, an area in which you 
excel. You need not be great at everything, just in certain areas and 
develop markets from there. That is why I think that, in terms of 
size, Quebec, as a country, would compare favourably with 
Austria, Denmark, Switzerland, Sweden and the like, and do quite 
well.
<P>
	Quebec is not a poor nation. Some people seem to want to put up 
a fence around Quebec, including the Minister of Finance who 
says: ``Listen, when that fence is up, you will lose one million 
jobs''. I am sorry but there will be no such fence, because this is not 
the way things work. Why did the minister say one million jobs? 
One million, as in the word millionaire. The Minister of Finance 
knows about millionaires, but he would be better off talking about 
the billions of dollars worth of freight transported on his ships, or 
the millions in goods produced in his plants. It is inappropriate on 
the part of a finance minister to tell Quebecers that one million of 
them will become unemployed if sovereignty is achieved, and that 
a fence will be built around Quebec.
<P>
	The issue of Quebec's population in relation to the prosperity 
which it can develop is not a factor here, because it is not for other 
countries either. As I said, Quebec is not without assets. Its GDP 
stands at 160 billion dollars. Quebec is a modern state with major 
institutions, including a deposit and investment fund, 
Hydro-Quebec and a pension board, and with large corporations 
which developed over the years, even though, at one point, some of 
these big entrepreneurs invested in Northern Ireland and in 
Belgium, and said: ``In Quebec, we started off in a small village''. I 
could mention the community of Valcourt, where a major  
Canadian and Quebec multinational is based. One would think that 
it is a Quebec company, but we were told: ``It is not a Quebec 
corporation, it is a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15590"> 15590 </A></B>
<P>
Canadian one. And if Quebec becomes sovereign, do not expect us 
to stay here: we will move back to Canada''.
<P>
	Over the last 30 or 35 years, Quebec developed industrial 
structures and trade policies which will enable it to join the 
countries which I mentioned earlier. We rank 16th in terms of the 
GDP. This is quite something. Quebec is part of Canada. Our 
friends across the floor say: ``Quebec is part of Canada. If you 
leave Canada, you will become poor, while Canada will keep on 
being rich''.
<P>
<B>(1325)</B>
<P>
	That is all very fine, but the wealth of Quebec and the wealth of 
Canada are similar in terms of domestic product. Quebec 
sovereignty does not take our engineers from us. Quebec 
sovereignty does not take our capital from us. Quebec sovereignty 
does not take our administrators, our poets; it takes nothing from 
us.
<P>
	Quebec sovereignty gives us additional powers in terms of laws, 
gives us additional powers in terms of treaties we can negotiate. 
Treaties like those Canada has with 55 countries, we will have too. 
We will have them because we have something to offer. There are 
people in those countries who may come to invest in Quebec and 
people in Quebec who may go and invest there. We will be able to 
have as many treaties as you have managed to have.
<P>
	That is why it is most appropriate to bring up the case of Quebec 
in my intervention concerning Bill C-105, for it shows us that it is 
completely normal for the Government of Canada to have treaties 
with Latvia, with Estonia, with Trinidad and Tobago, with 
Hungary, as it will be completely normal for there to be one 
between Canada and Quebec, once its citizens have decided on 
sovereignty. And we will have such a treaty.
<P>
	We keep hearing ``But you are not telling Quebecers what you 
will do afterward. What will the partnership be like? We do not 
have much of an idea''. Just do a bit of reading. I imagine that the 
hon. members have most definitely familiarized themselves with 
Quebec's bill on sovereignty, that they are also aware of the 
agreement signed this past June between Messrs. Bouchard, 
Parizeau and Dumont on the matter of the partnership treaty 
between Quebec and Canada.
<P>
	And what will that partnership treaty cover? A customs union, 
free circulation of goods, free circulation of individuals, free 
circulation of services, free circulation of capital, monetary policy, 
manpower mobility, citizenship. It is a treaty between sovereign 
states. By the very fact that we shall be a sovereign state, we shall 
have the possibility of signing treaties. If Canada wants to sign 
treaties with Quebec in other areas, we are open to any and all 
discussion.
<P>
	My point is that once we are sovereign, even if our economy is 
not as big as Canada's, we will be able to sign treaties just like 
Estonia, Hungary, Trinidad and Tobago and Latvia.
<P>
	And they will be signed for the same reason they were signed 
with the countries I just referred to, because it is in our interest to 
do so. We claim, and I am sure that the people of Quebec will trust 
us to do the right thing, that this is in the interest of Quebec and of 
Canada.
<P>
	Of course Canada will maintain up to the last minute that there 
will be no negotiations and no agreement ever. Our Canadian 
friends are so anxious to make this point that yesterday, when the 
Prime Minister of Canada was in Quebec, he said: ``There will be 
nothing, because Canada will disappear if Quebec leaves. We do 
not know what will happen. There will be nothing left, because 
once Quebec has gone, there will be no more Canada''. That is how 
we understood Mr. Chrétien's speech.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I realize one tends to forget 
this from time to time, but I may remind the House that members 
are to be referred to by their ridings or departments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Caron:</B> This was of course an oversight, Mr. Speaker. We 
always refer to him in conversation as Mr. Chrétien, but it is the 
hon. Prime Minister.
<P>
	The hon. Prime Minister-Mr. Speaker, do you not think this is 
extraordinary? -the hon. Prime Minister of Canada said last night 
in a speech in Quebec, and I should have brought the quote with 
me, the hon. Prime Minister of Canada said there would be no more 
Canada if Quebec were to leave. This is really incredible.
<P>
	If the province of Newfoundland ever decided to withdraw from 
Canada, would there still be a Canada? The people of 
Newfoundland-I have met a number of members from that 
province-are people of great warmth who was very attached to 
their province.
<P>
<B>(1330)</B>
<P>
	However, if Newfoundland were no longer a part of Canada, we 
can assume there would still be a Canada, as there was in 1948 and 
1945, when Newfoundland was not part of Canada.
<P>
	Similarly, if British Columbia withdrew from Canada, saying: 
``Listen, we are on the west coast, that is where the markets are'', 
because it is always a matter of markets. Today, countries are 
markets, and their purpose is to engage in trade, not to protect the 
well-being of their citizens or ensure the continuity of nations. Let 
us suppose that the people of British Columbia decide that they 
face west, towards Japan, the Rockies are too big, there will 
probably be no more train service through the Rockies, with 
privatization and all that, the train costs too much. If they decide to 
become a sovereign country and then, to improve trading with 
Asia, they form a sort of North American Singapore, will Canada 
still exist?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15591"> 15591 </A></B>
<P>
	I do not think the Prime Minister of Canada would go to 
Vancouver and say: ``Do not leave Canada; if you leave Canada, 
the country will no longer exist.'' But this is what happened 
yesterday. The Prime Minister of Canada said that Canada would 
cease to exist if Quebec left. Is Canada only Ontario and Quebec? 
This is what we will end up thinking. It is as if this were 1840 
and Canada were Lower and Upper Canada-joined later by other 
provinces and territories-but they remained the heart of the 
country. Ontario and Quebec form the heart of Canada, why, 
because they are the two biggest markets?
<P>
	Certainly, with today's mentality, that is what those opposite will 
have us believe. Is it not, rather, that Canada at the outset was 
Ontario and Quebec, because Ontario was English Canadian and 
Quebec was French Canadian, and each country had minorities, 
official language minorities different from the majority. That was 
Canada.
<P>
	Canada did what it could for minorities. Look at Quebec, there is 
a very strong English Canadian minority that has its universities, 
its school boards, its hospitals, its representatives in major 
institutions. I would like to be able to say the same of our 
Franco-Ontarian and Franco-Manitoban friends who had to fight 
for their schools, and who still have to fight for their schools, and 
for control over them. They are not fighting for control over 
universities, they are fighting for control over elementary schools 
and high schools, because that it where assimilation occurs.
<P>
	We challenged, two days ago, statistics stating that there were a 
million francophones outside Quebec in Canada. We said that, out 
of the one million Canadians outside Quebec who claim French as 
their mother tongue, 650 speak French at home. We did not mean 
any disrespect to our Franco-Ontarian and Franco-Manitoban 
friends or our friends in the Yukon or the Northwest Territories. We 
just wanted to say how sad we were to see the French language die 
out outside Quebec. What we intend to achieve among other things 
through sovereignty, besides allowing Quebec to develop with its 
best interests in mind, is to ensure, through our own institutions, 
that French will still be spoken in America in a hundred years and 
that a French or Quebec culture will still be alive in Quebec at that 
time.
<P>
	That is what we want to do. We want to live on without 
constantly having to protest, like our friends opposite do, just to 
survive. It is important to be able to survive. But we think that there 
are enough of us, and that we have enough education, enough 
capital, enough stamina, and enough willpower to do better than 
survive.
<P>
	When I was in grade school, money was collected throughout the 
Quebec school system, a dime at a time, for the survival of the 
French language in Canada. Grade school children gave money for 
use in Manitoba and Ontario. This was fine. But look at where they 
now stand.  It is sad in a sense to think that there are only 640 of 
them across Canada, including Acadians.
<P>
<B>(1335)</B>
<P>
	It is most unfortunate, but as a francophone and a Quebecer or a 
French Canadian living in Quebec who calls himself a Quebecer, I 
do not want anything to do with a system that will lead, fifty years 
from now, to a situation where we have a nice official languages act 
and many officially bilingual institutions, but where French will no 
longer be a living language in Quebec.
<P>
	People can say we are spiteful, I say that we are just stating the 
facts. The fact is that Canada started off as a bicultural country, a 
bilingual country, where you had French and English Canadians. 
The very reason there is panic in some political back rooms is that, 
yes indeed, this is what Canada was initially.
<P>
	The Prime Minister said so: If Quebec goes, that is it for Canada. 
Look, this is a basic issue. What is Quebec? It is not an economy; it 
is a culture, and a language. With this culture and language gone, 
Canada as we know it will no longer exist. This means that we have 
reached the bottom line.
<P>
	Canada is more than a checkerboard with ten squares 
representing each of the ten provinces and that we call Canada. Try 
as we may, and Reformers will insist that that is Canada and that 
each little square should be assigned the same number of senators 
and the same responsibilities, we have to admit that this view of 
Canada does not agree with reality.
<P>
	Initially, the real Canada was made up of French Canadians and 
English Canadians. French Canadians did not benefit from this 
agreement. And French Canadians in Quebec who are now called 
Quebecers decided to withdraw from the agreement, to declare 
themselves sovereign, that is to say, in control of their laws, taxes 
and treaties, and then to propose a partnership treaty with English 
Canada.
<P>
	English Canada likes us so much that it is threatening to cut us 
off. It is so pleasant to stay in a country like this one. They like us 
so much that instead of telling us, ``Stay with us and everything 
will be fine'', they say, ``If you vote Yes, we will cut you off; if you 
vote No, nothing will happen and you will stay the way you are 
now''.
<P>
	It is over for French Canadians in Quebec who are now called 
Quebecers, and I hope that, on October 30, these Quebecers will be 
able to sign treaties such as this one, agreements with other 
countries, so that they can benefit from international trade and 
eventually have access to the economic instruments they need to 
remain what they are, a French speaking people with their own 
culture in North America. This is my dearest wish and I think that 
the people of Quebec will listen to our proposal and vote Yes on 
October 30.

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I hope to 
stick to Bill C-105 and keep it kind of short.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> That is the second time in two years I have been 
applauded by members opposite; I appreciate it.
<P>
	The purpose of Bill C-105 is to implement the tax conventions 
between Canada and the republics of Latvia, Estonia, Trinidad and 
Tobago and a protocol between Canada and the republic of 
Hungary for the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of 
income tax evasion.
<P>
	It is just like Bill S-9. We are here debating bills and for all 
intents and purposes they are already done deals. The agreements 
have already been signed by the bureaucrats and diplomats and 
now we have to give them a formal blessing. We have spent two 
days doing that. It is important to do it, so let us get on with the 
business of getting it done.
<P>
	Tax treaties like this one along with their amending protocols 
have two main purposes: the elimination of double taxation on 
goods, services and people that flow back and forth across borders 
and the prevention of fiscal evasion by the same people. The 
treaties and protocols being signed are patterned on the model of 
the double taxation convention prepared by the OECD. That is 
supposed to be our guarantee that everything in here is wonderful, 
good for everybody, and we do not even have to look into the 
details. The Reform Party supports these and any initiatives that 
help eliminate barriers to the globalization of our economy.
<P>
<B>(1340)</B>
<P>
	However, in the debate on Bill C-105 I noticed when the 
parliamentary secretary to the finance minister made his 
presentation on the bill today that he said there was nothing 
contentious in the bill. That almost made me want to look into it 
and reread it, as if he were trying to hide some of the sneaky little 
deals found in Bill S-9 that the member for Gander-Grand Falls 
pointed out. That Liberal member pointed out how bad Bill S-9 
was, that it was not really a Liberal bill, and that he was 
disappointed the Liberal Party could support it.
<P>
	That brings me to another point on the Liberal government. It 
struck me interesting in reviewing and researching protocol bills 
and tax concession bills between countries how the Liberal 
government had flip-flopped on its anti-free trade policies of the 
past. It is actually approving bills that lower taxes. It is actually 
approving bills that eliminate the barriers to trade. It is actually 
doing something they were against when in opposition and we are 
for.
<P>
	It makes me wonder whether the finance minister is in charge or 
the deputy minister is in charge who worked for the Conservative 
government? Which set of people,  which grouping, the politicians 
or the bureaucrats, is in charge of the government?
<P>
	In 1991 when the finance minister was in opposition he gave his 
opinion on trade conventions, treaties and tax concession 
conventions. What did he ask the government to do? What did he 
say to ensure the deals were in the best interests of all Canadians? 
To put it in context, when in opposition the finance minister in 
referring to the Conservative government said, as indicated in 
<I>Hansard</I>:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In the free trade agreement this government, so desperate for a success even if 
it was only paper thin, and so afraid of failure, sat down cowardly with the 
Americans and gave up the ghost before negotiations started.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Shame.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Martin:</B> It made every single concession. Every point it 
thought the Americans would raise at the table, it gave up before it 
got there, because this indeed is a craven government.
<P>
	He was referring to Bill S-9, what we approved yesterday. He 
was criticizing the very bill that was passed in substantially the 
same form. He did not agree that the Conservative government was 
headed in the right direction.
<P>
	That borders on the hypocritical. If a member who criticizes 
something vehemently and strongly in opposition has the chance to 
change it, to improve it, to fix it or to make it better when in power, 
he or she should do so. But the government goes along and in the 
course of the last two years has basically passed about 10 
Conservative bills substantially in the form that were on the shelf 
gathering dust. Its members just took them off the shelf, blew off 
the dust, presented them in the House, put Liberal on them, and 
now they are being passed.
<P>
	I am sure some members of the Liberal government are deeply 
hurt because their party said in the past that it would never cut the 
deficit on the backs of the sick or the poor and this is exactly what it 
is now doing.
<P>
	The Liberals are cutting and transferring the debt from the 
federal government to the provincial governments. They are 
cutting health care and welfare services by $7 billion and are 
calling it the social transfer bill or whatever. This is what they said 
they would not do.
<P>
	There have to be some Liberals over there who are hurting, who 
are bleeding internally, because they are losing their roots. They 
are losing what they are supposed to be doing in terms of protecting 
the people who elected them. They are not protecting them. They 
are going against their wishes. They are breaking a lot of the 
promises they made in the red book.
<P>
	During the election they said on free trade that they did not like 
NAFTA and that they would renegotiate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> This is not free trade.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Assadourian:</B> Stick to the subject.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15593"> 15593 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> I am sticking to the subject a lot more than the 
previous speaker. I am straying a bit here when I am talking about 
an agreement with another country.
<P>
<B>(1345 )</B>
<P>
	Once again, when they got elected did the Prime Minister 
renegotiate as he promised he would? He did not. He passed it in 
substantially the same form it was in when the Conservatives 
negotiated it. I find it ironic this government says one thing in 
opposition and does another thing when in power which means it is 
still the status quo. It means nothing has changed although we now 
have a Liberal government instead of a Conservative one.
<P>
	While we support Bill C-105, there are still a few questions I 
would like to address. I would like to know why our diplomats 
abroad can initiate legislation that makes our taxes lower and our 
tax rules simpler when our politicians will not do the same.
<P>
	Why is it that when the politicians approach the department 
heads and say: ``We would like to make the Income Tax Act less 
confusing, less complicated and less convoluted. We would like to 
make it more simple. We understand it is fair but we would like to 
make it fair in a way that everybody understands it, and could we 
not lower spending a bit? Since they are making spending cuts they 
could pass the benefit to taxpayers''. The bureaucrats say no 
because any time we give up a tax point or two we never get it back, 
so the answer is no. And that is it. That is as far as the politicians 
go.
<P>
	Except for the member for Broadview-Greenwood who since 
1989 has consistently pushed for a simplification of the taxation 
system, there is nobody else over there that has as openly, vocally 
and energetically pursued this topic. I would like to be another one 
of those people who pushes the government into doing it. To the 
politicians: Do not let the bureaucrats say it will not work. To the 
finance minister: Demand a review of the taxation system to see if 
it can be changed.
<P>
	We all know high taxes are an impediment to growth in the 
economy. Why do we not remove the impediment? Why do we not 
lower taxes with some spending cuts that the Liberal government is 
now finally making? It is finally listening to us; it is finally doing 
something to the benefit of many Canadians. Combine that with a 
genuine review of the entire taxation system which will then help 
to create jobs.
<P>
	The opportunities for gains in the economy by implementing tax 
reform are tremendous. By not doing it, by not exploring it, those 
doors remain closed and the opportunity to restore faith, hope and 
savings for taxpayers are eliminated. That debt will never, ever be 
addressed by adding to it. We have to get to a zero deficit, not a 3 
per cent of GDP and dig the hole slower. They are still digging the 
hole and are just adding to the problem.
<P>
	If we want to get rid of the problem, lower spending, raise taxes 
to a zero point and the deficit is gone, if that is what the Liberal 
government thinks is the problem. However, that is not the 
problem. The problem is the debt and our high levels of taxation.
<P>
	Diplomats recognize globally that we must have equality, that 
we need to have the lowest rates of taxation possible to attract 
investment and capital while reciprocating with other countries by 
offering them the same deals in our country. They do that. Look 
through those agreements with the incentives and the opportunities 
between countries. It is great. It works well for exports and 
imports. What is saving our economy today? NAFTA. Trade with 
other nations.
<P>
	We need to treat each of our provinces, including that wonderful 
province of Quebec which belongs in Canada and will stay in 
Canada, the same way we treat other nations. Let us make deals 
among ourselves, province to province, that eliminate the barriers 
to trade and introduce treaties. Let us have only one level of 
government looking after a service. Let us define specifically 
which level of government should look after which program. Let us 
get some savings and some gains into our system so we can lower 
spending thus lowering taxes, so we can remove the impediments 
to our sluggish economy.
<P>
	I am trying to make an analogy between the good aspects of 
trade treaties we are making with other countries. Why do we not 
use those diplomats instead of the politicians sitting over there in 
the front row to make our negotiations with the deputy ministers in 
order to implement the kind of reforms we need in this country? 
These diplomats do a much better job than the elected politicians 
because the elected politicians are afraid to stand up to the 
bureaucracy. I encourage similar actions here at home in the form 
of tax reform as we find in deals like this.
<P>
<B>(1350)</B>
<P>
	In conclusion, I hope this is the last fluffy type bill we have 
before this House and that we can get on with more important bills. 
As far as I am concerned, Mr. Speaker, you could put the question, 
put the bill through committee of the whole and then we could 
debate the health act.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> We will now go to the next 
stage of debate where members will be entitled to a 20 minute 
maximum, subject to 10 minutes questions or comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jesse Flis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a great pleasure for me to 
participate in the debate on Bill C-105, an act to implement a 
convention between Canada and the republic of Latvia, a conven-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15594"> 15594 </A></B>
<P>
tion between Canada and the republic of Estonia, a convention 
between Canada and the republic of Trinidad and Tobago, and a 
protocol  between Canada and the republic of Hungary, for the 
avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion 
with respect to taxes on income.
<P>
	As the bill states, the purpose of this enactment is to implement 
income tax conventions that have been signed with Latvia, Estonia, 
Trinidad and Tobago, and a protocol to the income tax convention 
with Hungary. As the bill says, these treaties have been signed. The 
treaty with Latvia was signed in Ottawa on April 26, 1995. The 
agreement with Estonia was signed in Tallinn on June 2, 1995. The 
agreement with Trinidad and Tobago was signed in Toronto on 
September 11 of this year. The protocol with Hungary was signed 
back on May 3, 1994 in Budapest.
<P>
	Tax treaties are designed to alleviate double taxation of income 
earned in one country by a person resident in another country. 
While the present position of Latvia, Estonia, Trinidad and Tobago, 
and Hungary limits the potential for additional investment by 
residents of these countries in Canada, the tax treaties in question 
will certainly be helpful to Canadian corporations and individuals 
with operations and investments in those countries.
<P>
	As the parliamentary secretary has already alerted this House, 
these agreements contain provisions on withholding tax, on capital 
gains, on non-discrimination-discrimination is prohibited but 
only on the basis of the nationality of the taxpayers-pensions and 
annuities, and double taxation relief.
<P>
	These are important agreements. They now must be approved by 
Parliament to make them official.
<P>
	I have been in these countries, except for Trinidad and Tobago. I 
have visited Latvia, Estonia and Hungary. I was in these countries 
before they were sovereign countries, when they were forced to be 
under the Soviet Union. I have visited them after they obtained 
their independence. Canada was one of the first countries to 
recognize the independence of the three Baltic states and Hungary, 
et cetera.
<P>
	I would like to differ with my colleague from Jonquière very 
strongly. He tries to compare Quebec to these countries. I hope he 
will read his history. Latvia and Estonia, which are mentioned in 
this bill, were sovereign countries at one time but they had their 
sovereignty taken away from them by the Molotov-Ribbentrop 
agreement. That was not the people's choice; it was forced on 
them. Now through democratic elections they are choosing their 
own governments. That is why these countries are now ready to do 
business with the western world and the entire globe.
<P>
	I was in those two countries just last summer and in Hungary two 
years ago. All of those countries are open for business. So is 
Trinidad and Tobago, but I have never been there so I cannot speak 
for it, but the other three countries are open for business. They do 
not want  handouts, although we have helped them a lot with our 
technical assistance program.
<P>
<B>(1355)</B>
<P>
	The technical co-operation program has been placed under 
CIDA. We have helped those countries in language training for 
example. Many people living in Estonia speak nothing but Russian. 
In order to obtain their citizenship they must learn Estonian. There 
is a big demand for learning Estonian very quickly. We are helping 
Estonians with the technology for teaching languages.
<P>
	I wish the hon. member would read his history and not compare 
la belle province with sovereign countries like the three Baltic 
states, Hungary, et cetera.
<P>
	I was very shocked to hear the hon. member say that Canadians 
want to see French disappear. Where has the hon. member been for 
the last 10 years? I was in education for 27 years. The big trend was 
to have children attend total immersion French programs. Children 
from British Columbia to Newfoundland are graduating having 
spoken the two official languages from as early as grade 3.
<P>
	The hon. member was concerned that there is no preservation of 
the French language. The Constitution of Canada preserves the 
French language. If Quebec separates, that guarantee is gone. That 
is why Quebecers have to be shown very clearly what they are 
going to vote for on October 30. It is: Do you want to separate from 
Canada, period? If you do, along with everything else Quebec may 
lose is the protection of the French language and French culture.
<P>
	I am very emotional about that because my wife happens to 
come from Quebec. Most of her family lives in la belle province. I 
am so pleased when my nieces and nephews write to me. I have a 
card in my office which I invite the hon. member to come and see. 
It reads: Mon oncle, je t'aime. My uncle, I love you. When my 
niece sees me she tells me the same thing: ``Wujek, ja Cie 
kocham''. She will also tell me: ``Uncle, I love you''. It is great that 
in a province, le beau Québec, Canadians can grow up with three 
languages. What more can we ask for? Not only protecting the 
French language, but also allow young Canadians to grow up in

premiers, I can understand the wish for a flexible federalism that 
would readily and efficectively meet the particular needs of every 
region of Canada.

	<B>Mrs. Sharon Hayes (Port Moody-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on Thanksgiving Sunday in Coquitlam, a grandfather, 
grandmother and their daughter were brutally murdered at the 
hands of the common law husband. This heinous crime once again 
illustrates the impotence of court orders in the justice system and 
the tragedy of marital and family breakdown.
<P>
	Three white coffins stood in the very church that was the centre 
of this family's life and the tragic place of their death. I joined the 
community of Maillardville there last week and shared their pain.
<P>
	It is for the sake of such communities that we in this place must 
find those measures that will strengthen and safeguard crucial 
family bonds in our society. We must work together to promote and 
implement measures in our justice and legal systems that make 
peace, not war, in the difficult separation of family structures. We 
must recognize that government policy does influence choice, 
attitude, and action, and seek out the root causes of the distemper of 
our times.
<P>

to the grieving family and to the community. My thoughts and my

	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the federal Liberal government is proceeding with the 
former Conservative government's plan to privatize the operations 
of local airports.
<P>
	This week the president of the Saskatchewan Aviation Council 
reminded us of the continued importance of these airports and said 
that the key to the financial survival of small airports in these new 
circumstances is the ability to attract business to the affected 
communities.  He accurately points out that there is little 
communities can do about the costs of running the airports, so they 
must find ways to raise new operating money. That generally 
means that the airports need to bring in more users.
<P>
	The irony of the situation is that if new money cannot be found 
the increased costs of operating the airports will have to be passed 
on to the current airport users, resulting in less, not more, use of the 
airports.
<P>
	With this in mind, I urge the government to provide the resources 
and support systems necessary to ensure that municipal 
governments can successfully make it through this critical 
transition period.

Canadians have always formed a united front to face common

confront the issues of our time: jobs, economic growth, safety, 
good government and unity. Together we shall prevail.
<P>
	Together we tilled the countryside and built cities, went to war to 
win peace and kept peace to prevent war. We made breakthroughs 
in science and pioneered technologies for all citizens. We created 
medicare so that all Canadians, rich or poor, have equal access to 
top-notch health care.
<P>
	I know that Quebecers and their fellow Canadians take pride in 
the work we have done together to make Canada what it is today: 
the number one nation in the world in which to live. May this pride 
bring victory on October 30 to a Canada united in purpose and 
committed to a renewed federalism that ensures we reach our full

	<B>Mr. Gary Pillitteri (Niagara Falls, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
recent weeks many concerned Canadians in my riding of Niagara 
Falls and Niagara-on-the-Lake have been talking about the 
forthcoming referendum in Quebec and what it may mean for the 
future of our nation. Emotions are high and opinions have ranged 
from indignation to disbelief and even ambivalence. Many letters 
written from the heart call for Quebec to remain in Canada as a 
fundamental part of the Canadian family.
<P>
	Yesterday a group of students from Niagara College wrote to the 
citizens of Quebec expressing their deeply held belief that it is the 
uniqueness of the people of Quebec that has helped Canada to 
become the greatest country in the world.

	Mayor Bernard Provencher told the delegates of the two

magical way of bringing all English-speaking Canadians through the Quebec 
province and do it in reverse the other way then we would not have to vote for 
what we already own on the 30th. Long live the twinning of our two cities, may 
they both remain forever in a united Canada.</BLOCKQUOTE>

	<B>Mr. Bernard St-Laurent (Manicouagan, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the comments made yesterday by the Prime Minister in his speech 
before the greater Quebec City chamber of commerce are 
unequivocal and they clear up any misunderstanding. The federal 
system will not be changed in light of Quebec's legitimate 
aspirations.
<P>
	The Prime Minister just abandoned all Quebec federalists who 
still believed that it would be possible to reform federalism and 
guarantee the respect and development of Quebec's distinctiveness. 
Indeed, the Prime Minister just slammed the door on those who 
still thought that federalism would take into account Quebec's 
distinct and specific character.
<P>
	It is now clear that the Prime Minister has nothing to offer to 
Quebecers. The side which is promoting change is the only one 
providing a vision that will allow Quebec to develop to its full 
potential. Vote yes, it is the only logical choice.

include a picture of missing children in their householders. The 
idea was to make these pictures of missing children more visible to 
many more people, thereby increasing the probability of their being 
found.
<P>
	I am pleased to inform the House that this project has already 
been successful. I was recently informed by Child Find Canada's 
office in Edmonton that a missing teenager was safely located as a 
direct result of tips arising from the people who had seen her 
picture in a fellow member's householder.

	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (St. Boniface, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday, the separatist dream merchants received a cold shower 
from the United States. The U.S. secretary of state, Warren 
Christopher, dispelled the separatist dream concerning the special 
relationship that an independent Quebec would continue to have 
with the United States.
<P>
	Mr. Christopher said: ``The fact that Canada is a united nation is 
an important aspect which explains our ability to get along with 
that country, to do business with it, and to have a successful 
relation''.
<P>
	Separatist leaders can continue to generate confusion and sell 
dreams wherever they go, but they will never succeed in fooling

suppositions, hoping that they can thus slip them by Quebecers.
<P>

attitude as to state in an interview with <I>La Presse</I> yesterday: ``I did 
not say that there were no risks, I said that there were no costs''.

	Members of the yes team have even refused to acknowledge the 
costs associated with separation. They have even refused to talk 
about them throughout the entire campaign.

	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, yesterday the 
Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs said that Canadians in the

The minister finds it exceedingly complicated for Quebec to retain 
ownership of federal assets located on Quebec territory after 
sovereignty.
<P>
<B>(1410)</B>
<P>
	Naturally the minister neglected to add that, in fact, Quebec has 
paid for 23 per cent of federal assets located elsewhere in Canada 
or abroad. And custom and international law stipulate that federal 
assets located within Quebec will become the property of 
Quebecers <I>ipso facto</I>. Canada loses nothing in the transaction, as 
only 17.5 per cent of all federal assets are located in Quebec.
<P>
	Obviously, Quebec will want to deduct this shortfall from the 
portion of the federal debt it will assume the day after a yes vote. 
Once again, the minister has attempted to bend the truth about what 
would happen in a sovereign Quebec the day after October 30.

	The justice minister talks a good game and keeps throwing out 
feeble changes to the laws of the land, but where is the 
enforcement? Strangers move in and occupy land they do not own 
and nobody touches them. Bikers blow up property, each other, and 
innocent citizens. Policemen work hard to bring criminals to 
justice, only to see those same criminals walk out of court with a 
slap on their wrists and a smirk on their faces.
<P>
	Law-abiding citizens are fed up. Hundreds will rally tonight with 
the Reform Party leader at the Civic Auditorium in Oshawa. 
Reform has a strong, common sense plan to deal with this situation 
and make public safety the number one priority of our justice 
system.
<P>
	The justice minister can either get the message now or voters 
will talk to him at the ballot box.

campaign, Canadian citizenship and the Canadian passport are 
issues that have been raised repeatedly by the Yes side. And almost 
every time, the separatists try to make us believe that all Quebecers 
who so wished would be able to keep their Canadian citizenship 
and their Canadian passport after Quebec's separation.
<P>
	However, when the PQ's chief negotiator realized that his 
arguments were no longer convincing anyone, he started to back 
down, and now he says he will not negotiate the issue of citizenship 
for Quebecers. Furthermore, the leader of the Bloc is starting to 
praise the advantages of a Quebec passport. The only passport the 
separatist leader can guarantee is a passport to the unknown, a one 
way ticket to separation. On October 30, Quebecers will again 
confirm their ties with Canada and say no.

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in what 
should have been his most important speech in the referendum 
campaign, yesterday the Prime Minister simply gave Quebecers a 
warning by refusing to promise any sort of constitutional change to 
the present federal system. Once again, the Prime Minister has 
been the passionate defender of the status quo.
<P>
	Are we to understand from the Prime Minister that he is asking 
Quebecers to vote no while refusing to commit to any 
constitutional change, even though his Quebec allies on the no side 
are rejecting the status quo?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I said very clearly yesterday to the people of Quebec that 
the referendum vote is a very serious one and what the Bloc 
Quebecois and the Parti Quebecois are proposing is separation, 
pure and simple. The leader of the Bloc Quebecois said clearly 
yesterday that he had no interest in any sort of union with Canada, 
that he only  wanted sovereignty. Perhaps he is in fact no longer the 
chief negotiator, but he certainly is the chief separator.
<P>
	I have always said that Canada is evolving all the time and that 
there will certainly be changes-we make them everyday. But what 
do they want, the people of Quebec and, like them, all the people in 
Canada? They want an end to talk of constitutional problems. They 
want us to work together with the governments of Quebec and the 
other provinces, with business people and with all of society to 
create jobs and to give workers back their dignity in Quebec and 
elsewhere. This is why, after the voting on the referendum in ten or 
twelve days, we can get down to the real problems.
<P>
	As far as constitutional changes are concerned, the debate today 
is not about that. We are answering the ambiguous question posed 
by the PQ and the separatists. The question is separation. If 
Quebecers understand well, they will understand that the issue is 
separation and Quebecers do not want to separate from Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
always a surprise to hear the Prime Minister say in all seriousness 
that he wants to solve Canada's real problems when, during the past 
four weeks we have been sitting, the government has not tabled a 
single major piece of legislation on real issues. There are limits. 
We know he is keeping things until after the referendum.
<P>
	The director general of election is distributing a brochure in 
Quebec, under the Referendum Act, which sets out the yes and the 
no positions. I would ask the Prime Minister whether the no side 
position in the brochure distributed by the director general of 
election accurately reflects his government's constitutional 
position?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we have always said that, as the federal government, we 
wanted to make the Canadian federation work well, and it is vital 
administrative arrangements be found to achieve the goals we are 
seeking. The brochure states clearly that we are prepared to clarify 
existing duplications. In fact, we have signed nine agreements with 
the nine other provincial governments to end much of the 
duplication. The only government refusing to sign an agreement to 
discuss the elimination of duplication is the Government of 
Quebec. It refused, because it had no interest in making the 
federation work. It wants to make use of everything to delude 
Quebecers into thinking they will remain in Canada when it wants 
to get them out of Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
have appreciated an answer to my question, but, you will permit me 
to remind the Prime Minister that it was Daniel Johnson and the 
Minister of Labour, who at the time was a minister in the Johnson 
government, who refused to sign the cut-rate agreement he was 
proposing. He has a short memory. He has a very short memory, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15599"> 15599 </A></B>
<P>
Mr.  Speaker. Since I did not get any answer from the Prime 
Minister, I will try for a more specific one.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	In the document tabled, we read that ``the Government of 
Quebec must-be a willing party to any change in its relationship 
with the federal government. This is the spirit of the federalism we 
believe in''. This is the no position.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister agree with this statement of the no 
side's position, a statement which calls for a veto for Quebec? Does 
he agree?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my party supported a veto for Quebec. When René 
Lévesque was Premier of Quebec and he met with the seven other 
premiers, he was the one who opted for an amending formula that 
gave all the provinces equal status. He rejected the Victoria 
formula, which provided for a veto and which was proposed by this 
government to combine with the others and create equality among 
the provinces.
<P>
	It was at this point that the veto we were proposing for Quebec 
was dropped by the PQ, which the member belonged to at the time. 
Instead of criticizing us for the situation, he should do a <I>mea culpa</I>. 
For strictly partisan and short term reasons, Mr. Lévesque dropped 
the veto for Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, René Lévesque made a single mistake: going to Ottawa 
without a mandate and trusting the premiers of the other provinces 
and the current Prime Minister, all of whom betrayed him. Never 
again will we make the same mistake.
<P>
	In a brochure sent to all Quebecers by the director general of 
elections in Quebec, the no committee clearly demands a right of 
veto for Quebec, and since members asked the question, I will 
quote from the brochure once again to give them another chance of 
hearing it: ``The government of Quebec must-be a willing party to 
any change in its relationship with the federal government''. This is 
what the no side and the Prime Minister are currently selling 
Quebecers.
<P>
	As an eminent member of the no committee, can the Prime 
Minister tell us if he was consulted on the demand for a right of 
veto as expressed, printed and conveyed by the no side? Is this what 
he is saying or is he telling us stories once again?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the constitutional position of the Liberal Party of Quebec 
is well-known. It was developed by the Liberal Party of Quebec. 
For us, the question at this time is about the right of veto. We 
offered Quebec a right of veto before, but René Lévesque turned it 
down in favour of another amending formula.
<P>
	When Mr. Johnson forms the new government after the next 
election, he will be able to make the same demand if he wants to 
and it will be submitted to the provinces. If the provinces agree, the 
amending formula will be changed.
<P>
	As for myself, if I was in favour of this amending formula in 
1970, I will have no difficulty in approving it again. The Parti 
Quebecois, however, has created a situation that will make it very 
difficult to find a solution because they were the ones who rejected 
the right of veto. It was rejected not by us but by them so they could 
join forces with the other provinces in opposing the proposals made 
by the government of which I was then a member. I have nothing to 
learn from them. If a mistake was made, it is the Parti Quebecois 
that must pay the price. They were the ones who rejected Quebec's 
right of veto.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I say again to the Prime Minister that Lévesque's mistake 
was to trust the premiers of the other provinces, who betrayed him 
with the assistance of the current Prime Minister, an expert 
manipulator. We know that he has nothing to learn in the area of 
manipulation. He is Canada's number one manipulator.
<P>
	I ask the Prime Minister to give us a straightforward answer. 
There is a clear statement from the no committee, of which he is a 
member. Until he tells us that he is no longer on the committee, he 
is still on it. His Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and his 
Minister of Labour, who is responsible for the referendum, are also 
on this committee. Do they agree with what is in this brochure? 
This is a simple question. It is not hard to answer. Could he make 
an effort, Mr. Speaker?
<P>
<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the truth hurts when we tell them that they were the ones 
who rejected Quebec's right of veto. They have no right to blame us 
at this time.
<P>
	The truth is that they want to talk about something else. They do 
not want to talk about their plans. For five weeks and even five 
months they have tried telling Quebecers: ``We do not want to 
separate, we want a partnership''. They are now changing their tune 
at the last minute.
<P>
	Their document clearly states that they want to keep their 
Canadian citizenship and passports. And then yesterday, with a 
wave of their magic wand, the Canadian passport became 
something else for Quebecers. They have changed their tune. We, 
however, are not changing our position. We want Quebec to stay in 
Canada and we are not flip-flopping as the Bloc members are doing 
because the PQ is suddenly changing its tune while still trying to 
hide the truth from Quebecers. These separatists do not have the 
courage to frankly tell Quebecers that they are indeed separatists.

	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, yesterday in 
Washington the foreign affairs minister announced we will be 
sending troops to Bosnia as part of the new NATO combat force. 
Prior to the announcement there was no consultation with 
Parliament or with Canadians.
<P>
	It is outrageous. It is just like the Mulroney Tories, who the 
Liberals often condemn.
<P>
	In opposition the now Minister of Human Resources 
Development said about the deployment of troops to the Persian 
Gulf, and I quote: ``To deny the opportunity of this Parliament to be 
heard or to represent the Canadian people is a dereliction of duty by 
the government''.
<P>
	I ask the Prime Minister, why has this government abandoned its 
principles and adopted the same style of government as the hated 
Mulroney?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the member should know that as of this moment we have 
had three debates. The minister said ``if necessary''.
<P>
	The Americans, our partners in the Bosnian situation, are trying 
to achieve peace. If peace is achieved they would like it to be 
maintained. The Americans, who have not yet put one soldier there, 
are apparently willing to send in up to 25,000 soldiers. They have 
asked us if we would participate. The minister said we would look 
into it and if it is absolutely necessary troops would be sent. 
However, before we make a decision we will come to cabinet and 
the House of Commons.
<P>
	The member should congratulate the ministers and all those 
involved for the peace we are about to have in Bosnia. One of the 
reasons we will have peace in Bosnia is because of our Canadian 
soldiers and others who have been there for the last three years 
developing a situation that is leading to that peace today.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, if we are going to 
have peace in the former Yugoslavia, which we all hope for, we 
certainly would not be sending troops that are the biggest and 
baddest junkyard dogs to take care of themselves over there; we 
would be sending peacekeepers. That is what was promised in this 
House.
<P>
	This is a totally new role. The Canadian people demand to know 
how many troops we are sending. What is the duration of their stay 
there? What will be the cost? What will be the exact mandate of 
these troops?
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister agree that Parliament must be allowed to 
establish the criteria for a dangerous mission like this?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> I do not 
know if you remember, Mr. Speaker, but I remember  that they 
voted twice in this House for having troops there. They got up from 
their seats and approved the actions of the government.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> Fine, no. I am sorry, they just 
made speeches in favour of that but they did not vote. When I say 
something, I also vote that way.
<P>
<B>(1430 )</B>
<P>
	It is a very useful situation at the moment. We said that 
everybody wants to be involved and there will be even more troops 
if a peace treaty is ratified to make sure the situation evolves 
peacefully in Bosnia. We all want that to happen.
<P>
	If Canadian soldiers are needed, Mr. Christopher was informed 
by the Minister of Foreign Affairs that we will look into the 
possibility. However, before we make a decision we will consult 
the cabinet and the House of Commons where you can express your 
views. Again I can expect that what you say is not necessarily what 
you will vote for.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I ask my colleagues to please address the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we should 
remember we are not voting during these discussions and that the 
decision has been made before the discussions.
<P>
	The defence minister said yesterday the force we are sending to 
Bosnia will not have a peacekeeping role. That means the 
government is sending Canadian troops into a combat role without 
consulting Parliament, which is outrageous.
<P>
	With the lives of young Canadians at stake will the Prime 
Minister at the very minimum allow Parliament to have a free vote 
on whether our men and women should be sent into a combat role 
in Bosnia?
<P>
	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I do not know where the hon. member took this quotation 
from but I assure him what we are expecting is peace at last in the 
former Yugoslavia.
<P>
	We are not getting ready to send combat troops. We feel it is the 
profound sentiment of Canadians all across the country to support 
UN peacekeeping missions. We have in the past and we will in the 
future because that is where Canadians have been singled out as 
among the best, a duty Canadian troops expect to continue in the 
future.

question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15601"> 15601 </A></B>
<P>
	Speaking before the greater Quebec City chamber of commerce 
yesterday, the Prime Minister stated that Quebec constitutes a 
distinct society because it has its own language, culture and 
institutions, but refused to give this fact formal recognition in the 
Canadian Constitution.
<P>
	If he is serious in making his own the notion of distinct society 
as defined in the Meech Lake accord, can the Prime Minister tell us 
why he has so far refused to make a commitment to amend the 
constitution to include this definition of distinct society?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it takes some nerve on the part of an hon. member who 
voted against a distinct society in the Quebec referendum on the 
Charlottetown accord to rise in this House and ask me if I support 
the notion of distinct society.
<P>
	I have always said, and we voted accordingly, that these matters 
were discussed in the collective document issued by the No side. 
But the Bloc Quebecois and its members across the way all voted 
against the distinct society clause when it was introduced. It was 
included in the Charlottetown accord, yet they all voted against it. 
It takes some nerve to come and blame us for that today. In 
rejecting it, for all kinds of reasons, they actually sided with the 
Reform Party against the Charlottetown accord. We, on the other 
hand, voted for and believe in it.
<P>
	As for the constitution, it will be amended if and when 
discussions are held on the matter. The existing amending formula, 
as proposed by Mr. Lévesque, requires the consent of at least seven 
provinces. The federal government really cannot speak for the 
provinces because, as Mr. Lévesque put it at the time, all the 
provinces are equal and must take part in the constitutional 
amendment process.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
support the concept of distinct society when it really means 
something.
<P>
	Must we gather from the Prime Minister's refusal to make a 
commitment to recognize Quebec as a distinct society in the 
constitution that he not only does not believe in it himself but that 
he is also unable to get a sufficient number of provinces to agree on 
this issue?
<P>
<B>(1435)</B>
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is beyond me how the hon. member, who voted against 
the distinct society clause, can ask me to make all kinds of 
promises in this respect. She was against this concept and voted 
accordingly. Now she claims that it was not really the concept of 
distinct society, that it was not the right term. The question that was 
just put to me was: Do you support the concept of distinct society? 
My answer is Yes and I might add that the hon. member voted 
against the distinct society clause.

	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of National Defence. I 
hope he knows his cabinet colleague announced the government's 
intention to send our troops back to Bosnia without consultation 
despite a number of serious shortcomings in the Canadian Armed 
Forces, including inadequate equipment, low morale and the 
current troop rotation. Some of our troops have been there for the 
third time.
<P>
	How can the minister even consider sending our troops back to 
Bosnia without addressing these concerns?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fred Mifflin (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am not really sure what the hon. member's question is 
pertaining to.
<P>
	I am perplexed by his question. As a previous member of the 
Canadian forces he knows the resiliency of the Canadian forces and 
their capacity to do what is asked of them despite adverse 
conditions and despite tasking.
<P>
	I do not think anybody would disagree that our troops have had 
more than their fair share of work. The Prime Minister has 
indicated the work they have done has saved millions of lives and 
we should be very proud of that.
<P>
	The hon. member is suggesting the Canadian forces do not have 
the capacity to participate in whatever decision is being made. 
Inasmuch as that decision is being made, I would prefer not to 
comment on it right now.
<P>
	However, I assure him that if the government decides to 
participate in the NATO peace implementation plan, in the 
reconstruction of Bosnia or in the help for refugees it will be able to 
do what it plans to because the Canadian forces will have the 
capacity.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, evidence is increasing that our troops in Somalia were 
let down by their leadership.
<P>
	Canadians have confidence in our troops in the field but they 
have serious reservations about the senior chain of command. It is 
the privates and the corporals who must bear the burden of this lack 
of leadership.
<P>
	Canadians are asking is it wise for the government to volunteer 
our troops before the Somalia commission has reached its final 
conclusion?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fred Mifflin (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister has already indicated that before 
decisions are made, whether there is a vote or not, we will have a 
discussion in the House.
<P>
	I repeat, the Canadian forces will be capable of doing what the 
government asks them to do. If the member is  suggesting morale is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15602"> 15602 </A></B>

not good in the Canadian forces, he is not doing anything to help 
the morale by suggesting that Canadian forces are not capable of 
doing what their government asks of them.

	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	In the brochure distributed to every Quebec household by the 
director general of elections, the No committee says that the 
Quebec government must have full power in the fields which fall 
under its jurisdiction.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister admit that, far from putting an end to the 
federal spending power in fields of provincial jurisdiction, Bill 
C-96, which deals with manpower training and education, is an 
even greater interference in these sectors?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as everyone knows, I want to make sure that the Canadian 
constitution is complied with. Sometimes, there are sectors in 
which our respective jurisdictions have a bearing on one another. 
The spending power has been in our constitution since 1867 and, at 
this point in time, we cannot really abuse it, since we have little 
money.
<P>
<B>(1440)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, how 
does the Prime Minister intend to convince Quebecers of the 
virtues of administrative arrangements when even his federalist 
ally, Daniel Johnson, and his labour minister have rejected the 
administrative agreement on labour, calling it a cheap 
arrangement?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member has it wrong. 
It was the present minister of employment, Madam Harel. When I 
wrote to the ministry offering specifically to transfer institutional 
training to the province of Quebec, as with other provinces, we 
received absolutely no response. It would be very useful for the 
hon. member to check her facts.

	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, a 
landmark agreement on harmonizing environmental issues is 
floundering.
<P>
	The minister has blamed the provinces, especially Alberta. 
According to a recent CCME publication, she knows the federal 
government walked out, not the provinces, contrary to what she 
said.
<P>
	Will the minister now admit she stalled this process and 
apologize to the provinces?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the difference between the 
member for Beaver River and me is I was at the meeting.
<P>
	I did not pinch a transcript and then claim it was something else. 
In front of at least 10 witnesses I offered to publish 10 of the 11 
indexes to the public the day after that meeting. The offer was 
turned down by Mr. Ty Lund.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
regardless of who did what, we need to get on with this.
<P>
	This needs to move forward, not backward. Let us not cast 
aspersions and blame. Let us move forward. This process is being 
totally held up. On August 25 all the premiers with the exception of 
the Quebec premier urged the Prime Minister to tell the Minister of 
the Environment to meet with her counterparts and get on with this 
draft agreement.
<P>
	Next Monday the minister will meet with these counterparts 
again in Whitehorse. Will she stay at the meeting and will she 
commit to producing a draft agreement and get on with it?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am perfectly prepared to 
restate the commitment I made in Haines Junction. I hope the 
minister of the environment for Alberta will be open enough to 
begin the public discussion. The federal government asked very 
early in this process for public participation. That was turned down 
by the province of Alberta.
<P>
	It is also interesting that the member for Beaver River said all 
the provinces with the exception of Quebec. She will know very 
well there was a formal letter written by the province of Quebec 
asking the CCME not to take action on that initiative at that 
meeting, a letter which conveniently her minister, Mr. Lund, 
chooses to ignore.

<HR>

that several months ago I wrote to a minister of the Government of 
Quebec, Madam Harel, suggesting we get together to study the 
issue of overlap and duplication so that we could clarify roles and 
responsibilities. Again, no response, rien à faire. I guess Madam

	<B>Mr. Laurent Lavigne (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in my opinion, the best way to avoid distortions is to give 
back to Quebec full authority over manpower training, along with 
the related funding, and thus create a single-window service.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister recognize that his government's 
measure, namely Bill C-96, contradicts the position held by the No 
committee in the brochure distributed by the director general of 
elections, since Ottawa is increasing duplication in the manpower 
sector by eliminating the UI fund?

	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources

the opposition are now recycling their questions from last week.
<P>
	I will simply give them the answer we gave last week, which is 
no, Bill C-96 simply consolidates the authorities that were under 
the existing acts of the four departments that were brought in as 
part of the human resource development ministry. That is all that 
took place, nothing more than that. We were simply doing what 
was done before but consolidating into the new ministry.
<P>
	I would say, seeing as the hon. member raises this wonderful 
publication, that I am very glad to see that the members of the Bloc 
Quebecois have it in their possession. Maybe they will read it and 
find out what a co-operative federation strategy really looks like.

	<B>Mr. Paul DeVillers (Simcoe North, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, just 
like larger corporations, now a majority of small and medium size

Quebec. Can the industry minister explain to this House the main 
economic reasons why those who really create jobs in Quebec want 
to stay within a united Canada?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
it is not at all surprising that small and medium size businesses are 
against the separation of Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, Oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manley:</B> They do not want to say so, but it is true. An 
uncertain climate creates problems for businesses and in this case 
the uncertainty stems from the fact that separatists cannot answer 
questions on the interprovincial trade agreement and on NAFTA, 
they cannot give answers to the thousands of Quebecers who 
depend on foreign trade.
<P>
	They also understand this when business people go outside 
Canada. I saw this when I was in Geneva two weeks ago: there were 
several small and medium size telecommunication businesses from

place because workers came from all parts of Canada to help build 
the oil fields in those areas.

recognize Quebec as a distinct society as defined in the Meech

powers from jurisdictions exclusive to Quebec, and he even refuses 
to reduce duplication. His position is a direct contradiction of the

	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we are on the No side, and we have a very clear policy on 
what has to be done now, and it is to vote in the referendum and 
stop the political and economic uncertainty hovering over Quebec 
and Canada because of the determination of members opposite to 
separate Quebec from Canada. They do not even have the courage 
to say they are separatists. In this brochure, the No side  has 
presented a text that reflects the consensus reached by all members 
of the No committee. Spending powers and so forth are all 
proposals that were accepted and which the members of the Bloc 
Quebecois turned down. They voted against the Charlottetown 
accord which included all that. We supported the Charlottetown 
accord, and this particular text reflects the Charlottetown accord. 
You were against it. You might as well stop talking because you 
keep contradicting yourselves.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr.

information contained in the brochure of the director general of

language that is pretty strong, even for the House of Commons. I

<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am not very impressed by the hon. member's 
exaggerations, because at a time when we are facing a very serious 
situation in Quebec, members of the Bloc Quebecois and the Parti 
Quebecois refuse to tell Quebecers that they want to separate. In 
the public opinion polls, 30 or 40 per cent of the people who say 
they will vote yes believe they will keep their Canadian passports 
and Canadian citizenship and are convinced they will stay in 
Canada and that there will still be federal members in Canada. 
They are not telling them otherwise. They will tell them after the 
referendum instead of telling them the truth before.
<P>
	That is why in my speech yesterday I told Quebecers that reality 
is not a magic wand that will deal with the problems, not a leader 
who appears and disappears, like the one we have now. He was 
supposed to come to the House to crush us, and now he has 
disappeared. Poof, we do not see him any more.
<P>
	The important thing is to realize that when Quebecers have to 
pay their bills at the end of the month, they do not need a magic 
wand but jobs and prosperity. Everyone in Quebec knows perfectly 
well that the Canadian alternative is the only one that will provide 
prosperity, security and progress for Quebecers.

Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am a little concerned that the minister does 
not take the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada with the 
seriousness with which it deliberated over it.
<P>
	I would like to ask the minister if it is his intention to proceed 
with the deportation process against Mr. Chan and other refugee 
claimants who are using the one-child policy in China as their 
claim of refugee status in Canada.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I take any decision of any court 
very seriously. That is why I have tried to tell the hon. member that 
I think we should be cautious before speculating before a minister 
of the crown has had a chance to read the decision in its entirety.
<P>
	Second, with respect to the individual claim, if the individual's 
appeal has been turned down and the individual has gone through 
the complete system and there is no H and C claim, of course that 
individual will be subject to removal. As she knows, refugee 
determination is done on an individual case basis.

	<B>Mr. Eugène Bellemare (Carleton-Gloucester, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is directed to the Minister of Foreign Affairs.
<P>
	The American Secretary of State has made a statement on the 
significance the U.S. attaches to its special relationship with 
Canada. What are we to understand from Mr. Christopher's words 
when he says that we ``should not take it for granted that a different 
kind of organization would just obviously have exactly the same 
kind of ties''?
<P>
	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, the words of the American Secretary of State are clear 
evidence of how important the very close and very profitable ties 
between our two countries are to the United States. The arrival of a 
third player in the game might complicate things considerably. An 
eternal triangle is certainly not something the U.S. would wish for, 
if I read the American Secretary of State correctly.

	<B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question 
is for the Minister of National Defence.
<P>
	There is a proposal before the minister's department to change 
the tendering system for moving companies who move employees 
of national defence. Will the minister assure this House that his 
department will not move toward a one bidder take all system, 
which would create a monopoly in the moving business and destroy 
an industry of over 800 companies across this nation and put many 
thousands of people out of work?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fred Mifflin (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the hon. member for her question. She is aware 
that this has been the subject of debate in the House for the last two 
years. I want to tell the House that it is still being debated and the 
discussion continues to go on.
<P>
	I will tell the hon. member that the department has met with the 
Bureau of Competition Policy and with all the main players 
involved. I will have to tell her that a decision will be coming in the 
very near future on this matter.

<P>
renovations to the Peace Tower, the general contractor, Fuller, 
subcontracted to Karmash, who contracted Ray Wolfe to do 
masonry work. Wolfe's female engineer, Anne Raney, was 
subsequent harassed off the job by Karmash.
<P>
<B>(1500 )</B>
<P>
	Given the government's commitment to equity in the workplace 
and given this workplace is within the jurisdiction of Parliament 
Hill, literally outside our doors, why did the minister of public 
works subsequently reward such unacceptable behaviour by 
granting Fuller and Karmash contracts for the rest of Centre Block 
even after the Raney incident?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services and Minister for the Atlantic Canada 
Opportunities Agency, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. 
member for his question.
<P>
	The hon. member will know that our contract is with the main 
contractor and not with the subcontractors. There is no, what they 
call in law, privity of contract between the Government of Canada 
and the subcontractor. However I instructed my deputy minister to 
apprise the main contractor to try to resolve the issue as 
expeditiously as possible. We have sent communications to him 
and we are hoping the matter which occurred will not occur again.
<P>
	With regard to subsequent contracts I assure the hon. member as 
well as other members of the House that, notwithstanding the fact it 
is beyond the legal ramifications of the Government of Canada in 
terms of the privity of contract, we will ensure this kind of 
behaviour is not tolerated. Therefore we will have to look at all 
contracts awarded in that manner.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> This will conclude question period. I have a point 
of privilege followed by a point of order. Before I recognize the 
hon. member for Perth-Wellington-Waterloo, I might ask him 
whether his point of privilege arises out of today's question period.

	<B>Mr. John Richardson (Perth-Wellington-Waterloo, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of privilege. The member for Red

bad junk yard dogs''. What a terrible and unfair characterization of 
the members of the Canadian forces who have served our country 
and the UN for decades.
<P>
	There seems to be an attempt by the members of the third party 
to smear the Canadian forces.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> That is not a point of privilege. The hon. member 
for Red Deer has been named and I saw him getting to his feet. 
Does the hon. member have something to add to the point before 
the House?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Yes, Mr. Speaker. First I quote 
the minister of defence when he said: ``Our force would have to be 
robust and tough''.
<P>
	In my question I said that we were not sending peacekeepers, 
which is what the defence minister went on to say. The U.S. 
defence minister said that the force has to be the biggest, baddest 
junk yard dog.

<P>
	I believe the House of Commons is a place where we have very 
strong feelings and from time to time we use very strong words. I 
would hope this is not an indication of things to come and I would 
like the matter to rest where it is. It is not a point of privilege.

	<B>Mr. Stinson:</B> You are twisted.

	<B>An hon. member:</B> I heard that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mifflin:</B> The hon. member for Red Deer in his question to 
the Prime Minister in the context of another country used the term 
``meanest junk yard dogs'' in reference to members of the 
Canadian forces.
<P>
<B>(1505 )</B>
<P>
	My concern is not just that he used that term; but in reference to 
the tenor of the questions from the third party that morale in the 
Canadian forces was so bad that perhaps we may not want to send 
the troops, this was totally out of context. In that context I ask the 
member to withdraw that statement.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> We had a point of privilege which I ruled was not 
a point of privilege. The hon. member for Red Deer rose to his feet 
to give some explanation. I said I wanted to let the matter rest 
there.
<P>
	The hon. parliamentary secretary raised the same point on a 
point of order. I would rule at this point at least-I do not want to

<P>
get into a debate-that members of Parliament should not be 
curtailed by the Chair any  more than is absolutely necessary when 
they are giving some opinions.
<P>
	There are some words that are offensive to the House in total. 
There are some words that are inflammatory to some members. 
Once again I would appeal to members that the more they push 
their Speaker to making decisions on the comments they make by 
bringing it right up to the end, the more difficult it is to conduct a 
civilized question period, if I might use that word.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-105, 
an act to implement a convention between Canada and the republic 
of Latvia, a convention between Canada and the republic of 
Estonia, a convention between Canada and the republic of Trinidad 
and Tobago and a protocol between Canada and the republic of 
Hungary, for the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention 
of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on  income, be read the 
second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jesse Flis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the conventions we were 
talking about this morning under Bill C-105 are actually patterned 
to a large extent on the model double taxation convention prepared 
by the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development.
<P>
	Under the convention a general rate of withholding tax of 5 per 
cent will apply to dividends paid to a parent company and on 
branch profits and 10 per cent on interest and royalties. The rate of 
withholding tax on other dividends is set at 15 per cent. The 
convention also provides for a number of exemptions in the case of 
interest.
<P>
	The Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International 
Trade is holding many meetings with small and medium size 
Canadian companies. These companies are already exporting 
Canadian goods to other countries or are interested in penetrating 
the export market.
<P>
<B>(1510 )</B>
<P>
	I compliment the committee for taking on the task to stimulate 
exports where $1 million in trade can create over 30 or 35 jobs. If 
we want to create more jobs in the country, which is the mandate of 
the government, there are two ways of doing it: first, by increasing 
our exports for companies that have never been in the export 
market and, second, by encouraging those who are exporting to 
increase their exports by 5 per cent, 10 per cent or 15 per cent.
<P>
	We were very pleased that some of the witnesses who appeared 
this morning talked about trading with companies such as the ones 
mentioned in the bill.
<P>
	The fact that we have Canadians who came here from countries 
around the world makes Canada a great country. We have to 
capitalize on our strengths. Some Canadians understand not only 
the languages of Hungary, Latvia and Estonia, Trinidad and Tobago 
but the cultures. It is very important when trading with a country to 
know its culture. This is why it is important to preserve our policy 
of bilingualism and multiculturalism.
<P>
	Before question period I debated with the hon. member for 
Jonquiére who tried to compare the province of Quebec with small 
countries such as Estonia, Latvia, Hungary, Lithuania, et cetera. He 
was really comparing apples and oranges because la belle province 
is a beautiful province within Canada. When I think of Canada I 
include the territories and all the provinces.
<P>
	I reminded the hon. member that better protection there would 
not be to preserve the French language than having it entrenched in 
the Canadian Constitution and in our overall policy. That language 
will never die in Canada if we stay united and keep our country 
strong. However, if we start splitting up the country and if  Quebec 
separates, that guarantee of the French language and French culture 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15608"> 15608 </A></B>
<P>
will no longer be there. When the people of Quebec vote on 
October 30 I hope they will take that into consideration.
<P>
	The referendum is glossed over with fancy language. The 
referendum question should read: Do you want to separate from 
Canada? Yes or no. If it were worded that way I think we would 
find that the majority of Canadians living in Quebec, regardless of 
origin, would vote no. Canada has been twice declared by the 
United Nations the number one country in the world in which to 
live. Canada has been identified as the second richest country on 
the planet, next to Australia.
<P>
	Why would any Canadian or any province want to separate? It is 
nonsense. That is why we need bills like Bill C-105 so that all 
Canadians interested in exporting, be it to Estonia, Latvia or 
Trinidad and Tobago, have the freedom to do so and at the same 
time have the protection of not being double taxed, of not losing 
their profits and of not being taxed unfairly.
<P>
	These are agreements we have already signed with 55 other 
countries. It is nothing new. I am pleased that the official 
opposition and the third party, if I heard correctly, will be 
supporting the bill.
<P>
	I appreciate the opportunity to take part in the debate. I remind 
all Canadians, especially people living in la belle province, that we 
have something no other country in the world has. Let us keep it 
that way.
<P>
<B>(1515 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is with 
great pleasure that I stand before the House to speak on Bill C-105, 
an act to implement tax conventions between Canada and Latvia, 
Estonia, Trinidad and Tobago, and a protocol with Hungary.
<P>
	Canada has such agreements with more than 55 countries. This 
type of agreement is very normal in today's business environment 
because the global economy is becoming smaller. The barriers for 
trade are coming down. The fences that were built between 
countries are no longer in existence. The trend is that there will be 
more and more trade. There will be more investment among 
different countries.
<P>
	When Canadian companies invest in other countries they have to 
look at the tax implications that exist. Obviously those companies 
are making a profit there and when they do we have to have certain 
rules on withholding taxes. The same is true when investments are 
made here by companies outside of Canada. We have to have rules 
and regulations to govern how those moneys can be taken out of the 
country.
<P>
	Bill C-105 provides the legislative authority for the 
implementation of the tax agreements which Canada has signed. 
The tax treaties are designed to alleviate double  taxation of income 
earned in one country by a person resident in another country. 
Obviously it would not be beneficial for someone to invest in 
another country only to have to pay the full taxes of that country 
and then once again pay taxes in their resident country. That would 
not be an incentive to invest.
<P>
	This is very good for Canada. We are a trading nation. One out of 
every five jobs in this country is related to trade. Trade will be 
increasing.
<P>
	In the criteria used as to which countries we should and should 
not have these types of agreements with, three primary factors are 
to be considered when negotiating a tax treaty with a particular 
country.
<P>
	One is how much Canadian investment is planned for that 
country. Obviously if we have a much larger amount of capital and 
investment going into another country, there is a greater urgency. If 
we have very little, then it is not that apparent to have a tax treaty. 
The second requirement is Canada's desire to encourage economic 
reforms. If we want to encourage economic reforms, that is an 
additional reason to ensure there is a tax treaty. Another 
requirement is a country's interest in expanding its trade and 
economic relations with Canada.
<P>
	We are building new relationships all the time with other 
countries. For example, there are companies investing in the 
tourism business and mining in Cuba. To ensure that those 
investments are encouraged and that we have an understanding 
with Cuba, we need to look at tax treatments, to ensure there is a 
fair tax treatment for both countries, for the other country and for 
Canada.
<P>
	There is also the capital gains situation. There has to be a way to 
ensure that when a foreign company or an individual in another 
country comes to Canada that the tax is paid on their profits here 
but that they are also treated so that there is equity in the tax being 
paid. In other words, a company paying taxes back home does not 
have to pay twice. This is an advantage for both countries.
<P>
<B>(1520)</B>
<P>
	Bill C-105 is neither earth shattering nor housekeeping 
legislation. Rather, it is workaday legislation which addresses the 
dual issue of fair taxation and good international relations.
<P>
	In this era of governments reappraising their roles, particularly 
their economic roles in an increasingly interdependent open global 
economy, reciprocal tax treaties make good common sense. They 
certainly do not hinder economic competition, which for Canada is 
an important fact of life. Canada is above all a trading nation. We 
must keep expanding our trading boundaries and our relationships 
with other countries.
<P>
	A few items in the bill apply to all four treaties. First, while tax 
treaties vary from one country to another, because there are special 
circumstances, each treaty must  be negotiated individually. These 
proposed conventions are similar to other treaties already 
concluded by Canada. They are patterned on the model of the 
double 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15609"> 15609 </A></B>
<P>
taxation convention prepared by the Organization for Economic 
Co-operation and Development.
<P>
	Second, each treaty has been negotiated individually and has 
taken into account the relevant policies in each country.
<P>
	Third, Bill C-105 provides an equitable solution to the double 
taxation problems which exist between Canada and these countries. 
Double taxation occurs when international transactions result in the 
same income being taxable in the hands of the same person by 
more than one nation.
<P>
	In addition, the protocol brings the convention with Hungary in 
line with the current Canadian tax policy, particularly with regard 
to the rates of withholding taxes.
<P>
	Here are some of the technical aspects of Bill C-105 which apply 
to the treaties with Estonia, Latvia, and Trinidad and Tobago.
<P>
	There will be a withholding tax rate of 5 per cent on dividends 
paid to parent companies and on branch profits, 10 per cent on 
interest and royalties, and management fees in the case of Trinidad 
and Tobago. A 15 per cent rate of withholding tax will apply on 
other dividends. The conventions also provide for a number of 
exemptions in the case of interest. For Estonia and Latvia, a zero 
rate will apply to interest paid to the governments, the central 
banks, the Export Development Corporation, and from sales made 
on credit. I could go on with more of the technical details of this 
bill, but I would like to talk about taxation in general.
<P>
	Because there is more and more trade happening around the 
world, and for very good reason, we as a country want to ensure 
that our energies are put into doing the type of economic activities 
in which we have a trade advantage, where we are more 
competitive and have the resources, the skills and the technology 
which will enable us to be more competitive than other countries. 
We would be able to produce that product at a lower price than 
other countries that may not have the same advantages. As we see 
more and more trade developing around the world, some of the 
costs will decrease.
<P>
	One of the most important things is taxation in general. As 
Canadians we have to ensure that we do not burden our companies 
and our business people with high taxes which would make it more 
difficult for them to compete in the international community.
<P>
	Canadians are overtaxed and our tax system is too complicated. 
We have to work on both of those areas to ensure that we simplify 
our tax system and that we reduce the tax burden. If we do not do 
that, we will find it more and more difficult to compete around the 
world. If our neighbours or our trading partners have a much  lower 
tax rate, obviously our companies and our business people will not 
have the same advantages.
<P>
<B>(1525 )</B>
<P>
	As trade develops and the barriers come down, as we saw with 
the world trade agreement, we will need to focus more on taxation, 
on our rate of taxes and on the complexity of our taxation system. 
We will also need to ensure that our duties and excise taxes are also 
very competitive and consistent so that we can compete efficiently 
with the rest of the world.
<P>
	Our finance minister will ensure that some of those areas get 
attention so that we can continue to be a strong trading nation. In 
doing that, we will continue to create employment and 
opportunities for all Canadians.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have the pleasure to rise this afternoon to say a few 
words about Bill C-105, at second reading.
<P>
	This piece of legislation implements tax conventions between 
Canada and Latvia, Estonia, Trinidad and Tobago and a protocol to 
the tax convention signed with Hungary.
<P>
	Canada has signed tax conventions with 55 countries; Bill C-105 
allows for the implementation of conventions with four of these 
countries. The purpose of these conventions is simply to avoid 
double taxation of income. This means that an individual would not 
be required to pay taxes both in Canada and Trinidad and Tobago, 
for instance, or in Canada and Hungary.
<P>
	Indeed, some engineering companies in my riding do business in 
such countries, where they plan and build bridges and other things. 
I refer to civil engineering, of course. The purpose of this bill is to 
avoid things of this kind.
<P>
	I must say that I was rather taken aback by the remarks made by 
the Bloc member this morning in the House. The member for 
Jonquière, I believe, used the time he had been given to speak on 
Bill C-105 to extol the virtues of separation.
<P>
	The member opposite had a great time explaining that Bill C-105 
meant that Quebec would automatically have access to all the 
international agreements signed by Canada. This is stretching the 
truth, to say the least. Indeed, it is true that Canada has agreements 
with several countries in order to avoid double taxation. But to say, 
as the member is claiming and as he mentioned in some of his 
statements, that Quebec, if it were to separate, and I hope that never 
happens, would automatically have all the rights or most of the 
rights that it now has within Canada in terms of international 
agreements, that is not only an exaggeration, but as we would say 
in Hawkesbury, ``that is stretching it quite a bit''.
<P>
	I say to the member opposite that, what he would want 
Quebecers to believe is that, in fact, Quebec would  automatically 
have the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15610"> 15610 </A></B>
<P>
right to join NAFTA, for instance, or other trade agreements such 
as the Canada-U.S. free trade agreement.
<P>
	That is simply not true. Yesterday, Mr. Christopher said clearly 
that, if Quebec were to separate, things would not be necessarily 
the same at all.
<P>
<B>(1530)</B>
<P>
	Of course, the Deputy Premier of Quebec has attempted to give a 
different twist to all of this. Last night, on the news, we saw him try 
his best to put other words in Mr. Christopher's mouth. But it did 
not work, of course. Mr. Christopher's words are clear. Besides, a 
few days ago, we saw the Roh report, which was even tabled in this 
House and which indicated, once again, that agreements signed 
exclusively between Canada and the United States or Mexico are 
not automatically offered to other countries, including Quebec if it 
became a country. And I repeat that I hope that this will not happen. 
I hope we will remain a united country, the great country we live in.
<P>
	However, that would not be automatic, and the Minister of 
Finance made it clear. The minister mentioned that one million 
jobs in Quebec depend on trade. He clearly said that those jobs are 
at risk. He did not say that they would all disappear. He did not say 
that. The member opposite knows that and so do his colleagues. 
But it is true that these jobs are threatened. Does that mean that 
some would have to take salary cuts, while others would lose their 
jobs, their benefits, or whatever else? I do not know, but there is no 
doubt that jobs are at stake. There is a potential loss for one million 
workers. This is not to say that they will all lose their jobs. 
Absolutely not. The member knows that too.
<P>
	However, it also does not mean that everything will remain the 
same as it is, and the member is also aware of that. There are 
potential losses and there are great risks. As we saw, the 
referendum campaign went through various stages. For example, at 
the beginning, these separatist members told us about sovereignty, 
without elaborating. Then we saw one separatist leader give way to 
another and, at the same time, we started hearing about a new 
union, a unifying separation, if you can imagine.
<P>
	According to the Leader of the Opposition, this unifying 
separation would lead to all sorts of agreements, imaginary or 
otherwise with the rest of Canada, in addition to ensuring that 
Quebecers would enjoy all the benefits resulting from Canada's 
international agreements and prestige, including the Canadian 
passport, if you can imagine that for one second.
<P>
	Yesterday, the Leader of the Opposition went so far as to admit it 
may not be quite that way. Trying another tack, he said that, maybe, 
the passport will not be a Canadian passport. It may turn out to be 
something else. We can see that he is starting to sing another tune, 
once  again. Separatists are shifting like that all the time. It is a case 
of moving targets.
<P>
	What takes the cake, concerning agreements and privileges that 
some separatists envision, is that they used the Canadian dollar, the 
loonie with the word Canada on it, to replace the ``o'' of ``oui''. It is 
very hard for me, and probably for you too, to imagine they had the 
gall to do that, but it goes to show how low the separatists across 
the way have stooped during the referendum campaign.
<P>
	Last weekend, I campaigned in the Saint-Janvier area, near 
Mirabel. Senior citizens told me and some of my colleagues that 
separatists had told them that voting yes meant voting for Canada. 
That is what they were told by separatists.
<P>
<B>(1535)</B>
<P>
	How awful. This shows how little conviction they have on the 
other side if they go around telling people the opposite of what they 
think in order to get their vote.
<P>
	That is what I witnessed last week. This is the sort of thing going 
on. They tell senior citizens that voting yes means voting for 
Canada. That is what I have seen in that area. Members opposite 
must not be too sure of their arguments if they are willing to tell the 
opposite of the truth to win votes. It is even worse than the unifying 
separation the Leader of the Opposition was talking about last 
week. That is the kind of thing we have heard.
<P>
	This morning, the hon. member tried to rewrite history when he 
said that the province of Ontario and Quebec have been together 
only since 1867, only for 130 years is what he said, when he knows 
full well that the Union Act of 1840 was signed-guess when, 
ladies and gentlemen-in 1840. That is why it is called what it is 
called. Being a teacher yourself, Mr. Speaker, you know that is so.
<P>
	The pages here in the House of Commons are all students who 
have learned that the Union Act of 1840 was signed in 1840. It does 
not come as a great surprise to them, but it seems that the Bloc 
members have to revisit the past, because the rest of their 
arguments does not hold so good either.
<P>
	Let me tell the hon. member opposite who spoke this morning 
that the agreements referred to in Bill C-105 are not side 
agreements nor are they similar to agreements made under the 
Canada-U.S. free trade agreement and NAFTA signed by Canada, 
the United States and Mexico.
<P>
	U.S. trade representatives, whether it is Senator Dole, Mr. Roh, 
and even Mr. Christopher no later than yesterday, have all clearly 
stated that there will have to be concessions for a sovereign Quebec 
to keep the prerogatives it now enjoys within a unified Canada. 
That is why Canada must remain unified, if for no other reason than 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15611"> 15611 </A></B>
<P>
to serve the commercial interests of the  country and the interests of 
all the workers in Quebec and the rest of Canada.
<P>
	That is what the prime minister said, that is what the Minister of 
Finance said, and that is what other ministers said. All of my 
colleagues as well as Mr. Johnson and the Chambers of Commerce 
have said it. A united Canada will bring us prosperity, but a divided 
Canada will bring us adversity.
<P>
	This must not be. We have all been elected to this House to help 
build this great country, to make it better and more prosperous. 
Those are the commitments we made in the red book and that is 
what we will do as a government. This is why we urge Quebecers to 
vote no in the referendum, so that we can continue to build this 
country, to build an economy for each and everyone of us.
<P>

	Mr. Speaker, before you put the question, I believe you will find 
the unanimous consent of the House that the bill be referred to 
committee of the whole to be dealt with immediately. I understand 
one of the chairs of the committee of the whole is preparing to enter 
the Chamber shortly in order to take over that measure should the 
House give its consent.

<P>
	<B>The Assistant Deputy Chairman:</B> Shall clause 6 carry?
<P>
	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Chairman, would it not 
be appropriate, since it is a regulatory power being granted the 
minister, to see to it that the minister consults the House or the 
appropriate standing committee before issuing the regulation?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Walker:</B> Could we have the question again, please?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Caron:</B> Even so, Mr. Speaker, clause 6 makes provision for 
a regulatory power. I believe that departments often go too far in 
the definition of what constitutes a regulation. I believe that it 
would be worthwhile and even appropriate for the Standing  
Committee on Finance to be consulted when a regulation 
pertaining to this bill is issued.
<P>
	<B>The Assistant Deputy Chairman:</B> We have had technical 
problems and I appreciate the member for Jonquière's cooperation 
in kindly repeating his question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Walker:</B> Thank you. Now we understand the question.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The reason this particular piece of legislation and the tax treaty 
would come to the House in this form is to ensure that the House is 
clear as to what is being delegated to officials in terms of 
regulatory authority. However, the House of Commons has, 
through other committees, regular review of regulation. Any time a 
member feels this is not within the normal course of activities they 
can bring it to the attention of the House through that committee, 
but there is no particular regulatory reference back to the House of 
Commons finance committee.

time and passed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Walker (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity 
to speak today at third reading of Bill C-105, the Income Tax 
Conventions Implementation Act, 1995.
<P>
	Hon. members will recall that Bill C-105 implements reciprocal 
income tax conventions between Canada and  Latvia, Canada and 
Estonia, Canada and Trinidad and Tobago, and a protocol to the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15612"> 15612 </A></B>
<P>
current income tax treaty between Canada and Hungary. The tax 
conventions and the amending protocol this bill will ratify are 
patterned after conventions previously approved by this chamber. 
They break no new ground.
<P>
	Tax treaties have two main specific objectives: the avoidance of 
double taxation and the prevention of tax evasion. More broadly, 
tax treaties facilitate investment and trade between the treaty 
countries and can help encourage reforms.
<P>
	The treaties in the legislation before us are part of an ongoing 
series of tax treaties that began in 1971, when the reform of 
Canada's income tax legislation required Canada to expand its 
network of double taxation conventions with other countries. They 
also reflect Canada's willingness to reduce or eliminate certain 
forms of withholding to meet international norms and to advance 
our economic interests, including the competitiveness of our 
technological industries.
<P>
	The treaties are patterned on the model double taxation 
convention prepared by the Organization for Economic 
Co-operation and Development. Each treaty has been negotiated 
carefully and individually. Each takes into account the relevant 
policies of the country with which we are undertaking this treaty. 
The treaties will provide an equitable solution to the double 
taxation problems that currently exist between Canada and these 
countries. In addition, the protocol to our treaty with Hungary 
brings the existing convention with that country into line with 
current Canadian tax policy, particularly in the area of withholding 
taxes.
<P>
	Let me briefly restate during this third reading debate some of 
the technical provisions of Bill C-105 that apply to the treaties with 
Estonia, Latvia, and Trinidad and Tobago. First, there will be a 
withholding tax rate of 5 per cent on dividends paid to a parent 
company and on branch profits and 10 per cent on interest and 
royalties, which in the case of Trinidad and Tobago includes 
management fees, and also a 15 per cent rate of withholding tax 
that will apply on other dividends.
<P>
	The conventions also provide for a number of exemptions in the 
case of interest. For Estonia and Latvia a zero rate will apply to 
interest paid to the governments, the central banks, the Export 
Development Corporation, and from sales made on credit. For 
Trinidad and Tobago, a zero rate will apply to interest paid for 
government indebtedness and on loans or credit from the Export 
Development Corporation or its equivalent there and for interest 
paid to pension plans.
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
	Canadians will benefit from any future changes extended by 
Estonia and Latvia to other OECD member countries with respect 
to withholding tax on copyright  and patent royalties. Trinidad and 
Tobago will maintain the exemption on copyright royalties.
<P>
	Pension payments and annuity payments in the case of Trinidad 
and Tobacco will be taxed at a maximum rate of 15 per cent in the 
source country. However, war pensions in Trinidad and Tobago will 
be exempted. In addition, social security pensions will be taxed in 
the originating country and the withholding tax rate on annuity 
payments will be dropped to 10 per cent.
<P>
	Also with respect to Trinidad and Tobago, the two-year 
exemption for visiting teachers will no longer exist and seasonal 
workers will not have to pay Canadian tax if they earn under 
$8,500.
<P>
	I return briefly now to the protocol negotiated with Hungary, 
which is also part of Bill C-105. As background, I should mention 
that the Income Tax Act amendments in 1976 increased the rate of 
the withholding tax paid to non-residents from 15 per cent to 25 per 
cent unless reduced by a tax treaty.
<P>
	The existing treaty between Canada and Hungary reduced the 
withholding tax rate to 10 per cent on dividends paid to a parent 
company and 15 per cent in all other cases. However, that 
convention was negotiated before the 1992 budget announced 
Canada's willingness to reduce its withholding tax on direct 
dividends to 5 per cent. The revised protocol before us today 
reduces that rate and the rate of branch tax to 5 per cent by 1997. 
There are no changes in the rates of withholding tax on other 
dividends.
<P>
	I would like to point out that the Government of Canada will lose 
no revenue as a result of the provisions in these treaties. Not only 
will Canada gain from increased trade and investment, but we will 
gain too from the reduced withholding tax rates and other 
concessions we have gained from these negotiations.
<P>
	There is nothing contentious in this bill. I would like to take a 
moment to thank the House for its co-operation today, for 
providing for second reading in committee of the whole and now 
third reading. It is very much appreciated that the opposition 
parties that are participating in this debate today understand that 
this is a good step forward for the government.
<P>
	This is a workaday legislation that will expand trade and 
investment opportunities between Canada and the countries with 
whom we have made this deal. Canada already has tax agreements 
with 54 nations. This bill will increase the number to 57.
<P>
	I call upon the House to give its support and bring a conclusion 
to this debate on third reading.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Is the House ready for the 
question?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Question.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15613"> 15613 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jordan:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order, it is my 
understanding that one of our members wishes to speak to third 
reading of this bill. Perhaps that could be accommodated.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Certainly. We are still at the 
debate stage. Resuming debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a great 
privilege to speak once again on Bill C-105.
<P>
	This bill shows that you need to build an infrastructure whenever 
you deal with trade with other countries. That infrastructure takes a 
substantial amount of effort to create so that there is trade and 
investment taking place among different countries.
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
	Looking at the legislation, as I said earlier in the debate, there is 
an agreement with 55 countries. I know members of the Bloc think 
it is very simple and easy to build a relationship with other 
countries. They think it is very easy to set up treaties, make 
agreements and develop trade with other countries. It takes a very 
long time to build the infrastructure and the treaties. It takes a long 
time to make agreements and create the organizations to develop 
trade and exchanges, rules, regulations and understandings among 
different countries.
<P>
	It does not take a genius to know that if the infrastructure is 
broken, if those agreements are broken sometimes they cannot be 
renegotiated. For example, some people in the Bloc think it would 
be very easy to negotiate a new NAFTA. That simply is not the 
case. Look at the world trade agreement. It took years and years to 
negotiate that, to develop a consensus among so many countries.
<P>
	This bill shows that as a country, Canada needs the tremendous 
infrastructures we have built in trade, transportation and 
organizations. These were not created overnight. They took years 
and years to develop. It also takes expertise.
<P>
	I sometimes wonder what the people in the Bloc are thinking 
when they say that they can do the same thing overnight and that 
they will be able to set up all the agreements the next day and do all 
the things it took Canada so long to do. It makes no sense.
<P>
	Everyone knows that when political uncertainty is created, 
business people are not willing to invest where there is uncertainty. 
One way to judge that is what has happened in real estate, the 
business I was involved in. It is a very good indicator of the 
investment climate and of the uncertainty that exists. If we drive 
across the bridge over to Hull we will see that real estate prices are 
lower because of the uncertainty in Quebec. They are substantially 
lower because of the political uncertainty created by members of 
the Bloc.
<P>
	The jobs that are created, whether they are in Canada or other 
countries, the investment and the foundations that are laid are 
because of stability. We need political stability to ensure that we 
create a climate for investment and for business.
<P>
	This bill is an indication of another infrastructure, another 
agreement we are developing as a nation. All Canadians will be 
able to take advantage of this. It will become easier to invest in 
other countries and easier for other countries to invest in Canada.
<P>
	If that infrastructure is broken, it creates problems. We will not 
have the built in systems. Those systems take a long time to 
develop. As a country we have to recognize that. I think the people 
in Quebec recognize that they cannot duplicate overnight what took 
so many years to build. That is going to be a disadvantage. When 
we have those types of disadvantages we cannot compete. If we 
cannot compete, the reality is that jobs will be lost. Anybody who 
says that if Quebec is no longer part of Canada no jobs will be lost 
does not have a clue about the reality that exists out there. 
Thousands of jobs are going to be lost because it is taking away the 
system, the infrastructure, the communications, all the things that 
have been built up.
<P>
<B>(1605)</B>
<P>
	There are many examples around the world where countries have 
been torn apart. What happens is that the prosperity is not there. 
Racial harmony is a key to prosperity. At this time, the stronger the 
unit we have, the greater our ability is to negotiate and fulfil 
agreements, to have financial strength and to have a critical mass 
where we can talk to other countries because of our fiscal strength. 
We can talk to other countries because of our technologies and they 
will want to talk to us about the economy, trade and making 
exchanges.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is the member finished his address?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dhaliwal:</B> Let me just conclude, Mr. Speaker. I see the hon. 
Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development is here so I 
will conclude my remarks by saying that as a country we have to 
recognize, as do all the people of Quebec, that we will be stronger 
if we are united as Canadians. We will be able to create jobs and 
have a future for our children if we stay together. We will not be 
strong if we are divided. We will be strong if we are united and we 
will be able to build a strong future for the generations to come.

	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.)</B> moved that Bill C-107, an act respecting the 
establishment of the British Columbia Treaty Commission be read 
the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in my place today to 
begin debate on second reading of Bill C-107, an act respecting the 
establishment of the British Columbia Treaty Commission.
<P>
	The legislation confirms Canada's obligations under the B.C. 
Treaty Commission agreement signed in September 1992 by the 
Government of Canada, the Government of British Columbia and 
the First Nations Summit. It is an obligation we have inherited 
from the previous government, but its aims and objectives lie close 
to the heart of this government.
<P>
	Our government is committed to building new partnerships with 
aboriginal people based on trust and mutual respect. In the 1993 
election we addressed aboriginal issues in the red book. We stated 
what a Liberal government would do.
<P>
	In the red book we stated that our goal was: a Canada where 
aboriginal people would enjoy a standard of living and quality of 
life and opportunity equal to those other Canadians; a Canada 
where First Nations, Inuit and Metis people would live 
self-reliantly, secure in the knowledge of who they are as unique 
peoples; a Canada where all Canadians would be enriched by 
aboriginal cultures and would be committed to the fair sharing of 
the potential of our nation; and a Canada where aboriginal people 
would have the positive option to live and work wherever they 
chose. Perhaps most important, the red book set out our goal for 
Canada where aboriginal children would grow up in secure families 
and healthy communities with the opportunity to take their full 
place in Canada.
<P>
<B>(1610 )</B>
<P>
	As a result, we also said that the resolution of land claims would 
be a priority. That is our vision and we have been moving step by 
step to bring it alive. In two years we have already made 
considerable progress. On August 10, I and my colleague, the 
federal interlocutor for Metis and non-status Indians, announced 
the government's approach to the implementation of the inherent 
right of aboriginal self-government.
<P>
	We have fostered greater economic development opportunities 
for aboriginal communities through co-management agreements 
and support for business ventures. We have committed an 
additional $20 million annually to the Indian and Inuit 
post-secondary student  support program. We have settled some 44 
specific claims and have seen five comprehensive claims come into 
effect. By any measure we have achieved a great deal in living up 
to the commitments we made to the people of Canada in the red 
book.
<P>
	Perhaps the most complex challenge is the one that the 
legislation before us addresses: treaty making in British Columbia. 
I would like to remind the House that British Columbia is unique in 
Canada in that the process of signing treaties has never been 
completed. Only a handful of treaties were signed in the 
pre-Confederation period. They cover parts of Vancouver Island. In 
1899 Treaty No. 8 was signed with the First Nations in the Peace 
River area in northeastern B.C. However, in the rest of the province 
the issue of aboriginal rights remains largely unresolved.
<P>
	The First Nations have wanted to resolve these issues. 
Repeatedly they have pressed for treaties, but only until this decade 
did the provincial government have the willingness to negotiate. It 
maintained previously that there was no need to negotiate. It said 
that whatever rights to land and resources the aboriginal people 
may have once had were extinguished long ago. The result was 
decades of legal acrimony. The First Nations sought settlement 
through the courts of what they had been unable to achieve through 
the negotiation process.
<P>
	In 1973 the Supreme Court of Canada was asked whether 
aboriginal title to the Nisga'a traditional territory had been 
extinguished. It was the Calder case. The six judges were evenly 
split on the question. The Government of Canada then adopted a 
policy to enter into negotiations to resolve comprehensive claims.
<P>
	The courts for their part have expressed repeatedly and in the 
strongest terms that the issues brought before them ought to be 
settled at the negotiation table, not before the bar. They should be 
settled through negotiation, not litigation.
<P>
	In the case of Delgamuukw v. Her Majesty for example, Judge 
Macfarlane wrote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Treaty making is the best way to respect Indian rights-.The questions of 
what aboriginal rights exist-cannot be decided in this case, and are ripe for 
negotiation.</BLOCKQUOTE>
The learned judge went on to observe:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>During the course of these proceedings, it became apparent that there are two 
schools of thought.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The first is an all or nothing approach, which says that the Indian nations 
were here first, that they have exclusive ownership and control of all the land 
and resources and may deal with them as they see fit.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The second is a co-existence approach, which says that the Indian interest and 
other interests can co-exist to a large extent, and that consultation and 
reconciliation is the process by which the Indian culture can be preserved and 
by which other Canadians may be assured that their interests, developed over 
125 years of nationhood, can also be respected-. I favour the second approach.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15615"> 15615 </A></B>
<P>
	I agree with the learned judge. I too favour the second approach. 
I am certain that members of the House would agree that the 
co-existence approach, based upon consultation and reconciliation, 
is the appropriate course. It is this government's course. It is the 
course preferred by the vast majority of Canadians and the vast 
majority of aboriginal people.
<P>
	We have undergone a turbulent summer of protest and pain. 
Issues which have been left unresolved for decades have erupted 
into violence. Negotiation, not confrontation, resolves issues. This 
legislation provides the framework for these negotiations in B.C. If 
we do not negotiate, we leave the field to those who believe in the 
all or nothing approach. We leave the resolution to those who have 
little regard for the law.
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	The B.C. Treaty Commission establishes a solid foundation for 
consultation and reconciliation. It lies at the heart of the 
co-existence approach. This legislation confirms the creation of the 
B.C. Treaty Commission as an arm's length body with a mandate to 
ensure the three parties are adequately prepared for the 
negotiations.
<P>
	Some members across the floor criticize the BCTC because they 
maintain it will concede too much to First Nations. They monger 
fear and misunderstanding by removing facts from the context. 
How many times on radio shows and at town hall meetings have 
they used the process of negotiations to instil suspicion and 
resentment in the hearts of British Columbians? How many times 
over the past few months have we heard that the First Nations of 
British Columbia claim 110 per cent of the province?
<P>
	The hon. members who raise these issues ought to know better. 
They know the claims overlap. They know they are simply opening 
positions that take into account the history of the various First 
Nations. They know the final solutions of these settlements will be 
very different from the opening positions. Yet they persist in 
stirring up fear and misunderstanding by repeating the 110 per cent 
figure as though it were an outrageous demand upon the common 
sense of the people of British Columbia. They claim the 
Government of Canada is ignoring other interests affecting 
negotiations. They spread misinformation.
<P>
	These hon. members are the kinds of people who themselves 
favour an all or nothing approach. They do not espouse the same 
cause as those described by Judge Macfarlane, the view that 
aboriginal people have exclusive ownership, but their philosophy is 
the same, all or nothing. They have no patience for reconciliation 
or consultation. Their approach will lead us inevitably to the 
confrontation and lawlessness that we witnessed in British 
Columbia over the past few months.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Irwin:</B> Mr. Speaker, I see I have their attention now.
<P>
	The role of the commission is to facilitate, not negotiate modern 
day treaties. Its main functions are to assess the readiness of the 
parties to begin negotiations, allocate and negotiate funding to 
aboriginal groups, assist parties to obtain dispute resolution 
services at the request of all parties, and monitor and report on the 
status of negotiations.
<P>
	This House will be pleased to hear that 47 First Nations groups 
are involved with the BCTC process. They represent over 70 per 
cent of the B.C. First Nations. Two First Nations, the Teslin and the 
Gitanyow, are about to complete the third stage of the negotiation 
process. Their framework agreements have been initialled by 
negotiators and I hope to be in a position to sign these agreements 
soon. Soon they will begin negotiating an agreement in principle.
<P>
	I have also had occasion to sign the Sechelt, the Gitxsan, the 
Wet'suwet'en, and the Champagne Aishihik transboundary claim 
framework agreements. This is significant progress and I would 
like to thank the negotiators for all parties for making it possible.
<P>
	We are well down the road of consultation and reconciliation that 
provides the foundation for a coexistence approach to settlement of 
land claims. I want to make one issue very clear, particularly to 
those members across the floor who would stir up misinformation 
and distrust. Our approach of consultation, reconciliation, and 
coexistence applies to all interested groups in British Columbia, 
not just the three parties at the negotiating table. Many different 
groups, organizations, and individuals have a major stake in how 
the land claim settlements are resolved. We are dealing after all 
with land and resources that provide the livelihood of British 
Columbians from many walks of life in all regions of the province.
<P>
	All British Columbians will benefit from seeing these 
longstanding issues resolved. The negotiations will remove the 
uncertainty that has held back development. Resolution opens the 
doors to new investment and jobs in the province.
<P>
<B>(1620 )</B>
<P>
	To ensure the negotiating process remains accessible to the 
public the openness protocol is negotiated for each treaty 
negotiation. A typical protocol will list specific measures the 
federal and provincial governments or the First Nations must take 
to an open and productive treaty process. These protocols keep the 
community and the media informed about what is happening at the 
negotiating table.
<P>
	As of June 15, 11 negotiations have completed the openness 
protocols. For the negotiations to be fair the voices of all interested 
British Columbians must be heard. We have launched a 
province-wide consultation process  to advise both the federal and 
provincial 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15616"> 15616 </A></B>
<P>
governments on the views of those who cannot be at the negotiating 
table but whose interests must be represented there.
<P>
	The process functions at two levels. A 31-member treaty 
negotiation advisory committee, TNAC, brings the perspective of 
municipal governments, business, labour, fishing, wildlife, and 
environmental groups to the treaty-making process. Each 
committee member sits on one of four sectoral groups representing 
lands and forests, fisheries, governance, and wildlife. The members 
ensure that the interests and expertise of their organizations are 
understood and are taken into consideration in treaty negotiations.
<P>
	I have met with these advisory committee members. So has our 
colleague, the hon. member for Vancouver East. The BCTC 
commissioners and the federal and provincial negotiating teams 
provide updates to the members on the process of negotiations.
<P>
	The second level of consultations brings the diverse interests of 
the various regions of the province to bear in the land claims 
process. Regional advisory committees are being struck in each 
treaty negotiation area to represent local interests. In fact as part of 
the land claims process the BCTC requires a regional advisory 
committee be struck before Canada and B.C. are declared ``ready to 
negotiate'' a treaty with First Nations. These committees work 
directly with federal and provincial negotiating teams by providing 
input on the formulation of interest and comments on the options 
for discussions at the negotiating table. For example, we have 
formed committees in Bulkley-Skeena, West Coast Vancouver 
Island, Westbank Kelowna, and the lower mainland.
<P>
	In the months ahead British Columbians will have an 
opportunity to participate in an historical process. They have the 
opportunity to correct an imbalance. For generations the people of 
British Columbia, aboriginal and non-aboriginal, have lived in a 
legal no-man's land of claims, conflicting claims, and refusal to 
acknowledge deep-seated historical wrongs.
<P>
	We are setting up a process whereby hundreds of years after the 
first interaction of two civilizations we can find a just and equitable 
resolution on how land and resources are to be shared. The all or 
nothing approach is not a solution for the 1990s. All parties, with 
good conscience, openness to new ideas, but with a new tough 
resolve to protect what is most important to each of us, must now 
sit at the negotiating table. We must talk. If we do not talk and if we 
do not resolve these issues through consultation and reconciliation 
we leave the field open to those who believe that the only 
resolution is all or nothing.
<P>
	I have maintained all along that self-government agreements 
work best when designed from the ground up with the input of the 
people they affect. Now is not the time for land claim settlements 
by government decree or constitutional amendment. Now is the 
time for creativity  and flexibility for modern treaty making. It will 
be a slow, painstaking process. It will require a great reservoir of 
goodwill among all parties in the negotiating process. The process 
is harmed immeasurably by the kind of fearmongering and 
controversy we have seen stirred up by those who want to score 
short-term political points.
<P>
	I am confident that the negotiation process will succeed in 
British Columbia. I am confident because I have been working with 
my provincial colleagues, with the leaders of the First Nations, and 
the members of the treaty negotiating advisory committee. I know 
that these are people of goodwill who are dedicated to reaching an 
equitable solution.
<P>
	Canadians and British Columbians must settle this unfinished 
business. I urge this House to support this legislation and give the 
federal commissioner the power to get on with the job.
<P>
<B>(1625 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harris:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order, considering that 
the government only presented the Reform members with this bill 
after 3 p.m. yesterday, which is in typical fashion, I would like to 
seek consent of the House if we may have the opportunity to 
question the minister about the bill.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> That is not a point of order. I think the 
correct thing for the member to do is wait until he speaks on behalf 
of his party. Then he might ask the minister, if the minister will 
permit with unanimous consent, some questions and answers. It is 
entirely a matter for unanimous consent of the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Irwin:</B> Mr. Speaker, we ended treaty at the Alberta border, 
and for 100 years we said we would come back and deal with these 
people who have lived there for 10,000 years.
<P>
	Succeeding governments have tried to and made movement to 
start a process. But when I walk through these doors, as we all must 
at some point in our lives, the one thing I will be proud of is that in 
October 1993 this government was elected and in December 1993 
the B.C. Treaty Commission doors were opened for negotiations.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ): </B>Mr. Speaker, of course 
Bloc Quebecois members will support Bill C-107.
<P>
	However there are a few concerns that should be addressed in the 
debate. Having always made a point of seeing for myself how 
aboriginal people live, I feel I am better able to speak, perhaps with 
a bit more assurance, about aboriginal issues, including the bill 
before us.
<P>
	As recently as last summer, I had the great privilege of visiting 
British Columbia and meeting with some aboriginal nations, some 
communities which were deeply concerned about the negotiation 
and the British Columbia Treaty Commission.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15617"> 15617 </A></B>
<P>
	Among others, I met with the Nisga'a nation, the main party 
to the negotiations in British Colombia. I had the extreme 
privilege of visiting, with Mr. Adams, five Nisga'a communities 
settled in an a marvelous area. A few hundred years ago, two 
Nisga'a communities were wiped off the map when a volcano 
erupted in that part of the country. Today the Nisga'a people revere 
the ruins of these ancient villages and are really anxious to reach 
an agreement.
<P>
	This is no exception to the usual attitude among the communities 
I met in British Columbia. Up to now, they always chose the path of 
negotiation in good faith rather than confrontation. Why do I 
mention the Nisga'a? Because, as I said in my opening remarks, I 
think they are at the centre of these negotiations. As you know the 
Nisga'a band is probably-in fact, it is-the only nation that is not 
under the umbrella of the British Columbia Treaty Commission 
because they had started their negotiations even before the 
commission was created, and the federal government recognized it.
<P>
	I will give a short overview of the commission's progress in a 
few moments. As a matter of fact, having begun to negotiate before 
any other band, the Nisga'a are they necessarily a length ahead the 
others now.
<P>
	However, they feel it is important for the negotiations to 
progress as fast as possible. Unfortunately, they are now blocked, 
both at the commission and with the Nisga'a.
<P>
	Speaking of concerns in this regard, both the Chilcotin band and 
the Carrier-Sekanni band I visited told me that, if the negotiations 
with the Nisga'a did not progress, the commission's efforts to 
negotiate agreements with nations and communities of British 
Columbia could grind to a halt. This is why I feel we should take an 
interest in what is happening to the Nisga'a, who right now are 
having a really bad time.
<P>
<B>(1630)</B>
<P>
	Personally, I witnessed the terrible devastation of the forest 
environment. A certain territory has been recognized as belonging 
to the Nisga'a as part of their ancestral land or aboriginal territory. 
We know what the terms ``aboriginal territory'' mean. The Nisga'a 
are asking for only 8 per cent of this territory recognized by the 
court.
<P>
	However, despite the fact that their claim is rather modest and 
reasonable, the Nisga'a are witnessing today the plundering of their 
forests. Between 100 and 200 trucks a day are taking away freshly 
cut logs. They are asking themselves: ``My God, are we ever going 
to come to an agreement to put an end to this plundering, and 
manage to protect our hunting and fishing rights recognized by the 
Canadian constitution?'' I have, in my office, videos which show 
the dreadful consequences of the clear cuts in British Columbia 
where, once the loggers have gone through, there is nothing left, 
neither  trees nor beasts. Very often, the damage is irreparable. 
Such forests will take hundreds of years to recover.
<P>
	In their opinion, had such forest been burned to the ground it 
would recover faster than it will in the present situation.
<P>
	It is a race to clear cut as much of the forest as possible, and the 
Chilcotin, the Carrier-Sekkani and the Nisga'a, have a feeling that 
governments are allowing this wanton destruction, this mad race 
for profit, this rush to clear cut everything. When it is all over, 
when all the resources are gone, they believe they will be told: 
``Now, we are ready to resume negotiations and we are willing to 
give you the territory'', a territory which will have been emptied, as 
I just said, of all its natural resources.
<P>
	The Nisga'a are extremely concerned. I even wrote to the 
premier of British Columbia, asking him to put an end to this 
plundering. As you know, British Columbia is a big province, as 
big as Quebec, if not bigger. You have to travel by plane to reach 
these native communities. One can see the damage done by logging 
companies through clear cutting.
<P>
	I take this opportunity to say that I, for one, find shocking this 
complete waste of a province's natural resources on what will 
probably be considered native lands, and recognized as such. We 
remain silent before the devastation, and the natives must wait for 
the negotiations to continue. In the meantime, they see that their 
lands keep deteriorating. It was worth mentioning, I think.
<P>
	I also noticed a general shortage of housing in the communities; 
several generations live under one roof. There are health problems.
<P>
	Finally, there is a pressing need to conclude treaties in British 
Columbia. I will talk about Quebec native communities later. In 
this regard, Quebec is a model. British Columbia would benefit 
from imitating the Quebec government, which has great respect for 
natives, in spite of what is reported in the media. I can assure you 
of the contrary, as I will demonstrate. I wish good luck to the 
people of British Columbia, hoping they will follow in Quebec's 
footsteps with regard to native peoples.
<P>
	Let me talk a little about the Chilcotin people from British 
Columbia, because they are very outspoken. Something funny 
happened. When I told them that the official opposition critic 
wished to meet them, it apparently created quite a commotion in 
the community. The fact that a nasty separatist from Quebec, even 
though a critic for Indian affairs and as such in a position to put 
questions regularly to the minister, wanted to come to talk with 
them about their problems made them rather uneasy. They were a 
little concerned. However I found them to be great people, and 
warriors. I call them ``warriors'' because the Chilcotin pride 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15618"> 15618 </A></B>
<P>
themselves in  having been the only native nation in Canada to have 
fought a war against white people and won.
<P>
<B>(1635)</B>
<P>
	As you know, all the natives in Canada say they might have 
fought wars, one side against the other, but in the case of the 
Chilcotin, it was definitely the case and they are proud of it. They 
even mentioned the names of warriors who took part in the battle. It 
was clear to them that the Chilcotin had defeated the white people 
who wanted to invade their territory, but of course they were unable 
to hold out for long after that first victory. From then on, there was 
a gradual invasion of their territory.
<P>
	Promises had been made to them at that time. It is worth noting 
that these were not necessarily agreements signed between the 
Prime Minister, Her Majesty the Queen and some representative of 
the natives. Even the courts are now beginning to recognize that the 
verbal agreements and commitments made at the time were legally 
binding, because natives were absolutely not able to 
understand-they needed translators to have white people's words 
translated into their language and white people needed translators 
to understand what the natives were saying. Thus verbal 
agreements were binding. Courts are beginning to recognize it.
<P>
	At that time, those natives were told: ``Listen, we recognize the 
Chilcotin nation, we recognize the Chilcotin Valley as your hunting 
and fishing grounds''. What happened to the Chilcotin has 
happened to many native communities in Canada.
<P>
	Over the years, over the decades, over the centuries, there has 
been a gradual invasion. Today this proud Chilcotin nation is 
reduced to six small communities on small reserves.
<P>
	To look at the population figures, I believe that since 1987 the 
population of these communities has doubled. Now the people are 
living in cramped reserves, threatened with prosecution by the pulp 
and paper and forest companies if they go off their reserve to hunt.
<P>
	There are huge problems, therefore, and the Chilcotin are 
impatiently waiting for the British Columbia treaty commission to 
get moving to ensure them of the few natural resources remaining 
to them.
<P>
	The same situation exists with housing. Sometimes there are 
three generations living under one roof. The Chilcotin would 
therefore like to see the negotiating process get not just started up 
but speeded up.
<P>
	Another example they spoke to me about, and one in which I 
have had to intervene, was that the military base in the Chilcotin 
valley is testing artillery on Chilcotin land. They have been trying 
without success for years to get this testing stopped.
<P>
	The situation is therefore this: overpopulated reserves, an 
inability to have any say about such vital issues as housing and the 
free disposal of property that ought to  be theirs, since they were the 
original inhabitants, an inability to have any effective impact on a 
military base which continues to pillage their natural resources. 
Needless to say, the Chilcotin are anxious to see the whole thing 
settled.
<P>
	They too have agreements, and this is where we see the sense of 
responsibility among the aboriginal nations. The Chilcotin have an 
agreement with Fisheries. Some twenty people are involved with 
fisheries, the salmon fisheries among others. Conservation is 
primary among the priorities set. The concept of conservation is 
assured.
<P>
	Then there is the concept of subsistence fishing, and thirdly there 
is commercial fishing. The Chilcotin have demonstrated that when 
they are given these responsibilities not only are they excellent 
conservationists but they can also obtain their food from 
subsistence fishing or hunting.
<P>
	There are many such examples, and there is great anticipation of 
the day when everything can all be translated into agreements. At 
the moment, unfortunately, everything is at a standstill.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	I will tell you a little later on where I think negotiations have 
stalled. I believe the federal government has a responsibility, but 
the Government of British Columbia also has a responsibility. I 
think both sides have to agree if there is to be any progress, because 
these aboriginal communities are ready to start negotiations, but 
we are now seeing obstruction on the part of the Government of 
British Columbia, and the federal government, instead of putting 
the pressure on to get things moving again, just sits there and says: 
``Well, I am going to wait until the Government of British 
Columbia pulls the switch and starts negotiating in good faith''.
<P>
	The trouble with the Premier of British Columbia is that when he 
came to power, with the NDP, he was very, very receptive to 
aboriginal issues. But recently, probably under pressure from the 
Reform Party, he is starting to say: ``Listen-''. They started by 
setting a deadline for the Nisga'a, and they said: ``If no agreement 
is reached by that date, the deal is off''. Of course the deadline 
passed and now all negotiations have been on hold since last 
summer.
<P>
	Because of growing support for the Reform Party in western 
Canada, the Harcourt government is backing down and 
unfortunately, it is not only backing down but, as I said earlier, it 
allows this wholesale destruction of natural resources to continue. 
Meanwhile, the aboriginal peoples have to watch this exodus of 
natural resources from their communities without being able to 
intervene.
<P>
	I also met the Carrier-Sekkani in Prince George. We had a very 
frank discussion about sovereignty. These aboriginal peoples, 
although they happen to be in British Columbia, 5,000 kilometres 
from Quebec, are concerned  about the economic and political 
status of their brothers and sisters in eastern Canada, and I am 
referring particularly to Quebec. We had a very good free ranging 
discussion about the sovereignty of Quebec, and I think the 
Carrier-Sekkani understood that the quality of life of aboriginal 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15619"> 15619 </A></B>
<P>
peoples in Quebec was clearly to be envied, compared with the 
quality of life of aboriginal peoples elsewhere.
<P>
	I think we agreed on that. We also agreed that Quebec was 
certainly not going to build the Berlin wall the day after 
sovereignty is proclaimed to prevent aboriginal peoples or the Inuit 
from maintaining their contacts with their brothers and sisters in 
Canada and elsewhere, including Antarctica and the United States. 
Those contacts already exist and will continue to do so.
<P>
	So, therefore, we each assured the other. They asked me as well, 
naturally, for support. They were very concerned about the British 
Columbia Treaty Commission. They said: ``You know, Mr. 
Bachand, the commission will never get off the ground so long as 
there is no progress in the negotiations with the Nisga'a''. If these 
negotiations blocked at the point they had reached, the others' 
negotiations at the first stage could almost certainly not be 
expected to catch up with the Nisga'as'. The Nisga'as are 20 years 
ahead of the other communities in their negotiations. Therefore the 
bill before us today is of major concern in British Columbia.
<P>
	I want to say in passing-I was talking about the Carrier-Sekani 
earlier-I would like, while we are before the cameras here, to 
salute Camille Joseph, elder of the Carrier-Sekani nation, who is 
well into his 90s. I simply sent him a congratulatory note, but I will 
take a moment during my speech to note it in passing, because I 
think it should be mentioned.
<P>
	The three communities I have just talked to you about are on the 
mainland. I went to the Island as well. The same concerns are to be 
found on Vancouver Island. Members of the Mid-Island Tribal 
Council expressed their concerns to me about the progress in the 
Nisga'a negotiations and the systematic blocking they are currently 
facing.
<P>
	I thought it important to situate the context of this bill's passage, 
a bit. There is nothing like speaking when one has been there 
personally and has met them and discussed all these questions with 
them, often over a number of hours. So I think it appropriate to 
mention it here. British Columbia is very rich in native culture.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	You know, as everywhere else, there are 200 reserves, 200 
communities there and whether the people are Chilcotin, Nisga'a, 
Haida or others, all these nations are different and even 
communities within the same nation differ from one another.
<P>
	Therefore, it is important to know. I went to the museum in 
Victoria, and the whole place, the complete  two story museum, is 
dedicated to relations between the white people and the aboriginal 
peoples. There we can see that the aboriginal peoples of British 
Columbia really had an impact on cultural values in that province.
<P>
	I will not hide the fact that there is some hostility now. It is true, 
but maybe it is because some people provoke that hostility. I can 
tell you that the natives feel no hostility whatsoever towards the 
white people. But they have been waiting for 150 years for issues to 
be settled, and it has not happened yet.
<P>
	It is important to realize, to see, and it is important that I can 
attest to the cultural impact of the native people and to their 
contribution to the life of the white people in British Columbia. 
You can see it in all the stores, the museums and the schools. The 
native culture is omnipresent, it has a direct impact on white and 
non aboriginal values and I think that, with the creation of this 
commission, time has come to make sure we reach an amicable 
agreement with the native people of that area, just as we are trying 
to do in Quebec where I think we are well on our way.
<P>
	According to my notes, Europeans have been present in British 
Columbia for 140 years now, and during that time, 14 treaties 
covering approximately 358 square miles on Vancouver Island 
were signed, involving the Hudson's Bay Company. Since 
Confederation, there has been only one treaty, in 1899; it is one of 
the numbered ones. In total, there are ten numbered treaties in 
Canada and that one is number eight; it covers the Peace River 
region and the northern part of Alberta.
<P>
	It is important to note that treaty negotiations have been essential 
for native peoples in British Columbia for the last 140 years. Their 
chiefs went to London to see the king. They regularly came to 
Ottawa, and went to the Court in London, to try to solve their 
problem, but to no avail. Worse yet, we, the non-natives, made 
serious mistakes concerning them, and British Columbia is no 
exception.
<P>
	Moreover, I have here some notes indicating that in 1927 and 
1951 they were prohibited from going to court. That meant that 
these people, who were trying to negotiate their land claims in good 
faith, could not even go to court when the negotiations appeared to 
be deadlocked. In spite of it all, native peoples have persevered, 
sometimes breaking the law, and today the situation is such that we 
have to find a solution. Of course, now they are allowed to go to 
court and, in British Columbia, things are following their course.
<P>
	I have a few examples here. In 1973, the six judges of the 
Supreme Court were split on whether to recognize native land 
titles; consequently, the federal government said: ``Listen, we have 
to settle this whole thing. We have to start negotiating''.
<P>
	In 1982, there was another turning point with the patriation of 
the constitution which, by the way, Quebec  did not sign, and never 
will after all, I believe. This constitution contained provisions 
dealing with native peoples; aboriginal rights and treaty rights were 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15620"> 15620 </A></B>
<P>
recognized; the last remnants of British colonialism crumbled, 
imperialist policies started to fall apart, and then, the injunctions 
preventing aboriginal peoples from going to court naturally 
became null and void.
<P>
	For the past 15 years, we have been trying again to find solutions 
through negotiations or through the courts, if negotiations are not 
possible.
<P>
	I believe that the decision we will make today when we pass 
C-107, will be a vindication of this long struggle and will enable us 
to finally put an end to a history of confrontation which has plagued 
British Columbia for the past 150 years.
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	There is also an history to the commission. There was a report 
from a task force on claims in British Columbia and the creation of 
the commission was discussed at that time. The creators of that 
commission had really identified the need to enter into treaties with 
the first nations. I quote from that report: ``that a new partnership 
be developed to recognize the importance of natives and first 
nations in Canada, based on voluntary negotiations well carried 
out, where natives, the provincial government and the federal 
government would be on an equal footing''.
<P>
	In September 1992, an agreement in principle was signed 
between the three authorities. This agreement implemented 19 
recommendations made by the task force I mentioned earlier, 
including recommendation No. 3 which, at the time, called for the 
creation of the British Columbia Treaty Commission that was set 
up a little later and that we will confirm, because the federal 
government had not yet confirmed its participation, although that 
was happening in practice.
<P>
	Today, or in the next few days, with the passing of Bill C-107, we 
will have confirmed the participation of the federal government in 
this issue.
<P>
	In the history of the commission, it is also important to mention 
that at the provincial level, it is only in 1993 that British Columbia 
got its Indian Affairs Department. That was long overdue, 
considering all the problems that exist in British Columbia. It was 
not long ago that the department was established. So, it is 
important today that we have a recognized department, a 
recognized minister in British Columbia, a counterpart of the 
federal minister to be able to thoroughly discuss the issues.
<P>
	The First Nations Summit would also be a principal to the 
commission. The first nations have given themselves a negotiation 
tool called the Summit, which is part of the agreements leading to 
the commission. This Summit is very active and several of the 
groups that I was mentioning earlier are participants in the Summit 
and  defend the interests of natives, which will lead, they hope, to 
treaties.
<P>
	How does this work? There are six different steps in the process. 
I think that it is important to follow the course of these steps. The 
first stage consists in submitting a declaration of intent to 
negotiate. I will get back to this later on. Forty or so first nations 
have already done so.
<P>
	The second stage is the stage at which negotiation arrangements 
are made, first meetings held and evaluations conducted to 
determine if the first nations are prepared to negotiate. A first 
meeting takes place, where one group asks the other: ``Are you 
ready to negotiate? How soon can we start?'', and so on. A number 
of first nations, of whom I wanted to give you the list, are already at 
stage 2.
<P>
	Stage 3 is the negotiation of a master agreement. The further 
along I get into this process, the less progress is made on these 
issues in terms of first nations's participation.
<P>
	Stage 4 is the negotiation of an agreement in principle; stage 5, 
the negotiation of a definitive treaty; and stage 6, the 
implementation of the definitive treaty.
<P>
	I told you that 43 first nations were taking part in the process. To 
date, 14 claims have passed stage 1. No individual group has gone 
further than stage 3 at this point in time. It should be noted however 
that the Nisga'as have taken an approach to negotiations that is 
different from the normal approach used by the commission. The 
Nisga'as negotiated for 27 years just to get to the equivalent of 
stage 3. Unfortunately, and I must digress here to say this, 
negotiations have stopped since.
<P>
	As I indicated earlier, when the BC premier was elected, he said 
that the issue had to be settled. Finally, they agreed to set up the 
commission. Now, we can see that, with a provincial election 
impending in British Columbia, the premier is backtracking on his 
promises. The result is stalled negotiations with the Nisga'as, 
which in turn stalls the entire negotiation process with the other 
first nations of British Columbia.
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	Let us now turn to Quebec. We should wish to the BC first 
nations that their negotiations can eventually reach as advanced a 
stage as was reached in negotiations with their Quebec 
counterparts. Unlike British Columbia, Quebec has been signing 
modern treaties for the past 20 years, including the famous James 
Bay Agreement.
<P>
	Twenty years ago, the Crees, the federal government and the 
Quebec government signed this historical agreement, which has 
become a standard agreement for the rest of Canada. More 
accurately, any time first nations seemed to be on the verge of 
achieving self-government or asked the federal government and  
their respective provincial government: ``Could you spare a piece 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15621"> 15621 </A></B>
<P>
of jurisdiction that we could take over?'', the James Bay 
Agreement was quoted as a reference.
<P>
	As far as I am concerned, it is still a reference, and just to show 
you how open-minded Quebecers are, they are now saying: ``Even 
if we are always leading the way, under the present circumstances, 
we agree with the Crees on the need to update the James Bay 
Agreement model''. This goes to show how open-minded 
Quebecers are concerning first nations and how far they are ready 
to go to meet native claims in Quebec.
<P>
	I have some statistics before me that I should share with you 
because they come from the assistant to the Minister of Indian 
Affairs, Professor Bradford Morse, who, in a study he submitted to 
the task force, gives examples of a new constitutional partnership. 
As recently as 1992, Professor Morse wrote on the subject of land 
claims that Quebec was the first Canadian province to accept the 
continuity of aboriginal titles and to recognize them by trying to 
negotiate land claim settlements. Professor Morse concluded that, 
compared with the other provinces, Quebec has adopted a 
comprehensive position that can be seen as much more favourable 
to aboriginal people and their rights over their traditional lands.
<P>
	I think that Professor Morse thus recognizes that the people of 
Quebec are ahead on land claims. They are so much ahead that, 
when this study was done, we had already concluded the model 
agreement I referred to earlier, the James Bay Agreement. 
However, the proposal that has just been made to the 
Attikamek-Montagnais was not yet on the table. This proposal 
would recognize what we call native areas, over which native 
people will have full jurisdiction. We will negotiate an agreement 
with them on how to divide the territory, over which they will have 
complete freedom with regard to, among other things, joint 
management of natural, non-renewable and other resources.
<P>
	As far as these native areas are concerned, our proposal to the 
Attikamek-Montagnais even provides for a 40,000 square 
kilometre buffer zone, which we have agreed to share with the 
Attikamek-Montagnais. This shows once again that Quebec is in 
the vanguard of the drive to improve living conditions for Canada's 
native people.
<P>
	On the question of self-government, Professor Morse goes on to 
say that, of all provincial governments, Quebec is the one that did 
the most to accommodate the desire of native people to exert more 
control over their lives and their community affairs.
<P>
	The James Bay Agreement recognizes whole areas of 
jurisdiction that now come under the exclusive control of the Cree. 
These areas include culture, education and health. Instead of telling 
native people that they must go to all-white hospitals, follow the 
department's educational programs and comply with the directives  
from Environment Canada, the James Bay Agreement has put 
whole areas of jurisdiction under Cree control, and I think it is 
important to point this out.
<P>
<B>(1700)</B>
<P>
	The same goes for the language component. I just talked about 
culture, which is often closely related to language. Indeed, we 
Quebecers have known for a long time that our culture and our 
language are closely intertwined. We recognized that was also the 
case for aboriginal peoples. In that regard, it is rather interesting to 
see that, for several years now, the Supreme Court has been 
targeting Quebec's charter of the French language, Bill 101. Yet, 
that legislation must stay, and I want to tell you about some of its 
more interesting provisions. Quebec's charter expressly recognizes 
the right of aboriginals, Indians and Inuit to protect and develop 
their own language and culture.
<P>
	The fact that Bill 101 even includes provisions which protect 
aboriginal languages in our province is an indication of how open 
minded Quebecers are.
<P>
	This explains why, as professor wrote, aboriginal people in 
Quebec are much more successful in terms of preserving their 
language than those who live elsewhere in Canada. This is a 
perfectly normal and accepted way of doing things in Quebec 
where, for a long time now, young Crees have been taking Cree 
language classes with their own school board, while young 
Montagnais do the same in Pointe-Bleue or elsewhere.
<P>
	It must be emphasized that Quebecers have always attached a 
great deal of importance to aboriginal cultures. We recognize the 
fact that aboriginals were here before us. We also recognize the fact 
that they have given us enormous wealth. In order to keep whole 
segments of these societies from disappearing, Quebecers strongly 
encourage the protection of aboriginal languages and cultures.
<P>
	Incidentally, a while ago, Mrs. Beaudoin, the Quebec minister of 
intergovernmental affairs, submitted a claim to the federal 
government, which has not yet acted on it. As you know, the James 
Bay agreement deals with the sharing of costs relating to Crees and 
Naskapis. There is the James Bay agreement, but there is also the 
Northeastern Quebec agreement, which primarily concerns 
Naskapis.
<P>
	Under that agreement, Quebec pays 25 per cent of the costs 
related to Crees and Naskapis, while the federal government pays 
for the rest. In the case of the Inuit, the proportions are reversed. 
However, some changes have occurred since 1987 regarding the 
sharing of these costs. Since that year, the birth rate among Crees 
has increased tremendously. Consequently, there are many more 
children attending school.
<P>
	A special effort was made to develop education programs for 
adults. There is an increased demand for specialized education, 
including for young Cree children  with special needs. The Quebec 
government pays for that component in the case of non aboriginal 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15622"> 15622 </A></B>
<P>
children, but there is an increased demand up there, and we must 
provide the additional services required.
<P>
	For some time, there was no problem with the federal 
government concerning the payment of these costs each year. Since 
1987, however, the government has changed its way of doing 
things. It wants to index its contribution to the annual inflation rate 
and sticks to this rate instead of abiding by the provisions of the 
James Bay agreement which were negotiated in good faith by the 
federal government, Quebec as well as the Crees, the Naskapi and 
the Inuit.
<P>
	Unfortunately, for the Quebec government, this meant a loss of 
$199 million in income. What did it do? It could easily have said to 
the young Crees, as some provinces did to other native groups: 
``Look, since the federal government, which has the fiduciary 
responsibility for the fees incurred on the reserves, is not paying its 
share, we are no longer able to financially support education for the 
young Crees, under the James Bay agreement. Tell them that some 
children will not be able to go to school this year''.
<P>
	I said earlier that the same thing goes on elsewhere in the United 
States. The people covered by the Treaty No. 7 in central Canada 
are being told that they can forget about post-secondary education. 
``We cannot send your children to school this year, because we ran 
out of money''.
<P>
<B>(1705)</B>
<P>
	We could have done the same thing in Quebec, but the Quebec 
government met its responsibilities and took upon itself to foot the 
bill. Now, it is asking the federal government, the current Liberal 
government, to pay its share. I must say that I think it is unfortunate 
that the claim made by the government of Quebec has not been 
settled. We are talking about $199 million. It cannot just be 
shrugged off.
<P>
	Professor Morse, an assistant to the Indian affairs minister, also 
says that Quebec has shown great leadership in promoting 
economic development. There are some economic development 
provisions in the James Bay agreement where it is recognized that 
significant compensation must be paid to the native communities 
following the construction of hydro-electric dams, and that was 
done. Their hunting, trapping and fruit-picking rights were also 
recognized. We are also leaders in economic development.
<P>
	Furthermore, there is a happy combination of traditional 
activities, like hunting and fishing, and marketing. It is also worth 
mentioning that there are local outfitting operations managed by 
natives.
<P>
	In health care, we see the same thing. The Quebec government is 
the leader. Natives in Quebec are in much better health than their 
counterparts in the rest of Canada.
<P>
	Finally, I hope for the benefit of British Columbia natives that 
the federal government will adopt Bill C-107 and will go further 
and use its influence and its fiduciary role to force the Harcourt 
government to go back to the negotiating table. I also hope that the 
negotiations concerning the Nisga'as will be resumed and that the 
participation of the federal government as a party in the British 
Columbia Treaty Commission will be accepted so that natives in 
that province can one day benefit from as much generosity as 
natives in Quebec.

	<B>Ms. Bridgman:</B> Mr. Speaker, a request has been made by the

she has commitments tomorrow. I have no problem with that.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Everything is possible with unanimous

<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We could proceed this way with unanimous consent.
<P>

	It would be understood, presumably, that the hon. member for 
Vancouver East would speak today for 20 minutes with a 10-minute 
question and answer period and that the Reform Party 
representative would have 40 minutes without a question and 
answer period the next time the matter comes up for debate.
<P>
	Is there unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Anna Terrana (Vancouver East, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the hon. member for Surrey North for allowing me to speak.

<P>
	The bill before us marks the culmination of a long and at times 
difficult struggle. It is born of British Columbia's unique history. It 
is the product of many years of hard work and goodwill. Fairness, 
clarity and justice are not issues of party politics. They are 
elements of principles which we all share as Canadians.
<P>
	Over the decades many people have played a part: people from 
various parties and political ideologies, people who shared little in 
common except a desire to see justice done and to get on with 
building a brighter future for British Columbia.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15623"> 15623 </A></B>
<P>
	To understand why in 1995 we are still talking about negotiating 
treaties we need to look to our history. Unlike most other 
provinces where treaties were signed to clarify jurisdiction over 
land and resources and forge new relationships between First 
Nations and the newcomers to this great land few were ever 
concluded in British Columbia. As a result some 124 years after 
becoming a province, the key question of unextinguished 
aboriginal rights remains unresolved and the majority of the 
province remains subject to outstanding aboriginal land claims.
<P>
	Few treaties were signed because of the position historically 
taken by the Government of British Columbia. From the late 1800s 
the position was that aboriginal rights had been extinguished prior 
to B.C.'s entry into Confederation in 1871 or, if these rights did 
exist, they were the exclusive responsibility of the federal 
government.
<P>
<B>(1710)</B>
<P>
	In 1990 under the leadership of Premier Vander Zalm, a Socred, 
B.C. reversed its longstanding position and the way was opened to 
resolving these issues.
<P>
	I think it only fair to point out that one of the key players in 
convincing the provincial government to reverse its historic 
opposition to negotiating treaties was the then B.C. minister of 
native affairs, Mr. Jack Weisgerber. I know that many of my 
Reform Party friends would recognize Mr. Weisgerber's name. One 
of the early and enthusiastic architects of this process, Mr. 
Weisgerber now leads the provincial Reform Party in British 
Columbia.
<P>
	Following on the heels of the B.C. government's decision, the 
Government of Canada and the B.C. government acted quickly to 
advance the process. Later the same year the federal Minister of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development, the hon. Tom Siddon, 
along with Mr. Weisgerber and Bill Wilson, chairman of the First 
Nations Congress, agreed to establish a task force to make 
recommendations on the mandate and process for treaty 
negotiations.
<P>
	By June 1991 the B.C. claims task force had released its report. 
One of its key recommendations was the creation of an arm's 
length B.C. treaty commission.
<P>
	In the 10 months that followed, representatives of Canada, B.C. 
and the First Nations summit negotiated the B.C. treaty 
commission agreement which was the blueprint for the 
commission. On September 21, 1992, Prime Minister Brian 
Mulroney, Indian Affairs Minister Tom Siddon, both 
Conservatives, B.C. Premier Mike Harcourt and native affairs 
minister Andrew Petter, both New Democrats, joined with the First 
Nations summit leadership in signing the B.C. treaty commission 
agreement. We had all the parties on board.
<P>
	In the three years since, the commission has made great 
progress. If there was ever any doubt that the commission was 
necessary, one need only look at the response it has had for the 
aboriginal population of British Columbia.
<P>
	To date, 49 first nation groups representing 79 per cent of B.C.'s 
aboriginal peoples have submitted a statement of intent to 
negotiate. One of the terms of the agreement creating the treaty 
commission was a commitment to establish it in the legislation. In 
May 1993 both the aboriginal summit and the province fulfilled 
their part of that commitment.
<P>
	Now the time has come for the federal government to honour its 
part of the bargain. These then are the events which have led us to 
this legislation and to this debate. I welcome all members to this 
great partnership.
<P>
	Across the years and across party lines people have joined hands 
in a common cause. It is their vision and determination that we 
celebrate and formalize today. Their cause was simple: the desire to 
bring justice to aboriginal people and certainty to their province.
<P>
	The costs of that uncertainty has been high. In a Price 
Waterhouse study prepared in 1990 it was estimated that $1 billion 
in investment had not occurred because of unresolved land claims. 
Three hundred badly needed jobs had not been created and $125 
million in capital investments had not been made. Yesterday we 
had the mining industry in town and they were talking to me about 
the same problem.
<P>
	Since the time of that study the price has continued to be paid 
year in and year out. That has been the price of denying the 
problem or pretending it would go away. That is the price of the 
status quo for the people of British Columbia. It is a price we can 
no longer afford. With the passage of this legislation we will be on 
the way to no longer having to pay.
<P>
	But, if the price has been high for the general population of B.C., 
for aboriginal people it has been far higher. For aboriginal people it 
has meant great hardships and shattering poverty. It has meant the 
denial of historic rights and future hopes. It has meant generations 
of dreams deferred and promises unkept. It has meant a quality of 
life few of us can imagine and none of us should tolerate.
<P>
	Conditions are appalling. Almost a third of aboriginal homes on 
reserves lack running water. Diseases such as hepatitis and 
tuberculosis virtually eradicated in the non-native population 
persist in aboriginal communities. Death from fires are three and a 
half times the non-aboriginal level because of unsafe housing and 
lack of proper sanitation.
<P>
<B>(1715 )</B>
<P>
	Aboriginal people are more than three times as likely to die a 
violent death and about twice as likely to die before age 65. The 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15624"> 15624 </A></B>
<P>
suicide rate among aboriginal people is 50 per cent higher than 
among non-aboriginal people.  That difference is even more 
pronounced in the age group of 15 to 25.
<P>
	This country can simply not afford to lose another generation of 
aboriginal people able and willing to make a contribution to this 
country. The young aboriginal people of today can be our 
professionals, our trades people, our inventors of tomorrow. They 
represent our past and our future. If we lose them it will be an 
incredible waste.
<P>
	We cannot afford to continue to condemn aboriginal peoples to 
lesser lives in lesser lands. We cannot afford to judge any longer. 
We must start facilitating a process that is indispensable.
<P>
	In my riding of Vancouver East I have one of the largest 
aboriginal urban communities in the country. It is an active 
community. Its members are engaged in bettering their situation by 
making everybody aware of their past and their plight. In 
Vancouver East there is the Aboriginal Friendship Centre and the 
Native Education Centre which help us understand them.
<P>
	The people of B.C. have told their government to get on with it, 
to negotiate fair and just agreements which protect the rights of 
both aboriginal and non-aboriginal people alike, and the sooner the 
better.
<P>
	We must do it in an organized manner and this is what the B.C. 
Treaty Commission has been doing and will continue to do. It 
wants to establish a stable economic climate which in turn will help 
to bring in investments, dollars and opportunities for all British 
Columbians and bring peace to our forests, our waters, our lands.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	My colleague from the Bloc has explained very well how 
important aboriginal peoples are in British Columbia and I thank 
him. I also want to say that native peoples are very important to our 
culture, our past and our future in B.C. In fact, they are an 
extremely important part of the history of British Columbia, which, 
as you know, Mr. Speaker, is a wonderful part of Canada, where 
aboriginal peoples, anglophones, francophones and other 
communities from around the world all live in harmony.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In 1993, speaking in favour of the legislation creating the treaty 
commission, Jack Weisgerber recounted his experience in 1989 as 
a member of the premier's advisory council on native affairs: ``It 
became clear to us as we travelled and met with groups around the 
province that if we were going to address the root of the social and 
economic problems we had to deal with the land claim question''.
<P>
	Those are wise words from a man who now leads the Reform 
Party in British Columbia, words echoed by members of all parties 
in the British Columbia legislature when that great body passed its 
own enabling legislation;  words I commend to my friends across 
the floor today, words which we now have the opportunity to 
honour through our actions.
<P>
	The history of this legislation is a story of partnerships between 
cultures, between political parties, between generations. Let us 
continue in that same spirit of partnership now as we open the way 
for a brighter future for all British Columbians and a prouder day 
for all Canadians.
<P>
	We have already waited too long. We should have settled this 
problem long ago. We now must ensure peace and harmony with 
our aboriginal brothers and sisters by working with them on the 
settlement of their land claims and on their needs.
<P>
	In the last two years we have done a lot of work and with 
everybody's co-operation we will be able to solve a long and 
overdue problem and ensure peace and certainty in British 
Columbia.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robert D. Nault (Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Labour, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have the 
opportunity to rise in support of Bill C-107 and in support of the 
comments made by the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development.
<P>
	Bill C-107 creates the legal framework for the British Columbia 
Treaty Commission to act as an arm's length body and facilitate 
treaty negotiations with British Columbia's First Nations.
<P>
<B>(1720 )</B>
<P>
	I support the creation of the commission and its mandate. As 
hon. members are aware, very few of the First Nations in B.C. have 
ever signed treaties with the crown. In lower Vancouver Island 
several First Nations signed treaties with Governor Douglas in the 
mid-1800s. By the end of the 19th century the Peace River district 
was included in treaty number 8 signed with the federal 
government. Obviously it is well known to people from B.C., 
although it may not be known by other people in Canada, that was 
the last one. There have been no treaties signed in this century.
<P>
	In recent years the Nisga'a Tribal Council has been actively 
negotiating with the federal and provincial governments. When 
those negotiations are complete and an agreement is signed it will 
be the first treaty with a B.C. First Nation signed this century, and 
we are almost in the next century.
<P>
	The people of B.C. want to enter the 21st century knowing we 
have completed the unfinished business of the 19th century. The 
land claims of B.C. First Nations have to be resolved. Some people 
would ask why. Resolving these issues creates an environment of 
certainty which means economic growth and job creation. Settling 
land and resource issues creates the environment needed for 
increased investment and local economic activity.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15625"> 15625 </A></B>
<P>
	In recent years real progress has been made toward resolving 
100-year old unfinished business. In 1990 Ottawa, B.C. and the 
leaders of B.C.'s First Nations established a task force to 
recommend a negotiation process that could accommodate the 
numerous First Nations in B.C. that want to negotiate settlements.
<P>
	The task force presented 19 recommendations in June, 1991, all 
of which were all accepted by the First Nations summit and the 
federal and provincial governments, a major achievement in itself. 
One of the key recommendations was to establish the British 
Columbia Treaty Commission as an arm's length minder of the 
process. The agreement committed the three partners to establish 
the BCTC through federal an provincial legislation and a resolution 
of the First Nations summit. In the meantime commissioners have 
been appointed by order in council and summit resolutions. They 
began their work in December, 1993 and have made considerable 
progress.
<P>
	As a member of Parliament who represents 46 First Nations 
communities I can tell from firsthand experience of the importance 
of having a process to deal with longstanding grievances and issues 
of specific land claims and, more important, in B.C.'s case of 
treaties that have never been signed. It is a major undertaking of 
tremendous importance, probably more important than anything 
the B.C. government will have done in the term of its involvement 
over the past number of years.
<P>
	There are 47 First Nations involved in the BCTC process to date. 
They represent over 70 per cent of the First Nations of the province 
and more are likely to become involved soon. The BCTC has five 
commissioners. Two are nominated by the First Nations summit, 
one by the B.C. government and one by Ottawa. The chief 
commissioner is selected and appointed by consensus of all three 
partners.
<P>
	The First Nations summit includes all B.C. First Nations that 
have agreed to participate in the BCTC process. It provides a forum 
for those First Nations to meet and discuss treaty negotiations. It 
worked closely with Ottawa and the provinces to develop the treaty 
negotiation process and to establish the BCTC. As one of the 
partners in the process it continues to provide direction.
<P>
	In Kenora-Rainy River, no different than in B.C., we have our 
treaties: treaty 3, treaty 9 and treaty 5. The minister responsible for 
Indian and northern affairs has also undertaken some significant 
changes to the lives of First Nations people and has tried to 
improve the affairs of individual communities by getting involved 
and trying to deal with First Nations and specific land claims.
<P>
<B>(1725 )</B>
<P>
	From firsthand experience, in order for us to get involved in 
what is most important, the next generation, the economics and the 
social well-being of First Nations  for the years to come, these land 
claims and these processes must work.
<P>
	To get into the next century with some hope and aspiration for 
the young First Nation people not only in my riding but across the 
country and in B.C. we will have to assure them the grievances of 
the past will be rectified in order to get on with the future.
<P>
	I, like many others who represent First Nations, have had 
roadblocks. I have had First Nations people tell me they are 
frustrated and fed up. They are not willing to wait much longer. 
They no longer want the federal or provincial governments to sit on 
their hands while they wait for a miracle. They would like that 
process to start.
<P>
	I take this opportunity to tell the House, the people of 
Kenora-Rainy River and the people of B.C. that they can thank 
the government and the minister responsible for moving an agenda 
which from the last term was basically stalled or going in reverse. 
We are now starting to see some significant improvement for all the 
hard work and efforts of not only the Minister of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development but the chiefs and councils of the First 
Nations.
<P>
	B.C. will be dealing with a six stage treaty. In this negotiation 
process the stages something like this: a statement of intent; 
preparation for negotiations; negotiation of a framework 
agreement; negotiation of agreement in principle; treaty 
finalization; treaty implementation.
<P>
	The commission will assess the readiness of parties to negotiate. 
This involves ensuring the First Nations have the resources needed 
to make their case and ensuring the federal and provincial 
governments have struck regional advisory committees so that the 
local non-aboriginal residents have a voice.
<P>
	This brings me to a very important point and the obvious wisdom 
of the positions of the government and the First Nations of the 
involvement and the voice of non-aboriginal residents. I will use an 
example of a community in my riding which is over 50 per cent 
aboriginal. Sioux Lookout is thought by a lot of people to be a 
non-aboriginal community but it does have a lot of aboriginal 
people. It would like to participate when we get involved in 
specific land claim policies and negotiations with First Nations so 
that when the agreements are made there is a recognition that all of 
us, native and non-native, will be able to live with the results.
<P>
	Therefore it is very important that advisory committees are set 
up with local non-aboriginal residents to give them a voice so we 
can be assured that in the end the agreements we get will be a 
win-win situation and not win-lose or lose-win.
<P>
	I commend again the individuals who put in this process in B.C. 
because with it I think the results will be much longer lasting than 
if this process did not have non-aboriginal people in it.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="15626"> 15626 </A></B>
<P>
	These regional committees in B.C. are part of an extensive 
commitment to keep the public and all other affected parties 
informed of developments and to make sure that advice from all 
sectors of B.C. society are considered. Other efforts include news 
letters, public meetings, an 800 number, speaking engagements, 
information brochures, other publications and participation in 
trade shows.
<P>
	The BCTC also allocates loans to enable First Nations to fully 
participate in the process. In other words, it works in partnership 
with all parties to ensure that the job gets done properly.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am sorry to interrupt the hon. 
parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Labour, but he will have 
10 minutes remaining the next time the matter is called.
<P>
	It now being 5.30 p.m., the House will proceed to consideration 
of private members' business as listed on today's Order Paper.

	The House resumed from June 20, 1995, consideration of the 
motion that, in the opinion of this House, the government should 
support the undertaking of a country-wide program of improving 
the treatment of municipal sewage to a minimum standard of at 
least that of primary treatment facilities, and of the amendment of 
Mrs. Guay.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernard St-Laurent (Manicouagan, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
is with great interest that I rise today to debate Motion M-425 
brought forward by the member for Comox-Alberni. In this 
motion, my colleague proposes that the water we use be treated at 
the primary level instead of being discharged directly into the 
environment, as is the case today.
<P>
	In developed and industrialized regions, pollution has altered the 
natural quality of this valuable resource. Because of growing 
urbanization and because of the obvious inadequacy of our sewage 
treatment facilities, we have to worry about the quality of the large 
quantity of water we consume daily.
<P>
	Not only is water a necessity of life, but it also contributes to our 
quality of life. I am very aware of this fact when I look at my 
riding, the riding of Manicouagan, that borders the Gulf of St. 
Lawrence. Water is the principal driving force in my region. This 
natural resource has attracted several industries employing a large 
number of workers to this area.
<P>
	Unlike many other vital resources, water has no substitute in 
most of the activities and processes where it  is required, both in 
industry and in nature. Yet, despite its increasing scarcity and 
despite the fact that, over the last few years, we have become aware 
of the seriousness of the water pollution problem, we have not 
taken the necessary measures to deal with it.
<P>
	Everyone agrees that our current sewage treatment systems will 
have to be modernized. I support the motion brought forward by 
the member for Comox-Alberni because it is clear that our waste 
water needs a minimum amount of treatment. We cannot go on 
thinking that we can discharge sewage directly into our lakes and 
rivers without harming the environment.
<P>
	Sewage treatment systems are essential to the social and 
economic functioning of modern communities. The major part of 
polluted waste found in water comes from sewage and municipal 
sewage treatment installations and from numerous industries which 
use those installations to dispose of their waste.
<P>
	In the last ten years or so, the growing awareness of 
environmental issues has sparked considerable interest for the 
protection of waterways. Provinces and municipalities have 
therefore been spending tremendous amounts of money to develop 
protection programs for those resources. Motion M-425 proposes a 
national program. Yet, it has always been clear that municipalities 
are responsible for providing drinking water, sewage treatment and 
waste disposal services.
<P>
	The motion proposes federal interference in a provincial 
jurisdiction, which is of course totally unacceptable for the Bloc 
Quebecois. I wonder if the author of this motion is aware of the 
danger of allowing the federal government to impose its own 
standards on municipalities.
<P>
	Motion M-425 proposes that the federal government establish a 
nationwide program of improving the treatment of municipal 
sewage to the point of meeting a minimum national standard. In the 
area of environment, the federal government has always had a 
tendency to centralize power in Ottawa, supposedly because of the 
national interest the need to modernize environmental programs.
<P>
	Yet, under the constitution, environment is not explicitly the 
jurisdiction of one level of government more than another.
<P>
<B>(1735)</B>
<P>
	The courts have declared it what is termed an ancillary power, 
derived from the areas of jurisdiction allocated to each 
government. Even before the mid-eighties the government of 
Quebec, which has exclusive jurisdiction over matters of a local or 
territorial nature, played a lead role in environmental matters, an 
area over which it was for the most part responsible.
<P>
	The federal government was satisfied at that time, as set out in 
the constitution, with intervening in  complementary areas. It was 
only in later years that it began to interfere in environmental 
matters. As soon as that happened, duplication and overlap began 
to crop up increasingly, moreover. This has been perpetuated and 
<P>

<B><A NAME="15627"> 15627 </A></B>
<P>
aggravated since the election of the present Liberal government, 
which is attempting to centralize decision making in Ottawa, with 
all due deference to my colleague from 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell. The truth is not always easy to 
hear, but there you are.
<P>
	It is becoming increasingly obvious that the present government, 
regardless of what it says, is seeking to centralize and concentrate 
power in Ottawa still further. Under a federal regime, there must of 
necessity be a division of areas of jurisdiction. In Canada, however, 
such a division often leads to inefficiency. At this very moment, 
there is a need for the federal government to enter into 
administrative agreements with the provinces. The current 
situation simply clouds the issue and makes it extremely difficult to 
identify who is really responsible if a policy does not bring results. 
Are we to blame the federal government, the author of the 
standards, or the provincial government, which may have been 
remiss in implementing those standards?
<P>
	Since Canada maintains that it has jurisdiction over some areas 
of the environment because of the so-called national interest, this 
means it is in a position to enter into international agreements and 
to find global solutions along with its partners. Why then could the 
provinces not do the same with each other and with a sovereign 
Quebec?
<P>
	The inefficiency of a system in which responsibility is not 
clearly identified lies in wasted energy due to duplication and is 
certainly not any guarantee of sustainable development. In fact, 
under the current federal system it would be unthinkable to 
guarantee any kind of sustainable development, since the 
government in Ottawa seems to have an abiding tendency to 
centralize powers and to interfere with matters that are the sole 
responsibility of the provinces.
<P>
	Although Quebec recognizes the very real concern we should 
have for the environment, it is not prepared to let the federal 
government once again intrude in an area over which it has no 
jurisdiction. Responsibility for municipal sewage lies clearly with 
the provinces and the municipalities.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois will vote against this motion, not because it 
is against protecting the environment, and I would like to say that 
we appreciate the good intentions of the hon. member for 
Comox-Alberni. As I said, the Bloc would vote against the 
motion, and it will do so not because it is against protecting the 
environment but rather because it believes that the environment is 
better protected when each government deals with the problems for 
which it is responsible, so that it can set priorities that make sense 
and as a result be truly effective.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I too am pleased to participate this afternoon in this debate 
on Motion M-425.
<P>
	Notwithstanding what we just heard-and I am not sure that the 
motion has this much importance in a sense-I must say that the 
remarks that were just made do not reflect what I would call the 
truth.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	First, the motion before the House says that the government 
should support the undertaking-it says support, it does not say 
establish it themselves-support the undertaking of a country-wide 
program of improving the treatment of municipal sewage to a 
minimum standard of at least that of primary treatment facilities. 
The motion does not even talk about establishing one national 
standard, as was alleged by the hon. member from the Bloc 
Quebecois. Second, it is totally false to allege that it does anything 
else, which the member has also indicated.
<P>
<B>(1740)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Second, there is an amendment, and I wonder whether it is really 
in order. It must be in order if the Chair accepted it. I must tell you 
that this amendment has no connection with the main issue, since it 
deals with a right for all provinces to financial compensation. One 
has nothing to do with the other.
<P>
	The motion simply calls upon the federal government to support 
certain initiatives to guarantee a minimum level of waste water 
treatment. That is all this motion is about.
<P>
	Once again, today, the Bloc Quebecois was caught in this House 
making things up and stretching the truth to an incredible extent.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Sir Winston Churchill once said that the opposite to the truth had 
never been stated with greater accuracy. I guess one could apply 
that to the speech the House just heard with respect to what the 
intention of the motion really is.
<P>
	I want to speak a bit about the infrastructure program. We get 
mixed messages from Reform MPs on infrastructure. The motion 
by the hon. member for Comox-Alberni invites the federal 
government to support infrastructure programs concerning sewers 
and the like. I have to admit that we have been getting mixed 
messages from Reform Party MPs on that subject. Come to think of 
it, we have been getting mixed messages from the Reform Party on 
just about every issue.
<P>
	I have an editorial from the Ottawa <I>Citizen</I>, the valley edition, of 
August 14, 1994, which speaks of the Reform Party position on 
infrastructure. It is entitled ``Reform Sings the Blues'' and states 
that ``The Reform Party  seems to have changed its tune after 
advocating the nurturing of infrastructure before the election''.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="15628"> 15628 </A></B>
<P>
	It works something like this. Before the election the Reform 
Party was in favour of ameliorating the infrastructure and of the 
federal government supporting it. After the election Reformers 
started criticizing this. You might ask what is wrong with that, after 
all, they are Reformers and it should be expected that they will 
contradict themselves every now and then. That might be true, but 
there is a certain limit beyond which it becomes odd, even for 
Reformers.
<P>
	We have the spectacle of the hon. member for Simcoe Centre. 
That is a spectacle if I ever saw one. He wrote a letter regarding an 
infrastructure program in his riding. I want all my colleagues to 
know it was a coincidence that it was in his riding. The letter, which 
was to the President of the Treasury Board, stated: ``I am writing to 
further offer my strong support for the project because of the 
significant job creation this project will provide. One of the main 
objectives of the infrastructure program is to promote public and 
private sector partnerships that will not only improve the local and 
regional economic climate, but also will help Canada as a whole to 
attract corporations by providing prime business opportunity'' and 
so on.
<P>
	That was the hon. member for Simcoe Centre, who was at that 
time writing in praise of an infrastructure program that just 
happened to be located in his riding. After that was over the same 
member-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harris:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. We are 
supposed to be discussing the amendment that was put forward by 
the hon. member for Laurentides. What the hon. member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell is talking about now has no 
relevance to the amendment. I would ask, Mr. Speaker, that he 
would speak to the amendment.
<P>
<B>(1745)</B>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The member is referring to the standing 
order regarding relevance. I am sure the hon. member will make his 
remarks relevant, if that was not the case, very soon.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, the motion is in regard to supporting 
infrastructure programs. The amendment refers only to how one 
should fund these infrastructure programs. Of course the member 
for Simcoe Centre was writing in support of funding an 
infrastructure program which is exactly what the amendment is 
about.
<P>
	Let us get back to the member for Simcoe Centre because I like 
him a lot. The member for Simcoe Centre in commenting to a 
reporter said ``of other infrastructure programs''. By coincidence, 
these other projects were not in his riding, but here is what he said 
about them. Remember, let us not be cynical. These other projects 
to which I am going to refer were in someone else's riding. He said
<P>
about those: ``It is not  infrastructure; it is a make work project. 
They talk about the short term jobs this is creating but those jobs 
can be anywhere from one day to one month''. He was explaining 
how these things were wrong, among them renovating the coliseum 
in Edmonton and building facilities and arenas elsewhere.
<P>
	All those other arenas were wrong but the arena in Barrie was 
right. It just happens to be in the riding of the member for Simcoe 
Centre. It was worthy of support and all the praise I brought to the 
attention of the House a moment ago. It constituted all those 
virtuous things I described to the House, such as promoting public 
and private sector partnerships, and so on.
<P>
	How could that be? How could it be that infrastructure projects 
are worthy when they are in the hon. member's riding but virtually 
identical projects in someone else's riding are not worthy of similar 
praise? I am sure there is a reasonable explanation for this and we 
will hear it soon.
<P>
	Let us talk about the infrastructure works program. The city of 
Calgary has put out a publication on the Canada-Alberta 
infrastructure works program. It is called ``Calgary at Work''. 
Calgary of course is where the ridings of the leader of the Reform 
Party and other Reform members are located. I wonder if they will 
pay attention to this because we might ask them questions later. 
The publication ``Calgary at Work'' lauds all the virtues of the 
infrastructure program and all the things that have been done in 
Calgary. Here are some of the things-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Johnston:</B> A point of order, Mr. Speaker, I wonder if you 
could confirm quorum.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> There is not a quorum.
<P>
	Call in the members.
<P>
	<I>And the bells having rung:</I>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Pursuant to Standing Order 29(4), I 
would ask those members present to approach the table and have 
their names recorded in the journal.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Pursuant to Standing Order 29(3), as we do not have a quorum, 
the House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m.
<P>
	(There being only 13 members present, including the Deputy 
Speaker, the names were written down, and the House adjourned at 
6.03 p.m.)
<P>
