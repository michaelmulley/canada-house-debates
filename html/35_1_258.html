<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="MANGANESEBASEDFUELADDITIVESACT">MANGANESE BASED FUEL ADDITIVES ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed from November 8 consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-94, an act to regulate interprovincial trade in and 
the importation for commercial purposes of certain manganese 
based substances, be read the third time and passed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure once again to speak to Bill C-94, an act to 
regulate interprovincial trade in and the importation for 
commercial purposes of certain manganese based substances.
<P>
	The purpose of the bill is to ban the import and interprovincial 
trade of MMT, an octane enhancer. Essentially MMT reduces 
emissions from motor vehicles. The government claims that MMT 
damages the onboard devices in new 1996 cars. It is going to be 
obligatory for cars used in Canada not to use MMT. This was at the 
prompting of the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association.
<P>
	The Ethyl corporation that makes MMT and the petroleum 
products group claim that first, MMT is not a health hazard to 
Canadians and second, does not damage onboard devices.
<P>
	If the minister wishes to ban MMT, then she has to prove that 
MMT is a health hazard to Canadians. The contrary has been 
proven by the Ministry of Health which has shown that MMT does 
not damage the health of Canadians. I have heard some spurious 
allegations by members across the way who have actually claimed 
that since the health department said what it did, that maybe MMT 
really does harm Canadians. Those are statements made off the top 
of their heads without any factual basis. If we look at the facts, 
MMT does not harm the health of Canadians.
<P>
	Central to the bill is the question, does or does not MMT damage 
onboard devices? There is ample evidence showing that onboard 
devices are not damaged by MMT. It is wise to look at the situation 
in the United States. We say we want a common gasoline for our 
vehicles, but the United States is bringing back MMT. It is bringing 
MMT  back for a couple of very important reasons: first, that it is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16401"> 16401 </A></B>
<P>
not a health hazard to people; second, that it does not damage 
onboard devices; and, third, that if it is removed from gasoline 
nitrous oxide emissions will be increased by more that 20 per cent. 
Nitrous oxide is a very important component of smog. Smog 
exacerbates respiratory problems in people who suffer from asthma 
or chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases.
<P>
<B>(1020)</B>
<P>
	If MMT is to be banned another substance will have to take its 
place. That will make gasoline more expensive. It will translate 
into more expense at the pump and in turn will cost to the industry 
more. It would act as a depressant on the economy, which means 
fewer jobs.
<P>
	The minister cannot ban MMT on the basis of health reasons so 
she is going to try to ban its movement in interprovincial trade and 
in import and export which, in effect, is a ban on the substance. 
That is how the minister has managed to get around that.
<P>
	The real truth behind this is that the Motor Vehicle 
Manufacturers Association is looking for a scapegoat because its 
members know that their onboard devices malfunction. They want 
to find some other reason for this and have found a handy peg to 
hang their hat on by claiming that MMT damages the onboard 
devices. However the facts prove otherwise.
<P>
	When looking at the situation in the United States which does 
not use MMT, we find that onboard devices malfunction at exactly 
the same rate as they do in cars using MMT. This is very 
conclusive, suggestive and strong evidence that MMT, as a reason 
for the damage of onboard devices simply does not hold water.
<P>
	I ask the minister to look at new ways and new energy sources. 
The transport sector has a 90 per cent plus dependency on fossil 
fuels. As we all know in the House, fossil fuels are finite and one 
day they will come to an end.
<P>
	We must also look globally. By the year 2025, 11 billion plus 
people will be living on this planet or twice as many as lives on it 
today. Therefore, energy consumption will double or, as many 
people believe, will increase even more than that.
<P>
	Another reason is that in developing nations people are actually 
consuming energy at a far greater rate than they have in previous 
years. Through industrialization and manufacturing the demands 
for energy and fossil fuels increase.
<P>
	I ask the minister to work with the minister of science and 
technology and the Minister of Transport and look at different ways 
we can work on new and more environmentally sound alternatives 
to fossil fuels in the future. One alternative is electrically powered 
cars. We cannot provide energy now at the low cost that we have 
with fossil fuels but in the future this will be an  important 
alternative for powering vehicles. While we cannot do it now, we 
must look to the future and develop the research and technology so 
that we can do that.
<P>
	Another interesting concept is the hydrogen fuel cell which 
works on the electrolysis of hydrogen sulphide or water. Although 
these systems are too bulky right now to use this might be an 
alternative form of power for vehicles in the future. Another is 
photovoltaic cells which take energy from the sun. The Holy Grail 
of all energy sources is the concept of fusion.
<P>
	As a country we do not have the finances to engage in extensive 
projects in this area. By working with our neighbours to the south 
and some Europeans that are doing some fascinating work on 
fusion technology, we can provide our scientific expertise to them 
to try to make this into a reality in the future. While it may not be 
practical for the transport sector, there are many other energy 
sectors for which this technology will have to be used.
<P>
<B>(1025)</B>
<P>
	Although these alternatives cannot replace fossil fuels right now, 
we do not see enough of working together between ministries. In 
this instance the Ministry of the Environment has logical partners 
in the ministry of science and technology and the Ministry of 
Transport. They are intimately entwined. It would serve Canada 
well if these ministers got together with their staffs and determined 
areas where they could work together in an efficient fashion.
<P>
	I suggest the minister look at some other areas in the 
transportation sector and work with the Minister of Transport, as I 
said before. It costs about $7,000 a year to operate a car, with high 
social and environmental costs. It is very expensive. Canadians 
should look at the European model and extract from that more 
environmentally sound measures on the transportation of people, 
paying particular attention to bicycles and rail travel.
<P>
	There is a very important issue in my riding. The E &amp; N railway 
runs north-south on Vancouver Island. It can be a very potent and 
environmentally sound mover of goods, services and people. This 
railway has been lying idle for many years and is highly 
unproductive. I hope the Minister of the Environment will work 
with the Minister of Transport to try to make this railway a reality, 
not in the public domain but in the private domain; ownership 
being retained in the public domain but management and 
functioning in the private sector.
<P>
	Vancouver Island is an area where the population is growing at 
perhaps the fastest rate in all of Canada. Unfortunately we are 
seeing the southern California syndrome where we have urban 
sprawl at its worst. We can look at Vancouver to see what happened 
there.
<P>
	With that growth in population will come transport and energy 
demands. These must be met by looking  toward the future by 
determining ways in which we can provide this transportation 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16402"> 16402 </A></B>
<P>
without damaging and destroying the pristine environment that the 
island affords.
<P>
	In conclusion, with respect to MMT our role in the House is to 
determine the truth. The minister acknowledges the conclusive 
evidence that first, MMT does not damage people's health. Second, 
there is conclusive evidence within our own country and even south 
of the border to show that MMT does not damage onboard devices.
<P>
	We need to determine the truth. I ask the minister to review the 
relevant data and rethink this issue. Clearly there is no reason to 
ban MMT in Canada now. If the minister has to have an 
independent study to determine once and for all whether MMT 
actually does damage onboard devices then she ought to do that.
<P>
	Again I hope the minister would work with the minister of 
science and technology and the Minister of Transport to look at 
new and improved ways of meeting the energy needs of Canadians 
in the future.
<P>
	I wish to move the following motion to Bill C-94. I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the motion be amended by deleting all the words after the word ``that'' 
and substituting the following therefor:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``This House declines to give third reading to Bill C-94, an act to regulate 
interprovincial trade in and the importation for commercial purposes of certain 
manganese based substances, since among other things the bill does not take 
measures to compensate for the fact that MMT free gasoline would cause the 
fuel industry to burn more crude oil, causing greater emissions into the 
atmosphere while at the same time increasing tailpipe nitrous oxide emissions''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1030 )</B>
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The motion is in order. Is the hon. member rising 
on debate?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Caccia:</B> Mr. Speaker, we are still in the 10-minute phase 
which would permit a question or a comment.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Because the hon. member for Esquimalt-Juan de 
Fuca moved an amendment we now move to debate on the 
amendment. There will be no questions or comments. That is how 
we will proceed.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Beth Phinney (Hamilton Mountain, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
many questions have been raised about the legislation now before 
the House. In some cases the debate has obscured what really is at 
stake. I would like therefore to try to answer some of the questions 
to give members a clear picture of the issue.
<P>
	First, we have heard about the harm MMT causes to pollution 
control equipment in vehicles. Does this not have a plus side? Ethyl 
corporation is the producer of MMT. According to this company 
the use of MMT allows less intensive refining, thereby reducing 
emissions from the refineries. Ethyl corporation also maintains that  
MMT reduces tailpipe emissions of nitrogen oxide by up to 20 per 
cent and lowers toxic benzene emissions. If so, what is the point of 
banning such a useful additive?
<P>
	Let us take the question of refining. It is true that MMT allows 
less intensive refining. In 1992 a report was prepared for Ethyl 
Canada. It indicated that if the additive were banned Canadian 
refineries would emit 40 to 50 tonnes more of nitrogen oxide per 
annum and 34 to 43 more kilotonnes of carbon dioxide. Those 
amounts represent 0.0025 per cent of our yearly emissions of 
nitrogen oxide and 0.01 per cent of our carbon dioxide emissions. 
Such slight increases are clearly minuscule.
<P>
	What then about emissions from vehicle tailpipes? The data 
collected by Ethyl corporation showed an average reduction in 
nitrogen oxide emissions with MMT of up to 20 per cent. But the 
figures were for a test fleet of well maintained vehicles, whereas 
the actual Canadian cars are not on average as well maintained. If 
we put the findings into the context of the current Canadian cars, 
another analysis indicates that MMT causes a much smaller 
reduction in nitrogen oxide emissions, no more than about 5 per 
cent.
<P>
	As for toxic benzene emissions, these should not increase as a 
result of the banning of MMT. Gasoline can be refined to limit its 
benzene content. This past July the Minister of the Environment 
announced that she intended to regulate benzene levels in gasoline 
to a maximum of one per cent per volume. The regulations would 
also limit any increase in the amount of aromatics in gasoline.
<P>
<B>(1035)</B>
<P>
	MMT has been used as an octane enhancer in gasoline, but the 
oil refining industry has various options for replacing it. These 
options should still limit the benzene content. For example, the 
refining process could be changed to produce higher octane 
gasoline constituents. Along with or instead of that, other octane 
enhancers are available such as ethyl and MTBE.
<P>
	This raises another question: Are we banning MMT to promote 
the use of ethanol? The answer to that is no. Ethanol is only one 
option for replacing the octane now provided by MMT. There are 
other options available, and it is up to the petroleum industry to 
make that choice.
<P>
	What about the financial costs? Some wonder whether MMT 
removal would place a heavy financial burden on the oil industry or 
consumers. According to the industry's own estimates, the cost 
would translate to an increase of approximately 0.1 cents to 0.24 
cents per litre, a minor amount, especially considering the normal 
day to day price fluctuations we see at the fuel pump in the order of 
a few cents per litre.
<P>
	Other questions have been raised about the studies that provide 
the basis for the legislation. Why, it is asked, are we accepting the 
word of the auto industry, which is surely an interested party in the 
dispute. Why do we not  make use of independent studies? The fact 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16403"> 16403 </A></B>
<P>
is there have been no independent studies to determine the effect of 
MMT on emissions control systems. The research has been 
sponsored either by the auto makers or by Ethyl for the oil 
producers.
<P>
	Some would ask why Environment Canada has not sponsored or 
conducted its own research. The department has sought technical 
opinions from two outside experts, one of whom was called on by 
both industries to participate in joint discussions. Both experts 
agreed that we do not have conclusive data but that MMT tends to 
affect emissions performance and increase costs.
<P>
	To go further and conduct a government study of the issue would 
simply use up taxpayers' dollars and delay the introduction of new 
pollution control technology into Canada. We cannot afford to do 
that. Both industries have done their work and studied the issue. It 
is now time for a decision. Some might ask why that must be a 
government decision; why not leave it to the industries concerned 
to arrive at their solution? That is exactly what we have been trying 
to do for more than two years, but so far that approach has not 
succeeded.
<P>
	Senior officials from four federal departments have met with 
representatives of the oil and auto industries. I would stress this 
about four federal departments because the previous speaker 
suggested we should be talking among the different departments 
and getting answers. This minister has spoken to and worked with 
four federal departments. More recently the Minister of the 
Environment attempted personally to negotiate an agreement. All 
these efforts have failed. We have no alternative but to legislate the 
necessary changes.
<P>
	Still another question concerns actions on MMT in the United 
States. In the last months we have seen moves to reintroduce its use 
there. Most recently, this past October 20, a United States Court of 
Appeal decision ordered the Environmental Protection Agency to 
grant Ethyl corporation registration for the use of its MMT additive 
in unleaded gasoline.
<P>
	Why are we banning MMT in Canada when the United States 
seems to be lifting its almost 20-year old ban on MMT? After all, 
part of the argument made against MMT is that we must harmonize 
our emissions control approach with that of the Americans. Are we 
not in danger of remaining out of step if we pass the legislation?
<P>
<B>(1040)</B>
<P>
	MMT prospects in the United States remain cloudy. The EPA 
could appeal the October 20 ruling or attempt other legal action. 
Major refineries might be reluctant to adopt MMT until 
uncertainties are resolved about the health effects associated with 
widespread use of the additive. Furthermore, the auto industry 
could launch its own challenge.
<P>
	Even if none of that happens, about one-third of the U.S. 
gasoline market including California requires  reformulated 
gasoline to meet more stringent air quality requirements. MMT is 
still not allowed in reformulated gasoline, which can be expected to 
claim a growing share of the U.S. market in the coming years as the 
country moves toward cleaner fuel.
<P>
	California has gone so far as to expressly prohibit the use of 
MMT as a gasoline additive. This U.S. state is a world leader in 
emission control strategies. The example it sets is widely followed 
throughout North America and beyond. We should carefully 
consider the approach of California. It could well become the 
benchmark for tomorrow.
<P>
	Another question asked is what is the rush. Why do we not wait 
for the doubts to resolve themselves? Why should we intervene 
now when the issue is still unclear and evolving? The answer is that 
the issue will never be settled to the entire satisfaction of both the 
auto and oil industries. Doubts are bound to persist, but there is 
sufficient evidence now to make an informed decision. This the 
two industries have been unable to do themselves, even though we 
gave them plenty of time in which to do it. The voluntary approach 
has failed so we must be prepared to turn to legislation to achieve a 
solution.
<P>
	For those who have raised doubts and questions, I have some 
questions myself. In a time of budgetary constraints can we justify 
spending government money to duplicate studies already carried 
out by the private sector? Can we justify a delay in introducing 
state of the art emission control technology in Canada? Can we 
justify the extra expense consumers will bear if MMT continues to 
be used as an additive in Canada? Would there be considerable cost 
for industry or consumers if MMT is banned? Would there be a 
notable harmful environmental impact? Is MMT likely to have a 
place in the cleaner fuels of the future? After more than two years 
of discussion is there any likelihood that the industries concerned 
could reach agreement in the near future on MMT use? Is there any 
real alternative left except legislation?
<P>
	I believe that the answer to all these questions is self-evident. 
Equally obvious is that the time has come for Parliament to 
exercise its obligation and legislate an end to the use of manganese 
based additives in gasoline. That is what Bill C-94 does. The 
measure is pro-environmental, pro-consumer, pro-investment and 
pro-business. It is time for the House to face the facts and pass the 
legislation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
speak on Bill C-94.
<P>
	We introduced the amendment simply to allow time for the topic 
to be studied and assessed in light of what has happened in the U.S. 
and to avoid embarrassment for the government and the country.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16404"> 16404 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1045 )</B>
<P>
	The move to ban MMT at this time clearly has little support in 
evidence. Everyone on the committee, including the government 
members, raised substantive doubts on the validity of the evidence.
<P>
	The presentation of the previous speech we heard was very well 
done. Nevertheless it was a presentation that again accepts 
unquestionably the evidence provided by the auto manufacturers in 
spite of the fact that they refused to table any of those studies for us 
to look at.
<P>
	We are told that the minister intervened personally to try and 
bring about a settlement on this issue. I would question how the 
minister could intervene personally to negotiate a settlement on 
this issue when she refused to meet with one of the parties 
involved. In spite of several attempts by that side, that party in the 
dispute, the minister refused to meet with them.
<P>
	The member says she personally intervened to try and bring 
about a settlement. What hogwash. A settlement cannot be brought 
about by only meeting with one side. Again she says they have had 
plenty of time to settle the dispute, that the government has given 
ample time to do that.
<P>
	In the 1993 campaign the Liberal party, before it became the 
government, committed in its red book to ban MMT if an 
agreement was not reached. In the dispute the motor vehicle 
manufacturers lost all will to negotiate any kind of agreement 
because it was there in writing: if an agreement was not reached, 
the government was prepared to ban MMT.
<P>
	We again hear how there is no time to let the National Research 
Council or the Department of the Environment conduct 
independent tests. There is this urgency because of the technology 
on the 1996 cars. The 1996 cars are here. They are on the market. 
They are being sold. The OBD II system is onboard. It is 
functioning and has not been disconnected. Why are we in such a 
terrible rush?
<P>
	Yesterday we heard from the member for Davenport that if these 
OBD II warning lights were disconnected and the system was 
malfunctioning, it would somehow contribute greatly to more 
pollution and would be a health hazard for Canadians. My response 
to that is: What about the millions and millions of cars on our roads 
that are pre-1996 and do not have OBD II systems and seem to be 
functioning quite well? This OBD II technology is not vital to the 
operation of a car. Whether or not it functions is not how we judge 
the pollution that is coming from the car. They are simply warning 
devices. They have no effect on the pollution produced from the 
tailpipe of that car.
<P>
	There is not that great a rush and we do have time to do that 
testing. It is important in the interests of this country to wait. 
Certainly if MMT is allowed to be used again in the United States 
in the coming year, this bill and this movement by our government 
will truly be  embarrassing. Certainly it will be embarrassing to the 
country to have the Minister of the Environment go down in history 
as the minister who passed a bill to increase ground level ozone and 
smog. It is truly ludicrous.
<P>
	We have introduced the amendment to appeal to the common 
sense of the House to let the bill rest somewhere at least for a 
couple of months or a year. Let us do some independent testing to 
verify the evidence. Let us wait and see what happens in the U.S. so 
we can truly move toward harmonization of fuel, an objective the 
Minister of Industry clearly stated in the House as being crucial.
<P>
	Whatever happens in the U.S. and however small an amount of 
MMT is or is not allowed in, to ban MMT in Canada is to move 
away from the goal of harmonization and not toward it. It only 
makes good common sense to wait until we see what happens and 
to do independent testing so that we have concrete evidence one 
way or the other.
<P>
<B>(1050)</B>
<P>
	Certainly this party supports the banning of MMT if it can be 
shown in independent testing that it is a problem. Ethyl corporation 
and the petroleum refining industry stated in committee that they 
are perfectly willing to withdraw the product from the market if 
independent evidence shows that it is detrimental. That is certainly 
a more reasonable position than the one presented by the 
government.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Beth Phinney (Hamilton Mountain, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to make some comments about the auto industry in 
Canada and point out some facts about it.
<P>
	In 1994, $44 billion worth of vehicles and $20 billion worth of 
parts were produced in Canada. Producing $44 billion worth of 
vehicles in Canada employed 58,000 Canadians. Canadians across 
the country are involved in the industry. There is a Volvo plant in 
Halifax, many plants in Quebec and Ontario, and truck 
manufacturers in British Columbia. The vehicle parts 
manufacturing industry involves over 750 companies employing 
82,000 Canadians.
<P>
	I am sure that Canadians employed in these companies would 
like to know the hon. member and his party are supporting their 
jobs. I get the feeling from what I have heard in the House that their 
support is only for the oil refining industry and not for the workers 
of Canada and the Canadian industry. I wonder if the hon. member 
has any comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chatters:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would love to comment on that 
because truly we are beginning to see the real motivation for the 
legislation. It is a political motivation.
<P>
	I am not responding to any lobby. I met with both sides on the 
issue. I listened to the evidence from both  sides. We did extensive 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16405"> 16405 </A></B>
<P>
research into that evidence. The evidence is not there to support 
banning MMT. It simply is not there.
<P>
	Certainly to suggest that by not banning MMT it will create a 
loss of jobs in the auto industry is a red herring. Cars will certainly 
continue to be built where they are being made today.
<P>
	I will say one thing. If there are job losses to be incurred because 
of the issue, they will not be in the auto industry; they will be in the 
manufacture of MMT. That plant will close down and those jobs 
will be lost in Canada. They will be gone.
<P>
	The member has the facts just a little mixed up. We are accused 
of being overcome by the lobby of Ethyl corporation and that there 
is some kind of evil corporation from the U.S. which is not even 
Canadian. Where are the head offices of every member of the 
Motor Vehicles Manufacturers Association? They are no more 
Canadian than Ethyl is, quite frankly. If the member is concerned 
about job losses, let us be realistic and fair. They will not be in the 
auto industry.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
again the member for Athabasca is deviating from the information 
we received in committee.
<P>
	It was amply discussed there from the information provided by 
the auto industry that the presence of manganese has a negative 
effect on the functioning capacity of the oxygen sensors and 
catalytic converters. The results are clearly identified. The 
committee was quite keen in investigating the matter. It went into 
investigating the question of the effect of manganese on 
sparkplugs. The hon. member saw the pictures that when 
sparkplugs operate with gasoline containing manganese, the 
coating of manganese is visible on the sparkplugs.
<P>
<B>(1055 )</B>
<P>
	In addition the MMT manufacturers are in the U.S.A. They are 
keen to maintain the Canadian market as they have already in 
Bulgaria, Russia, Taiwan and Argentina. We have now reached a 
stage in Canada where we have to move away from MMT as the 
Americans already did in 1978. The American motorist has been 
using gasoline without MMT since 1978. There is no deviation 
from that fact and the Reform Party must accept that fact.
<P>
	The entire North American automotive technology is moving 
toward an onboard diagnostic system which is intended to improve 
the emission controls of the engine.
<P>
	Is this a political decision? Yes, it is a political decision because 
politicians have to make policy decisions. We have to keep up with 
rapidly advancing technology. We cannot turn the clocks back to 
before 1978 and go back to how it was in the United States before 
the U.S. banned MMT.
<P>
	We must apply the latest technology for the sake of the 
consumer. That is why we have the issue of onboard  diagnostics 
which, contrary to what the hon. member for Athabasca said, 
would have to be disconnected in Canada if MMT was not 
removed. The disconnection would be to the disadvantage of the 
warranty holder, namely the car owner.
<P>
	These facts emerged from committee. Does the member for 
Athabasca agree with those observations?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chatters:</B> Madam Speaker, for some reason the member for 
Davenport does not seem to remember what went on in committee.
<P>
	The evidence was very suspect. The pictures of the sparkplugs 
which he referred to were two different types of sparkplugs. The 
witnesses told us they were exactly the same sparkplugs run in the 
same engine and all the rest of it. On the tailpipe emission issue, a 
government member was clearly confused and had some real doubt 
as to the authenticity of the data before him and what they were 
suggested to mean.
<P>
	Without any question, the evidence is suspect at best and 
certainly is not enough on which to base the decision to ban MMT. 
The evidence simply is not there. The bill is an embarrassment to 
the country and the minister.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton-Middlesex, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am especially pleased to have the opportunity to take 
part in the third reading debate on Bill C-94, an act to regulate 
interprovincial trade in and the importation for commercial 
purposes of certain manganese based substances.
<P>
	The primary purpose of the bill which is to be known as the 
manganese based fuel additives act is to ban the use of MMT, a 
manganese based compound used as an octane enhancer in 
Canadian gasolines.
<P>
	MMT is widely recognized as having an adverse effect on the 
operation of vehicle emission control components, including 
sophisticated onboard diagnostic systems, commonly known as 
OBDS. OBDS are slated to be introduced in virtually all 1996 
vehicle models. They will help to control vehicle pollution by 
monitoring emission system performance and alerting drivers to a 
malfunction. Several car manufacturers around the world including 
Ford, Chrysler, General Motors and Toyota have all come to the 
conclusion after extensive scientific testing that MMT adversely 
affects onboard diagnostic systems. Many of these corporations 
have billions of dollars invested in Canada and directly employ 
tens of thousands of Canadians in manufacturing plants.
<P>
<B>(1100)</B>
<P>
	To continue using MMT in Canadian gasoline would 
compromise the ability of Canada's auto industry to design cars 
that achieve important pollution reductions. Surely it goes without 
saying that Canada's environment and Canadian consumers have 
the right to the best emission control technology available. 
Presently Canada is one of the last countries in the world in which 
MMT is  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16406"> 16406 </A></B>
<P>
used in unleaded gasoline. That is a distinction we should not be 
particularly proud of.
<P>
	While MMT has been in use in Canada since 1977 as a 
replacement for lead in unleaded gasoline, it has been banned in the 
United States since 1977 because of concerns over health effects. I 
find it ironical that one country, ours, adopted a product at the 
precisely the same time its neighbour bans it.
<P>
	Environment Canada, the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency and virtually every single automobile company around the 
world all agree that MMT impairs the performance of pollution 
control equipment found in today's cars and trucks. Study after 
study shows that MMT adversely affects the onboard diagnostic 
systems where the pollution control equipment is found. These 
systems are extremely important for the environment because they 
ensure the cleaner burning engines of today and tomorrow operate 
as designed.
<P>
	Understandably the vehicle industry has indicated it will not 
accept the risk of increased warranty repair costs associated with 
MMT in gasoline and would take preventive actions, including 
disconnecting the OBD systems in whole or in part and possibly 
reducing vehicle warranty coverage with 1996 vehicles if MMT 
continues to be used.
<P>
	The passage of Bill C-94 into law will bring about a successful 
resolution of the MMT issue in Canada and will ensure that vehicle 
emission standards remain harmonized in the North American 
automotive market.
<P>
	I will now speak on the health hazards associated with 
manganese based compounds like MMT. AT 1990 hearings of the 
U.S. environmental protection agency into a waiver application 
submitted by Ethyl Corporation to reallow MMT in unleaded 
gasoline, a number of experts testified on the toxic effects of 
manganese compounds.
<P>
	Ms. Ellen Silbergeld of the environmental defense fund testified 
at the EPA hearings: ``Manganese, like lead, is a toxin in that both 
its absorption and retention as well as its toxicity increase with 
time. At present there are insufficient data on the low level chronic 
effects of the manganese exposure similar to the case that was 
made for lead in 1925''.
<P>
	The environmental defense fund in its written submission to the 
EPA states: ``We know that manganese at high dose is a 
demonstrated human neurotoxin with persistent and irreversible 
pathological effects on brain structure and resulting severe 
impairments in movement and mental state. We do not know what 
the long term chronic low dose consequences of human exposure to 
manganese are. We do not know a safe level of manganese 
exposure, particularly for those subgroups that may be at increased 
risk for neurotoxity, the young and the aged''.
<P>
	Dr. John Donaldson is one of Canada's top neurotoxologists. He 
has conducted ground breaking research in this area. Dr. Donaldson 
told the EPA in Washington: ``One of the major theories in leading 
edge neuroscience which relate to the environment today is that 
there are agents, neurotoxins, insidious neurotoxins like 
manganese, which are age accelerating neurotoxins. I believe that 
manganese is such an age accelerating neurotoxin and I believe this 
is the answer to manganese's ability to produce biochemically, 
pathologically and clinically the picture which is very similar, very 
similar but not identical, to Parkinson's disease''.
<P>
	On May 1, 1994 Dr. Donaldson wrote to me with an overview of 
more recent scientific studies that should give us all pause. I put on 
the record the following examples of recent research provided to 
me by Dr. Donaldson:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>An increasing body of evidence from Sweden, the centre of excellence and 
occupational health and safety, has demonstrated that chronic exposure to 
manganese at very low levels can produce impairment of mental function. The 
evidence suggesting that low levels over a prolonged period can impair memory 
has strong implications not only for occupational health but perhaps more 
especially to child mental health, and firmly places manganese in the category 
of behavioural psychotoxin as well as neurotoxin.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This newly emerging recognition of the low dose effects of manganese is a 
most effective club with which to stifle industrial critics which argue that 
manganese is only toxic at enormous levels rarely attained.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Recent evidence by Dr. Donald Calne of the University of British Columbia, a 
distinguished and internationally acclaimed researcher in Parkinson's disease, 
considers that manganese in humans is progressive and even a short exposure 
can lead ultimately to brain damage. Of especial importance was his 
observations that even a short exposure was as effective as a prolonged one in 
causing irreparable brain damage. This should dispel claims by critics that at 
moderate doses manganese has no health risk.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Dr. Calne has also noted that the initial toxicity of manganese can remain masked 
for several decades following exposure although causing brain cell death at an 
increased rate which is only detectable by brain imaging techniques. The disease 
may not appear for periods as long as four decades. A silent killer indeed.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1105)</B>
<P>
	There are a number of options to replace the octane provided by 
MMT. Available substances include MTBE, ETBE, methanol and 
ethanol. Ethanol, which is produced from Canadian grains, is an 
ideal octane enhancer for unleaded gasoline. Since it is 
manufactured from renewal feedstock it is especially valuable as a 
non-petroleum fuel component in times of restricted supply. 
Ethanol and its derivative, ETBE, are the only gasoline additives 
which are renewable and offer the further security of reducing 
dependence on foreign energy supplies.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16407"> 16407 </A></B>
<P>
	The primary environmental benefit of ethanol is its high content 
of oxygen. Gasoline contains no oxygen. Adding oxygen has the 
effect of creating a more favourable air-fuel ratio, which results 
in a cleaner combustion of the fuel, thereby reducing such harmful 
emissions as carbon dioxide.
<P>
	On December 21, 1994 the government announced a new 
program to encourage the development of biomass derived fuels. It 
is obvious that the banning of MMT as contained in Bill C-94 
dovetails perfectly with this program. In addition to helping 
improve the environment, the government's support of ethanol 
investment will benefit agricultural producers and create industrial 
development. There is no doubt in my mind that the banning of 
MMT will boost demand for ethanol and help to create new long 
term markets for corn and grain as feedstock to the ethanol process.
<P>
	I heartily support Bill C-94 and I strongly encourage all 
members to do likewise.
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I have 
a number of questions.
<P>
	I cannot remember when I have heard such a gross distortion of 
facts as we have just heard. Perhaps it is as a result of overexposure 
to manganese.
<P>
	Does the member not believe that officials and experts in the 
Department of Health are competent and reliable? Has she read the 
blues from when Health Canada appeared as a witness before the 
committee and on several different occasions clearly stated 
manganese in fuels does not present any health hazard to 
Canadians? That is clear. It is written down and there for her to see.
<P>
<B>(1110 )</B>
<P>
	The other comment I have is a return to the red herring of 
ethanol. The member should check the evidence presented by 
witnesses. Every manufacturing and refining witness that appeared 
before us said ethanol is not an alternative, it will not replace 
MMT.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ur:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for his question. 
Perhaps his judgment is that ethanol is not the only alternative. In 
my speech I offered other alternatives. It is one of the alternatives 
that can be offered to this program.
<P>
	Health is not the issue at the present time. We are looking at the 
air pollution issue as well. He says we do not take studies into 
consideration. In the United States they filed with the EPA four 
times as to qualifications for MMT. Three times they filed under 
section 211(c) and were denied. This section deals with matters 
concerning public health in relation to MMT as well the effect of 
MMT on the performance of emission control devices. They were 
turned down.
<P>
	In their good wisdom they looked at section 211(f)(1) within the 
clean air act. The application was denied because it only related to 
the health aspects. We must  consider what section they applied and 
when it was accepted or turned down.
<P>
	There have been other studies conducted. I believe some Reform 
Party members said NOx emissions would be reduced by 20 per 
cent. However, these data were collected by Ethyl corporation. 
Environment Canada has said NOx would be reduced by 5 per cent. 
We must get our data straight on the issue.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I listened to the hon. member's comments quite closely. I 
am a little concerned she is still putting forth the idea that ethanol is 
an alternative to MMT. As my hon. colleague from Athabasca 
stated, clear evidence was presented to the committee which 
contradicts what she is trying to say.
<P>
	Once again in her comments she has said ethanol is one of the 
alternatives, which is simply not correct. I would like her to retract 
that statement because ethanol is not an alternative to MMT.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ur:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague. In the past 
few days or weeks General Motors acknowledged that its cars 
would be able to use ethanol gas.
<P>
	In addition I am very proud to say that gas stations have included 
ethanol pumps in London, Ontario, within the last week or two. 
They have been in touch with the car manufacturers. Obviously 
they know there is a requirement for such an option. I am very 
pleased to say ethanol is making strides in southwestern Ontario, 
my area.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, as I have listened to the debate over the past few days one 
thing has become abundantly obvious. We need to do more 
research. The evidence, as the hon. member said, reflects people on 
one side saying one thing and people on the other side saying 
another thing.
<P>
	I appeal to the government to support the amendment my 
colleague from Athabasca has made. We should give some time to 
it. The Americans are studying it. We need to look at it some more. 
It would be a great disservice to Canadians to quickly rush the bill 
through the House. There is nothing wrong with accepting the 
amendment and looking at this matter a little more.
<P>
	If we look at the evidence presented in committee it becomes 
quite clear we need to look at this a lot more. I hope the 
government will listen to reason and support the amendment.
<P>
<B>(1115 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton-Middlesex, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question.
<P>
	I reassure the member that the government is not rushing 
through this issue. The minister gave notice in 1993, two years ago. 
In my view that is not rushing.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16408"> 16408 </A></B>
<P>
	Further, I believe the House has been working on it since 1985 
to broker a solution. Senior departmental officials from 
environment, transport, industry and natural resources have all 
been working with senior representatives from the petroleum 
companies and the automotive industry. This has not come by 
night; it has been looked at for several years with one option or 
another.
<P>
	With all due respect, I believe there has been sufficient data put 
together and we have to move forward. We cannot constantly be 
looking and looking and looking. We have a party in the House that 
tells us we are wasting money continually. This costs money. I do 
not say it is wasting money when we do studies, but it costs money. 
We have adequate information. Let us move forward on the issue. It 
is time to move. We have to respect the information we have 
collected.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Is the House ready for the 
question?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Question.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> The question is on the 
amendment. Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the 
amendment?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> All those in favour of the 
amendment will please say yea.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Yea.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> All those opposed will 
please say nay.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Nay.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> In my opinion the nays 
have it.
<P>
	<I>And more than five members having risen:</I>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Pursuant to Standing 
Order 45(7), a division on the question now before the House 
stands deferred until Monday, November 20, at 6 p.m., at which 
time the bells to call in the members will be sounded for not more 
than 15 minutes.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="DEPARTMENTOFHUMANRESOURCESDEVELOPMENTACT">DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN RESOURCES 
DEVELOPMENT ACT</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.)</B> moved that Bill C-96, an act to establish the 
Department of Human Resources Development and to amend and 
repeal certain related acts, be read the second time and referred to a 
committee.
<P>
	He said: Madam Speaker, I am very pleased, along with my 
colleague from Portage-Interlake, to move second reading of the 
bill that provides for the formal foundation of the Department of 
Human Resources. This is the last of the 10 reorganization bills and 
with its passage the major reorganization of departments that began 
in 1993 will be complete.
<P>
<B>(1120 )</B>
<P>
	The bill primarily deals with administrative reorganization. As 
members know, the new department brought together portions of 
several other departments: the former departments of employment 
and immigration, health and welfare, secretary of state, and 
Labour.
<P>
	At the outset I say the bill makes no significant changes to the 
statutory elements of the legislation that established these founding 
departments.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The bill does not change the powers of the federal government or 
the provinces. It gives no new powers. The mandate conferred in 
the bill is clearly limited to the matters over which Parliament has 
jurisdiction. That is literally what it says in clause 6.
<P>
	In other words, the programs and structures included in existing 
legislation have simply been put together in this new bill.
<P>
	The Bloc objects to clause 20 because it allows the minister to 
sign contracts with agencies and institutions other than the 
provinces. But this is not new. This has not changed.
<P>
	For instance, the bill includes agreements on older workers with 
the government of Quebec and the other provinces. Under this 
agreement, the government purchases annuities from financial 
institutions.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	All the legislation does is allow us to continue to provide 
assistance for older workers by buying a series of annuities from 
financial institutions in full co-operation with the provinces. 
Frankly, the attempt to raise fears and create the impression that 
this is some form of new intrusion is simply another example of 
blowing smoke, which we have seen so rampant over the past 
several weeks.
<P>
	Why then is the legislation important? Why bring together four 
or five departments into a singular instrument of government? I 
think the vision that underlies the reorganization of the department 
is captured in the name itself, Human Resources Development. It 
tries to bring together all the different elements, instruments, 
programs and policies of the federal government into one coherent 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16409"> 16409 </A></B>
<P>
approach to the fundamental issue dealing with individual 
Canadians. In a sense it is a single drawer out of which a number of 
tools can be brought to try to tackle and focus on the concerns and 
issues of many Canadians as they go through  difficult times of 
personal, family and community adjustment at a time of incredible 
changes in society.
<P>
	This is not a defence of the status quo or what used to be. It is an 
attempt to try to provide a new, innovative way of doing 
government. One of the great singular difficulties we have, as we 
well know, is to get people to begin to think differently about how 
government can relate to individuals, communities and the country. 
The old ways simply are not relevant to the kinds of conditions we 
now face. That is one reason the government has undertaken to 
provide a new set of instruments, brought together with a single 
focus of policy. It really gives us a foundation on which the role 
and participation of the Canadian government can tackle the real 
deficit problem in the country, which is not just the fiscal deficit 
but also the human deficit, a deficit as corrosive and undermining 
to the well-being of individuals as anything we face on the fiscal 
side.
<P>
	The singular challenge we face, regardless of political opinion or 
jurisdiction, is how to give Canadians the ability, the resources and 
the support they need to manage sometimes very painful and 
difficult transitions as the economy changes into a globally 
integrated economy, as we try to cope with the major impacts of 
new technology and the impacts on the workplace, where job 
requirements and qualifications change in an instant. This almost 
revolutionary transitional sweep is affecting not only Canada but 
every country in the world.
<P>
<B>(1125 )</B>
<P>
	The time has come for all levels of government-federal, 
provincial, and municipal-not to engage in the old fashioned 
warfare of whose turf we own, but to find ways of working 
together, find ways of bringing together our combined resources. 
The attempts to try to stake out what one jurisdiction should do 
versus the other oftentimes leave out one major problem. We are 
still talking about the same people who are interested in their 
family, their job and their community and simply want government 
to help, not hinder or in the way but provide the resources they 
need.
<P>
	The real fear and the real uncertainty gripping the lives of people 
is how to cope with unprecedented change and how to make 
something of it that can be positive and constructive. There are 
those in our society and I suppose there are people in the chamber 
who would like to roll back that change. Like King Canute, they 
would like to stop the waves from coming in. That is bound to 
frustration.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B> Madam Speaker, I did 
not want to interrupt my colleague, but I have just consulted with 
the official opposition and we have contravened one of the rules in 
the House.
<P>
	According to Standing Order 45(6)(a), a division deferred on 
Thursday is not held on Friday but is instead deferred to the next 
sitting day at the ordinary hour of adjournment.
<P>
	The government whip did not consult with or get the consent of 
our party. Nor did he get the consent of the official opposition in 
deferring the vote.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I will take that under 
advisement and get back to the member.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Axworthy (Winnipeg South Centre):</B> Madam Speaker, the 
fundamental purpose and rationale for reorganizing the department 
is to put us in a position where we can take a holistic view of this 
transformation, try to put a finder on it that enables us to see the 
linkages and the crossovers.
<P>
	We know full well that the problem of child poverty stems 
oftentimes from relationships in the workplace. We know that poor 
children also end up with children who have illnesses. Therefore 
we have to find some way of cross-linking the responses and in so 
doing be more effective and more efficient both within and 
between governments and provide the best possible answer in that 
respect. This means not abandoning basic values but finding new 
ways of doing things.
<P>
	We have to recognize, a fundamental and critical issue, is that 
the old top down centralized hierarchies of governmental 
organization, which have been really a product of the old industrial 
age, no longer work effectively. The kind of management that is 
driven from a command point of view no longer works very 
effectively. We now must find a much different way of working in a 
society with individuals and communities, much more in a lateral 
and horizontal way than in a vertical way. The old manuals that 
governed inputs and outputs and measured results according to 
fiscal accounts no longer apply when it comes down to values.
<P>
	I would like to point out one of the interesting initiatives we 
were able to co-sponsor with the OECD last spring. The secretary 
of labor in the United States and I made a motion that rather than 
have the OECD issue purely economic indicators every year it 
should begin to also look at social indicators, the impacts on 
investments in education, investments in welfare and what it tells 
us in terms of the resulting capacity and competence of individuals 
to make progress in dealing with the problems.
<P>
	I am really talking about getting the best use of taxpayers' 
dollars at a time when we face real restraint and providing a much 
more effective way of enabling people to respond and make 
choices themselves and not have choices made for them.
<P>
	Let me give one small example of how a saving can be made that 
has an impact both for the individual and for society at large. If we 
could get the 400,000 people who are almost permanently 
unemployed through the  unemployment insurance ranks and who 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16410"> 16410 </A></B>
<P>
receive benefits by changing that benefit to a form of employment 
benefit so they could get one more week of work, we would save 
the entire system $50 million, just by that one act alone, an 
additional week of work.
<P>
<B>(1130 )</B>
<P>
	Think of what it does for the individual who knows that for the 
first time he or she has an opportunity to springboard back into the 
workforce as opposed to simply planning a life which is a constant 
round of getting from one benefit program to another. That is the 
key element in trying to shift the role of government and the way 
government operates.
<P>
	This is not critical of what was done in the past. It was a product 
of its time. In the 1940s, 1950s and even the 1960s there was a view 
about how government should work in terms of providing a form of 
security through welfare payments and social benefits. During 
those times we were not facing the kind of economic 
transformation which is going on today. We were not facing the 
disruption which is now taking place.
<P>
	People now have a much higher level of skills requirements. We 
have seen all the reports; I do not have to repeat them. The reports 
show that those who have some kind of post-secondary education 
have an 85 per cent to 90 per cent chance of getting a job. Those 
who have less than high school have about a 30 per cent chance of 
getting a job.
<P>
	One cannot simply say it is the individual who has to survive and 
swim in that sea. I reject that philosophy. Government after all is 
nothing more than the combined collective representation of all 
those individuals recognizing there are certain things that have to 
be done together and not individually. We have to combine 
resources across the country so that when one area is facing higher 
unemployment, other areas help support it. That is the fundamental 
concept of sharing.
<P>
	The more we fragment the country, the more we divide it, 
separate it and turn it into a series of fiefdoms, the less capable we 
are of helping individuals to respond when they have needs because 
we no longer have the benefit of that sharing. That is why the 
federal government must continue to play an important role in this 
area. Those who are the apostles of provincialism, which is to say 
turn everything over and make all the decisions, will recognize 
what can happen.
<P>
	One example is a discussion we are having with the province of 
British Columbia. It is feeling the pressure from people who are 
moving in from other provinces. Those in B.C. forget that in the 
1980s people from British Columbia were moving to other 
provinces which were picking up the responsibility. They forget 
that it was a very important time for there to be a balanced wheel to 
make sure there was a proper adjudication and sharing of resources.
<P>
	That is why it is important to help redefine, select and work out 
how we in the new department of human resources can play that 
role clearly in a system of partnership. We must also make sure 
there is a very active and useful delivery of service to individual 
Canadians nationally.
<P>
	In the last year in the department of human resources in its 
combined form, we provided in one way or another a transaction 
service to one million Canadians. We are the largest service 
delivery organization in the country. We deal with more Canadians 
than McDonald's, Air Canada and Sears, Roebuck combined. That 
is why the question of service becomes so important.
<P>
	One of the most important elements of the reforms we are 
introducing is trying to understand how we can provide a much 
better service related to where the individual is and to get away 
from the top down command system. I used to say that the 
departments we brought together had a General Motors or IBM 
philosophy. I wanted to turn that into a Canadian Tire philosophy 
where it was based in the local communities with tools and 
instruments customized and tailored to the needs of those 
communities.
<P>
	We are pioneering in this approach. We have made enormous 
progress in the past year by being able to fundamentally rethink 
and redo the way in which the department of human resources 
works. It is an attempt to find the most relevant kind of 
governmental organization to fit the job system and social system 
we are going to need as we approach the new century.
<P>
	As an example, last August we announced a fundamental change 
in the way in which the service delivery operation of the 
department would operate. We are going from 450 points of service 
in the country to 700 points of service. We are providing a much 
broader network.
<P>
<B>(1135 )</B>
<P>
	Some of my colleagues have been very concerned about how the 
federal government ensures adequate and effective services in rural 
areas. This means a much broader extension of the services of the 
department into areas that did not have services before. People can 
now access services without having to travel 50 miles or 70 miles 
to visit an old CEC.
<P>
	I will give the example of a person in Elgin county where I 
visited about a month or so ago. In terms of testing out new models, 
one of our young officers in St. Thomas worked out a system where 
through the Internet he was able to provide the same access to 
information and services we used to provide by having somebody 
come into the St. Thomas office. In a period of three months with 
that simple change alone he was able to provide service to 4,000 
new clients.
<P>
	If we had had to do it the old way, people would have been in line 
ups five miles long every single day at that  St. Thomas office 
trying to find information on pensions or employment. One of the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16411"> 16411 </A></B>
<P>
end results is that people can access the job bank in the local 
grocery stores, high schools, libraries, places where people go, 
where they carry out their normal business. We can work 
partnerships at those local levels so people get that same level of 
service.
<P>
	We are also working with the disabled community to establish a 
new job bank for disabled Canadians which is tied in with a large 
number of corporations. Again the access is provided at the local 
level and is designed by the users themselves working with the 
business community. All of a sudden a number of disabled 
Canadians can put their resumes on the system. Businesses can 
recognize what those resumes are and they can do the transaction 
together. It frees up our own officers to do the really important and 
intense work of counselling and mentoring and providing good 
advice as to where one can go and how to get there.
<P>
	One of the major advantages as well is that what used to be the 
old job centres are now becoming in a sense human resource 
centres where there is an integration of all the services of the 
department. Seniors, students and workers under the 
unemployment insurance system can all come to the same place.
<P>
	As a result, seniors will have four times as many offices in which 
they can be serviced than previously. The new technology means 
that processing UI claims can be reduced to two days when it used 
to take sometimes 10 days to two weeks. Claims for old age 
security can be processed in half a day instead of eight days. That 
means a lot. We can put that in cold statistical terms but for a senior 
who has been waiting for an application for old age security, to 
have it within a half a day as opposed to eight or 10 days makes a 
big difference when they do not have a lot of money to deal with.
<P>
	We are substantially broadening that network to a variety of 
points of service. We are using the new technology. We are not 
afraid of it, like some members are saying, like the Luddites of old 
who say that we cannot use new information systems. There is not a 
business, not an organization in the country which is not asking 
itself questions about how to improve efficiency, productivity and 
access by using the new systems. That is what we are now doing 
and implementing. It is a fundamental part of trying to provide 
better service for those nine million Canadians who use our 
services.
<P>
	Not only are we integrating within the programs we offer, we are 
also undertaking a wide variety of experiments and projects 
throughout Canada in terms of a guichet unique. We are providing 
ways in which all three levels of government can work together to 
provide a common one stop shopping service.
<P>
	For example, in Alberta there are a series of youth centres. Both 
the federal and provincial governments now combine to provide a 
very direct ability to deal with  long term unemployed youth in 
three of those centres. In early evaluations and in talking to Alberta 
officials, we are finding a much higher success rate because we 
combined services and young people can come to one place and get 
that same kind of service.
<P>
	Another interesting example is in the province of Quebec, in 
Alma, the hometown of the Leader of the Opposition. My 
department, the SQDM, the local municipalities and local clubs are 
now combined in a single service delivery system.
<P>
	It is exceedingly strange that we are being attacked by those who 
say we are intruding but in fact we have a wide variety of those 
co-operative projects going on in the province of Quebec with the 
Government of Quebec. The reason we are doing that is because 
they work better that way. This is at the working level. It is not at 
the level of the top bureaucrats or politicians who love to talk about 
the grand design. It is at the working community level. We are 
dealing directly with the service in towns like Alma, Jonquière, and 
other places where there are these combined services.
<P>
<B>(1140)</B>
<P>
	The key to success is that people find it much more effective, 
much more helpful and much more productive for them as 
individuals. Is that not what it is about? Is that not what 
government is about? Those are the kinds of changes we are 
undertaking.
<P>
	It also means we will go back and look at many of the old 
programs which were developed 20 or 30 years ago, some of which 
I helped to develop when I was a minister back in the early eighties, 
for example the national training act. We must ask if they work any 
more.
<P>
	During this past year we have undertaken very extensive 
evaluations testing what does and does not work. We have 
produced a series of 24 different evaluation reports which are 
publicly available. They provide a very good assessment as to what 
kind of involvement or participation makes sense in the areas of 
benefits, youth, et cetera. Based upon those evaluations, which we 
have already highlighted, we are providing a substantial distillation 
of our programs from 39 or 40 programs down to five programs, 
five basic tools.
<P>
	I will take a moment to articulate this most clearly. These five 
tools will provide the opportunity for decisions to be made at the 
local employment centre level instead of having to respond to some 
program designed and manufactured in Ottawa or the regional 
office. Decisions can be made right at the community level with the 
local partners, the provinces, municipalities, businesses and social 
agencies. They can tailor how those tools can be most effectively 
used to deal with the unemployment problem in a specific locale.
<P>
	It is decentralization of a very different kind. There has been a 
lot of talk and we have read much in the paper about 
decentralization. So far it has been a  somewhat restricted debate as 
it talks only 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16412"> 16412 </A></B>
<P>
about decentralization in terms of transferring from the federal 
government to provincial governments.
<P>
	Should we not also be talking about how to empower 
communities and individuals to make more choices? Is that not 
what we should be looking at in terms of decentralization? Should 
we not be looking at how governments become partners and 
facilitators in the local community context? Not only do we find a 
much more effective way to deal with the unemployment problem 
in a specific community, but we can also begin to help strengthen 
and enhance those communities themselves.
<P>
	Social analysts have made a very good and profound 
contribution by recognizing that with all the pressures of the global 
economy and new technologies, one of the consequences has been 
the unravelling of what they call a civic society. Those intermediate 
organizations, trade unions, social agencies, community based 
organizations no longer have the same capacity to respond.
<P>
	I will give a personal working example. When I was in school, 
just a few years ago-
<P>
	<B>Mr. McCormick:</B> Very few, yes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Axworthy (Winnipeg South Centre):</B> You don't have to 
snicker.
<P>
	One of my summer jobs was working on recreation programs for 
a boy's club, which was associated with the local United Church in 
inner city Winnipeg. We brought in 40 or 50 volunteers per night to 
provide student recreation programs at the local level in an area 
where children did not have much opportunity.
<P>
	A month or so ago I was talking to a woman who was a 
contemporary of mine. She had been involved in the program and 
had become heavily involved in the work of the United Church in 
offering this program. I asked her whether she still did those 
programs and she replied: ``No, we spend money lobbying people 
like you''. That is an interesting change. Rather than investing their 
dollars in terms of providing a rooted, community based activity 
directly designed to meet those problems, they were mobilizing to 
lobby the government.
<P>
<B>(1145)</B>
<P>
	Is there a way we can make government a partner in that area? Is 
there a way government can help the local boys' club or church 
organization? That is why I want to decentralize the department. It 
will give far more discretion, far more autonomy and far more 
accountability at the local level so it can make decisions and work 
out its business plans. I believe this is a very exciting opportunity.
<P>
	The other night in Winnipeg there was a major conference put on 
by the Institute for Advanced Research on children's problems. The 
institute brought together from across Canada about 20 different 
agencies which were pioneers in bringing together community  
based responses to the problems of children and youth at risk. It 
was a heart warming and encouraging experience. We saw how 
schools, agencies, local police, local municipalities, the provinces 
and our department all came together at the same time to provide a 
range of services. They could make use of the resources. Rather 
than having single silos or pyramids built all over town, they were 
now bringing them together.
<P>
	Their request to us was to have an information network which 
would link them across Canada so they can share experiences and 
resources, so they can get common procurement and look at 
common training for their workers. That is a simple way of 
hooking them up to the information network.
<P>
	Look at the connection. One of the reforms we are introducing in 
our department is the new labour market information system across 
Canada. Individuals can tap into that system to find jobs whether 
they are in Gander or in Prince Rupert. If we can provide the same 
information network to those child centres, all of a sudden we have 
substantially enhanced their resource with very little cost to us and 
we have made them much more effective in their local 
communities. That is the vision the department is trying to put 
forward.
<P>
	How do we take this very large department, which has 27,000 
employees and a budget of $60 billion, and really make it an active, 
involved participant at the community level along with its other 
partners?
<P>
	At times I show some frustration at the old debate about which 
level of bureaucracy will control the money. I am saying the real 
problem is at the community level. That is where it really counts.
<P>
	It gives us the opportunity to help to clarify the roles between 
levels of government. Contrary to the charge that there is a big 
intrusion, one of the direct results of the department will be to give 
far more space for provincial governments to begin to make 
decisions at their level of responsibility and jurisdiction. I firmly 
believe that. The time has come for us to take a much closer look at 
the respective roles and to build bridges to bring us together.
<P>
	That is why we have formally invited the provinces to work with 
the Government of Canada on the decentralization of the delivery 
of services so we can tailor them to local labour market needs. That 
is the key. We cannot do it unilaterally, as some provinces want; we 
must do it together.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	As the federal government simplifies its programs and further 
defines their scope, the roles of both levels of government will be 
clarified, and major sectors of the labour market will be open to the 
provinces.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16413"> 16413 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1150)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	That is a very major task we have set for ourselves. We have 
already started a number of discussions with many provinces about 
how we can do exactly that. One of the most important results of 
the new legislation we are preparing which will be introduced very 
shortly will give us the ability to make a much better, more 
effective clarification of the respective roles and to create far more 
space for provinces to make their decisions.
<P>
	Rather than getting into the bare knuckle federalism that some 
people in the House have advocated, in which they seem to enjoy 
confrontation, it is time to start building a partnership of 
federalism. In that wonderful world of Judith Maxwell, one of our 
important social and economic confreres, said: ``Is it it not time 
governments look at the potential of federalism, not its problems, 
not its disputes, but the potential of federalism?'' That is what we 
are trying to discover and search out as we deal with the new issues, 
the potential of federalism, the potential we can bring together.
<P>
	As I said earlier, we have already succeeded in building that in a 
number of new delivery systems. Let me give an example of the 
things in the past year we have been able to do working with the 
provinces in those areas.
<P>
	One good example is from Newfoundland dealing with a serious 
problem, as my colleague from St. John's knows well. We 
established a collaborative approach to deal with youth 
unemployment. As a result of the student work and service 
program, 2,700 young people including 1,000 on social assistance 
were given an opportunity to work for a period of 16 weeks in 
either the private sector or community agencies. Upon completion 
of that work they were given a voucher and could then choose to go 
back to school or use it for self-employment.
<P>
	A full 97 per cent of those young people on social assistance 
have used or intend to use those vouchers to go back to school. 
They worked, they earned it, they have the voucher and now they 
understand the importance of education. That was done with full 
collaboration between two levels of government working with 
youth agencies, schools and colleges in that area.
<P>
	Does that kind of thing not indicate exactly how collaboration is 
better than confrontation, division and separation? That is the way 
to get things done, by working at that level of opportunity.
<P>
	Let me give another example from British Columbia where 
certain ministers are claiming we do nothing. There is a major child 
care project going on, almost $30 million invested through our 
strategic initiative. Again, we sat down and worked it out. We 
asked how we could provide a better service in child car. The 
province took the lead in the design and implementation and we 
provided the resource through which it could establish community 
based child care centres that provide a series  of services for 30 or 
40 child care activities. They provide a common procurement, 
common training, respite care for parents who need it.
<P>
	The evaluations I shared with a minister in British Columbia 
again demonstrating we have saved the child care system money 
because there is a common based service. Those individual child 
care units can provide a better range of services because there are 
special remedial programs for disabled children which can be 
shared among a number of units. That collaboration has resulted in 
better planning within the community level about how children can 
be looked after at the community level.
<P>
	This makes sense, rather than getting into the bare knuckles. It is 
better to realize the real issue is children and how we can work 
together to provide that kind of service.
<P>
	Another good example in Quebec is the APPORT program which 
the province pioneered with the previous government. It has 
provided a form of assistance and testing those on social assistance 
so they can go back to school or to work with the use of an income 
supplement. While the debate about separation was raging, we 
were negotiating with the Government of Quebec about how we 
could combine and collaborate jointly fund the APPORT program 
and extend it to new kinds of clients so that we could find a way of 
enabling people, rather than staying on social assistance, to find 
self-sufficiency and independence in their lives and find a job. This 
is again an example that while the great political battles are waging 
over here, at the community level we can do something very useful, 
very effective and very helpful.
<P>
<B>(1155)</B>
<P>
	That is one level of the kind of partnership we see as the abiding 
philosophy we want to put forward. Another very important 
problem all members of the House are concerned about, because 
we see it every day in our constituencies, is our young people. They 
have a much tougher time than our generation had. They have far 
fewer opportunities because of the higher demands for skill and 
education. They have far less certainty about what the future holds 
because the future is so much in turbulence and turmoil.
<P>
	However there are ways we can work together in partnership. 
One of the areas we are exploring most actively is how to work 
with the private sector in this area. The most crucial area and where 
there have been serious problems is when young people finish their 
formal education. How do they open the door to new kinds of work 
experiences? How do they make that transition, build that bridge?
<P>
	Our department has been working on the establishment of a 
series of human resource sector councils. We now have 19 in place. 
These bring together employees and employers, unions and 
management to  work out a human resource plan for their own 
industry: electronics, software, tourism, horticulture, culture. They 
recognize, again through experience, is by bringing workers and 
management together they can do much better than having them 
separated. They also recognize they have very serious gaps in skills 
in those sectors and they are working to improve them.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16414"> 16414 </A></B>
<P>
	We have just signed an agreement with the Grocery Products 
Manufacturers Council two weeks ago, the second largest 
manufacturing group in Canada with about 300,000 employees. 
Half its employees do not have the level of education required to 
meet the new kinds of technologies now coming into that business. 
Therefore they will start with basic on the job literacy programs. 
The private sector helps to support this program and the provincial 
governments provide support for the private sector which is taking 
the responsibility to manage the program.
<P>
	Councils could provide very important conclusions in youth 
internships in which we could provide the opportunity, managed 
and driven by the private sector, to take responsibility for our 
young people to make that transition. It means that in schools in all 
provinces there are young people who work half days through a 
private sector opportunity and go to school half days. The 
curriculum and standards have been designed jointly by the private 
sector council and the local school or provincial agency.
<P>
	This year 25,000 young Canadians will have the opportunity to 
be involved in that kind of youth internship program. Again, it is a 
partnership: government with the private sector; government with 
the local school boards; government with the provinces. That is the 
kind of philosophy we have to continually talk about because that is 
what works.
<P>
	That is what the department is about, finding what works based 
on dealing with the real individual needs of Canadians and getting 
better services to them, but also developing a real set of 
partnerships that will enable us to reach out and cross over to find 
the linkages, bridges and connections throughout the country with 
our fellow governments, the private sector and community style 
agencies to combine resources and focus our efforts specifically on 
enabling individual Canadians to make a difference and to make a 
change.
<P>
	Therefore I strongly recommend to the House the legislation we 
have before us. I hope members will see it for what it really is, not 
based on the old prisms and optics of the past, which is to say this is 
federal or that is provincial, but on the prisms and optics of the 
future, which is to say let us redefine government as partners with 
individuals, partners with communities and as partners with each 
other. That is the real philosophy that underlies the new 
Department of Human Resources Development.
<P>
<B>(1200)</B>
<P>
	With the accord and support of the House, we can get this 
legislation in place. It would give us the authority to bring together 
the powers of the old department and provide a coherent, concise 
focus on helping Canadians meet the challenges of a new century.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. A little 
earlier today there was a question raised in the House about 
whether or not the vote that was deferred until Monday at 6 p.m. by 
the deputy government whip was appropriately deferred.
<P>
	I want to confirm to the House that consultations were held by 
the whips. Pursuant to Standing Order 45(7), the vote was properly 
deferred pursuant to the consultations which had taken place as 
early as Tuesday of this week.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> In response to the point of 
order by the hon. member for Yorkton-Melville, since we appear 
to have agreement of the whips of all recognized parties, under 
Standing Order 45(7), the vote on the amendment for the third 
reading of Bill C-94 will take place at 6 p.m., Monday, November 
20.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B> Madam Speaker, we 
have no objection to the vote being held at 6 p.m. rather than 6.30 
p.m. It should have been clearly stated when it was presented to the 
House that consent had been reached by all the whips.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am sorry, that is not a 
point of order.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, the 
minister who tabled the bill implies that his bill is a model of 
flexibility, co-ordination, decentralization, and letting the average 
citizen decide. Unfortunately, that is not the case, since it all 
depends on whether the minister is prepared to say yes or no to a 
project, any project.
<P>
	In the final analysis, the minister will decide what will be 
decentralized, who will get a grant, who may co-ordinate, because 
ultimately, the decision will always be his. This bill is the exact 
opposite of flexible. This bill is unbending, and its author did not 
listen to Quebec.
<P>
	Coming ten days after a referendum in which the people of 
Quebec spoke loud and clear, while giving Canada a brief respite to 
shape up, this bill is an insult. It is easy for the minister to say: Let 
us set prerogatives and jurisdictions aside and co-operate, when in 
this legislation he assumes powers he never had under the 
constitution, powers he had the colossal nerve to extrapolate from 
his spending powers and which he today wants to legalize in a bill.
<P>
<B>(1205)</B>
<P>
	With complete disregard for efficiency in the use of shrinking 
resources and for the constitution, this bill for the first time clearly 
gives the federal Minister of Human Resources Development the 
power to replace the provinces in many of their jurisdictions, since, 
and we will see this later on, it literally allows the minister, as it 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16415"> 16415 </A></B>
<P>
says in the clause, to make decisions on all matters relating to 
human resources development in Canada, no less.
<P>
	Far from withdrawing from provincial jurisdictions, the federal 
government is in fact assuming general responsibility for human 
resources development. The federal government is assuming the 
powers it needs, whether the provinces like it or not, although some 
do, but that is another matter and we will get back to that, but 
Quebec was not consulted, and when it was, it said in no uncertain 
terms what it wanted. The federal government is getting ready to 
change the social safety net, with no regard for the impact this will 
have on the provinces and especially on the individuals concerned.
<P>
	This is a new phase, a qualitative leap in the development of 
Canadian federalism which tries to provide a legislative basis for 
this invasion by the federal government's spending power. The 
government has decided unilaterally to provide a legal, specific and 
positive basis for its spending power, which it often used to spend 
its way into debt. Today, the debt is being decentralized to the 
provinces, but the power has been recentralized to Ottawa.
<P>
	This confirms our worst fears, and we discussed this during the 
referendum campaign. For instance, instead of announcing a 
withdrawal of the federal presence from manpower, this bill 
accentuates that presence by giving the federal government the 
requisite powers to negotiate and make deals directly with local 
agencies, without prior consent from the provinces. That is what 
the minister calls being flexible. Even municipalities may be 
approached and offered responsibilities under contracts to be 
concluded directly with the Department of Human Resources 
Development.
<P>
	A good example is what happened during the so-called battle of 
the employment centres. We have yet to hear the epilogue to this 
story. Bill C-96 throws wide open the door to the delegation of the 
powers entrusted to the minister or the new employment and 
insurance commission-I will get back to this-to entities other 
than provincial governments and public administrations.
<P>
	In other words, this bill, without any consultations, also opens 
the door to privatization and contracting out. Again, this is to be 
done on the minister's say so; if this bill is passed, he will be in a 
position to adopt any standards he wants and to define expected 
results. All those involved-including provinces, if he feels like it, 
organizations, people and financial institutions-will have to be 
totally flexible in complying with his decisions.  This will remain 
true even though he says he wants to make employment centres 
responsible for some programs, since these centres will also be 
accountable to the minister.
<P>
<B>(1210)</B>
<P>
	If Bill C-96 is passed, it will also put in place the legislative 
framework allowing the Minister of Human Resources 
Development to go ahead with his UI reform according to the 
policy outlines revealed in the past few days. This policy is fully 
consistent with the bill.
<P>
	I would like to stress a disturbing fact. This bill, whose only 
purpose, according to the minister, is to join together previously 
separate departments or programs, is Kim Campbell's legacy to the 
Liberals.
<P>
	It is important to remember that, during her short-lived 
government, she gathered under the same roof all departments 
dealing with unemployment insurance, income security for both 
seniors and young people, literacy, student loans, employment 
training, and family policies. She did this as part of a major reform 
of social programs, as she said during the election campaign. Over 
50 per cent of the federal government's budget spending is done, 
decided, directed, and controlled by this new Department of 
Human Resources Development.
<P>
	The Tories did not hide the fact that they wanted to carry out a 
comprehensive reform. Let us not forget that, during the following 
election campaign, Liberal candidate Chrétien hounded the 
minister for saying, and we remember this, that this issue was too 
complex to be debated during an election campaign.
<P>
	When questioned, the Liberals never suggested that they were 
only waiting to be elected before doing what Kim Campbell wanted 
to do. It is important to keep this in mind. It is important to show 
that when the Liberals came to power, instead of putting the 
departments back the way they were, they took advantage of the 
major upheaval ordered by senior officials who are still there. This 
clearly shows that the Liberal policy is the same as the old Tory 
policy, which is the same as that proposed in 1985 by the 
Macdonald Commission set up, as we know, by Mr. Trudeau's 
Liberal government.
<P>
	Let us have a look-and I will quote the minister himself-at the 
new department's jurisdiction. In his budget plan tabled on 
February 27, 1995, he said that Human Resources Development 
Canada was in charge of the UI program, the income security 
program for children and seniors, a major part of family policy, 
existing federal programs of assistance to the provinces for 
post-secondary education and social assistance, labour market 
adjustment, social development and student loans. This accounts 
for more than 50 per cent of federal expenditures.
<P>
	The federal government is playing a major role in the daily lives 
of Canadians without having to consult anyone, when it is literally 
altering the social and  economic picture in Canada. But Quebec 
should be left to get organized to look after the people let down by 
the federal government.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16416"> 16416 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1215)</B>
<P>
	Quebec is expected to live with the consequences of this 
government's actions, that is to say, at a time when, as we know, 
deficits are high, let the middle class bear the brunt of the tax load, 
target assistance to the most disadvantaged, eventually creating a 
rather difficult situation, all this without being required in any way 
to consult the Quebec government, which is the only government 
representing the people and nation of Quebec.
<P>
	Must we remind members that a people that is different from 
others sets up its own social, economic, cultural and political 
structure that is not necessarily better but different, based on its 
priorities and its needs. Merely ten days after the October 30 vote, 
what Bill C-96 is saying is that the central government, through the 
Minister of Human Resources Development, will go ahead with its 
plans for reform and keep making decisions affecting the social 
fabric of Quebec without having to consult anyone.
<P>
	No wonder it is telling us: ``Forget jurisdictions. It does not 
matter any more''. It is taking over, making an unprecedented 
power grab in areas of responsibility that are not its own, by 
misusing its spending power to provide direction, decide, take 
charge.
<P>
	Let us take a look at some clauses. The people have the right to 
know. The bill reads, in part: ``The powers, duties and functions of 
the Minister extend to-they can say that again-and include all 
matters over which Parliament has jurisdiction relating to the 
development of the human resources of Canada-that is an even 
wider area than the specific ones I mentioned-not by law assigned 
to any other Minister, department, board or agency of the 
Government of Canada, and are to be exercised with the objective 
of enhancing employment, encouraging equality and promoting 
social security''.
<P>
	The federal government is trying to take over from the 
Government of Quebec a very wide and ill defined area of 
responsibility, human resources development.
<P>
	It never had that power. True, unemployment insurance 
legislation was put in place, but that required a constitutional 
amendment. Unemployment insurance and UI benefits are one 
thing, but we know that the government never had the power to 
decide and to provide direction it is now claiming over manpower 
training. Quite the contrary.
<P>
	And what about family policy, poverty, literacy, dropouts? The 
government first used its spending power to interfere, and now it is 
making this intrusion legal.
<P>
	Let us move to clause 7.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>7. In exercising the powers or performing the duties or functions assigned to 
the Minister under this or any other Act of Parliament, the Minister may-</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(<I>b</I>) cooperate with provincial authorities with a view to the coordination of 
efforts-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	There is no requirement to do so.
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
	Indeed, if you look at clause 20, it reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>For the purpose of facilitating the formulation, coordination and 
implementation of any program or policy-the Minister may enter into 
agreements with a province-agencies of provinces, financial institutions and 
such other persons or bodies as the Minister considers appropriate.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The minister decides whether or not he wants to hold 
consultations. He can delegate any power to the Minister of 
Labour, the commission or any other person or body he chooses.
<P>
	This is important, because the desire to take over the provinces' 
responsibility for their own fields of jurisdiction has, as we know, a 
different impact on Quebec than it does on the other provinces. A 
debate seems to be taking place outside Quebec concerning the 
social program reform, or a reform of federalism. Some want to 
maintain centralization, while others are in favour of 
decentralization.
<P>
	We understand that, but we want to say this: those who think that 
there is a will on this government's part to decentralize should open 
their eyes and their ears, and they should read these provisions. 
They will realize that what is in the making is not decentralization 
but, on the contrary, what one might call recentralization. Indeed, 
the central government is giving itself the means to directly decide 
what will happen at the local level.
<P>
	It is easy for the minister to say: ``Yes, citizen A or citizen B will 
be able to decide to-'' That is not the case. The minister is the one 
who will really make the decision. He is the one who will decide 
and it will not be possible for a province wishing to integrate its 
programs to do so. We will let the debate proceed, but we had to 
make this point.
<P>
	As for Quebec, it has been fighting Ottawa's centralizing views 
for a long time, because it conflicts with its own desire to have a 
well-adjusted or co-ordinated, as René Lévesque used to say, social 
and economic policy. Let me just mention that, before the Second 
World War, the Rowell-Sirois commission began preparing the 
ground-and would later complete the process-to ensure that, in 
Canada, major budgetary social and economic decisions would all 
be taken by Ottawa, with the provinces becoming mere flexible 
subcontractors.
<P>
	The bill introduced by the human resources development 
minister is not new but is certainly in line with the 
recommendations of the Rowell-Sirois commission. However, 
succeeding governments in  Quebec have always fought hard to 
maintain control over the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16417"> 16417 </A></B>
<P>
province's social and economic development. The war helped the 
central government, by allowing it to centralize all taxes. Once it 
had a foot in the door, Ottawa would not back out.
<P>
	In Quebec, the public, co-operative organizations, as well as 
grass-roots movements, created a coalition, somewhat like the one 
which we witnessed during the referendum campaign, and told then 
premier Duplessis: ``Quebec needs its own taxes''.
<P>
<B>(1225)</B>
<P>
	That tax is what allowed the then exuberant Quiet Revolution to 
be channelled into specific projects.
<P>
	At the federal-provincial conference on poverty in 1965, René 
Lévesque, who was to become the first sovereignist premier of 
Quebec and was then a federalist minister in a Liberal government, 
gave a very clear explanation of what the position of his federalist 
Liberal government was at the time.
<P>
	I quoted him in relation to Bill C-95 but, if you will allow me, I 
shall repeat the quotes here for the benefit of our audience and for 
argument's sake. I do so for the simple reason that they show that 
Quebec has made no progress between 1965 and 1995 in 
controlling its own future. It has regressed. Quebecers have seen 
their situation worsen. Concretely-applying it to manpower-the 
people find themselves face to face with two levels of 
decision-making, to their disadvantage.
<P>
	René Lévesque said that it had become imperative to establish a 
genuine economic and social policy. This policy needed to be 
integrated, flexible in its mechanisms, include a social security 
system centred on the family and be based on the right to assistance 
on the basis of need. Secondly, he said, for the sake of efficiency 
and on constitutional grounds, the Quebec government alone could 
and should, within its own territory, design and implement such a 
policy. I repeat, for the sake of efficiency first, and on 
constitutional grounds.
<P>
	Thirdly, Lévesque said, the social and economic development 
policy they had formulated would create an integrated social 
policy-I would interject here that the foregoing is the key 
phrase-regional development policy, manpower policy, health 
policy, housing policy and job training policy.
<P>
	Finally, he said that, as a federalist, the general policy, while he 
did not necessarily condemn it, did not necessarily correspond, in 
terms of its spirit and terms of application, to one the Government 
of Canada might opt for. The people of Quebec would enjoy at least 
as many if not more benefits than other Canadians might.
<P>
	For the sake of efficiency, for the sake of determining economic 
and social policy as a function of needs and priorities, at a time 
when money is scarce, it is urgent for Quebec's economic and 
social policy to be integrated.  Nothing, however, could be further 
from integration than this Bill C-96, which makes the Minister of 
Human Resources Development the key figure in that organization, 
as he has so aptly said himself.
<P>
	In the manpower field in particular, there is unanimity in 
Quebec, and this has been expressed by another resolution by the 
Société québécoise de développement de la main-d'oeuvre, which 
comprises banking co-operatives, school boards, the Conseil du 
patronat, along with municipal institutions, co-operative 
businesses-just about everybody, you might say.
<P>
	The Société québécoise de développement de la main-d'oeuvre, 
on the proposal of Mr. Béland and with the support of Ghislain 
Dufour, made a unanimous decision to ask the government-the 
federal government to be precise-not to put in place a parallel 
partnership structure or try to interfere with Quebec's jurisdiction 
over manpower development.
<P>
<B>(1230)</B>
<P>
	The board also indicated that the Société québécoise de 
développement de la main-d'oeuvre is and must remain the 
favoured partnership structure regarding Quebec manpower issues. 
Must I remind the House that this organization is not a government 
organization, but one whose members represent private groups. 
This is the organization through which the manpower policy is 
implemented. It stresses, almost imploringly, that the federal 
government is set to put in place another network, adding an extra 
level of consultation, decision and assessment.
<P>
	This is not a reflection of the central government's will to 
eliminate duplication and overlap, but of its will to take over 
everywhere, pushing the provinces aside and sidelining Quebec. 
Because it must be borne in mind that the cutbacks announced in 
relation to the Canada social transfer will result, in 1997-98, in a 
$1.9 billion shortfall on top of all the other cuts.
<P>
	Quebec is going to go through some rough times. Meanwhile, 
the central government and its HRD minister are letting UI fund 
surpluses accumulate, so that they can play Santa Claus by going 
over the Quebec government's head and spend this money in 
provincial areas of jurisdiction. But contributions to the UI fund 
come directly from employers and workers.
<P>
	The minister of employment and consultation herself vigorously 
denounced his bill. She says that: ``Like its labour market partners, 
the Quebec government denounces Ottawa's intentions to set up its 
own parallel manpower structures in Quebec. This federal initiative 
amounts to a flat rejection of the unanimous Quebec consensus, 
repeatedly expressed, both under the previous administration and 
under the current one, on the need for Quebec to regain control over 
all labour adjustment measures, including the related budgets''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16418"> 16418 </A></B>
<P>
	Lise Bissonnette referred, in several editorials, to this increased 
desire to interfere, the term is not strong enough because the 
federal really wants to assume Quebec's power to make its own 
political and economic decisions. This is not the first attempt by 
the central government to bypass the Quebec government and 
manpower corporation.
<P>
	Former minister Valcourt tried to do the same. Remember who 
told him off? None other than Liberal minister Bourbeau, also a 
federalist, who said: ``Your commission does offer grants to what it 
calls co-ordination groups for all sorts of projects, directly or 
indirectly related to manpower training. These groups include all 
kinds of associations. Such projects seem relatively pertinent, but 
others are more questionable''.
<P>
	He then said: ``Obviously, this is a new structure used by the 
federal government to spend money which comes primarily from 
the UI fund''.
<P>
	He also added: ``What is unacceptable with this approach is that 
it is totally improvised, this at a time when, more than ever, 
government intervention in the manpower development sector 
must be planned according to priorities, so as to deal efficiently 
with issues such as manpower shortage, retraining in growing 
economic sectors, as well as improvement of skills, and thus 
benefit from market globalization''.
<P>
<B>(1235)</B>
<P>
	Minister Bourbeau continued by saying: ``I find it hard to 
believe that the federal government would wilfully do things 
which, under the pretence of initiating a rapprochement with the 
private sector, would result in the establishment of a network of 
intermediaries, given that it pledged it would not do such a thing''.
<P>
	I only alluded to manpower training because it is a very sensitive 
issue at a time when Quebec is, sadly, the champion of poverty, 
with an unemployment rate still at 11.2 per cent, and with Montreal 
in 23rd place, out of 26 Canadian cities, in terms of income level. 
We, Bloc Quebecois members, will do everything possible to 
ensure that Quebec does not remain in that situation. Less than 10 
days after the referendum, instead of listening to us, they impose 
with an iron hand diktats that do not meet Quebec's economic and 
social needs and priorities.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, I move, seconded by the hon. member for La 
Prairie:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That all words following the word ``That'' be deleted and replaced with the 
following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
``this House declines to give second reading to Bill C-96, An Act to establish the 
Department of Human Resources Development and to amend and repeal 
certain related Acts, because the principle of the Bill includes no provision 
requiring the Minister, as part of that person's powers, to award full and entire 
financial compensation to any province wishing  to exercise, fully and alone, 
jurisdiction over human resources development.''
<P>
	If the government would only give a sign that it has heard 
Quebecers' majority vote calling unanimously for major changes, 
especially with respect to manpower. It could have given a sign. By 
moving second reading of this utterly offensive bill, the 
government shows no concern for efficiency and integration, for 
Quebec's need to co-ordinate all its resources at a difficult time, for 
the Constitution, for the wishes expressed once again by 100 per 
cent of Quebecers.
<P>
	Consideration of this bill will allow us to say that this dialogue 
of the deaf, which has been going on for so long and which hurts 
both Quebec and probably Canada, must end. Should Canada, 
however, end the dialogue by refusing to listen, Quebecers know 
which way they must go to take control of their own destiny. In the 
interests of the whole population of Quebec, of the whole Quebec 
nation, Quebecers have shown the way that they will have no 
choice but to follow.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> The amendment is in 
order.
<P>
	The debate is now on the amendment.
<P>
<B>(1240)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
am pleased to speak to Bill C-96 today.
<P>
	At first glance one might think that a creation bill such as this is 
little reason to engage in debate, but there is indeed much we need 
to discuss. It is not so much what the bill says but the issues that 
underlie the bill that merit a resounding rejection.
<P>
	Before I begin I would like to examine a recent event that speaks 
to why I stand before the House to express my rejection of Bill 
C-96.
<P>
	As members of the House know, our country is submerged in 
troubling times. The referendum in Quebec has paralysed the 
House, the Liberal government and in particular the Minister of 
Human Resources Development. Promises made in the red book 
have fallen by the wayside as the government has chosen to do 
nothing, fearing the consequences of decisive action.
<P>
	My party stated clearly at the outset of the referendum that we 
favoured a strong and united Canada. To this end, we made positive 
contributions to the debate. We outlined a very clear position for a 
new confederation. Our plan would change Canada for the better 
and bring our country into the next century healthy, vibrant and 
able to cope with its new challenges. Unfortunately for Canada, the 
no campaign launched a strategy based on a do nothing approach. It 
believed the status quo would work. In short order, however, it 
became obvious that this strategy was a complete and utter failure.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16419"> 16419 </A></B>
<P>
	Our Prime Minister had a 10-point lead in the polls and lost 
it all. In a move motivated by panic and fear he committed a huge 
virage. After having categorically rejected constitutional changes, 
after having categorically rejected administrative changes, the 
Prime Minister capitulated at the last minute and offered up 
constitutional changes and distinct society. As we all know, this 
tired rhetoric was soundly rejected by Canadians, not once but 
twice.
<P>
	Let me remind the Liberals that one of their titans, Mr. Trudeau, 
thoroughly and publicly denounced this strategy on Monday of this 
week.
<P>
	In light of the Prime Minister's virage, Canadians are expecting 
great changes from the government. However, in the week that has 
just passed, do we have any indication of change? I think not. 
Instead of change, the Minister of Human Resources Development 
is attempting to sell us this flawed bill, which not only grabs more 
powers for the federal government but also fails to introduce one 
single noteworthy measure of administrative change.
<P>
	I will speak on a number of areas the substance of Bill C-96 
eliminates. My comments will touch briefly on these areas: 
specific concern with some of the bill's provisions; the 
government's trivial attempt at post-secondary education reforms; 
the government's non-existent approach to decentralization; the 
government's brazen attempt at accountability; and the 
government's invisible strategy for reform of the Canada pension 
plan. All these issues will show beyond a reasonable doubt that the 
House has only one option: it must clearly and soundly reject the 
bill.
<P>
	In the bill the minister is accorded the power to deal directly with 
groups and municipalities for the delivery of social programs. This 
power circumvents the provinces directly and attempts to keep 
them out of the decision making process. This is disconcerting, as 
it is the provinces that have constitutional authority for social 
program delivery. This power contained in clauses 20 and 21 of the 
bill further demonstrates the government's penchant for power 
grabbing and invasive behaviour.
<P>
<B>(1245 )</B>
<P>
	The bill also allows for the appointment of a minister for labour. 
If the government feels the need to increase the size of its cabinet 
then it should admit so publicly, rather than doing it through the 
back door like this. The government has an obligation to be 
forthright in its reasoning. If I were a cynic I might suggest this 
change amounted to nothing more than the creation of a position at 
the cabinet table for the no campaign strategist, the hon. member 
for Saint-Henri-Westmount. I will not imply motive as I am an 
optimist. Instead I will leave it to Canadians to judge this for 
themselves.
<P>
	I would like to steer the discussion toward education. There can 
be no doubt that education forms the bedrock of a successful 
nation. Bill C-96 represents the creation of a department which 
oversees the federal role in education policy. The bill is a stark 
reminder that the government has no vision for an education policy 
which will meet the needs of Canada's students into the 21st 
century. The bill also reminds us that the government has failed in 
its attempts to create changes to revitalize post-secondary 
education.
<P>
	By looking at the trends of globalization and retrenchment, we 
see not only where the government has failed but, more important, 
where the Reform Party offers a substantially stronger vision in this 
regard.
<P>
	Herman Melville once said that we are not a nation so much as a 
world. This statement is as incisive as it is intimidating. 
Unwittingly it speaks volumes of the major shifts taking place 
today in all aspects of our world. For just as the business world is 
confronting the pressures of globalization to be more productive 
and competitive, so too are universities encountering the necessity 
to provide students with better tools to help Canada remain 
competitive.
<P>
	There is at present a growing concern among educators in 
Canada that students are entering the world market without the 
requisite education and training to help them meet the needs of 
their chosen vocation. The skills mismatch. The global job crisis. 
Reinventing education. All of these are familiar battle cries of 
observers writing in North American journals warning of this 
disturbing trend.
<P>
	Schools need to be relevant to reflect the realities of the modern 
world and to help train present and future workers who are capable 
of helping their employers, in whatever field, achieve higher levels 
of performance and productivity. For example, the challenge facing 
schools is to prepare future leaders to think critically about the 
forces and requirements that shape business operations in global 
markets and in different cross-cultural contexts.
<P>
	What leadership do we have from the government in the area of 
internationalization and education? Little to none. The Canadian 
Bureau of International Education has reported that Canada's 
performance in this area is the lowest among all G-7 countries. In 
fact, the bureau found that the United States spends somewhat in 
the order of 20 times what Canada spends in this regard. We are not 
talking about increasing aggregate spending, but rather 
reconfiguring current spending to reflect our strategic needs.
<P>
	The federal government simply has to be a player in the area of 
international education. In the short term a Reform government 
would work to do the following. Strengthen the policy dialogue 
with provincial governments and higher education institutions 
through regular and systematic consultation and information 
exchange at all levels. Increase networking and reinforce 
collaborative ventures among higher education institutions in 
priority regions and in priority areas of  research. Foster the 
development of stronger partnerships among higher education 
institutions, professional associations and public authorities, 
business and other organizations which have a stake in the quality 
of higher education and research. Facilitate and encourage key 
stakeholders, such as the provinces and territories, national 
standards bodies and associations representing the learning 
community, industry, business and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16420"> 16420 </A></B>
<P>
labour to develop competency based skill tests which are matched 
to learning outcomes developed by learning organizations.
<P>
	I want to examine a second trend, namely that of fiscal 
retrenchment. We are all agreed that the dismal state of public 
finances in Canada places a tremendous burden on the capacity of 
government to address any issue. This is particularly true in the 
case of education. Having said that, we must not let education be 
circumvented by, as the Smith commission noted in 1991, short 
term, make shift responses that have postponed temporarily the day 
of reckoning. I do not propose that we ignore the realities of 
retrenchment, but that we address our fiscal plight with a strategic 
mind set.
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
	We must re-examine the way we fund our post-secondary 
institutions. Specifically we need to re-examine student loans and 
transfers to provinces for education.
<P>
	The Department of Human Resources Development, which the 
bill will create, has done virtually nothing to take a lead role in 
promoting a new vision for education financing in Canada. Instead 
it has discussed, tinkered and carelessly cut.
<P>
	Let us review this disappointing history. The 1994 discussion 
paper on reforming social security talked vaguely about life long 
learning. The document was long on rhetoric and short on details. It 
talked in generalities, as most discussion papers do. We do not need 
discussion. We need action. We need fresh and creative approaches 
to confront the plight of our education financing mechanism.
<P>
	Bill C-28, passed in June 1994, made some modest 
improvements to the Canada student loans program. It removed 
financial liability from the government, which is good. However, it 
represents a stopgap measure for a program that requires 
fundamental redesign.
<P>
	Some serious questions need to be answered by the government. 
For example, while the act made provisions to develop pilot 
program testing, new financing schemes, such as income 
contingent loans, it is not likely that anything will happen before 
1997. That is four years that Canadians will have waited for the 
government to act, four years that the government has neglected 
the need to address questions of access and sustainability.
<P>
	Another fundamental question that lingers is one of strategic 
intent. When loan eligibility is controlled by the  government, 
loans do not provide an incentive for students to enter areas of 
study where there is good occupational demand. Competitiveness 
and productivity must be linked to education. We must determine 
where there is need and focus our energies to promote education in 
those areas.
<P>
	The 1995-96 budget announced changes to the fiscal transfer 
regime by creating the Canada health and social transfer, known as 
CHST. Through the CHST the government carelessly cut transfers 
which support education financing and made it increasingly 
difficult for taxpayers to measure whether provinces are spending 
the appropriate amounts of money on specific programs.
<P>
	The government decided that it is better to give education dollars 
to the provinces with no strings attached than it is to give education 
dollars to individuals, where it can be ensured that tax dollars are 
going to support their intended purpose. The logic in this is 
spectacularly flawed.
<P>
	Bill C-96 will create a department that for two years has done 
nothing to make the fundamental changes required of our 
post-secondary education system. Why should we create a 
department, when we already know that it has no capacity to act on 
this issue?
<P>
	Let us move to decentralization, an issue that has garnered 
significant attention of late and, in particular, when the Minister of 
Human Resources Development presented his remarks earlier this 
morning. Bill C-96 is a centralizing piece of legislation, make no 
mistake, despite what the hon. minister said in the House today.
<P>
	Clause 6 of the bill reinforces the existing federal powers for 
social programs. In fact, it may even create new powers for the 
federal government. Even if this new power never manifests itself, 
the bill at a minimum entrenches the status quo of federal 
intervention into provincial areas of social policy jurisdiction.
<P>
	I find it cathartic, though I suppose not entirely uncharacteristic, 
that the government should try to enact legislation which engenders 
and champions the notion of centralization and of status quo. To do 
so amidst the decentralization forces pressuring the country to 
change is profoundly absurd.
<P>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
	Recent events have shown to all that fundamental change is 
required in our federation. There is almost universal agreement that 
the federal government needs to rethink its current role as a 
provider of services and programs. In areas of social policy, we 
cannot continue to support a system which separates the revenue 
raising capacity from the expenditure function. In other areas too 
there is strong evidence to support devolution to the most logical 
level of government.
<P>
	In October of this year the Reform Party released its vision for a 
new confederation. Reform believes that  decentralization will 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16421"> 16421 </A></B>
<P>
permit future governments to respond more effectively to the needs 
of ordinary Canadians. It also addresses many of the historic 
concerns of individuals from all provinces.
<P>
	Reform's plan includes the following: giving provinces 
exclusive control over natural resources, job training, municipal 
affairs, housing, tourism, sports and recreation; giving provinces 
control over setting their own interprovincial standards for health, 
welfare and education and replacing federal cash transfers with tax 
points, allowing provinces to raise their own taxes to finance social 
programs. This decentralization will lead to a more balanced 
federation, one in which Ottawa will play a co-operative role rather 
than a dominating role.
<P>
	The proposals outlined in the new Confederation speak to the 
long term. They furnish Canada with a vision. They put flesh on the 
conceptual bones of a new federalism. This is the kind of 
leadership that has been conspicuously absent in the federal 
Liberals.
<P>
	How can one govern without coherent direction? It is 
incomprehensible. I am not talking about prescience but about the 
courage to say, these are my ideas, this is my vision. We have seen 
none of that from the government. The traditional response to fiscal 
crisis has been centralization, consolidation and concentration. 
This instinct increasingly leads to failure. Centralized control and 
consolidated agencies create more waste, not less.
<P>
	There are many reasons why Reform speaks for this vision of 
decentralization. Decentralization will engender greater flexibility, 
allowing institutions to respond more quickly to changing 
circumstances and client needs.
<P>
	Decentralization will create more effective programs and service 
delivery as the deliverers and providers of government assistance 
are closer to those whom they serve, which is whom we serve. 
Decentralization will reduce wasteful overlap and duplication 
created by concurrent jurisdiction and poorly co-ordinated 
government programs and services. Decentralization will engender 
greater fiscal responsibility. For a government that spends the 
money it raises will inherently be more accountable than the one 
that spends the money someone else collects. Decentralization in 
regard to the tax system is most compatible with the tenet of 
federalism. The essence of a federal form of government is local 
autonomy. In its designated spheres each unit is free, free to 
exercise its policy discretion unemcumbered.
<P>
	It is important to remember in this debate on Bill C-96 that 
decentralization is neither a celebrated buzzword nor a passing 
political fad. It is a policy movement that has been vigorously 
championed in Canada since the 1960s. It represents reconfiguring 
the locus of attention in the federation. As former B.C. Liberal 
Party leader Gordon Gibson writes in his new book: ``Canadians 
ultimately want less control by Ottawa and more local management 
of their affairs-The basic concept here is `government closer to 
home'. Now home is where the  heart is in our private lives 
perhaps, but in government terms home is where the folk have the 
knowledge and resources to do the job. That single thought takes us 
a long way''.
<P>
	Adhering to the rule of thumb that the responsibility for 
addressing problems should lie with the lowest level of government 
possible does not require that we disavow the notion of federal 
leadership.
<P>
<B>(1300 )</B>
<P>
	A federal government with fewer employees, fewer departments, 
and smaller budgets can still have a steering role in Canadian 
society. There would still be a policy framework setting functions 
in certain areas, even if it delivered no services. These would 
include policy areas that transcend the capacities of state and local 
governments such as international trade, macroeconomic policy 
and much environmental and regulatory policy; social insurance 
programs like employment compensation, where paying equal 
benefits to all citizens requires that rich and poor share 
differentiated burdens; and investments that are so costly that they 
require tax increases which might discourage business from 
locating or staying in a city or province.
<P>
	Even in these cases Reform believes that programs can be 
designed to allow for significant flexibility at a provincial or 
municipal level. The federal government can and must work with 
provincial governments to define jointly the missions and the 
outcome. But in so doing it must free lower government to achieve 
those outcomes as they see fit.
<P>
	What has been the Liberal response to decentralization? The 
government has resisted the natural ebb and flow of this federation 
by operating completely oblivious to its surroundings. We saw this 
in the recent referendum. The government grossly miscalculated by 
adhering to a status quo position. Only when it became obvious to 
the government that its policy was indeed a complete failure did it 
move to make insincere promises of change. Where is this change 
now, this vision of a new federalism? Where is its blueprint for a 
renewed Canada? Where is the leadership to bring forward such a 
plan?
<P>
	Given the government's previous attempts at major change, I 
suggest that we will be waiting a long time before we see 
substantive and meaningful change.
<P>
	Let me give one example of how the government is failing to 
deliver on its promise to reform and decentralize social programs. 
Consider the current welfare issue in British Columbia. When the 
province made changes to its own programs by stipulating a 
residency requirement for welfare qualifications, the federal 
government stepped in and threatened the province with punitive 
actions. That is certainly no stranger to Albertans.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16422"> 16422 </A></B>
<P>
	There is no question that the B.C. government should be 
permitted to administer its affairs without federal interference. The 
minister, rather than threatening the province, should back off and 
leave it free to run its own programs. It is absurd for this minister, 
who has radically reduced transfers to the provinces, to turn 
around and intervene in provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	The minister continues to refuse to meet with the provinces over 
the Canada health and social transfer. Now, when the provinces try 
to move forward, he stands in their way. This, it would seem, is the 
Liberal position on co-operative federalism. How terribly 
predictable and how truly unfortunate.
<P>
	I want to discuss accountability for a moment. Bill C-96 reminds 
us once again that the government has embraced a policy that will 
bring an end to departments submitting annual reports to 
Parliament. This ignoble policy speaks volumes of the 
government's attitude toward accountability, despite the sniping 
from the other side of the House.
<P>
	Most observers who study Parliament lament the gap that exists 
between the relatively rudimentary theory of parliamentary 
accountability and its practice. The theory suggests that there are 
strong linkages between the representative system that created the 
elected House of Commons and the executive system of 
departments headed and controlled by ministers.
<P>
	Parliamentary control is considered in two key phases: first, the 
assigning of responsibility and authority through statutes and 
appropriations; and, second, accountability through scrutiny in the 
House and in its committees. I can accept that the reality of modern 
government is not as neatly ordained as this theory might suggest. 
But I cannot accept any actions such as those provided for in Bill 
C-96, which weaken accountability through scrutiny in the House.
<P>
	Reform supports in principle the current attempt to improve the 
accessibility of information in the budget estimates. However, by 
moving to end the annual reporting function before the estimates 
reform is in place, we are left with an incomplete picture regarding 
annual departmental activities and expenditures. How can this be? 
When the bill and others like it are enacted we will have poor 
estimates and no annual report. This is a disgrace.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	At a conference hosted by the Canadian study of parliament 
group this past weekend the Auditor General of Canada stated that 
it was time for the government to go beyond rhetoric and embrace 
true accountability. The government would do well to listen to its 
own auditor general, because Canadians want information about 
their government. Canadians deserve to have access to good quality 
information about their government. For a department that spends 
some $70 billion annually, I  think the relatively minor investment 
that an annual report could engender is a worthwhile expenditure.
<P>
	In broader accountability terms the government does not have a 
solid track record. It is for this reason that I make specific reference 
to accountability in my remarks today. The red book outlined the 
seemingly ambitious agenda to restore integrity to the institution of 
Parliament. What has been accomplished since 1993? Not very 
much. Where are those free votes? Where is the independent ethics 
counsellor who was supposedly reporting to Parliament directly? 
Where is our code of conduct? Where is our real MP pension 
reform? Where is the promise of increasing the role of committees 
in drafting legislation? How can there be so many unanswered 
questions?
<P>
	The Liberal government has made a mockery of parliamentary 
accountability by showing such brazen disdain and contempt 
toward its election commitments. It has talked incessantly about 
transparency, about integrity and about commitment to the 
Canadian people. In truth, the question is not really how many 
commitments have already been broken, but when next will the 
government break another one.
<P>
	Because of this shameful lack of action the institution of 
Parliament has suffered. Members from all parties have suffered. 
Most significantly, the Canadian people have suffered.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Richardson:</B> The only party that suffers in the House is the 
Reform Party.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brown (Calgary Southeast):</B> The government has 
articulated the precepts of integrity but has failed to deliver the 
substance of its bravado. Canadians are right to be disappointed.
<P>
	We were promised a new approach to accountability and ethics. 
Instead, we have received well rehearsed rhetoric and woeful 
policy from that side of the House.
<P>
	I would like to turn my attention now to the issue of pensions. 
Bill C-96 will create the department responsible for administering 
the Canada pension plan. Given the importance of the program to 
all Canadians, it is only fair that we spend some time reviewing 
what the department has been doing. My review will be brief 
because in truth the department has done virtually nothing to 
address what the government has deemed unsustainable.
<P>
	The government, in refusing to confront the issue, has said to 
Canadians that it is not concerned about their futures. There is 
widespread consensus that the Canada pension plan is in trouble. In 
October of this year the chief actuary for the Office of the 
Superintendent of Financial Institutions stated: ``The CPP's 
projected costs are considerably higher than previously expected. If 
the existing schedule of contribution rates is not increased and 
benefits continue as now legislated, the CPP fund is expected to be 
exhausted by the year 2015''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16423"> 16423 </A></B>
<P>
	Other evidence suggests that prevalent fear and concern exists 
among Canadians regarding CPP. A Bank of Nova Scotia poll 
released last month stated that 75 per cent of Canadians distrust 
the security and sustainability of the Canada pension plan. The 
survey also showed that of those people aged 30 to 49, fully 81 
per cent reported that they are not confident about the ability of 
CPP to provide them with income when they retire. When so many 
are in agreement that changes are overdue it is incomprehensible 
why the government has failed to make changes in its promise 
in 1993 to do just that.
<P>
	Not long ago the Minister of Human Resources Development 
responded to my question in the House of Commons by stating: 
``The best way in which the hon. member can make a contribution 
is to start putting forward her own proposals on behalf of her 
party''. If the department that Bill C-96 creates will not put forward 
its ideas to address our enfeebled Canada pension plan, it is only 
fair that I present Reform's vision for renewing CPP.
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	Reform believes that the Canada pension plan is under 
considerable financial strain, a strain which if not addressed will 
jeopardize the pension benefits of today's seniors, those baby 
boomers edging toward retirement and our children who are 
beginning or who will soon enter the workforce. This evaluation of 
the Canada pension plan is not fearmongering or partisan 
politicking. It represents the opinions of the governments and of 
ordinary Canadians.
<P>
	Through access to information I obtained a briefing note 
prepared for the Minister of Human Resources Development 
written by one of his senior policy analysts. She writes of CPP that 
``the costs of the Canada pension plan are rising faster than the 
actuarial assumptions predicted''. She continued in the note to say 
that ``amendments may be required to Canada pension plan 
benefits or to restrict the cost of the benefits''. The senior policy 
analyst recommends therefore that the government increase 
contribution rates for CPP or implement cost cutting measures in 
the Canada pension plan.
<P>
	The only proposals for changing CPP the government is 
considering are cutting seniors' pensions or raising taxes for CPP 
contributions. We already have evidence that the government 
prefers the easy yet reckless tax grab option. On November 2 the 
government announced a payroll tax increase to support a faltering 
pension system. The Liberal penchant for tax increases, which is 
already legendary, once again rears its ugly head.
<P>
	Unlike the government, Reform believes we can renew the 
Canada pension plan without cutting seniors' pensions and without 
relying on contribution rate increases. Our plan would gradually 
convert CPP into individualized, privately invested accounts 
similar to RRSPs. The total investment income in these millions of  
accounts will greatly exceed the total income that is possible under 
CPP's current restrictive investment parameters. This increase in 
total investment wealth is key to our plan for making possible a 
renewed CPP that is generous to all age and income groups.
<P>
	The first point of our four-point plan to renew the Canada 
pension plan is a guarantee to seniors. The first step in CPP reform 
must be to provide a protected status for all benefits being paid to 
the current generation of seniors. Reform believes that when there 
are any changes to CPP, no matter what they may be, no matter who 
proposes them, those changes must never touch any benefits that 
we as a society have promised our seniors.
<P>
	If the Liberals implement cuts to seniors' pensions, as suggested 
in the briefing note to which I referred earlier, we can expect a 
seniors' uprising like no one has ever seen. Reform will help in 
every way possible to take that uprising to the House of Commons 
and even to the front doors of 24 Sussex Drive. We will not allow 
anyone to tamper with promises we have made to our seniors.
<P>
	The second point provides for recognition bonds. Because 
people over a certain age, say around 40, will not be able to build 
up enough savings in their super RRSPs to compensate fully for the 
loss of their Canada pension plan benefits, special bonds will be 
issued guaranteeing the redemption upon retirement of all 
previously made contributions to CPP. Once we have guaranteed 
seniors' benefits in point one, this point guarantees benefits for 
those who are quickly edging toward their retirement but will not 
be able to fully benefit from their new super RRSPs.
<P>
	This brings me to my third point, the creation of super RRSPs. 
Who should Canadians trust to manage their retirement savings, 
themselves or a government saddled with a $560 billion debt? 
Instead of contributing to the Canada pension plan to provide for 
their retirement, individuals would contribute into what we call 
super RRSPs. The conversion process from CPP to super RRSPs 
would gradually reduce the financial demands on the CPP system 
while keeping payroll deductions at reasonable levels. The excess 
revenues would be diverted into each worker's RRSP.
<P>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
	The fourth point of our plan for renewing the Canada pension 
plan is to improve benefits for elderly widows. The avaricious 
benefits given to elderly widows of deceased CPP contributors 
would gradually be replaced by a system under which full 
ownership of the spouse's super RRSP would be transferred to the 
widow without tax implications.
<P>
	Here are constructive ideas for addressing an issue about which 
most Canadians feel deeply. We have initiated the debate. Reform 
is prepared to discuss real options and is open to innovative ideas.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16424"> 16424 </A></B>
<P>
	Reform has a vision. Where is the Liberal vision? Where are 
the Liberals as we navigate the rough waters of complex policy?
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Right in front of you.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brown (Calgary Southeast):</B> It is clear they have missed 
the boat. They have no ideas, no vision and no stomach for white 
water. At a time when Canadians need leadership the most, the 
government has failed to deliver. How truly sad. We should give 
the hon. member on the other side of the House a bull horn.
<P>
	I have spoken at length about my concerns regarding Bill C-96. 
In light of what I have said my conclusions are self-evident. I 
cannot and will not support the bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
</B><B>President of the Treasury Board, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, there is 
considerable mischievousness going on here today. I want to 
correct a couple of flagrant errors.
<P>
	The Prime Minister said in the House on a number of occasions 
that the pensions of seniors, those who have them now, would not 
be cut. He did indicate it may be necessary to look at the amount 
being contributed at this time for future pensioners.
<P>
	For the Reform to suggest that is what the Liberals are doing, 
that is what the Prime Minister is doing, shows it has not been 
listening. It is unfortunate it would stoop to that. Reform members 
are trying to put their party and their leader in front of Canadians. 
That is what that kind of remark does. That is what it suggests.
<P>
	It is not unlike the remarks made during the referendum 
campaign. I have here over 30 some quotes from newspapers 
throughout the country condemning their behaviour, indicating 
quite clearly they were playing politics. They were putting their 
party, their leader in front of Canada. I would be delighted to share 
those comments with them if necessary.
<P>
	For that member to suggest pensioners will trust Reformers, 
Reform policy to protect them is really dreaming in technicolour. I 
doubt it very much.
<P>
	With respect to the official opposition I shall try to prove the bill 
is an administrative bill. It is putting the pieces together so that the 
job can be done. It is the kind of bill that will still require 
co-operation and partnership, those very elements required in order 
to make Canada work.
<P>
	There are no new powers in the bill. My colleagues in the official 
opposition know it.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Clause 20 of Bill C-96 raises concerns for the Government of 
Quebec as well as for certain members of this House. It is the one 
authorizing the minister to enter into agreements with provinces 
and financial or other institutions.
<P>
	Some members are concerned more specifically that this clause 
gives the minister too broad a discretionary power for entering into 
agreements with local organizations, which might lead to 
encroachment on provincial areas of jurisdiction.
<P>
	To clarify the situation, it might be worthwhile to examine the 
exact wording of clause 20. This clause states very clearly that 
these agreements are expressly intended to facilitate the carrying 
out of programs, and I quote, ``-relating to the powers, duties and 
functions referred to in section 6-''
<P>
	This clause sets out the mandate of the department and, let me 
repeat, without introducing new elements and without creating new 
powers. This is, obviously, what limits the discretionary powers 
which could be conferred upon the minister.
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	These powers are restricted by the very mandate of the 
department, which the bill clearly defines as restricted to all 
matters over which Parliament has jurisdiction. Moreover, it has 
been repeated on numerous occasions in this House that Bill C-96 
assigns no new powers to the minister. The bill makes no change in 
federal areas of jurisdiction, no change whatsoever, nor in those of 
provincial governments. In this connection, the bill makes no 
change whatsoever in the present situation. Clause 20 does not, 
therefore, in any way authorize the minister to encroach upon areas 
of provincial jurisdiction. Is that clear, now?
<P>
	The purpose of clause 20 is very simple. It allows the department 
to sign contracts with other organizations, which is normal. The 
department could not continue to function without that power. 
HRDC has signed hundreds of contracts and agreements with a 
broad range of Quebec groups, I might add, including agreements 
with the Government of Quebec, which are important to Quebec 
workers seeking to obtain training and get back into the work force.
<P>
	The existing legislation already allows this, the bill merely picks 
these agreements up again. Nothing is changed. In 1994-95 alone, 
HRDC signed more than 50,000 contracts relating to manpower in 
Quebec, representing in all $695 million in program financing and 
income support.
<P>
	These contracts break down as follows: 9,600 contracts with 
non-profit organizations; 9,300 contracts with businesses in the 
private sector; 2,800 contracts with public sector institutions such 
as municipalities; 3,200 contracts with the Government of Quebec 
and 25,000 contracts under the program for independent students, 
which provides income support for unemployed workers while they 
are receiving training.
<P>
	I am sure that, all things considered, no one would suggest 
cancelling the agreements made possible under clause 20. Think of 
the consequences. It would mean the  end of shared-cost 
agreements to help welfare recipients back on their feet. It would 
mean the end of funding for groups like the world famous Cirque 
du Soleil in Quebec City, which has carried out HRDC training and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16425"> 16425 </A></B>
<P>
job creation programs since 1987, programs that really make a 
difference in the lives of people who need help.
<P>
	It would mean the end of our partnership with two Quebec 
government departments which support youth training and job 
search programs through the Relais des jeunes adultes du sud-ouest 
de Montréal. It would mean the end of our partnership with the 
Société québécoise de développement de la main-d'oeuvre, which 
helps new businesses get established through the Société d'aide au 
développement des collectivités de Sorel-Tracy Inc.
<P>
	It would mean the end of our agreement with the SQDM to help 
workers affected by the closing of the Hyundai Plant in Bromont, 
last March. It would mean the end of our agreement with the local 
Human Resources Canada Centre and the Société de 
développement économique in Jonquière on the collection and 
exchange of labour market information. It would mean the end of 
agreements on one-stop services, like the agreement involving 
HRDC, the industrial commissioner and the Office de tourisme de 
Témiscamingue on providing services to promote industrial, rural 
and tourism development.
<P>
	It would mean the end of the partnership in Gaspé between 
HRDC, the SQDM, the Fédération québécoise des rivières à 
saumon du Québec and other groups that are working on upgrading 
the skills of salmon fishing guides. It would mean the end of the 
Older Workers Adjustment Program, a federal-provincial 
agreement that provides $54 million in assistance to displaced 
workers in Quebec.
<P>
	In fact, the Older Workers Adjustment Program is a prime 
example of why it is so important for the minister to be able to 
enter into agreements, not just with other governments but also 
with financial institutions, for instance.
<P>
<B>(1325)</B>
<P>
	Thanks to the Older Workers Adjustment Program, the federal 
government purchases annuities on behalf of older workers. During 
the past three years and up to now, we have spent more than $111 
million on purchasing these annuities and have helped nearly 5,000 
older workers to face the future with a measure of security.
<P>
	We would not be able to continue this practice without clause 20, 
which simply gives us the power to keep helping these workers.
<P>
	These agreements and thousands like them in communities in all 
Canadian provinces are what clause 20 is all about. We have no 
intention of using clause 20 to bypass the provinces or get involved 
in areas of provincial jurisdiction. No intention at all.
<P>
	For example, clause 20 gives us the power to enter into 
agreements with financial institutions providing student loans 
under the Canada student loans program, which is bigger and more 
flexible. As it is clearly entitled to, the Quebec government chose 
to withdraw from this program in favour of block funding.
<P>
	Clause 20 will preserve this kind of flexibility, which fully 
respects each province's powers and priorities.
<P>
	The department's ability to conclude this kind of agreement will 
become even more important as the department continues to 
streamline operations and decentralize programs.
<P>
	For example, the minister is testing various ways of ensuring 
local integration by establishing decision making and service 
development at the local level. We must move away from the 
highly centralized and compartmentalized programs imposed by 
the central administration and give local authorities a much greater 
latitude in making decisions. It is then easier to develop an 
integrated range of programs and services meeting the needs of the 
various communities.
<P>
	This will be impossible if we cannot enter into agreements with 
the people and organizations with whom we must work. 
Impossible.
<P>
	It would be impossible to build on the real progress we are 
making in integrating more effectively the federal government's 
resources with those of our partners. Local CRHCs are already 
learning to form more effective partnerships with schools, colleges, 
businesses, unions, and community organizations.
<P>
	In fact, many programs are now designed to integrate public and 
private sector resources. For example, the department has created 
16 sectoral councils to co-ordinate the management of human 
resources needs in the private sector. These councils now affect 
nearly 36 per cent of Canada's labour force, and many other 
councils are being created.
<P>
	In each of these councils, both labour and management in a 
given industrial sector work together to develop a master plan with 
respect to their human resources needs. This co-operation 
constitutes the basis for some truly innovative partnerships. Under 
the internship program for example, sectorial councils developed 
training courses to allow young people to gain experience in areas 
as varied as electronics, horticulture, tourism and knowledge based 
industries.
<P>
	In this partnership, businesses and unions set criteria and 
develop curricula together. Then, they make arrangements with 
local high school, community colleges and cégeps. In fact, they 
themselves give the hands-on portion so that the young people get 
an adequate mix of academic and practical training.
<P>

<P>
<HR>

<P>
	By integrating governmental and private sector resources this 
way, we end up with a more effective and efficient program. In 
fact, not only do our private sector partners manage the program, 
they also invest in it.
<P>
	This kind of forward-looking initiative attracts a great deal of 
interest. Other countries are looking into possible scenarios to 
involve the private sector and local communities in developing 
internship programs.
<P>
	Without clause 20 of Bill C-96, all these innovative initiatives 
would simply boil down to nothing because there would be no 
mechanism to govern all the administrative arrangements involved.
<P>
<B>(1330)</B>
<P>
	There is nothing catastrophic about clause 20. There is no need 
to read between the lines. Clause 20 is straightforward.
<P>
	I know that some believe that it goes further, that it will give the 
minister the power to dismiss concerns expressed by provincial 
governments. The minister has already given these people the 
assurance that provincial governments will continue to be 
consulted, as they were in the past, about the kinds of agreements 
that HRDC will be making.
<P>
	He even went as far as stating that he would not enter into any 
agreement without the prior consent of the appropriate provincial 
government, if that is what the province wants.
<P>
	I do not know what more those who oppose clause 20 could ask 
for. Instead of trying to find in Bill C-96 examples of usurpation of 
power which simply do not exist, we should get on with the real 
tasks of creating partnerships, co-operating, and providing jobs to 
Canadians. This is indeed the purpose of Bill C-96 and clause 20.
<P>
	We all know that co-operation between the federal and 
provincial governments could be improved in matters of labour, as 
well as in any other sector.
<P>
	Federal-provincial agreements and partnerships would help find 
better ways to fulfil our respective mandates. There is no doubt 
about that. The issue must be carefully examined, and this is why 
the minister sent a direct invitation to the provinces to start 
discussing it.
<P>
	However, if we really want these discussions to be productive, 
we must pass this bill now, in order to continue shaping a new 
department and a new era of flexible federalism.
<P>
	We must pass Bill C-96 to continue providing effective services 
to all Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have listened 
attentively to the remarks by the hon. member for St. Boniface, and 
note that sometimes the more we talk, the less we understand each 
other.
<P>
	The hon. member suggests that this clause 20 will lend much 
more flexibility and better harmony between levels of government. 
The clause must be read; it states ``-the Minister may enter into 
agreements with a province''-may, not must-``or group of 
provinces, agencies of provinces, financial institutions and such 
other persons or bodies as the Minister considers appropriate''.
<P>
	In order to keep it short, I would just like to ask my hon. 
colleague from St. Boniface if he recalls that post-secondary 
education, for example, as well as social assistance, are exclusively 
provincial jurisdictions? If he does recall that, is he aware of 
everything the federal government has done to date, not just this 
one, but all those before it over the past twenty years, to intervene 
via their financial powers in these two areas, in areas over which 
provinces have exclusive jurisdiction? Is he aware of this?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duhamel:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for his 
question.
<P>
	Yes, I am very much aware. I understand that, in the past, the 
situation was less than perfect, and I believe that we have tried to 
improve the situation, and have improved it. I believe that this bill 
is exactly what it claims to be, that is to say an administrative bill, 
one which confers no additional powers upon the minister or the 
department or the provinces or anyone else.
<P>
	I believe that there is a guarantee, not only in the bill but also by 
the minister himself, that he has no intention whatsoever of 
encroaching upon provincial responsibilities or trying to interfere 
in their areas of jurisdiction. I believe that this is a firm 
commitment, an honest one, an honourable one, and one that will 
be respected.
<P>
<B>(1335)</B>
<P>
	I understand that there may be differences of opinion, but I 
would like to start by inviting my colleagues to make concrete 
proposals so that we may work together better to improve the 
condition of all Canadians, including of course the men and women 
of Quebec, where employment is concerned.
<P>
	We all know what human beings want above all is a job, a 
challenging job, one that pays enough to keep them and their 
families. The challenge is to make concrete suggestions; we could 
sit down together. Let us make sure that the government of Quebec 
comes to meet with us, or we could go to meet with them if that 
suited better, if it were easier, in order to reach agreement.
<P>
	Secondly, apart from what I have just proposed, if there are 
questions-and obviously there are-which are bothering us, 
raising doubts about certain possibilities, if you like, if we might 
just put them aside and discuss them in the appropriate forum. For 
example, there are issues on federal-provincial affairs, links, 
reports, agreements between the two levels of government. There 
are  mechanisms for discussion. I would invite my colleague to 
encourage his colleagues to do everything possible to allow us to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16427"> 16427 </A></B>
<P>
work for the people, whether they live in Quebec or elsewhere. 
That is my wish.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I could not 
resist asking the hon. member for St. Boniface whether, 
considering his comments and the tone of his reply, he himself 
would support the resolution adopted unanimously by the Quebec 
National Assembly under Liberal Premier Daniel Johnson, who 
this year was the president of the No committee during the 
referendum campaign?
<P>
	This resolution is similar in every respect to another resolution 
adopted by the Société québécoise de la main-d'oeuvre, whose 
membership includes the Conseil du patronat du Québec and 
various institutions and labour federations. The Conseil du patronat 
is headed by Mr. Dufour, another supporter of the No side, who 
demanded the patriation of tax points for occupational training. 
The resolution asked the federal government to agree to relinquish 
these tax points and let Quebec act as it saw fit, as the people-he 
used the word people-as the vast majority of the people of Quebec 
want. Would the hon. member support this demand?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duhamel:</B> Madam Speaker, personally I am prepared to 
consider any option. I am not the minister responsible for this 
particular matter or for the department, so I will not get into an area 
with which I am not sufficiently familiar. I think the hon. member 
will understand my position.
<P>
	However, I do feel it is essential to put these matters on the table, 
to discuss them and to come up with flexible solutions that respond 
to the needs of the people, not only those of Quebec but of all the 
other provinces and territories of Canada. That would be my 
approach.
<P>
	Theoretically, there is nothing that cannot be put on the table or 
discussed in a frank and forthright way. We should look for flexible 
solutions that respond to the needs of all Canadians. That is about 
all I have to say. It would hardly be fair to expect us to do 
otherwise, and I am not particularly keen on taking a position on 
certain issues when I am not sufficiently familiar with the subject 
to suggest a solution.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Richardson (Perth-Wellington-Waterloo, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I would have a question for the hon. member for 
St. Boniface.
<P>
	During the recent referendum in Quebec, a certain regional party 
at the federal level did not get involved. Yet, it did not lose any 
chance to try to score political points. What does the hon. member 
think of that?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duhamel:</B> Madam Speaker, I can understand. I am a 
federalist obviously and I was on the no side. Naturally, I would 
have done my very best to keep Quebec within Canada.
<P>
<B>(1340)</B>
<P>
	I have great respect for Quebec and Quebecers. Of course, as a 
representative of a francophone minority outside Quebec, I am 
biased, I am prejudiced, so to speak. Quebec is an important 
reference point. As far as I am concerned, Quebec is an inspiration 
for francophones outside Quebec. It provides a certain 
infrastructure that is very useful.
<P>
	I wanted my colleagues to know that. I have a deep-rooted 
attachment to Quebec.
<P>
	Regarding the involvement of political parties, I appreciated 
what mine did, but I did not like at all what the Reform Party did. I 
found this form of involvement to be dishonest and excessive. It 
seemed to me that what came first for the Reformers was their 
party and their leader, and not the country. This observation is not 
mine alone; thirty or so editorial writers said so.
<P>
	On the other hand, I appreciated Mr. Charest's involvement. 
Pardon me, I should not mention members by name. I should say 
the involvement of the Leader of the Progressive Conservative 
Party.
<P>
	As for the other parties, all I have to say is that many people 
were playing politics with our country. I often wondered if the 
public interest, that of our fellow citizens, really came first for 
them. I came to the conclusion that it did not always come first.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, as the official 
opposition's critic on training and youth, I am pleased to take part 
in the debate at second reading on Bill C-96, an act to establish the 
Department of Human Resources Development and to amend and 
repeal certain related acts.
<P>
	This is an extremely important bill because it amends several 
acts, codes and regulations, in addition to repealing four important 
acts, namely the Employment and Immigration Department and 
Commission Act, the Department of Labour Act, the Department 
of National Health and Welfare Act, and the Department of State 
Act.
<P>
	If its only purpose was to make these changes, which, according 
to the Minister of Human Resources Development, simply make 
official the structures in place since the Liberals returned to power 
in 1993, we would be entitled to ask why it took so long to make 
official something that is already in place. It took two years, 
Madam Speaker.
<P>
	Later we will see that the impact of Bill C-96 is more significant 
than what the minister and even the hon. member for St. Boniface 
who just spoke first suggested. In fact, it changes the balance of 
power between the provinces and the federal government in favour 
of the latter, as this government is wont to do.
<P>
	The most surprising thing in all this is that the government 
waited until after the referendum to move  for second reading of 
this bill in the House, which involves a debate. As we know, there 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16428"> 16428 </A></B>
<P>
is no real debate at the first reading stage when a minister 
introduces a bill in the House.
<P>
	Why did they wait two years and why was there no debate in the 
House between June and now? If it was good for both Canada and 
Quebec, I think it would have been in the government's political 
interest to debate this bill even during the referendum campaign. 
This could have helped Quebecers better understand the 
government's intentions in some important areas.
<P>
	I simply want to remind you that, if we forget about debt 
servicing, the Department of Human Resources Development will 
manage over 40 per cent of federal budget spending. This is 
considerable; it is by far the most important federal department.
<P>
	Under these circumstances, one wonders why this is the case. I 
happen to think, and so do many Quebecers, that it is because there 
was a lot at stake, including the cuts affecting social programs. But 
the issue is not merely related to cuts: there is also a question of 
power involved.
<P>
<B>(1345)</B>
<P>
	Contrary to what the member for St. Boniface just said, our 
understanding of Bill C-96 is that, with this measure, the Minister 
of Human Resources Development is giving himself new powers 
which he did not have before. These are powers which he tried to 
exercise in an illegal context, through the spending power of the 
federal government.
<P>
	We must constantly remind some people of that, because they do 
not always understand what we mean. This spending power is 
provided in the constitution and, surely, the federal government can 
use it on certain occasions, such as during a major conflict or crisis. 
However, it is contrary to the constitution to use that spending 
power on a permanent basis. It should only be used on an ad hoc 
basis. The bill before us is an attempt by the government to legalize 
its action, by using the spending power as a model.
<P>
	Let me read the press release of the Quebec minister of state for 
joint action and employment minister. This will give you an idea of 
the Quebec government's reaction when it found out about this 
morning's debate.
<P>
	It reads as follows: ``While Quebec accepted the invitation sent 
by the Minister of Human Resources Development to participate in 
a meeting on human resources management, the federal Minister of 
Human Resources Development nevertheless intends to proceed, 
this very day, with second reading of Bill C-96. That decision sends 
quite a message to Quebec, considering the unanimous opposition 
to a bill which confirms the federal government's intentions to 
systematically bypass Quebec's jurisdiction and institutions to 
maintain, and even increase, duplication regarding manpower 
related  measures in our province''. This is the reaction ofMrs. Louise Harel, Quebec minister of state for joint action, 
Minister of Employment, and Minister of Immigration and 
Cultural Communities.
<P>
	``Bill C-96 amounts to a flat rejection of the unanimous Quebec 
consensus to the effect that the federal government must 
completely withdraw from the manpower sector and give related 
budgets back to the province''. The minister added that ``Ottawa's 
tactic was formally denounced by all labour market partners 
represented on the board of directors of the Société québécoise de 
développement de la main-d'oeuvre by way of a resolution passed 
on October 2''.
<P>
	``By initiating second reading of Bill C-96, Ottawa has 
confirmed that it intends to pursue its centralist manpower policy 
and ignore the specific needs of the Quebec labour market, thus 
dismissing the consensus in Quebec on manpower issues which 
stresses the need to fight unemployment effectively by allowing for 
the differences in the various labour markets across Quebec and 
promoting the involvement of the socio-economic players in every 
region and community''.
<P>
	``Only a proactive labour market policy that is consistent, 
integrated and adapted to our situation can help us fight 
unemployment effectively, with durable results''.
<P>
	``Ottawa wields Bill C-96 like a sword of Damocles. 
Opportunities to implement such a policy are essential to the 
development of employment in Quebec'', concluded Ms. Harel.
<P>
	Since I am reading, I might as well quote the attached document. 
This document was not drafted by the Parti Quebecois government 
but by the board of directors of the Société québécoise de la 
main-d'oeuvre. It reads as follows:
<P>
	``Whereas Bill C-96, an act to establish the Department of 
Human Resources Development, which in clauses 6 and 20 gives 
the Minister of Human Resources Development the power to enter 
into agreements with a province or group of provinces, agencies of 
provinces, financial institutions and such other persons or bodies as 
the minister considers appropriate, with the objective of enhancing 
employment, encouraging equality and promoting social security, 
moved by Gérald Larose, seconded by Claude Béland, president of 
the Mouvement Desjardins, and resolved unanimously: That the 
board of directors of the Société québécoise du développement de 
la main-d'oeuvre take the position adopted at the Conférence 
permanente sur l'adaptation de la main-d'oeuvre in November 
1990;''
<P>
	``That Quebec must have sole responsibility for manpower 
adjustment and manpower training policies within its territory and 
patriate, as appropriate, the moneys allocated by the federal 
government to these programs in Quebec''.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16429"> 16429 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1350)</B>
<P>
	``Under the Constitution as it stands today and to improve client 
services, Quebec will control and administer all services connected 
with employment and manpower development and all related 
programs funded by unemployment insurance contributions within 
Quebec's territory and will consequently receive the budgets 
commensurate with this responsibility''.
<P>
	``The board of directors asks the federal government, pending 
finalization of negotiations on the patriation of budgets, to refrain 
from setting up parallel partnership structures or taking steps to 
encroach on areas under Quebec's jurisdiction, since the Société 
québécoise de développement de la main-d'oeuvre is the dedicated 
structure for joint manpower programs in Quebec''.
<P>
	Nevertheless-and I could also quote a resolution adopted 
unanimously under Daniel Johnson's Liberal government which 
was along the same lines, in other words, patriation of tax points 
for manpower training in Quebec-nevertheless, in spite of a very 
close vote in the referendum and following promises for change, 
not by just anyone, by the Prime Minister of Canada, they said: 
``We will consider your desire for change''. Nevertheless, ten days 
later, the Minister of Human Resources Development is embarking 
on phase two, namely the second reading of Bill C-96, which, 
according to Quebec political observers, is the most centralizing 
ever.
<P>
	This morning, we listened to the minister and the member for St. 
Boniface talking about decentralization; they said that 
decentralization no longer necessarily meant cooperating with 
provinces in areas which are nonetheless under exclusive 
provincial jurisdiction; it no longer means this, it means that the 
federal minister has the authority to negotiate agreements with any 
organization, even municipal governments, and individual 
stakeholders. Does this take into account a people's desire for 
change as expressed to the federal government? Does this heed the 
results of the referendum? To the contrary. Nothing has changed.
<P>
	The government keeps on going as if nothing had happened, 
following the same logic, using the same rhetoric, the same words 
as the green book-I am not allowed to show it-the same green 
book the minister tabled a year and a half ago after extensive 
consultations. Wherever he went in Quebec, he was told, not only 
by the Société québécoise de la main-d'oeuvre, but also by a 
multitude of stakeholders, and this is the consensus in Quebec: 
``Mister Minister of Human Resources Development, listen to us, 
please''. In Quebec, we want to control education. We want our 
government, the Quebec government, to be in charge of manpower 
training, as provided by the constitution, by the way.
<P>
	We want to run our own affairs. What is the minister doing? Like 
a steamroller, he keeps on going, making a mockery of 
decentralization, saying that there will be  further decentralization. 
The federal government will deal directly with local communities, 
individuals and local stakeholders. He mentioned a club in his 
parish, in his Winnipeg riding, and said that the federal government 
will be able to help.
<P>
	I have no problem with that. It may work for the other provinces, 
the member for St. Boniface may not see anything wrong with it, 
but all Quebec stakeholders are against it. They want no part of it. 
We have said it time and time again, especially since the 
Bélanger-Campeau Commission, in 1990. Nevertheless, the 
minister is sticking to his gun. For him, decentralization means 
keeping all the powers for himself, and hogging 40 per cent of the 
federal budget, excluding the debt, to deal with unemployment 
problems. Of course, people who hear that and are not familiar with 
government operation, may say: ``Here is a man who is genuinely 
interested in creating jobs, here is a man who wants to train 
individuals''. Of course, these are good intentions, but this is not 
his jurisdiction. This is not his field.
<P>
<B>(1355)</B>
<P>
	This government keeps repeating that we must cut spending, but 
continues to spend in areas outside of its jurisdiction and cuts 
transfer payments to provinces, so much so that they, in turn, have 
to cut services such as hospital care. We know about that in 
Quebec. We have to cut because the federal government reduced 
transfer payments.
<P>
	It seems like the Minister of Human Resources Development 
and government members have not grasped the meaning of the 
referendum results.
<P>
	I was listening this morning as the minister boasted about a 
youth program he implemented as a pilot project in Newfoundland. 
He was explaining that finally, after quitting school to go looking 
for work, 97 per cent of the young people had decided to come back 
to school. According to him that was quite an accomplishment. It is 
easy to understand that if young people cannot find jobs, they will 
go back to school but in fact, what they wanted was to find jobs.
<P>
	They maintain the training programs, but they are carried out 
directly from Ottawa and entrusted to civil servants. I have some 
experience in that area; let me tell you about a specific incident.
<P>
	In my riding, two or three organizations asked me to help them 
get some federal funds, since we are still part of that system, by 
finding or creating some employment programs. The minister said 
that if we supported the no, he would be happy to give a positive 
reply to those requests. He said it and then the parliamentary 
secretary had to come to his rescue.
<P>
	When I saw, on Tuesday this week, only one week after the 
referendum, that the independent member for Beauce had 
announced in his riding a special project for an employment center, 
so that training could be provided  directly by businesses, and that 
he was boasting to have been successful at that, I remind the House 
that the independent member for Beauce was the chairman of the 
no committee in that riding. Is this the federal government's new 
way of decentralizing management: giving things to people who 
are on the right side or support federalists? Is this the way of 
governing that they want to show Quebecers? If Quebecers had 
known this is how things work, a lot more would have said yes.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="16430"> 16430 </A></B>
<P>
	In the end, when you hear so much double talk- That reminds 
me, for instance, of the Minister of Human Development 
Resources, a disciple of Mr. Trudeau, who was saying this morning 
that he was flexible. That reminds me of Prime Minister Trudeau 
who said in a message that he sent recently: ``Considering my 
legendary flexibility''. If this kind of bill, of attitude had been 
debated before the referendum, the result-
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I see that you are inviting me to sit down because 
question period is coming soon, so I will conclude, and if I have a 
few minutes left, I will complete my statement later.
<P>
	I am simply saying that if Quebecers had known that, perhaps we 
would be talking about something else today.

	<B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Florence Christie of Vancouver has just been given the Canada 
Volunteer Award Certificate of Merit for her work for Canadians 
suffering from lupus.
<P>
	She was diagnosed with the disease in 1980. Despite great 
sacrifice to her own health she has maintained constant contact and 
support with 50 support groups in British Columbia. In the past 
year she has answered over 600 telephone calls from lupus patients 
and has compiled and mailed some 1,300 information packages for 
the B.C. Lupus Society.

	Her message is one of hope and inspiration that despite a severe 
debilitating illness one can continue to work effectively and live in 
dignity. The award to Mrs. Christie is one in which British

	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley,

must be giving the people of Canada  a greater say in the running of 
the country. Although the Liberals are not too interested in this 
concept, we in the Reform Party have been trying on our own to 
truly represent our constituents.
<P>
	The best means we have available at this time are our 
householders. In each of my first six householders I have asked 10 
questions covering a wide variety of subjects. For the past two 
weeks I have been collecting results from my latest survey. To date 
I have over 3,800 responses with hundreds coming in daily.
<P>
	Liberal members might be interested to learn that their 
employment equity bill did not fair too well. Only 16 per cent of 
respondents are in favour of Bill C-64. By comparison, 31 per cent 
favour the legalization of marijuana and 54 per cent favour the 
legalization of prostitution.

their constituents.

flyer from a Quebec company which was distributed by Canada 
Post.

	The flyer is a mail order form advertising explicit pornographic 
videos. Included in the flyer is a detailed description and name of 
each of the 20 films. I will not repeat these words and descriptions 
as they are very explicit and deeply offensive.
<P>
	I have had many calls to my riding office from people who are 
totally outraged by having this kind of filth arrive at their front 
door by Canada Post. People feel that it is an invasion of their 
privacy and they want something done about it.
<P>
	What is the government's policy on delivering such material? 
Whatever the policy is, it should be revisited. I strongly urge the

He will address in general the human rights problems facing all

Speaker, it has been 25 years since the Royal Commission on the 
Status of Women tabled its report in this House, making numerous 
recommendations to improve the educational levels for women.
<P>
	Since then we have made significant progress. For example, 25 
years ago less than 3 per cent of women held university degrees. 
Today 10 per cent of Canadian women are university graduates and 
52 per cent of full time university students are women.
<P>
	The need for education is gender neutral. Education for women 
and for men is fundamental to economic advancement, to personal 
fulfilment and to the opportunity to participate to their full 
potential in Canadian society.
<P>
	Federal and provincial initiatives have improved the educational 
status of women. Our goal is to ensure equality in education and 
training for Canadian women and girls, thus paving the road to a 
truly equitable society.

	<B>Mr. John Richardson (Perth-Wellington-Waterloo, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure today to speak about a little known 
area called Drayton.
<P>
	Terms such as sold out season and financial success are not 
usually used when referring to a relatively new performing arts 
theatre. However, after five successful seasons the Drayton festival 
is accustomed to breaking the rules.
<P>
	Nestled in the picturesque village of Drayton, Ontario, the 
festival has fast become a Canadian success story. During the 
1993-94 season the festival made Canadian theatrical history by 
selling out every available seat before opening night. This year 
some 60,000 theatre goers enjoyed an evening at this fine theatre.
<P>
	Under the direction and guidance of artistic director Alex 
Mustakas, the talented cast and crew create a theatrical experience 
which is second to none.
<P>
	I invite all Canadians to visit Drayton and take in a performance. 
However, I warn them to be prepared to be dazzled by an evening 
of music and laughter.
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="FEDERALTRANSFERPAYMENTS">FEDERAL TRANSFER PAYMENTS</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the federal Liberal government claims that it wants standards for 
health care, education and social programs, but federal standards 
are meaningless without adequate core funding. The federal 
Liberals have cut back over $7 billion or 25 per cent of the budgets 
for health care, education and social services, yet they have cut 
back only 8 per cent on other government programs.
<P>
<B>(1405)</B>
<P>
	The implications on provincial governments are devastating, 
particularly Saskatchewan. The province of Saskatchewan will lose 
$200 million in federal transfer payments in 1996.
<P>
	The impact of these cutbacks means savage reductions in social 
programs in some provinces, forcing Canadians to relocate. They 
go to where better jobs and better social programs exist, putting 
extreme pressure on those very provinces.
<P>
	Weak national standards and the absence of adequate core 
funding means that provinces like Ontario and Alberta can punish 
those that need the help most. Pitting one province against another 
is wrong. So is a lack of funding for national standards.

	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
prisoners week is an affront to all victims of crime. Yesterday I 
received by mail a pamphlet produced and paid for by Correctional 
Services Canada. The pamphlet urges us all to celebrate and pray 
for the plight of prisoners, to give them special recognition 
between November 19 and 26.
<P>
	Talk about your priorities. Why should I recognize a rapist and a 
murderer? The solicitor general should be appalled that Canadian 
taxpayers are asked to pay for this glorification of murderers, 
thieves and rapists. The solicitor general should think about the 
security of Canadians as he sets aside a whole week glorifying 
those who would go so far as even to threaten the life of our Prime 
Minister.
<P>
	Maybe the solicitor general has forgotten just who we have in 
our prisons. He is asking us to dedicate a week to people like 
Robert Paul Thompson, a killer of his wife; Clifford Olson, a killer 
of our children; and Paul Bernardo, a killer and rapist of our 
daughters.
<P>
	This is outrageous, unacceptable and disgraceful. I challenge 
this government to scrap this week and let us get our priorities right 
for a change.

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, last 
Tuesday, the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs referred to the 
cabinet's phoney committee as being essential to the survival of 
Canada. Yesterday, he was corrected by his colleague at the 
Department of Justice, who said: ``We do not expect to find a 
formula to save the country''.
<P>
	Would the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs agree that what 
his colleague at the Department of Justice said confirms that the 
sole purpose of the government's phoney committee is to play for 
time and that Quebecers, and Canadians as well, for that matter, 
have nothing to gain from this committee?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, perhaps I may start by correcting the hon. member for 
Roberval. A phoney committee is like the regional political 
commissions set  up by the Parti Quebecois, where the members all 
belonged to the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16434"> 16434 </A></B>
<P>
same party and the money of Quebecers was used to make partisan 
propaganda. They were definitely phoney.
<P>
	We have set up a committee that will try to deal or suggest how 
to deal with the problems that exist in our country today. We all 
need this kind of committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs just scored in his own goal, 
as they say. A committee whose members all belong to the same 
political party, funded with taxpayers money and likely to 
accomplish nothing. That is the kind of committee he chairs.
<P>
	But seriously, this morning in New Zealand, the Prime Minister 
said that his government's first priority was not to make changes 
for Quebecers but to create jobs. At the same time he said the 
cabinet committee did not intend to reopen the debate on the 
constitution.
<P>
	Would the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, who yesterday 
said repeatedly during Question Period that the committee's 
mission was to save the country, agree that in the light of the 
correction made by his Prime Minister, Quebecers and Canadians 
should expect nothing either from him or his committee?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, the official opposition is spouting nonsense about a 
committee that was set up to deal with the problems we have now 
in this country.
<P>
	Prime Minister Chrétien made it quite clear that the important 
problems in this country today are economic problems, and he also 
said that the Parti Quebecois was wasting its time, after it lost the 
referendum, on reopening constitutional issues and refused to deal 
with the real problems, which are job creation and unemployment.
<P>
	More than 60 per cent of Quebecers said in a recent poll that they 
wanted the Parti Quebecois and the Bloc Quebecois to take care of 
the economy and job creation and stop wasting their time, their 
money and their future on discussing a problem that has already 
been settled.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in addition 
to being a poor hockey player, the minister does not know how to 
skate. Let me explain.
<P>
	Yesterday, the minister said that the committee would be used to 
save the country from the separatists who wanted to break it up. 
That is what he said yesterday. Today, after the Prime Minister's 
correction, he tells us that his committee will look into creating 
jobs and promoting economic development.
<P>
	Is the minister telling us that this government, which for more 
than two years has said it will deal with the country's real 
problems, is he telling us that they have no  recipe and that it takes 
a committee to suggest how the Prime Minister can get the country 
out of this mess?
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, to continue in hockey parlance, the hon. member for 
Roberval lost by default because they decided to leave the game. 
They lost the referendum and, instead of tackling the real 
problems, they decided their only objective is to destroy Canada. 
All their energy is spent not on dealing with the economic and other 
problems of this country but on destroying the country. That is why 
they have nothing to offer in the way of real solutions we should be 
developing for the future of Quebec and Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs.
<P>
	You will notice that it is after the Liberals were called to order by 
Pierre Elliott Trudeau that this panic-stricken government began to 
dilute its already vague promises of change to Quebecers and 
quickly set up a phoney committee which will prove useless.
<P>
	Considering that the Minister of Justice said yesterday that the 
cabinet committee would not save Canada, and given that the 
Prime Minister said this morning that the committee does not 
intend to reopen the 1982 constitution, does the minister not realize 
that he will preside a phoney committee which will be useless in 
terms fulfilling the promises made by the Prime Minister regarding 
the constitution?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, I will repeat for the tenth time that the Prime Minister 
clearly indicated in his speeches that he was going to look after the 
issues of distinct society and right of veto. He asked a number of 
ministers to develop strategies, get a better understanding of the 
referendum results, and make appropriate changes for Quebec and 
Canada. This is what we are doing.
<P>
	As regards Mr. Trudeau's comments, the hon. member should 
also remember that he clearly said that the Leader of the 
Opposition had make a mockery of the truth, to use a diplomatic 
expression. This is exactly what he said in his press conference.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Dear colleagues, we are now on thin ice. 
Therefore, I would ask hon. members to choose their words 
carefully.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, given 
that his phoney committee was set up in a mad rush, that the names 
of its members were released only  24 hours later, and that each of 
its members seems to have a different opinion as to its mandate, 
will the minister admit that his phoney committee was only set up 
to buy time until Christmas, when the House will recess and the

<P>

questions on the commitments he made during the referendum 
campaign?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, I see that the official opposition has now adopted the term 
``phoney''. Its members are asking phoney questions.
<P>
	They are obviously much more concerned about what goes on 
outside, than about the important issues discussed in this House. 
The important issue now is clearly to try to solve the problems as 
they exist. We are trying to do that by constitutional and others 
means.

nobody knows when they are supposed to report, and worst of all, 
nobody has a clue what the committee is supposed to be doing.

	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and

Speaker, this committee has clear terms of reference. They will not 
be produced in the House because this is a task force which consists 
of ministers. Ad hoc committees normally have mandates and 
memberships that are kept confidential. They are kept confidential 
for one good reason: they are the means by which advice and 
recommendations are given to the Prime Minister. That has been 
the custom of cabinets throughout history.
<P>
	The mandate of this committee is clear. We are going to look at 
the promises of the Prime Minister and how they can be 
implemented. That is clear. They were in the speech given by the 
Prime Minister. We know what they are. We are looking at 
non-constitutional means of improving the way in which the 
government operates.  We have already done it through program 
review last year. A lot of measures were indicated in the budget.

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, before we were so rudely interrupted we were asking the 
Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs for the terms of reference of 
this cabinet unity committee.
<P>
	It is simply unacceptable for the minister to plead cabinet 
secrecy or solidarity on releasing the terms of reference of a 
committee that is dealing with the whole subject of national unity.
<P>
	I would ask him again. Does this committee have clear terms of 
reference, and could he table those terms of reference in the House?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the answer to the first question is yes and to the second 
question is no.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> We ought to have this kind of break every day.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I need to warm up.
<P>
	Maybe we could look at the membership of this committee. The 
intergovernmental affairs minister has said that this committee has 
regional balance to ensure the views of all Canadians will be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16436"> 16436 </A></B>
<P>
represented. How is that possible when seven out of the nine 
committee members are from central Canada, when the west's only  
representative is a junior minister who won her seat by 11 votes and 
when British Columbia, the third most populous province in the 
country, is not even represented on the committee?
<P>
	About the only positive thing that can be said about this 
committee is that the Deputy Prime Minister is not a member.
<P>
	If this committee is supposed to effectively represent every 
region of the country, why does the west have only one seat and 
British Columbia no seat at all?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is not the custom to comment on the membership of 
committees. In this case there is clearly a regional balance. Unless 
we split people in two we unfortunately cannot have a balance that 
corresponds exactly to the percentage of the population.
<P>
	Also, when the member unfairly talks about the number of votes, 
we should all remember the Parti Quebecois was elected by barely 
three-quarters of one per cent of the popular vote. That means 
nothing. To repeat, in a democracy the people who have the most 
votes get the prize.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, could I put one simple question.
<P>
	British Columbia is the most populous province in western 
Canada and the third most populous province in the country. It has 
a crucial role to play on this issue of national unity and it has a 
different perspective from many other provinces in the country.
<P>
	Will the minister tell us why the province of British Columbia 
does not have representation on the cabinet national unity 
committee?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am afraid the question reveals a wrong understanding of 
the country and a wrong understanding of the parliamentary 
system.
<P>
<B>(1450 )</B>
<P>
	In our parliamentary system, with representative democracy, 
people are elected to express their views and their feelings about 
national interests in the federal Parliament. This is exactly what 
exists.
<P>
	The country is not homogeneous. People who come from Alberta 
are quite able to represent people who come from other areas of the 
country. They are not tied down to their part of the country.
<P>
	It is quite improper for the leader of the third party to assume 
that members of the House are only representative of a small part 
of the country. No. They represent national interests.

	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday the Minister of Justice candidly admitted that 
constitutional problems and Quebec's place in Canada constituted 
new concerns for the government, after the Prime Minister had 
promised changes to Quebecers just days before the referendum.
<P>
	In light of the Minister of Justice's statement yesterday, will the 
Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs admit that the federal 
strategy, which has consisted for two years now in denying the 
existence of a constitutional problem in the country, has failed 
miserably?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, if in fact one looks at the past two years, it will be seen 
that the amount of popular support for the Liberal government in 
the first two years of our mandate has been higher than for any 
government since confederation.
<P>
	So, clearly, we have had a level of popular support based on our 
accomplishments, because we have begun to address Canada's 
economic problems, while the Parti Quebecois and its little brother 
the Bloc Quebecois have not focussed their concerns on this in the 
least. That is what must be done.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as usual, the Minister selects his examples and neglects to 
mention that if there is one place where the government has a fairly 
high unpopularity rating it is Quebec, totally the opposite of the 
other provinces.
<P>
	By choosing the present member for St. Maurice as leader of 
their party in 1990, the Liberals thought they had solved the 
Quebec situation for once and for all.
<P>
	Is the fact that this government convinced Canadians that there 
was no longer any constitutional problem not obvious proof that 
the Liberal government, before deceiving Quebec, deceived the 
rest of Canada?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, what Canadians, Quebecers included, want and what they 
have reaffirmed for Quebec in a recent survey, is that government 
focus on their economic problems.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16437"> 16437 </A></B>
<P>
	The Liberal government, the government of Canada, has 
addressed these problems and cleaned its house in the last budget. I 
would strongly suggest to the opposition that it ensure that its big 
brother, the Parti Quebecois, does the same in Quebec because, like 
Canadians, Quebecers want their economic problems to be  
addressed, and the unemployment and employment problems in 
their province solved.

	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was shocked to 
learn that the Belgian government wants to interview Canadian 
peacekeeping hero, Romeo D'Allaire, for his involvement in the 
death of 10 Belgian peacekeepers he was in charge of during the 
UN mission in Rwanda. UN Ambassador Bob Fowler has known 
about this for a week, yet Canadians have heard nothing.
<P>
	My question is for the Deputy Prime Minister. Why has the 
Canadian government not said something about this and told the 
Canadian public about this very serious event?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I think everyone 
in the House will agree with me when I say that Major General 
D'Allaire served the country with great distinction at a very 
difficult time in Rwanda.
<P>
	As we saw with the events in Somalia a few years ago, it is quite 
possible for certain allegations to be made about an individual's 
conduct from time to time. In this case, as with that case, I think it 
is best that we look at the facts and see exactly what those charges 
are before we jump to any conclusions.
<P>
<B>(1455 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, that is a very 
difficult answer to accept, considering the seriousness of the event.
<P>
	Let us remember that former prime minister Kim Campbell has 
said that Mr. Fowler tended to downplay events during the Somalia 
affair. Is it possible that the government was not fully briefed by 
the UN ambassador about the seriousness of these charges?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member talks about charges as if these were matters that were laid 
in some court.
<P>
	I understand there were certain allegations made in some 
quarters by one of our allies as a result of certain activities in 
Rwanda. We are looking into those allegations.

	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question 
is for the defence minister.
<P>
	Yesterday, the Liberal government announced that a new 
contract for the purchase of new search and rescue helicopters will 
soon be awarded, to replace part of the previous EH-101 contract 
that the Liberal Party cancelled as soon as it took office.
<P>
	Since the government has yet to reach an agreement over the 
penalties following the cancellation of the EH-101 helicopters 
contract with the Agusta, why has it not excluded this company 
from the bidding process?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the discussions 
with respect to compensation are being conducted by my colleague, 
the minister of government services. He may wish to comment 
further if the hon. gentleman wishes any information on that score.
<P>
	I announced yesterday that we were to send out a solicitation of 
interest and then call for proposals from private industry to acquire 
up to 15 search and rescue helicopters. That process is not 
incompatible with the process now being conducted by my 
colleague, the minister of government services.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, since the 
Liberals condemned Agusta when the first contract was signed and 
requested an inquiry into this whole matter, how can the minister of 
defence explain that he has not deemed it appropriate to completely 
exclude Agusta from the new bidding process?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this is another 
attempt at revisionism in history.
<P>
	In the 1993 election campaign the Liberal Party campaigned 
against the acquisition of the EH-101 helicopter because we felt 
that deal was too rich for the pocketbooks of Canadian taxpayers. 
Upon a subsequent examination once we came into office we had 
those original feelings confirmed. It is for that reason that we have 
decided to proceed with the search and rescue helicopters.
<P>
	We have decided to have an open competition, which will allow 
any bidder who has the particular equipment and can meet the 
specifications to have an opportunity to take part in this initiative.

<P>
	Today I want to ask the minister about his policy on significant 
incident reports. I have learned from the information 
commissioner that these reports are now only retained for six 
months and then they are destroyed. Significant incident reports 
are the documents the Somalia inquiry is based on.
<P>
	Why has the minister changed the policy in order to have these 
reports destroyed after only six months?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, once again there 
is a distortion of the facts.
<P>
	We have been working with the information commissioner with 
respect to providing the documents that have been requested under 
access to information. It is very onerous for us right now because of 
the Somalia inquiry and all the attendant curiosity that has gone on. 
We are working with the information commissioner. I believe the 
information commissioner will agree that we are certainly trying to 
meet the expectations he has and conform to the law.
<P>
	With respect to the matter the hon. member raised referring to 
allegations he made yesterday against two top general officers, I 
wish to tell him that Lieutenant-General Boyle, who he named on 
the floor of the House, has served notice in writing to the Canadian 
Broadcasting Corporation of his intent to seek legal opinion and 
perhaps proceed in action against the CBC if there is no retraction 
on that story.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, again the minister did not answer the question I 
posed.
<P>
	Does the minister realize the destruction of significant incident 
reports after six months could prevent situations like the Somali 
affair from ever becoming public?
<P>
	What will the minister do to the correct the problem?

Defence. In many cases the attacks are without much information. 
He attacks members of the armed forces of various ranks. He 
attacks the military police and their ability to do their jobs. He 
attacks general officers as he did in the House yesterday.
<P>
	I would like to know from his leader, the hon. member for 
Calgary Southwest, how the member from the Reform Party, the 
opposition critic, can go outside the House and malign 87 general 
officers by calling them bandits, which means they have committed 
criminal offences, and sit in the House as a critic for the Reform

question is for the defence minister.
<P>
	Despite serious accusations of corruption made against the 
Agusta company in Europe and despite several requests for an 
inquiry made by the Minister of Human Resources Development 
when he was in opposition, the government continues to negotiate 
with the Italian firm the settlement of penalties totalling hundreds 
of millions of dollars for breach of contract with respect to the 
EH-101.
<P>
	Could the fact that the government refuses to dismiss Agusta 
mean that it intends to award the contract for 15 new helicopters to 
this company instead of paying these penalties totalling hundreds 
of millions of dollars? Is the defence minister preparing a sweet 
deal?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Public Works and

making reference to a contract the Government of Canada 
cancelled shortly after taking office.
<P>
	I remind the hon. member as well as others that we successfully 
concluded the termination costs with Loral, thereby resolving that 
matter with that contractor.
<P>
	Negotiations have proceeded with the EH-101. I am happy to 
report that after some very diligent, vigorous work by my deputy 
minister and senior assistant deputy minister an agreement in 
principle has been reached. I would like to provide all details to the 
House, which I will in several months. At that time members of the

<P>
	Knowing that the former NATO secretary general, Willy Claes, 
was forced to resign from his position after being accused of 
accepting bribes from the Italian firm Agusta when Belgium 
purchased EH-101s, how can the government insist on dealing with 
a company whose selling methods are suspicious to say the least?

Boeing, Bell, Sikorsky, Eurocopter and Agusta-Westland as 
possible suppliers for this contract.

question is for the minister of defence.
<P>
	Yesterday, the federal government announced a competition for 
the acquisition of 15 rescue helicopters, with no Canadian content 
requirement in the specifications. Considering that the Canadian 
aerospace industry is concentrated in the Montreal area, how can 
the minister justify this change of heart on the part of the federal 
government, given that, two months ago, he awarded without 
tender a $2 billion contract for armoured personnel carriers to 
Ontario but that he is now taking a different approach for the 
helicopter contract?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I find it quite 
interesting that Bloc members condemn the government for 
yesterday's announcement to buy search and rescue helicopters, 
while many critics, analysts and others in Quebec actually 
congratulated us for it.
<P>
	Just this morning, I read the following in <I>Le Devoir</I>: 
``Yesterday's announcement is good news. As for the price of the 
helicopters, it should not exceed $40 million per aircraft, three 
times less than the EH-101''.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	That is on the one hand. On the second point that the hon. 
member raised with respect to why there was a sole source contract 
for the armoured personnel carriers and a competition on this 
equipment, we have in Canada, with General Motors' diesel 
division in London, the only Canadian manufacturer. It is well 
known. It has a worldwide product mandate for the making of 
armoured vehicles. It was quite logical to have the contract 
awarded and negotiated with that company. Many companies in 
Quebec will benefit because many of the suppliers are located in 
the province of Quebec.
<P>
	When it comes to the helicopters, we do not have that same kind 
of capability, although there may be some offshoots for various 
companies that may compete. Therefore, it makes sense to get the 
best deal by having an open competition and invite people from 
around the world to bid.

<B>(1520)</B>
<P>
	Unfortunately the British Columbia government sort of skipped 
out on that process, short-circuited it and  decided unilaterally to do 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16442"> 16442 </A></B>
<P>
something different without consulting their provincial colleagues, 
without staying within the process and therefore has created a 
problem.
<P>
	As I said before, the law is the law. I find it exceedingly strange 
that when members of the Reform Party are constantly demanding 
in this House that we ensure that individuals live up to the spirit 
and the letter of the law, they do not want a province to live up to 
the spirit and letter of the law.

	<B>Mr. Chris Axworthy (Saskatoon-Clark's Crossing, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Human Resources 
Development.
<P>
	StatsCanada has recently confirmed that young Canadians with 
lower educational qualifications have suffered very badly in the job 
market over the last five years. The statistics confirm that without a 
post-secondary education the doors for employment have been 
slammed shut for young Canadians. We know that education is the 
pathway to the future for young people, yet the government has 
been cutting billions of dollars from transfers to post-secondary 
education to the provinces.
<P>
	How can the minister justify these cuts to the tens of thousands 
of young Canadians who are seeing their opportunities choked off 
by the government's actions?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to answer in two 
specific ways.
<P>
	First, this summer we introduced a brand new student financial 
assistance program that substantially refinanced the ability of 
young people to go back to school. For the first time ever we 
introduced a major grant program that would allow young people 
with high income needs, such as disabled students and women 
going to graduate school, to get specific direct grants. It is the first 
time the federal government has ever offered that kind of 
assistance.
<P>
	Second, this year we introduced a youth internship program. By 
working with the private sector, it allows young people to work half 
time in the business workplace environment and half time to go to 
school. We have signed agreements with a number of human 
resource sector councils in the private sector.
<P>
	This year alone up to 25,000 young people will be enrolled in 
that program, showing how successful it is to be able to get the 
private sector to work with us in partnership in helping young 
people.
<P>

	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleagues, this is a rather special day for the 
House because we have special guests in not only the Speaker's 
gallery but also in the opposition gallery.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Fifty years ago today, Canada became a member of the United 
Nations. On this occasion, I would like to salute the Canadian men 
and women who personify our commitment to the UN.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Seated in the gallery today are peacekeepers of the Canadian 
Armed Forces and Mounted Police who have served in Cyprus, 
Egypt, El Salvador, Haiti, the Golan Heights, Kuwait, 
Mozambique, Namibia, Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia.
<P>
	These men and women represent the 100,000 Canadians who 
have served in peacekeeping missions since Parliament ratified the 
United Nations charter. They are in our galleries to my left and they 
are joined today with their spouses.
<P>
	Today this House, the representatives of the people of Canada, 
salute our peacekeepers, nos Casques bleus, past and present on 
behalf of all Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleagues, I hope you will take a few minutes 
to receive the members of our peacekeeping forces, all three forces 
and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, at a very small reception 
which will be held in room 216-N immediately after question 
period.

<P>
	Finally, I would like to designate November 21 and November 
22 as opposition days.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have two 
questions for the House leader of the government.
<P>
	First, could the hon. House leader indicate whether the 
government intends to introduce any substantial legislation into the 
House between now and December 15, if the House continues in 
operation?
<P>
	Second, could the hon. House leader indicate whether the very 
important reports that have been promised regarding old age 
assistance, Canada pension plan, unemployment insurance are 
going to be tabled in the House? Will the paper on aging come to 
the House? Will a position be presented on the GST? That was 
promised at least two years ago.
<P>
	Finally, would the hon.-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robichaud:</B> Order.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> We allow these interventions if they are short 
questions. I would appeal to all hon. members, should there be any 
more interventions like this, that the questions be very precise and 
as short as possible.
<P>
	I will permit the hon. House leader to answer.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Mr. Speaker, with respect to the second part of the 
hon. member's question, the material on the subjects he has 
mentioned will be brought forward in due course in a way that is 
consistent with the red book, the throne speech and the budgets of 
the government.
<P>
	With respect to the first part of the hon. member's question, the 
answer is definitely yes.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I would encourage the hon. House leader of the 
Reform Party to perhaps have a meeting with the hon. House leader 
of the government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. It was our 
understanding there was to be a statement made at this time in 
reference to Armistice Day. I believe if you were to seek it you 
would find that was the agreement of the House.
<P>
	If such is the case perhaps we could proceed with that prior to 
going to Government Orders.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> As I understand it, the chief 
government whip is correct. We will proceed beginning with the 
hon. Minister of Veterans Affairs.

	<B>Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Secretary of State (Veterans), 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to those Canadians 
who gave their lives for freedom and  democracy in serving their 
country in two world wars, the Korean war and in peacekeeping 
missions.
<P>
	On Saturday in ceremonies across the country and in cemeteries 
around the world where soldiers rest in peace, Canadians will pay 
tribute to our war dead. This has been a cherished tradition on 
November 11 ever since the end of the first world war on that date 
in 1918.
<P>
	Through the course of this century Canadians have responded to 
the call of duty again and again. They have shown their strength, 
courage and conviction in defence of democracy and in the interest 
of peace. As the years pass and the veterans of these earlier wars 
age and pass away, it is up to each new generation of Canadians to 
continue the memory of their sacrifice and courage.
<P>
	It is up to each new generation of young Canadians to reflect that 
the men and women who gave their lives were young themselves. 
They fought for liberty with the strength and idealism of their 
youth. Many others sacrificed their youth in the terrible ordeal of 
war.
<P>
	The Prime Minister has declared November 4 to 12 veterans 
week. We have used this week as an occasion to honour those who 
made the ultimate sacrifice and those men and women who came 
back from the war and kept on contributing to Canada.
<P>
	These veterans come from all regions of Canada. They serve 
their country with pride and distinction. They left behind in the 
cemeteries of Europe, Southeast Asia, North Africa and the Pacific 
comrades who died for their country without a thought of whether 
they come from the east or the west or whether they fought for this 
province or that. They fought and died for Canadians. All 
Canadians in every province share the legacy of peace and freedom 
they left for us.
<P>
	On Saturday the country will unite to remember her war dead. 
Let every Canadian remember and cherish the memories of those 
who have sacrificed so much. Let us put aside our partisan 
differences and our conflicting visions of tomorrow. Let us pay 
tribute to those who gave us the freedom we have to choose our 
destiny, the freedom we share with Canadians.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, on behalf of 
the Bloc Quebecois, which forms the official opposition in this 
House, I am pleased to rise this afternoon in honour of 
Remembrance Day. Tradition dictates that, every November 11, we 
take a few moments to remember those who have served in the two 
world wars and in the Korean war.
<P>
	Of course, we must also remember those who served in the 
numerous UN peacekeeping missions. Remembrance Day is 
especially significant this year since last spring marked the 50th 
anniversary of the end of World War II. Today, we want to thank all 
those who served at the front, the sailors and airmen and women 
from all regions  of Canada, the members of the merchant navy, the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16444"> 16444 </A></B>
<P>
nurses, and all the men and women who risked or gave their lives to 
overcome tyranny.
<P>
	We must never forget that over 100,000 young Canadians and 
Quebecers lost their lives in the two major global conflicts, while 
hundreds of others died in Korea and in various peacekeeping 
missions. Unfortunately, many bloody conflicts are still raging 
throughout the world. Let us think about all those who are 
responsible for keeping the peace in the world, in particular the 
Canadian peacekeepers.
<P>
<B>(1535)</B>
<P>
	One of the main roles of the Canadian Forces at the international 
level is to participate in peacekeeping operations. This is an 
invaluable asset and international achievement for Canada.
<P>
	On behalf of all Bloc members, I wish to congratulate all 
members of the various Legion branches. We sincerely thank them 
for honouring the memory of the young Canadians and Quebecers 
who left everything behind and went overseas to fight for peace and 
freedom.
<P>
	Today we remember the selfless sacrifices made by those to 
whom we owe this legacy of freedom and democracy.
<P>
	The heavy human casualties and the great suffering of all those 
affected by these endless wars are beyond comprehension.
<P>
	As the Leader of the Official Opposition said in marking the 50th 
anniversary of the end of the second world war, who can describe 
the terrible pain of the mothers and fathers whose son was killed in 
the prime of his life? And what about the widows and orphans, the 
brothers and sisters forever deprived of a loved one who left one 
day for a faraway country to meet his destiny as a sacrificed hero?
<P>
	Like those who gave their lives, all these brave people also 
fought so that there would be no more wars and that future 
generations would be spared the attendant atrocities, suffering and 
upheaval.
<P>
	This was, however, the price we had to pay for our commitment 
to peace and democracy. It is precisely because our young soldiers 
shared these values that they felt compelled to defend them 
overseas.
<P>
	We must therefore sincerely thank again all those who died and, 
of course, all those who survived these tragedies.
<P>
	Let us pay them a vibrant tribute and honour their memory.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise to remember and pay tribute to those brave 
Canadians who served their country and those who lost their lives 
or suffered injuries or loss in the terrible  wars of this century. On 
behalf of our party, our constituencies, our constituents and all 
Canadians who remember, we offer our profound respect and 
deepest thanks.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	That reminds me that there are no French Canadians or English 
Canadians in cemeteries in Europe, only Canadians. I pray that this 
fact unites us in peacetime as in wartime.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	At the same time we remember and pay tribute to the current 
members of our armed forces, many of whom have served or are 
serving as peacekeepers in the troubled places of the world. Again 
on behalf of our constituents and on behalf of all Canadians who 
cherish peace, we offer our profound respect and our deepest 
thanks.
<P>
	November 11 is called Remembrance Day. Our children rightly 
ask what precisely it is we are asked to remember. If we ask the 
living, the loved ones and friends of those who served and fell in 
the wars, they will say we remember our loved ones and friends 
who gave their lives for freedom and democracy, and they will be 
right. However, if we could ask those who served and fell what they 
would like us to remember, I believe they would tell us to 
remember the great lesson their loss teaches us: the lesson that 
freedom and democracy cannot be preserved without self-sacrifice.
<P>
	If each of us every day, year after year, makes the small 
sacrifices of time, energy and self-interest necessary to preserve 
our freedoms, that is enough. But if we neglect to make those small 
daily sacrifices then someday, somewhere down the road, a vast 
multitude of people like those we honour on Remembrance Day 
must make the ultimate sacrifice on our behalf.
<P>
<B>(1540)</B>
<P>
	Today I say let us make our tributes and on November 11 let us 
lay our wreaths. But, above all, each day after that let us practise 
the great lesson: that freedom and democracy cannot be preserved 
without self-sacrifice on our part. Such practice would be the 
highest tribute we could pay to those who fought and fell as well as 
to those who stand on guard for Canada today.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simon de Jong (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is an honour for me to join my colleagues on behalf of 
the New Democratic Party in remembering those who died and 
suffered during the past great wars. This year marks the 50th 
anniversary of the end of the last great war, both in Europe and 
Southeast Asia.
<P>
	It is also a personal gratitude that I have the great honour to 
express today in the House to the Parliament of Canada. Coming 
from Holland, where many of my relatives had part in the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16445"> 16445 </A></B>
<P>
resistance against the fascism that swept through Europe, on their 
behalf and on behalf  of my former countrymen in the Netherlands I 
wish to express our great gratitude and appreciation to those young 
Canadian men and women who liberated us from the shadow of 
fascism.
<P>
	Having been born in the Dutch East Indies and a few months 
after my birth being incarcerated in a Japanese prisoner of war 
camp with my mother and my older brother, and my father 
eventually being taken a prisoner of war and incarcerated in a 
prisoner of war camp in Japan, I wish to express my personal 
gratitude to those men and women of the allied forces who 
liberated us. If it were not for them I would not be alive today. It is 
a very personal matter for me to stand in the House and express our 
deepest gratitude to those men and women who sacrificed their 
lives to save others.
<P>
	As we remember them, let us also remember why the young 
Canadian men and women went forward in their great act of 
sacrifice. It was to preserve democracy and freedom as we know 
them. It was to fight against the intolerance that had swept through 
Europe and Asia at the time. As we remember their deeds, it is 
important for us to also reaffirm ourselves to the ideals of 
democracy, freedom and tolerance. Without tolerance, democracy 
and freedom cannot exist.
<P>
	As we live through today's age of rapid social and technological 
changes, which create psychological insecurities, the ugly head of 
intolerance rises now and then. As we remember the dead, let us 
also remember the great purpose of freedom, democracy and 
tolerance.
<P>
	On behalf of my colleagues, myself, my family and the people of 
the Netherlands, I thank those great Canadian men and women who 
did so much.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to pay tribute to the many Canadians who sacrificed so much for 
the peace and freedom we all enjoy today.
<P>
	The first world war ended at 11 a.m. on November 11, 1918. We 
reflect each Remembrance Day on that time and on that date. 
World War I left close to 70,000 Canadians dead and almost twice 
as many wounded. The second world war took the lives of 45,000 
Canadians. Canadians also gave their lives during the Korean war 
and our armed forces answered when the United Nations called for 
action to put an end to Iraq's aggression against Kuwait. Canadians 
have never backed down or run away in the face of such aggression. 
Our troops have put their lives on the line when international peace 
and security has been at risk.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	I, like my colleague of the New Democratic Party, am personally 
aware of World War II because I had two brothers who served in 
Holland.
<P>
	As a child at that time I remember how we used to work and save 
our pennies to buy Canadian stamps, how we used to take our 
toothpaste tubes to school. Some of the boys used to bring their 
little metal toys and turn them in. All of us have memories, but I 
have happy memories because my brothers returned home safe and 
sound.
<P>
	Canadians know that to ensure world peace the laws that govern 
relationships among nations must be respected and enforced. That 
is why we have almost 2,000 members of the Canadian military 
serving throughout the world in peace and humanitarian 
operations.
<P>
	This year we commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the end of 
the second world war and on Remembrance Day and this Veterans' 
Week let us commit, each and every one of us, to honouring those 
who risked so much on our behalf through concrete action. In 
Holland during VE Day celebrations Canadian veterans were 
treated like royalty for their role in the liberation of that country.
<P>
	Here at home we must continue to remember and show our 
gratitude to those who risked everything so that we would have the 
country we have today with our rights and freedoms. That is why 
we have to protect the programs vital to the well-being of so many 
veterans.
<P>
	Today I say thank you to those who fought for the freedoms we 
enjoy. I say thank you to those who continue to wear the uniform of 
Canada for their extraordinary service to all of us.
<P>
	Let us not forget the price that has been paid so that we could live 
in peace, individually and collectively. Let us be vigilant about 
maintaining that peace.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion, with 
amendment.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Resuming debate on Bill 
C-96.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, as you indicated 
earlier, I was not completely done with my remarks on Bill C-96. I 
would like to use the three or four minutes remaining to raise two 
major points.
<P>
	I heard comments the minister and the hon. member for St. 
Boniface made to the effect that the official opposition was 
worrying for nothing, that it need not worry about clause 20 
because, even though the minister was giving himself greater 
powers-these are certainly not duties or functions; we are talking 
mostly about powers here-he did not intend to encroach on 
provincial powers or responsibilities.
<P>
	My father used to say: ``To predict the future or to know how 
someone will perform in the future, just look at their performance 
for the past few months or years''.
<P>
	The Minister of Human Resources Development has been in 
office for two years now and we can clearly see two things. There 
are many things, but I will focus on these two. First, we will recall 
that among the many budgetary provisions contained in Bill C-17, 
there was one concerning cuts to the unemployment insurance 
program, which I would briefly summarize as follows: longer 
qualifying period, lower amounts and shorter benefit period. Let us 
bear this in mind.
<P>
	The impact of these provisions was felt throughout Canada, but 
since I am from Quebec, let me point out that the labour minister 
mentioned again just recently how many more Quebecers were 
forced on welfare as a result.
<P>
	The minister, in his speech this morning, spoke about young 
people, and said that, all things considered, there were not that 
many more unemployed young people. That is true, but in Quebec, 
at least, there are many more people on welfare, including young 
people. It think that has to be pointed out.
<P>
	Furthermore, as the training and youth critic for my party, I 
would like to remind the House of what we heard in committee, 
which was that, in Bill C-28, the minister and the parliamentary 
secretary were giving themselves the right to designate the 
appropriate authority, when the previous act gave that right to the 
governor in council, meaning the provincial governments. Why? 
Because, in  the Constitution, this is an area of exclusive provincial 
jurisdiction.
<P>
	Moreover, in section 14(7), the minister dealt with the opting-out 
privilege which the government of Quebec has always requested 
and which it was able to use, but now there were some new 
conditions. Now, each element of the student financial assistance 
program had to meet the requirements of the federal government's 
financial assistance program. The minister was giving himself the 
right to determine how similar the two programs were. I just 
wanted to remind the House of all of this before concluding my 
remarks.
<P>
	And finally, I want to thank the hon. member for Mercier, who is 
sitting right behind me, for her excellent work as deputy 
chairperson of the human resources development committee. As 
the official opposition critic, she spoke today more specifically to 
the people of Quebec, asking them to watch out, because Prime 
Minister Jean Chrétien was about to make them face the music, as 
he promised to do in answer to a question put to him in the House 
not so long ago.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Before the question and 
comment period, I would like to remind all members that they 
cannot refer to hon. members by their names, but that they have to 
use the name of their ridings or their title. I know it is sometimes 
easy to forget, but I wanted to remind the House because this is an 
important point within our parliamentary rules.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
as always when the hon. member speaks I pay a great deal of 
attention.
<P>
<B>(1555 )</B>
<P>
	I have had the pleasure to work with the hon. member on the 
human resources committee and so I clearly understand the 
philosophical disposition he has toward matters related to human 
resources development.
<P>
	I find it quite ironic that the Bloc Quebecois would accuse the 
federal government of engaging in an exercise of political power 
grabbing when in this piece of legislation we are trying to empower 
not only the federal government but provincial partners and local 
stakeholders to give us an opportunity to better serve the people of 
Canada, whether they are in la belle province de Québec or outside.
<P>
	I also bring to the hon. member's attention that we as a federal 
government have a role to play in matters he outlined during his 
speech. One is the Unemployment Insurance Act which dates back 
to 1941 and gives a role to the federal government to engage in a 
process whereby we will give income support to the people of 
Canada and also a set of tools so they can re-enter the workforce.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16447"> 16447 </A></B>
<P>
	I have a different view of what is going on in the relationship 
between the federal government, provincial governments and local 
communities. Over the years we have demonstrated that as a 
federal government we engage very much in co-operative, flexible 
federalism-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bevilacqua:</B> I hear some rumbling on the Reform Party side 
which is quite obvious. It has nothing to say and so it just moans 
and groans.
<P>
	Despite the differences that exist, some of them political in 
nature, some philosophical, we have engaged in many innovative 
partnerships between Human Resources Development Canada and 
Quebec agencies. HRDC, Human Resources Development 
Canada-I am talking to the Reform Party so it gets its acronyms 
right-in partnerships with two Quebec government departments is 
supporting job search training for youth through le Relais des 
jeunes adultes du Sud-Ouest de Montréal; 65 per cent of the 
participants so far have found work.
<P>
	In partnership with the Societé québécoise de développement de 
la main-d'oeuvre HRDC provides financial assistance to help new 
entrepreneurs to get into business through la Société d'aide au 
développement des collectivités de Sorel-Tracy Inc.
<P>
	In partnership with SQDM, HRDC helped workers affected by a 
Hyundai plant closing in Bromont last March; 80 per cent of those 
workers found work or took further vocational training.
<P>
	The CEC and la Société du développement économique de 
Jonquière have established a partnership to compile and share 
labour market information.
<P>
	There is a single window service joining HRDC, le commissaire 
industriel and l'Office de tourisme in Témiscamingue to deliver 
services in industrial, rural and tourism development. The list is 
absolutely endless.
<P>
	I tell the hon. member in a very clear and concise manner that 
Canada works. Does it work perfectly? No. Can it use some 
improvements? Of course. We can achieve positive change in 
federal, provincial and community relationships as we redefine. 
This is a very important exercise in the redefinition of the 
relationship between the individual, the community and the state.
<P>
	It is within this framework that we must continue to work 
together to achieve those positive ends that will facilitate the 
process of getting people off unemployment rolls and on to 
payrolls.
<P>
	I know the hon. member shares this vision because he, like me, 
wants to get people off welfare, off unemployment and into safe, 
secure jobs.
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dubé:</B> Mr. Speaker, I can see the hon. parliamentary 
secretary is more skilful with comments than with questions. But 
he did ask a question, and he said in his preamble that we seem to 
have a different perception of the facts, and I agree.
<P>
	He is quite right, his point of view and mine are quite different. 
In my opinion, decentralization means that, in areas under 
provincial jurisdiction, the federal government should enter into 
agreements with the provinces. But they think decentralization 
means that Ottawa rakes in the money through the UI plan. 
Incidentally, the federal government has not put any money into the 
UI fund since 1991, but it is keeping control of the fund and goes so 
far as to imply that it is being generous, when in fact that money 
comes from the employees and the employers of Canada, including 
Quebec.
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary should know that the federal 
government got involved in the UI fund through a constitutional 
agreement and then with the approval of the provinces. It was 
aware at the time that this is an area under provincial jurisdiction. 
That agreement allowed the federal government to establish the 
unemployment insurance commission.
<P>
	Now, because the federal government manages the UI fund, it is 
using the power of money to do things, and it made a string of 
announcements. There may be one he does not know. One week 
after the referendum, the hon. member for Beauce made an 
announcement concerning the Minister of Human Resources 
Development. As you know, cuts in the employment centres had 
been announced right and left. The employment centre located in 
the constituency of the hon. member for Beauce was going to be 
transferred to the neighbouring Frontenac constituency.
<P>
	The hon. member for Beauce made representations, obviously 
accepted to chair the no committee and announced, one week after 
the referendum, that the Minister of Human Resources 
Development had agreed to keep a number of employees in the 
Beauce constituency rather than transferring them all as previously 
expected. Furthermore, there would be a special project in this 
constituency. Within this kind of decentralization, an independent 
member-instead of a province-would be able to create a 
consultation or support centre to help industries train their own 
employees. We, the official opposition, are against this kind of 
decentralization.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciated my hon. colleague's comments on this very 
important topic.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16448"> 16448 </A></B>
<P>
	I note with interest the comments of the parliamentary secretary 
that Canada works, that his government has been bringing forward 
a flexible and co-operative approach and therefore he does not 
understand what the problem would be. I can tell him the problem 
is that his government is not flexible and has not been very 
co-operative with the provinces. That is the big reason we have 
the problems in Canada today.
<P>
	It is interesting to note that this afternoon during question 
period, the hon. Minister of Health indicated how co-operative she 
is. She got up and bragged that she is going to be penalizing Alberta 
to the extent of over $400,000 a month in cutbacks in the transfer 
payments. That is how co-operative the government is with the 
provinces. Is it any wonder we have problems with the province of 
Quebec as well.
<P>
	It is very interesting to note that the Reform Party on the other 
hand has put forward a positive agenda for change and has 
devolved manpower training to the provinces. That is what we look 
to for innovative ways to make Confederation work.
<P>
	Perhaps the hon. member would care to comment on what his 
experience has been in how co-operative the Liberal government 
has been over the past two years. Is there further merit in the 
devolution of powers to the provinces if we are going to make 
Confederation work?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Let me remind everyone that 
the 10-minute question and comment period has almost lapsed. The 
response should be in 60 seconds or less.
<P>
<B>(1605)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dubé:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would simply like to say that I listened 
with great interest to the remarks made by my colleague from the 
Reform Party. It makes me realize that, even though the members 
opposite, on the government side, would have us believe that they 
only have problems with Quebec, they do have problems elsewhere 
as well.
<P>
	Now, regarding Quebec's position, it is quite clear. In a 
resolution adopted unanimously by the National Assembly under 
the Liberal government of Mr. Daniel Johnson, chairman of the no 
committee, Quebec has stated that it wants to be given exclusive 
jurisdiction over manpower, for example, as well as tax points 
equivalent to what the federal government is spending in this area 
at the present time in this province.
<P>
	Quebec has been asking for that for a long time.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the bill before the House has a straightforward goal. It provides the 
legal mandate and structure for Human Resources Development 
Canada.
<P>
	As the debate has already shown, we are not simply discussing 
technical legislation; we are in fact talking about a vision. That 
vision is one of Canadians and communities meeting the challenges 
of a new economy. It is a vision of a federal government that works 
as a partner within Canadian communities. It is a vision based on 
jobs, growth and results.
<P>
	This is not a vision of the future; it is a reality today. At a time 
when people ask how governments can get closer to the people they 
serve, HRDC is showing the way. This is true in every province and 
every territory. I know it is certainly true in the riding I represent in 
the House of Commons, York North.
<P>
	York North is one of the most dynamic areas in Canada. There 
are new families, new businesses and new opportunities 
everywhere in the riding. However, growth does not simply 
happen. We have to build for success. This is what we are achieving 
in York North.
<P>
	We are doing it through the York North technology strategy. This 
strategy was developed by working together with municipal 
governments, businesses, community organizations and area 
residents. It will prepare the people and communities in my riding 
for the 21st century. It will help them make the most of today's 
technology and will allow them to turn change into opportunity. It 
will equip people with tools which will help them compete in the 
economy we see emerging all around us.
<P>
	The government has been there to help. We have been able to use 
the department's flexible and effective programs to translate this 
strategy into concrete, innovative projects. We have been able to 
match the energy of community leaders in the York region with the 
tools of Human Resources Development Canada.
<P>
	One example is our new York region strategic alliance. The 
Regional Municipality of York, Seneca College and local 
employers have joined with the federal government to foster jobs 
and growth in this region. We are pooling resources and skills. We 
are sharing overhead and information. We are finding projects 
which will offer a real bang for the buck in terms of job creation.
<P>
	Strategic alliance's first project is taking place in the city of 
Vaughan. It is a pilot survey which will develop a database on local 
business opportunities and resources. This information will be 
available to employers around the world via the Internet. It will 
help employers who are considering Vaughan as a place to do 
business. It will help those already there who are considering 
expansion.
<P>
	Human Resources Development Canada was approached to help 
out with this initiative. Recognizing the importance of upgrading 
skills and modernizing the economy, our government supported 
this initiative.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16449"> 16449 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1610 )</B>
<P>
	Today, current unemployment insurance recipients are acquiring 
new skills that will help them return to the workforce on a more 
permanent basis. They are creating the database. They are doing 
the research. They are entering data and writing reports. They are 
learning and acquiring marketable skills. They are achieving and 
contributing to the well-being of the Canadian economy.
<P>
	We see strategic alliance as a solid investment in the future of 
our economy. I use the word investment with good reason. We 
expect two results from this project that will continue long after the 
Human Resources Development Canada funding is over.
<P>
	The first is that each of these employees will have better skills to 
bring to new employers. They will have received active help from 
unemployment insurance, not just temporary income. They will be 
back on the job, not back on the UI treadmill. The second is that the 
city of Vaughan and then all of York region will have an effective 
pool of resources and tools to create and attract jobs. That is only 
one of the many excellent examples of how HRDC works with 
communities.
<P>
	Just over a month ago I announced the establishment of the 
technology enterprise centre in the city of Vaughan. It was a very 
important day for the city. Vaughan is a young community in many 
ways. Many of my constituents are young people and parents who 
are concerned about the future. They know the economy demands 
more from all of us. They are prepared to meet that challenge. They 
need a government that will help them and their children acquire 
the skills the new economy demands.
<P>
	The technology enterprise centre is one way to provide essential 
skills. The project is sponsored by the Vaughan economic and 
technology development department. When the project is in full 
swing, 60 participants will have learned entrepreneurial skills, 
skills that are important in creating jobs for themselves and also 
creating jobs for other Canadians.
<P>
	Those entrepreneurial skills will have a particular focus: the high 
technology sector. The centre will work with unemployed residents 
between the ages of 19 and 34 who have a background in 
technology or research. It will help them gain the skills to start 
their own high tech businesses, or work for one of the many 
enterprises already established in Vaughan. This promises to be an 
intensive program with a realistic basis. After all, we know that 
companies such as Microsoft started in garages. Who knows where 
the next leaders of this innovative technology based revolution will 
come from?
<P>
	Community leaders in the private sector and at the city of 
Vaughan knew we have people who want to create opportunities. 
They were willing to contribute computer equipment to support 
this idea. They were willing to secure corporate sponsors to keep 
this idea going. They  needed a partner to help get this off the 
ground. Once again our government was there to help.
<P>
	We are deeply committed to the employment needs of youth. We 
recognize the importance of entrepreneurship in our high 
technology industries. Thanks to the support of our government 
based targeted labour market initiative, this is a chance to test a 
great idea with a great deal of potential.
<P>
	The federal government earmarked funding for the technology 
enterprise centre. This is one more example of this government's 
commitment to listen to communities. We work with their 
priorities; we focus on creating results. This is fundamental to the 
new way of governing and governance in this country.
<P>
	It is extremely important for us to reach out to the communities, 
to reach out to individuals and to help them along. More important, 
it is really about people investing in people, helping people help 
themselves, creating the entrepreneurial environment where jobs 
are created and to give young people the opportunity to acquire the 
skills required to meet the challenges of the new economy.
<P>
<B>(1615 )</B>
<P>
	Statistics show us that 45 per cent of all new jobs created 
between 1990 and the year 2000 will require more than 16 years of 
training and education. Never before have education and training 
played such a vital role in our children's future. In order to face this 
challenge head on, the public, private and educational sectors must 
band together to give our children the tools they need to succeed.
<P>
	Last fall, together with Mr. Colin Morrison of the Career 
Foundation and Philipp Tafelmacher, president of Tetra-Pak, I 
introduced the York Region Compact, a partnership for learning. 
This unique co-operative education program focuses on matching 
students with local companies based on the student's career goals, 
skills, and the requirements of the organizations.
<P>
	This spring I announced federal support for training young 
people in the automotive repair and service sector. As a result of an 
internship partnership forged between the Canadian Automotive 
Repair Service Knowledge Network, CARS, whose head office is 
located in Richmond Hill, and Human Resources Development 
Canada, labour and the private sector working together, over 1,000 
young people will receive hands on experience in this expanding 
industry with one of the major automakers, whether it be Chrysler, 
Ford or General Motors.
<P>
	What is important is that we are in fact training young people for 
jobs with a future. Why are we focusing on CARS? Why are we 
focusing on environmental technology, computers and tourism? It 
is because these are jobs with a future. We want to give young 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16450"> 16450 </A></B>
<P>
people the  skills required to obtain a job in a very competitive 
marketplace where jobs are long lasting and high paying.
<P>
	This government has created over 500,000 jobs so far, and the 
majority are full time, high paying jobs. It is a highly paid, highly 
skilled, high value added society that we want to create so that the 
quality of life for Canadians can be maintained.
<P>
	I am very proud to be a partner in initiatives such as the ones I 
have outlined. However, we could never have set these projects in 
motion without first being a community with the foresight to 
develop such a plan for the future.
<P>
	The North York technology strategy is about a community that is 
committed to working together. It is about people, employers, 
community organizations, and governments that are prepared to 
combine their efforts and work together for results that will benefit 
us for a long time to come.
<P>
	If I had the time I could discuss so many other examples of 
similar kinds of human resource development co-operation 
programs I have seen. One excellent example is the 
self-employment assistance program that has helped 34,000 people 
across Canada start businesses. Those businesses have created 
68,000 jobs. In North York literally hundreds of people have 
benefited from this program.
<P>
	The same is true about our support of young people. In April 
1994 our government unveiled the youth employment and learning 
strategy. This strategy is a cumulative result of many years of 
consultation, policy development, symposia, and town hall 
meetings with Canadians from coast to coast to coast.
<P>
	This Liberal government recognizes that our youth is a very 
important resource, and as such should be treated with a great deal 
of dignity and priority. That is why this year, during a time of fiscal 
restraint, the overall budget for youth employment services was 
increased by $43 million, to $236 million. We understand that 
investing in young people is an excellent investment for the future 
of this country.
<P>
<B>(1620 )</B>
<P>
	An important element of the youth employment and learning 
strategy is the national summer job action plan, which I announced 
in the city of Vaughan this spring. This year the student summer job 
action program created 44,500 jobs nationwide. When we include 
the spinoffs from the Canada Employment Centres for students, we 
created almost 250,000 jobs for our young people.
<P>
	Youth Service Canada and the youth internship program are 
viable, very interesting, and positive measures for young people. 
Youth Service Canada gives young people a chance to develop 
skills and confidence while serving their community. Participants 
receive a $2,000 voucher to be used for tuition or to start a  
business. To date, Youth Service Canada has given more than 3,500 
young Canadians a head start on their career path.
<P>
	The youth internship program provides a combination of training 
on the job and in class, with a balance of both specific and basic 
employment. Some 27,000 young people have benefited from this 
program since its inception.
<P>
	The government invests in results. We are committed to 
innovation, co-operation and flexibility. We know that people and 
communities understand their priorities. We know they are willing 
to make a real commitment to meeting these priorities, and we are 
willing to work with them in a way that meets their needs.
<P>
	At the same time we are adapting more than the services we 
provide. We are improving the way in which these services are 
delivered. In order to serve our clients better we have developed an 
integrated, affordable, highly flexible and decentralized service 
delivery network. This network incorporates new strategies and 
new tools for getting employment services and programs into the 
hands of the people who need them. While it maintains a face to 
face service that clients need it adds new technology features which 
enhance and expand service delivery.
<P>
	The use of new technology will be a key feature of the new 
service delivery network. Through electronic information kiosks, 
on line database and telephone access systems, the department 
hopes to extend its reach to clients and all Canadians. New 
technology will enhance the capacity of our staff to deliver 
information and services. Through built in flexibility, our staff is 
responding to what Canadians want and keeping pace with rapid 
changes in the job market. These initiatives and improvements are 
really the point of Bill C-96, which creates a department that will 
work with Canadians.
<P>
	Everywhere I go throughout the country, whether it is in the 
Atlantic provinces, British Columbia, Alberta or the province of 
Ontario, I find that people are responding positively to the new way 
of delivering services. They are responding positively to the new 
way of bringing people together. I am quite excited by the 
revolution that is occurring in every single province, in every city, 
in every community of this great land. People are coming together, 
finding out what their priorities are. They have a federal 
government that facilitates this meeting of people and bringing an 
idea to fruition, facilitates the ability to be accountable and to 
deliver services that make sense.
<P>
	The federal government is reclaiming relevance at the 
community level. Any hard working member of Parliament who 
has the ability to lead their community, the ability to facilitate the 
meeting of people, and who has the deep desire to bring about 
positive change in their community can do so, because we have 
built into 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16451"> 16451 </A></B>
<P>
this legislation the type of flexibility that will bring their  dreams 
and the dreams of Canadians from coast to coast to reality.
<P>
<B>(1625 )</B>
<P>
	It is not now the time to throw up your hands and say that Canada 
is not worth it. It is time to roll up your sleeves and make your 
community work.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is rather surprising to hear such a statement only two 
weeks after the referendum results.
<P>
	It is true that the Yes side got 49,4 p. 100 of the vote, but if there 
is one issue on which a referendum today would lead to a landslide 
victory, it is the return of powers to Quebec regarding manpower 
training.
<P>
	Again this week, Mr. Gérald A. Ponton, chairman of the 
Association des manufacturiers du Québec-not a member of the 
Parti Quebecois, not a member of the Bloc Quebecois, but the 
chairman of the Association des manufacturiers du 
Québec-clearly stated that there is a consensus in Quebec, that it 
was reiterated during the referendum campaign, that if the federal 
government wants to give us clear evidence of the will for reform it 
expressed during the week prior to the referendum, it should give 
the Government of Quebec the responsibility for all manpower 
training.
<P>
	It is very surprising to hear the member state that the present 
government wants to have concrete results to show how effective it 
is. From September 1994 to September 1995, the number of 
welfare recipients increased by 20,000, mostly because the 
unemployment insurance rules were tightened up by this 
government that wanted to create, in the unemployment fund, an 
artificial surplus that will amount to about $5 billion for this year. 
When the government makes decisions like this one that leads 
people to apply for welfare, I think we see very concrete results that 
do not reflect very well on the present government.
<P>
	In his speech, the member used the term ``decentralize''. That 
must be one of these words that does not mean the same thing in 
Canada and in Quebec. In every management book I studied, 
decentralization means mandating somebody to assume the whole 
responsibility of some undertaking. Everything there is in the bill 
presented by the Minister of Human Resources Development is to 
be found in clause 6 which reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The powers, duties and functions of the Minister extend to and include all 
matters over which Parliament has jurisdiction relating to the development of 
the human resources of Canada not by law assigned to any other Minister, 
department, board or agency of the Government of Canada-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This bill does not mention provincial responsibilities, contrary to 
Bill C-95 which at least, in the health area, contained clauses 
ensuring that the federal government  would not encroach upon 
provincial jurisdiction. In this bill, nothing is said about that.
<P>
	When you look at all those elements, it seems fair to ask the 
government if this bill, tabled before the outcome of the 
referendum, should not have died on the Order Paper, because it 
shows clearly that the federal government has no intention 
whatsoever of making real changes. It wants to make cosmetic 
changes only. The way to show they want change would be to 
amend the bill so that manpower training can become an exclusive 
jurisdiction for Quebec.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bevilacqua:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am often quite puzzled by some 
of the questions the Bloc Quebecois asks in the House of 
Commons.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> It does not take much 
to puzzle you.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bevilacqua:</B> I wonder if a member from British Columbia 
who came to a neighbouring riding and was able to draw only six 
people has the right to even express an opinion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> Nobody has the right 
except you. You are the only one with rights here.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bevilacqua:</B> I want to tell the hon. member that there was 
no question, as he may recall, on the June offer the Minister of 
Human Resources Development made to the provincial minister of 
employment, basically asking to sit down and perhaps come up 
with some different arrangements for a local economic 
development strategy for the province of Quebec and indeed any 
other province that would like to participate.
<P>
<B>(1630 )</B>
<P>
	I find that quite ironic, considering that the government, in 
co-operation with the people of Canada, has been able to create a 
climate where there have been over 500,000 full time, high paying 
jobs created since the October 1993 election.
<P>
	We have made offers to the provinces on the issue of the labour 
market. The hon. member knows that. As a matter of fact, we have 
continually made offers and it has taken a long time for the minister 
from Quebec responsible for employment to even have the decency 
to respond to the offers made by the Minister of Human Resources 
Development.
<P>
	If the hon. member is asking if can we make some changes to the 
way the federal government and the provinces relate, I submit that 
changes should be made not only with the provinces but with the 
way in which we deal with communities and individuals. The hon. 
member knows that governing and governance is an evolving 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16452"> 16452 </A></B>
<P>
process. Changes have occurred throughout the past two years. I 
cited earlier in my comments, in  response to the member for Lévis, 
a number of initiatives that are working quite well.
<P>
	When I was in Pierrefonds, Quebec, avec ton cher collègue du 
Parti québécois, le ministre de l'Éducation, Mr. Garon, we were 
there working together, ensemble, to make sure that by pooling the 
resources available, 1,000 young people, in co-operation with the 
Sectoral Council of Cars and Chrysler Canada, would get jobs.
<P>
	When you speak to young Quebecers, when you speak to young 
Albertans, when you speak to young British Columbians, their 
dream is to get a job, to have the type of security that the 
government is providing.
<P>
	Are we open to leading the way in these consultations toward 
change? Of course we are. It is unfair for any member of the 
opposition to say that no progress has been made because the 
numbers speak for themselves.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was 
interested that the parliamentary secretary in his vision of the new 
Canada said that the federal government works as a partner. Some 
partner. This is a partner that just finished removing $7 billion from 
the social spending envelope. What kind of a partner is that?
<P>
	All the words that the government keeps coming up with are 
nothing more than the platitudes of speech writers. Would he care 
to enlighten us as to who wrote his speech?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I want to remind my 
colleagues on all sides of the House to please make their 
interventions through the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bevilacqua:</B> Mr. Speaker, you can rest assured it was not a 
member of the Reform Party. Speeches have to make sense and I 
would never go to them for any advice on that.
<P>
	The hon. member knows because he has visited my community 
that it is working quite well. It is doing that with a Liberal member 
on the government side.
<P>
	This is what Reform Party members do a lot. They sit here and 
complain about cuts. When they ran in the 1993 election, they were 
going to cut approximately $15 billion from social spending. Since 
then, they have come up with a super RRSP for seniors that would 
actually reduce benefits for our seniors.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> Baloney.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bevilacqua:</B> There you are, Reform. It takes away maternity 
benefits. This is the type of cave age Reformers we have in this 
House. They seem to throw numbers and figures around. You 
should even check your super RSP-
<P>
<B>(1635)</B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order, please. I know that 
there are strongly held views in most debates, if not all of them, but 
there is a proper way to conduct debates and going through the 
Chair is most helpful.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bevilacqua:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will do that. There are correct 
views and there are wrong views. I believe that the hon. member is 
expressing wrong views.
<P>
	When we look at the budget which Reformers proposed, in 
relation to the super RSP, they have something called recognition 
bonds within that framework. The unfortunate thing is that they are 
reinventing the Canada pension plan, the OAS and the GIS. The 
only thing they do not know about the bonds is how they are going 
to pay for them. Everything else works quite well, according to 
them.
<P>
	I ask for a very simple thing from them. When Reform Party 
members speak in the House of Commons they really should take a 
bit more care, a bit more time, to analyse clearly and study the 
issues and not to present to Canadians plans which simply do not 
make sense. Canadians want plans that work. Canadians want plans 
that result in job creation. Canadians want plans that create jobs 
and economic growth. That is what the government has been able 
to do in the past two years. I know that members of the Reform 
Party are really not happy with that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
is getting more interesting as we go. I find it enlightening when we 
are told our plans do not work. I have been here for over two years 
and I have yet to hear of a plan coming from the government.
<P>
	The bill we are speaking about is Bill C-96, which we oppose. I 
must say, Mr. Speaker, that I am sharing my time with my 
colleague from Kootenay East.
<P>
	I would like to comment on the presentations which have been 
made this afternoon. One of our Liberal colleagues called on us to 
work together. Perhaps we could work together, reasonably closely, 
if the goal that the Liberal government has and the goal which the 
Reform Party has were at least close. I am going to demonstrate 
why we have these emotional debates. What we hear is rhetoric. 
We do not see concrete examples. We do not see anything 
substantive coming from the government which fits into Canadian 
society today.
<P>
	I hear that the bill will empower the government-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bevilacqua:</B> People.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> No, it was government. That 
was the word.
<P>
	Since October 1993 the government has had a majority. We are 
now, over two years later, talking about Bill C-96 which will 
empower the government. I have to wonder what has happened in 
the last two years. Has the government been thinking that maybe it 
should be empowered? It already is empowered. Has it been 
thinking about what it will do now that it has been elected by 
surprise? Just exactly what has the government been thinking for 
the last two years?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16453"> 16453 </A></B>
<P>
	This legislation will only go into that place over there, it will 
sit and go through committee, and it will be into year three if not 
year four before the government will say it is empowered. We 
have to wonder what the logic is.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Elect them again.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> I guess that is what they are 
looking for. They can go into the next election and say: ``This is 
what we wanted to do for those first five years and we are really 
going to do it in the second five years''. That is unacceptable.
<P>
	Well done is better than well said. The government should think 
about that. All it is doing is talking. Meanwhile people are waiting. 
Maybe it is just not all talk. Maybe there are some things the 
government has done.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	Since being elected it has overspent in the last two years $80 
billion plus. Congratulations. Add the interest on top and the figure 
is close to putting $100 billion more debt on the backs of our 
children. The Liberal members sit there sanctimoniously talking 
about how well they are doing.
<P>
	People listening to this have to be really disgusted with this kind 
of talk about how they are empowered, how they have done things, 
how they are doing things. What they have done is put us deeper in 
debt.
<P>
	When I talk about the social programs, the question has to be 
asked: How is the government going to address social programs 
when it is blowing the budget every year and adding more debt? 
The fact is that the premiums have to go up and the benefits have to 
come down. If the government keeps spending and spending into 
oblivion it is going to cost big time. Government members sit there 
spouting this rhetoric, like they are going to do something. They 
have done something all right.
<P>
	Let us talk about the member who has just finished speaking. 
``Canada works. Canadians feel that Canada works''. As I recall, 
during the last election campaign, I said that Canada was not 
working very well. The people said: ``Yes, we agree with you. 
Canada is not working very well''. Where does Canada work? 
Where Liberals sit, where their Liberal ridings are, is that where 
Canada works? It does not work in my riding.
<P>
	Let us make a comment on this statement. The Liberals have a 
straightforward goal. They are talking about a vision and a new 
economy. Yes, they are creating a new economy. Congratulations. 
We are back to the $80 billion over two years again. They are 
creating a new economy all right. We are going down hill fast. If 
they had anything serious to do with the economy they would not 
set ridiculous financial targets like having a deficit which is 3 per 
cent of the gross domestic product after three years.
<P>
	What the Liberals are really saying is after three years we will be 
overspending every year by $26 billion. What kind of logic is that 
in a day and age when we have $565 billion of debt? What kind of 
responsibility is that of a majority government to the young kids in 
this country?
<P>
	I have another comment and then I will get on to what I really 
wanted to talk about. I just have to address these things sometimes.
<P>
	The comment was made that 500,000 jobs have been created. 
Where do we get this figure of 500,000 jobs from? Where does this 
number come from? I followed up on one of these comments that 
was made in Atlantic Canada where the government had said it had 
created 40,000 jobs in ACOA. As it happens the challenge was put 
out to prove it.
<P>
	The government backed off and said: ``We say it is 40,000 jobs, 
we know''. Show us how. How did the government figure that out. 
With a survey of a half dozen or so companies extrapolated came 
out to 40,000 people if this and this and this happened. It is 
hogwash. When the government throws out numbers like 500,000 
new jobs it is hogwash. It cannot prove it.
<P>
	In fact the government talked about 100,000 jobs in 
infrastructure. It only cost us $6 billion, and if there are 100,000 
jobs, most of them are temporary. Who is going to pick up the bill 
for $6 billion? Congratulations. To get their names on the stats for 
the unemployed they have spent $6 billion of the taxpayers' money. 
I would not pat myself on the back if I were a Liberal. I would be 
ashamed.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	Now I am going to say what I really wanted to say. This bill 
transfers powers from the former ministry of employment and 
immigration. I guess it is necessary to transfer the powers. The 
Liberals took over from the Conservatives. There is going to be a 
name change, move people around and that sort of thing. However, 
let us look at the job they have done.
<P>
	After 30 years of big government, both Liberal and 
Conservative, we have ended up with less security instead of more 
because they mortgaged our future. There is less security today 
than there was before in the social programs. Now the Liberals 
come into the House and say they have a real novel idea. They are 
going to fix it. That is novel, after 30 years of being at the trough.
<P>
	Pensions by and large are unfunded today.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Not theirs.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Well, except the MPs 
pension. They are all on that. If they will protect and pension it is 
that one. Fully 1 per cent of our population is waiting for 
significant surgery. Tuition is rising and literacy is falling. These 
are not negative comments; this is reality. I caution Liberal 
members to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16454"> 16454 </A></B>
<P>
stop coming into  this House and putting platitudes to the Speaker 
expecting people to buy them. They do not.
<P>
	Is my time running out? I knew this would happen. I cannot even 
give a good lesson to these people without running out of time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> They would not learn anyway.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Have I got a minute? Rats. I 
am out of time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
Reform colleagues and I were elected on a platform of real change. 
It was change that would revolutionize the power and prosperity of 
Confederation, change that would put an end to the burden of 
constitutional wrangling which has plagued this land for 
generations, change that would release Canadians from the 
oppressive weight of deficit spending. These sentiments were 
echoed all across the country, particularly as we led up to the 
referendum on October 30. Canadians are not happy with the way 
their government operates and they want it fixed no matter where 
they are in Canada.
<P>
	Today we are addressing Bill C-96, an act to establish the 
Department of Human Resources Development. One would hope 
that a responsible government would listen to the wants of the 
electorate and do everything in its power to accommodate them. 
However, this bill perpetuates the centralized grip that Ottawa 
maintains on programs which would be administered much more 
effectively at the local level.
<P>
	Each province and region in Canada is distinctly different from 
the other. Demographically speaking, there are more differences 
between the provinces than there are similarities. Each province 
has identifiable characteristics which are unique to its own 
situation. These differences supersede language, culture and 
self-determination demanding economic prosperity through natural 
resources, employment, education, training, social services and 
housing. The Ottawa bureaucracy has historically implemented a 
unilateral blanket of policies which falls short of fulfilling the 
individual needs of the provinces.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, if you were going to purchase a helmet, would you 
purchase a generic helmet or would you purchase a helmet that was 
customized to your size and function? You would not purchase a 
cycling helmet to play hockey. Why? Because it is not suitable. 
While a cycling helmet is quite effective for cycling, it is not 
effective in protecting your health and livelihood even if you are a 
referee in a hockey game.
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	The same can be said for human resources development 
programs. It is imperative that social programs meet the 
specialized needs of a given province or municipality. Who better 
to determine that criterion  than the province itself or the people in 
the communities?
<P>
	This bill pays lip service to decentralization. For example, clause 
20 of the bill gives the minister the power to enter into negotiations 
with groups, including provinces and municipalities, for the 
administration of services under the Department of Human 
Resources Development. Although in theory this practice can be 
seen as a movement toward privatization, in reality it continues to 
exist unchanged as a centralized body subject to the exclusive 
decision making practices of the minister. It is lip service.
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary for HRD earlier in debate said that 
the federal government works as a partner. The minister is the 
decision maker for that partner. It is that partner which has 
removed $7 billion from this social envelope to which I say, with 
friends like this, who needs enemies?
<P>
	Since the time of Confederation the federal government scribed, 
debated and implemented laws which were perceived to be in the 
best interests of the nation. Over the past 128 years Canada has 
emerged as a nation comprised of diverse communities to which 
the archaic macro political practices of the past no longer apply.
<P>
	Canada needs legislation which is flexible enough to 
accommodate Canadians from Corner Brook to Cranbrook and 
everywhere in between. It is time to end the centralized purse string 
control which Ottawa has over the Canadian taxpayer and over the 
functions that are covered by this act.
<P>
	Tax dollars are squandered in order to sustain the massive 
national central bureaucracy which is not in touch with the needs 
and wants of Canadians in Corner Brook and Cranbrook. The 
constituents in my riding, like all other ridings across this great 
land, pay taxes for essential services. Let us look at this sum as 
though it were just one dollar.
<P>
	That dollar is sent to Ottawa where the cost of the massive 
bureaucracy does little more than deplete the amount of that tax 
dollar. By the time it is sent to the province through transfer 
payments, that dollar probably is worth about 80 cents. A similar 
vacuous process takes place at the provincial level where 
duplication of bureaucratic intervention does little else than spend 
tax dollars without cause or consequence, the resulting factor being 
that the original tax dollar collected from Joe Public is returned to 
the community as only 60 cents. This is one of the many reasons 
our country is in such a sorry financial state.
<P>
	There are considerable benefits to downloading the collection 
and implementation of essential service taxes from the federal 
level to the local level. Look at the simplification of collecting, 
administering and dispensing benefits and essential services at the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16455"> 16455 </A></B>
<P>
level at which the  services are received rather than meddling at the 
federal level.
<P>
	The most obvious advantage is the omission of expensive and 
extraneous bureaucratic intervention. The administration of taxes 
at a local level would ensure the transparency and accountability 
that Canadians have come to demand from their public institutions. 
Closed door deals and political patronage are not welcome.
<P>
	This bill proposes there is room for the commercialization or 
privatization of these services by allowing the minister or his 
appointed representatives to enter into negotiations with the 
provinces and other parties. But surprise, surprise, the final 
decision will be at the discretion of the minister, not the public. 
This is a problem because the minister receives advice from the 
federal bureaucracy interested in its own self-preservation.
<P>
	Reform is calling for the decentralization of federal powers in 
these areas. Decentralization means that the provinces, regions and 
municipalities decide based on their own needs when, why and 
especially how the funds are to be administered. Downloading 
gives Canadians a higher return on their tax investment while 
empowering them to be able to decide how their tax dollars are 
going to be spent.
<P>
	This concept is obviously scary to the establishment. Traditional 
federal institutions will be quite opposed to relinquishing any 
power. So too is the federal Liberal government whose mandate is 
based on the inflexible centralized power which has existed since 
Confederation.
<P>
<B>(1655 )</B>
<P>
	Bill C-96 does nothing to remedy the problems which are 
evident to everyone except this Liberal government. Canadians are 
calling for real change, not minuscule housekeeping activities.
<P>
	Bill C-96 as I have stated, continues centralization in spite of the 
cosmetics. There is a lot of lip service in the bill to the idea of 
decentralization and changing where the decisions are going to be 
made.
<P>
	Reform by contrast offers protection to pensioners for OAS and 
for CPP which is completely unfunded and which will run out of 
funds within a very specified period of time. Reform looks to 
decentralization and the efficiencies that would occur from that 
decentralization putting power back in the hands of Canadians 
where it should be. This government continues to tell the lie that 
the government will do it. Its spending habits are such that the 
government can no longer be counted on to do it.
<P>
	The country at this point is in a unique position to make changes. 
Canadians are demanding change, but more important, Canadians 
are demanding change now. Vacuous housekeeping bills like this 
one do absolutely nothing to give the change Canadians are asking 
for.
<P>
	Canadians want a decentralized power structure which 
empowers citizens, not politicians. Canadians do not want Bill 
C-96 and neither does the Reform Party. We saw Canadians come 
together in strength in Montreal. We saw an outpouring of healthy 
Canadian nationalism. What they did not want was status quo 
legislation like Bill C-96.
<P>
	Canadians are looking for leadership. I say to the Liberals: You 
can lead or you can follow, but if you are not going to lead, get out 
of the way.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened attentively to the member's speech.
<P>
	With respect, I must say his message is somewhat convoluted. 
On one hand he says that this is a housekeeping bill. He referred to 
it as status quo legislation and then talked about the Liberals trying 
to centralize power with the bill. Now, if the bill does not do 
anything, as the member suggested, how could it further centralize 
power? There is something there that whoever wrote that speech 
should try to straighten out. There is an obvious contradiction.
<P>
	Let us assume for one minute that the member was confused 
about the bill being housekeeping and status quo legislation and it 
is about centralizing power which he talked about initially. The 
member is going to have to answer another question. If the Liberals 
want to centralize power, as they have traditionally wanted to do 
according to the member-which of course is factually incorrect as 
we all know, those of us who are objective like you, Mr. Speaker, 
being the independent person you are in the House you will 
understand this-then surely we have not done a very good job of 
centralizing.
<P>
	We live in what is either the most decentralized federation or 
second most, depending on those who consider Switzerland to be 
more decentralized than Canada or Canada more decentralized than 
Switzerland. If we have centralized all that much and it is still the 
least centralized country in the world, it seems to me we have not 
done a very good job of centralizing.
<P>
	Would the member explain these contradictions in his speech 
because with respect, I believe they do not make a heck of a lot of 
sense. We cannot have centralized all these things and still end up 
with a country that is very decentralized.
<P>
	The member also talked about the finances of the nation which 
he says we have not sufficiently addressed. Perhaps the member is 
reading from material that was prepared some time ago. Surely, he 
would know that no less than the people at <I>Fortune</I> magazine, 
which is a rather prestigious publication, recently said that Canada 
was now a good place to invest because it had finally addressed the 
issue of the deficit and was progressing to clean its fiscal house and 
put things in order. That is another contradiction. Maybe the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16456"> 16456 </A></B>
<P>
member can explain to  us why he believes all these things that are 
different from reality.
<P>
<B>(1700)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to answer 
those questions. As the member will probably recall, today we will 
be going to the world money markets to borrow $100 million. What 
is it for? Is it for human resource development or medicare? No, we 
are going to the world markets today to borrow $100 million to pay 
the interest on the money we have already borrowed. If that is not 
bogus I do not know what in the world is.
<P>
	The reality is that while the member may be correct, and I am 
prepared to accept what he has said about <I>Fortune</I> magazine's 
saying this is a good place to invest, and truly in Canada with the 
resources and the people we have it is a good place to invest, but I 
remind him the bond rating agencies have downgraded the 
Canadian/U.S. denominated debt and we have been put on watch 
on our Canada bonds.
<P>
	If we are in such good shape, I wonder if they too are concerned, 
as we are, about the fact that today we will borrow $100 million to 
pay interest on money we have already borrowed.
<P>
	Dealing with the issues the member raised I find, as my leader 
has from time to time, that perhaps if we speak a little slower and 
perhaps get to smaller words sometimes we can manage to get our 
message to the people on the other side.
<P>
	I was talking about the fact that this bill is a continuation of the 
process of the centralization we have had in Ottawa since 1968, 
since the time of Trudeau, when the giant sucking noise Canadians 
heard was all of the money, all of the power, all of the decision 
making being drawn into Ottawa. This bill does absolutely nothing 
to change that situation. It is the continuation of the centralized 
decision making process.
<P>
	I say to the member who, after all, has a responsibility to the 
affairs of the House, the House has continued since we reconvened 
in the middle of September to do nothing but housekeeping things. 
Rather than coming forward with this kind of a bill, why are we not 
getting the reports that have been promised from HRD on UI, on 
pension? Why are we not getting those things? I suggest it is 
because the government is devoid of any ability to bring us those 
things.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin Cauchon (Outremont, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
very proud today to have this opportunity to speak in the House of 
Commons, this impressive forum of democracy, to support the 
Minister of Human Resources Development and his parliamentary 
secretary here on my left, on Bill C-96.
<P>
	The purpose of this bill is basically to establish and give a clear 
mandate to a department that, as we know, is fundamentally 
important to Canadian society and plays an equally important role 
in the daily lives of our citizens, not only in Quebec but in Canada 
as well.
<P>
	In fact, Bill C-96 ensures that the minister and his team can 
continue to help people in need, both in Quebec and the rest of 
Canada, and in all the regions, whether we are talking about the 
Gaspé or Abitibi-Témiscamingue. In fact, it is a tool that allows the 
federal government to intervene in an intelligent way to provide 
assistance where needed.
<P>
<B>(1705)</B>
<P>
	It makes me really sad to see that, even when we are discussing 
an issue as important as the reform of the human resources 
department, the official opposition cannot refrain from playing 
pure party politics.
<P>
	During the referendum campaign just concluded, we heard all 
sorts of statements which completely distorted the facts and which, 
in my opinion, were nothing but an insult to people's intelligence.
<P>
	Earlier, the member for Lévis concluded his speech by saying 
something which the official opposition keeps repeating all the 
time. Alluding to comments presumably made in this House, he 
said something about facing the music. It is unfortunate for 
Canadians that the official opposition cannot set aside its partisan 
attitude and stop trying to distort the facts and the statements made 
in this democratic place.
<P>
	I am not surprised to hear members of the official opposition say 
that the ultimate purpose of Bill C-96 is to make sure that the 
federal government continues to interfere in fields of provincial 
jurisdiction. I am not surprised because this is yet another tactic to 
avoid debating the real issue, as well as an attempt to fool the 
public.
<P>
	This is unfortunate, because today, what we are saying on the 
Liberal side is that the referendum was democratically held, that 
people voted no, but also voted for change.
<P>
	In today's context, changes must involve the federal government 
and all the provinces working hand in hand. Essentially, we are 
talking about multilateral relations. It is in working together that 
we will be able to respond to the desire for change expressed by the 
people in Quebec, a desire which is felt not only in Quebec, but 
across Canada.
<P>
	Unfortunately, with the government we have now in Quebec, and 
with the official opposition we have in Ottawa, it is very difficult to 
see how we can work towards a common goal, an ultimate goal, 
which, in the end, is in the best interests of the people, because they 
do not want the Canadian federation to work.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16457"> 16457 </A></B>
<P>
	Indeed, it is not by withdrawing from multilateral discussions, 
as the Parti Quebecois government did in Quebec, that advances 
will be made in improving Canadian federalism. It is not by 
withdrawing from multilateral discussions on the environment that 
it will be able to better defend Quebecers' interests so that Quebec 
can continue to be part of the federation, and continue to be an 
extremely strong province in a prosperous and united Canada.
<P>
	It is not by refusing to sit down at a conference table with the 
other provincial premiers that the system will be changed. In the 
end, it is the people in Quebec who are suffering from this refusal 
to co-operate.
<P>
	There is nothing complicated in this bill. It is aimed at giving 
tools to the federal government, at reorganizing a department, and 
yet, the official opposition is acting prematurely. The opposition is 
talking about interference. It is a bit early to start talking about 
interference. Before talking about interference, one must wait to 
see the kind of reforms the minister and his team will be able to 
bring about.
<P>
<B>(1710)</B>
<P>
	Judging on past experiences, if the past is any indication of the 
future, I think the minister has every reason to be proud of the 
changes he is proposing, and I think people in Quebec and Canada 
have a right to expect promising and positive changes which meet 
the expectations not only of Quebecers but of all Canadians.
<P>
	When I speak about changes the minister should be proud of, 
members will recall that, at the beginning of the year, before the 
finance minister's budget was tabled, the official opposition said 
loud and clear that they wanted the Canada Assistance Plan to be 
eliminated and transformed into a much more flexible plan, giving 
more leeway to provinces.
<P>
	Responding to that reality, that legitimate request, the human 
resources development minister, in co-operation with the finance 
minister, replaced the Canada Assistance Plan with the Canada 
social transfer.
<P>
	What is the Canada social transfer? It is a tool which will allow 
the federal government to transfer funds to the provinces so that 
they can operate in the social field and do so with much more 
flexibility.
<P>
	Let me read a few lines. It says that the social transfer is mainly 
designed to help the provinces provide the level of benefits and 
social assistance that they wanted to provide but could not because 
of inflexible rules. That is done.
<P>
	Someone mentioned earlier that the past is an indication of what 
the future holds. It is clear that the Canada social transfer is far 
from being the monster that the official opposition has made it out 
to be. It is essentially a structure in which all the provinces have 
more leeway.
<P>
	What is the Canada social transfer about? It makes it possible for 
instance to fund parental wage assistance programs such as the one 
known as APPORT in Quebec. This is an exclusively provincial 
program. So, with the Canada social transfer, the funding of 
programs like APPORT, a program developed by the Government 
of Quebec and appreciated by everyone, is made possible, while, 
under the old system, the Canada Assistance Plan, it could not be 
funded.
<P>
	The Canada social transfer, or CST for short, also provides for 
the provincial sales tax to be refunded to welfare recipients, a 
measure which could not have been implemented under the Canada 
Assistance Plan. I read further that it also includes a program to 
provide food to disadvantaged children, which would not have been 
possible either under the old system because it was too inflexible.
<P>
	The Canada social transfer also includes the provision of 
transportation services to people with disabilities, services that can 
be provided without having to assessment needs, contrary to the 
prescribed procedure for qualifying for funding under the old 
system.
<P>
	The steps taken by the minister and his department are clearly a 
reflection of the federal administration's good faith and 
commitment to keep up with the trends towards change, as 
requested by the public.
<P>
	As for trends toward change, as for the Canada Assistance Plan, 
we keep hearing: ``Yes, but that mean beast, the federal machinery, 
is the only one setting national standards''. I have said it in this 
House and I repeat that we are a country. I think that, whether we 
are from Quebec, Ontario, British Columbia or Newfoundland, we 
agree that we, together, as a big family, must have standards that 
allow for a similar quality of life throughout the country.
<P>
<B>(1715)</B>
<P>
	But as far as the system is concerned, we kept hearing that 
national standards were set unilaterally by the federal machinery. 
Again, in trying to respond to the needs for change, to the demands 
of the provinces, the Minister of Human Resources Development 
has ensured that national standards will now be set in co-operation 
with the provinces, through the Canada social transfer. So, we are 
not imposing any more; quite the contrary, we are responding to 
current federalism, evolutionary federalism. We are responding 
once again to the winds of change and, once again, in a spirit of 
good faith that demonstrates a will to work in partnership and in 
co-operation with the provinces.
<P>
	When talking about a will to change on the part of the federal 
government and a will to respect the wishes of the people, we can 
consider the strategic initiatives put forward by the minister to 
implement a number of programs based on the priorities and needs 
of the provinces.

<P>
	Can we still talk about interference by the federal machinery? 
I think that the action taken by the minister clearly demonstrates 
that we are following this trend of open federalism, of modern 
federalism that increasingly respects the objectives and wishes of 
the provinces as a whole. Furthermore, with respect to reform, we 
must bear in mind that the people as a whole asked that reform 
take place not only to decentralize but also to ensure that programs 
established in the 1960s can be brought into line with the new 
needs of Canadians in terms of social and labour market programs. 
That is why the minister and his officials are busy implementing 
programs that meet the expectations of the members of the 
Canadian society of the 1990s by making sure that the department 
can make the leap into the next millennium.
<P>
	In fact, our goal is to better serve the public and provide it with 
tools. At this stage, on the basis of Bill C-96, whose purpose is to 
set out the department's mandate, I think that in the general, public 
interest, we must try to see our basic role, our ultimate goal and 
purpose, at the provincial and federal level, as working together, 
hand in hand, towards change in the federal system.
<P>
	The department this bill deals with is an important department 
because of both the role it plays in the field and of what it can 
achieve with the funds at its disposal.
<P>
	To show how important this department is, this is the department 
responsible for unemployment insurance. Changes will soon be 
made to the UI program. Again, the minister's clear commitment to 
respecting all the provinces and meeting the needs of the public 
will show.
<P>
	This is an important department, whose role in Quebec and 
Canada cannot be underestimated, a department which people rely 
on and which has an impact on everyday life, a department which, 
last year, spent $13.3 billion in the province of Quebec alone.
<P>
	How does this affect us? This amount of $13.3 billion was used 
to help more than 164,000 Quebecers find jobs and 44,789 students 
find summers jobs, to pump $1.5 billion into the Quebec 
post-secondary education system, to ensure that more than 80,000 
Quebecers receive adequate training, while $3 billion went to 
subsidizing Quebec social assistance programs, which benefited 
approximately 700,000 people.
<P>
<B>(1720)</B>
<P>
	We are talking about a department that, on the average, allowed 
UI benefits to be paid to some 528 unemployed people every 
month. That is not all. I have a long list in front of me, but 
unfortunately it would take too long to enumerate all the concrete 
actions that were taken.
<P>
	The department also helped develop youth employment. So, we 
are talking about a department that is having a real effect, that is 
undergoing changes. Given  that reality, instead of always playing 
politics, the official opposition should rise above partisanship and, 
just this once, think about the people's interest, try to serve them 
better and, finally, work in partnership.
<P>
	We know what can be achieved through partnership and, again in 
this case, the past gives us an indication of what the future holds. 
Take for example the Canada social transfer set up because people 
asked for it. There are also the agreements to improve job 
opportunities for welfare recipients, which allow us to join forces 
in order to help them find jobs. There is also the block funding 
agreement which was concluded with Quebec under the Canada 
Student Loans Program.
<P>
	There are many examples showing that if we are ready to 
co-operate, as Quebecers want, and work hand in hand toward the 
common goal of helping all the people, so that Quebec can still 
have its place, we will grow together and allow federalism to grow 
in the best interests of the people and the provinces.
<P>
	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
carefully to the member for Outremont and I am torn between 
disbelief and admiration. I say disbelief because, in spite of what 
the situation in Canada's manpower and employment sector, the 
member for Outremont keeps referring to a slew of federal and 
Liberal policies which, in the last two years, have obviously not 
given any results.
<P>
	He told us about the role of the federal government regarding 
employment development in Quebec and in Canada. He said that 
this is important, that great things are happening. However, when 
we look at the statistics on unemployment, we see a situation quite 
different from the picture painted by the hon. member.
<P>
	I say disbelief because I cannot understand how a member, who 
claims to be well aware of the situation of workers and of the plight 
of the unemployed and the welfare recipients in Quebec and in 
Canada, can seriously discuss federal policies and try to convince 
us that everything is fine, that there are no problems, that we 
simply must let the Minister of Human Resources Development go 
on with his good work. This is why I used the word disbelief.
<P>
	My disbelief is also mixed with admiration. The hon. member 
talked about great principles. He told us about how we must work 
together, grow together, co-operate, be partners, and do our share to 
promote Canada's development.
<P>
<B>(1725)</B>
<P>
	In a way, I admire the hon. member, who may well become a 
minister some day. Indeed, his speech was an almost flawless 
performance in that it reflected the Liberal philosophy heard for at 
least 20 or 25 years, a philosophy which expresses something that 
no one recognizes in Canada. We are presented with a picture of  
<P>

<B><A NAME="16459"> 16459 </A></B>
<P>
Canada that no one recognizes. And no one recognizes it because it 
obviously has nothing to do with reality.
<P>
	Regarding the bill's provision on manpower training, we note 
that, for the last four or five years, since 1991 or so, everyone in 
Quebec has been asking that manpower adjustment and manpower 
training become the responsibility of the province. I say everyone, 
but I should be a little more specific and provide some names, since 
the hon. member may not have followed the developments in the 
newspapers and may not have heard the views expressed.
<P>
	First, there was Mr. Bourbeau, then Quebec's Liberal minister of 
Labour; he was followed by Mr. Johnson and Mr. Ryan. Now, it is 
the PQ government. All of them asked that Quebec be given full 
responsibility for manpower. Mr. Dufour, president of Quebec's 
Conseil du patronat, made the same request. And so did, just this 
week, Mr. Gérald Ponton, president of Quebec's Association des 
manufacturiers.
<P>
	I ask the hon. member: How does he explain the fact that 
everyone in Quebec, except for the provincial caucus of the Liberal 
Party of Canada, is asking that manpower training be made 
Quebec's responsibility? Why is it that he and the minister do not 
see that this is what Quebecers are asking for? Why is it that his 
government will not comply with that request in the bill before us 
today?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Before giving the floor to 
the hon. member, I must say that I failed earlier to carry out a duty 
with regard to the adjournment proceedings.
<P>
	It is my duty, pursuant to Standing Order 38, to inform the House 
that the question to be raised tonight at the time of adjournment is 
as follows: the hon. member for 
Notre-Dame-de-Grâce-International Criminal Court.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cauchon:</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened to my colleague's 
remarks. First, as regards admiration, I would ask my colleague not 
to waste any energy in admiring me but rather to use his energy in 
helping the federal system change, in working to represent 
objectively and constructively the interests of the whole population 
of Quebec so that we can continue to make Canadian federalism 
change.
<P>
	I talked earlier about remarks that are an insult to people's 
intelligence. We have to listen. There are people watching us today. 
Some members said the bill deals with manpower. The bill before 
the House, Bill C-96, deals-and I point this out to people 
watching us-essentially with structuring the department, 
providing the minister and his department with a mandate and the 
tools needed to be able to work. It is a bill of a general nature that 
has nothing to do with manpower per se.
<P>
	As concerns manpower, and again I said it in my main speech, 
we ought to wait. We are now dealing with a bill  of a general 
nature. I said in my main speech that the minister and his officials 
did an outstanding job in order to serve and to respond to demands 
for change made by the population. There are more things to come. 
What I ask the official opposition to do is to work in co-operation 
with us, to accept the referendum results and to help bring about 
changes.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> It being 5.30 p.m., the House 
will now proceed to the consideration of Private Members' 
Business as listed on today's Order Paper.

	The House resumed from October 4, 1995, consideration of the 
motion that, in the opinion of this House, the government should 
consider implementing a new program of mining incentives which 
would encourage exploration and development in Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia-Matane, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would find Motion M-292 put forward by my colleague from 
Timiskaming-French River quite acceptable if it would take into 
account the history of this country and particularly of the province 
of Quebec.
<P>
	I am in favour of implementing a new financial incentives 
program to encourage mining exploration and development in 
Canada and in Quebec, but not at any price or under any condition.
<P>
	I do believe that natural resources play a crucial part in the 
economy of any country. A country without natural resources is a 
country that depends on international markets. It is very hard for a 
country with no natural resources to properly develop a processing 
industry. This industry would always rely on major markets and 
bear the brunt of a supply and demand system.
<P>
	It would also be subject to the whims of the money markets 
which always seek to get the most out of our natural resources. We 
had a striking example of that situation in 1929, during the Great 
Depression.
<P>
	When the automotive industry was in full expansion, the rubber 
producing countries, especially in Southeast Asia, could not get a 
reasonable price for their products although demand was very 
strong.
<P>
	World financial markets were pulling the strings and, 
unfortunately, were getting richer at the expense of the producers. 
Government had to intervene so that this industry would not go 
bankrupt.
<P>
	We still have the same market system and the government must 
act at the natural resources level. To yield all possible benefits, the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16460"> 16460 </A></B>
<P>
development of natural  resources must be planned coherently and 
consistently, and I would not say this is the case in Canada.
<P>
	The competition between the federal government and Quebec 
and the other provinces is counterproductive and above all very 
costly. It generates very expensive duplication and this waste of 
energy and money only benefits our competitors on the world 
markets.
<P>
	While we, in Canada, are fighting each other and while the 
federal government is trying to oust the provinces from a 
jurisdiction which is rightly theirs, our competitors get the 
opportunity to capture our own markets. A country which fails to 
invest in the development of its natural resources shows a lack of 
foresight which makes it very vulnerable.
<P>
	Motion M-292 by my colleague tends to maintain a minimum 
investment in the Canadian mining industry and this is very good.
<P>
	Moreover, a country whose national government violates the 
jurisdictions of other levels of government cannot expect an 
exceptional performance from its industry. In Canada, we have had 
huge difficulties in this area for some years.
<P>
	If you are a producer and if, every time you want to go ahead, 
you are faced with two levels of government that disagree and with 
two sets of standards, you will waste valuable time and energy that 
would be better spent elsewhere.
<P>
	As everyone knows, a country's natural resources belong to the 
community. If they are available for the well-being of the 
population, they are at the heart of our own development. In 
addition to creating jobs, they play an active part in our economic 
growth and collective wealth.
<P>
	As you will recall, Mr. Speaker, sections 109 and 117 of the 1867 
Constitution Act gave the provinces ownership of the lands, mines, 
minerals, and attendant royalties; several provinces, including 
Quebec, used these provisions to promote local industrial 
development and economic diversification.
<P>
<B>(1735)</B>
<P>
	I was elected in a rural riding and a relatively poor region. Our 
natural resources are the key to the survival and development of 
small communities in our regions. The involvement of the 
government in this crucial economic sector is essential, and this is 
why I congratulate my colleague for presenting this amendment.
<P>
	But I firmly believe that the federal government should stick to 
the Constitution and let the provinces and Quebec take care of this 
sector. The federal government should give back to the provinces 
the sums it has collected and continues to collect for natural 
resources, and tell them: ``Administer them the best you can''.
<P>
	The federal government profited from the revenues yielded by 
the development of natural resources, and it would only be right, as 
is requested in Motion M-292 proposed by my colleague, that that 
money be used for further developing these resources. The 
interference of the federal government in natural resources is 
serious. For example, the federal government has heavily taxed 
petroleum, which is outright interference in interprovincial and 
international trade.
<P>
	It unilaterally fixed the sale price of oil and gas, wading into the 
market beyond provincial boundaries, thus forcing certain 
producing provinces to reduce their royalties and, in certain cases, 
even causing them to lose certain foreign markets.
<P>
	Moreover, one must not forget that the federal government has 
jurisdiction over interprovincial pipelines, interprovincial hydro 
lines and other methods of transportation between two or more 
provinces. Finally, in case of conflict leading to political stiffness 
like we experienced under the Trudeau government, the federal 
government could in a twisted manner use the declaratory power 
included in section 91(10)<I>c</I>) of the Constitution Act of 1867 to 
unilaterally declare, as we have often seen the Liberals do, that 
projects like power dams, mines and oil wells fall under exclusive 
federal jurisdiction. Furthermore, it could use the incidental power 
to regulate working conditions and product quality in those 
projects, thus encroaching once more on provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	The present government already did that through its 
environmental legislation which declared its authority on such 
projects. Many people, particularly now, ask themselves why 
Canadian federalism does not work. Yet, the answer is obvious. 
There is in Canada a level of government that does not respect the 
jurisdiction of other levels of government. There is a government 
which wants to grab all power for itself.
<P>
	There is a government which does not have for objective the 
well-being of Canadians, but the appropriation of all power. I 
conclude by saying that the Bloc Quebecois will support the 
motion, but not without certain reservations.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Speller (Haldimand-Norfolk, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to have an opportunity to speak today in support of 
Motion No. 292, especially after the fairy tales I have been hearing 
from the member of the Bloc.
<P>
	During my seven years as a member I have had an opportunity to 
meet various sectors of the mining industry, people involved in the 
mining industry on a daily basis. The main message they have been 
giving governments over these years is that governments must 
make a solid commitment not only to keeping the mining industry 
in Canada but also to making it prosper.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16461"> 16461 </A></B>
<P>
	The motion before us today proposes the government consider 
implementing a new program of mining incentives which would 
encourage exploration and development in Canada. Although most 
people equate these incentives with taxes and grants, this is not 
necessarily the case.
<P>
<B>(1740)</B>
<P>
	I commend the hon. member for Timiskaming-French River 
for putting this motion forward. He has been very supportive of the 
mining industry. As he previously stated in the House, all the 
mining industry wants is a level playing field and a tax system 
competitive with the rest of the world and competitive 
internationally. In order to do this it is essential to streamline 
government procedures and to provide the mining industry with a 
single window approach to approvals.
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary will be speaking after I finish. I am 
sure he will bring us up to date on how the minister is moving in 
these areas.
<P>
	Why is this motion so important to Canadians? It is important 
because we are being asked to consider new initiatives, initiatives 
which previous governments did not feel were necessary.
<P>
	When driving through Hagersville or Caledonia in my riding the 
first things we see as we approach these communities are the shafts 
of the gypsum mines. They support the gypsum plants which 
produce gypsum board which is shipped throughout North 
America. These communities rely on the mines, as do small 
communities in remote and rural areas all across the country. For 
visitors these mines show the importance of mining to the 
economic and social well-being of the country.
<P>
	There has been a progressive decline in investment, employment 
and mining exploration in Canada over the last ten years. Between 
1990 and 1993, 20,000 jobs were lost in the Canadian mining 
industry. Taking into consideration that mining provides 400,000 
direct and indirect jobs in Canada, that number is quite substantial.
<P>
	There are approximately 150 communities across Canada which 
depend on mining for their livelihood. When we factor in the 
number of businesses and the family members who buy goods from 
the stores and businesses, we are talking close to one million 
Canadians depending on this industry, a big industry in Canada.
<P>
	We are also talking about an industry which pays some of the 
highest industrial wages in Canada: $847 per week. Most of these 
wages are earned in rural and isolated communities across the 
country. They provide the infrastructure in many places which 
keeps rural Canada together.
<P>
	Between 1986 and 1991 Canada failed to attract a single new 
mining project with capital of more than $250 million. By 
comparison, Latin America acquired five  such contracts. 
Likewise, from 1991 to 1992 more than 150 companies worldwide 
reduced expenditures in Canadian mining projects by 30 per cent, 
from $430 million to $302 million.
<P>
	We need to look at why these investors are no longer selecting 
Canada and we must move to provide solutions to the problem. 
Why are they going to South America? Why are they going to 
Southeast Asia? The common feeling is it must be because of the 
environmental differences. I do not think that is the case. That may 
be a small component of it but more and more it is a direct result of 
government red tape.
<P>
	We have three and in some areas four different levels of 
government. These companies have to go through an enormous 
amount of red tape to get anything done. It should be a primary role 
of anybody looking at solutions to the problem to deal with the 
whole question of red tape.
<P>
	In 1994 the total contribution to the Canadian economy from 
mining equalled $19.1 billion. We must also remember this is a 
cyclical industry; it has ups and downs. In 1992 and 1993 alone 44 
Canadian mines closed while 22 opened. We can see the trend is 
not in the right direction.
<P>
<B>(1745 )</B>
<P>
	The requests that have been put forward by Keep Mining in 
Canada are not only logical but they are very plausible and 
workable. The Keep Mining in Canada campaign, supported by the 
industry, has laid out 10 reasonable points that it feels, if achieved, 
would help its industry.
<P>
	The Standing Committee on Natural Resources when chaired by 
the member for Kenora-Rainy River conducted extensive 
hearings with all the stakeholders which resulted in the setting out 
of nine key recommendations committee members felt that if 
followed through on would help the industry.
<P>
	They talked about streamlining the federal-provincial 
environmental regulations, which only makes sense and I know the 
Minister of the Environment is working in that area now; 
implementing an appropriate incentive to stimulate grassroots 
mineral exploration, and I know some hon. members do that 
sometimes as well; changing the tax laws on mine reclamation 
funding; establishing processes for land use planning that respect 
mineral tenure and ensure both the protection of Canada's heritage 
and access to the mineral resource development. We have to be 
able to balance those two. I know the parliamentary secretary will 
be happy to tell us following my speech how the minister is 
working in that area.
<P>
	Overlapping jurisdictions also have a negative impact on 
investors. Much time and money is spent by companies filling out 
separate forms for either municipal, provincial or federal levels of 
government. They always seem to have different guidelines. These 
companies have  to jump through a number of hoops. Surely our 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16462"> 16462 </A></B>
<P>
governments can work together and come up with a single window 
and a single set of regulations which these companies can follow.
<P>
	Canada also must implement an appropriate incentive to 
stimulate grassroots mineral exploration. By improving the tax 
laws and reclamation funding we would be promoting good 
environmental management. I know the member for Davenport 
wants to talk about that a little later.
<P>
	The taxation of money put into trust by a company to meet future 
demands for mine reclamation should definitely be one of the items 
the government should look at. I am sure the member for 
Davenport will have something to say about that.
<P>
	The last item I want to consider today in my last few minutes is 
the topic of establishing a process for land use planning that respect 
mineral tenure to ensure both the protection of Canada's natural 
heritage and access to mineral resource development. Mining is 
part of our heritage and we must ensure that it is accessible and that 
its terms can be met.
<P>
	A commitment to supporting the mining industry does not 
translate into excess money being spent. Many incentives can be 
implemented that are not costly but which would encourage 
exploration and development. I talked about a few of these 
incentives in my speech. I urge anyone who seriously considers 
what is being voted on today to take a look at this. This is a votable 
item. It is a serious item. It is serious in the sense that it helps our 
program to develop and create jobs in this country.
<P>
	We are voting today on the very survival of the mining industry 
and the demise of the communities that mining supports. Mining 
has always been a very important part of our heritage and I hope we 
will keep it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
motion we are debating today says that the government should 
consider implementing a new program of mining incentives which 
would encourage exploration and development in Canada.
<P>
	Mining is one of the most important industries in Canada. It 
deserves the government's attention. It pays the highest average 
wage of any industry in the country which is over $200 a week 
higher than its next highest wage category of transportation and 
communication. Mining products total 15 per cent of our exports. It 
is a very important industry.
<P>
	Investment in the exploration of new mines is less than half of 
what it once was in the early 1990s. In real dollars investment in 
the early 1990s was around $800 million annually. This year it is 
expected to be $300 million or maybe less. Exploration and 
development have fallen drastically because Canada has failed to 
provide a favourable investment climate.
<P>
<B>(1750 )</B>
<P>
	Canada used to be a world leader in mining activity, but that 
leadership is in jeopardy. Other nations now offer a more 
favourable environment for mining companies. Canada has fallen 
from first to fourth place in attracting new investment. We have not 
opened a major new mine in the last five years. We need to address 
the problem quickly, not by the year 2000, not within the term of 
the government's mandate. We need to start now to turn the 
situation around.
<P>
	The motion before us speaks about incentives for the mining 
industry to stimulate exploration and development. What kind of 
incentives are being talked about? Is it some huge program of cash 
rebates? Are costly tax breaks needed so that the industry can 
flourish once again?
<P>
	I intend to support this motion but I want to make sure to let 
members know what we mean by incentives. For the Liberal or the 
socialist, an incentive is some kind of government assistance. It is a 
handout. It is a grant, a transfer or a tax shelter that is big enough to 
overcome the disincentives that are found in the industry. If there is 
over-regulation, for example, the government handout will be 
enough to induce companies to overlook inefficiencies in the 
system.
<P>
	These types of government programs are like giving an oxygen 
mask to someone who is choking instead of just loosening the rope 
that is hanging around the neck.
<P>
	For the free enterpriser, the entrepreneur who is a self-starter, an 
incentive is not a grant from the government where it picks some 
winners and losers in the industry. An incentive is merely an 
opportunity.
<P>
	If I know miners at all, they are free enterprisers. They are risk 
takers. They are self-starters. They do not want special help. They 
want a level playing field and an opportunity to show their skills, 
develop the resources for the good of the country and for their 
companies.
<P>
	We were talking with someone from a major mining association 
who represents mining companies yesterday. He told us that the 
industry is not looking for handouts. That is not what it needs. The 
industry is looking for the government to get out of its way so that 
it can get on with doing what it does best.
<P>
	I am supporting this motion today because that is what I mean by 
incentives. I mean deregulation, not in a way that harms the 
environment, but in a way that makes government approval 
processes more efficient.
<P>
	Government departments and different levels of government 
should communicate with one another to harmonize contradictory 
or overlapping legislation. Right now this is Canada's problem. 
The government strangles the industry with red tape, then someone 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16463"> 16463 </A></B>
<P>
wants to come along and give the industry an oxygen mask of  
government incentives. We say, take off the red tape and the 
industry will be healthy again on its own.
<P>
	Today we had a representative from the Mining Association of 
Canada appear before the standing committee. He said: ``The 
current regulatory system is choked with red tape. Regulations, 
guidelines and decision making processes duplicate and contradict 
each other from one department to another and between the two 
levels of government''. We have to solve this problem.
<P>
	The industry also needs security of land tenure and security in 
Canada's legal regime. Mining companies have to know that when 
they start a project they are going to have an opportunity to finish 
it.
<P>
	Security is also necessary in the new environmental assessment 
process. The government has made wonderful noises about this 
problem. I am sure the hon. parliamentary secretary is going to try 
to sum this up.
<P>
	The Minister of Natural Resources has said many of the right 
words to the industry and made many good promises. The red 
book, the Liberal mining platform and the White House mining 
initiative are all full of great words.
<P>
	The industry minister promised action on streamlining 
regulations this year, 1995. However, to quote Greg Waller, an 
executive with Cominco, obviously exasperated with the 
government's lack of action to date, says: ``The mining industry is 
getting impatient with the empty words''.
<P>
	An example happened this last week. I received copies of two 
separate letters from the provinces addressed to the Minister of 
Natural Resources, one in September and one in October, 
requesting, almost pleading for a meeting between the minister, the 
Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and their provincial 
counterparts. They did not even get the courtesy of a reply from the 
Minister of Natural Resources until a provincial minister talked to 
me late last week.
<P>
<B>(1755 )</B>
<P>
	I raised the issue in the House last week. I find out now the 
minister had a conference call with the intergovernmental affairs 
minister and the provincial minister. That is a start. It is a shame it 
takes two and half or three months to arrange a simple 
teleconference call among three parties who say they are interested 
in getting to the bottom of this regulatory problem.
<P>
	There was a good presentation on regulatory reform in 
committee today. There were some specific recommendations and 
reforms that would help the industry. Many of those ideas were 
adopted by an all-party committee in last year's report ``Lifting 
Canadian Mining Off the Rocks''. These all-party resolutions were 
brought to the government. They were  recommendations from all 
sides. Not a single one of those recommendations has been adopted 
to date.
<P>
	Again, they are good words, nice words, but we do not need 
more words. We do not need more committees. We do not need 
more studies. We do not need more talk. We do not need more task 
forces. We do not need government inquiries. We do not need 
empty promises. We know the problems. We know what to do to fix 
them. What is needed right now is not knowledge, more ideas. We 
need the political will to get the job done.
<P>
	Here is part of the conclusion from today's presentation by the 
mining association: ``Real progress requires the removal of costly 
regulatory systems that are process based rather than performance 
or results oriented. This implies a willingness by the federal 
government to let go of outdated and expensive centralist systems. 
It is a willingness which has not been expressed in concrete action 
to date''.
<P>
	We need to get away from an expanded role for the federal 
government in the mining industry. The federal government must 
get off the industry's back and out of its pockets and allow the 
industry to rise to the prominence it should have. That should be 
left primarily with the provinces and the federal government 
should remember that.
<P>
	We are dealing with two philosophies of government. Is the role 
of the federal government an ever increasing one or should it take 
heed from what the industry, the provinces and many Canadians are 
saying? They are saying the role of the federal government is not to 
continually expand into areas of provincial jurisdiction; the role is 
to see where there is overlap and then to withdraw and allow the 
provinces to get the job done.
<P>
	The Minister of Natural Resources has been politely applauded 
for saying the right words to the natural resources community. She 
talks the talk, but can she walk the walk? Her political honeymoon 
with the industry will soon be over unless she produces results to 
act on the good intentions she has expressed.
<P>
	The problems with regulatory reform are the first test of this 
minister's real political will. Will she be able to overcome her 
colleagues around the cabinet table who are calling for natural 
resource industries to sit on their hands watching as sustainable 
development slowly devolves into sustainable preservation? I hope 
she has that will. I hope she will be able to stand up to her 
colleagues, stand up for a more rational approach to environmental 
assessment, stand up for Canadian jobs and expertise and 
development.
<P>
	I call on the minister to back up her words with some action 
starting today. Provide the only real incentive the Canadian mining 
industry wants and needs which is substantial, positive regulatory 
reform. She knows what has to happen. Let us see it happen. Let it 
happen now.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish 
to congratulate the member for Timiskaming-French River for 
his forceful introduction of this motion and for his keen interest 
in the importance of the mining industry.
<P>
	The motion before us urges the government to adopt the 
recommendations of the report of the Standing Committee on 
Natural Resources entitled ``Lifting Canadian Mining Off The 
Rocks'' and urges the adoption of a new program of incentives.
<P>
	It seems to me that at a time of budget austerity and restraint it 
would be wiser not to seek new tax incentives and subsidies. It is 
true that the mining industry is an important part of the Canadian 
economy. It is true that the past recession has proven difficult for 
the mining industry, but the resource sector has returned to 
profitability. For example, Barrick Gold Corporation of Toronto 
posted record profits of $250 million in 1994, up 17 per cent from 
1993.
<P>
	In addition, as the member for Timiskaming-French River 
pointed out at the beginning of this debate, there was a substantial 
increase in exploration activities throughout Canada in 1994, 9.1 
per cent or $3.3 billion above 1993 according to the Minister of 
Natural Resources and the press release which she issued on 
February 9, 1995.
<P>
<B>(1800 )</B>
<P>
	On page two of the report I mentioned earlier, we find the 
following statement: ``An application to build a mine in Canada, 
for example, can take up to four years to make its way through 
environmental assessments, in contrast to a mere six months in 
Chile''. Are we to conclude that Chile has a more advanced 
environmental assessment process than Canada, or that Chile is 
providing greater environmental protection than Canada?
<P>
	Environmental assessment regulations and legislation and the 
cumulative impact assessment are essential parts of sustainable 
development. They are here to stay. They are safeguards on human 
and environmental health.
<P>
	The report goes on into great detail on issues of tax reform. It is 
silent on the cost of tax incentives not only in terms of forgone 
revenue but in terms of potential damage to water, soil, and air. 
This, I submit, requires attention.
<P>
	The concluding paragraph of the report on page 11 is also 
important because it reveals a big gap between the position of the 
mining industry and that of the government. The paragraph states: 
``Governments must strike a much more realistic balance between 
environmental considerations and the economic viability of the 
industry''.
<P>
	This idea of balancing environmental and economic 
considerations runs counter to the Brundtland definition  of 
sustainable development and the position of the government in the 
red book and also paragraph 6(a) of the Department of Natural 
Resources Act, which calls for the sustainable development of 
Canada's natural resources.
<P>
	Balancing environment and economy is not sustainable 
development because it separates the two, running the risk of 
making policy decisions that give precedence to the economy over 
the environment. The mining association must realize that the 
Department of Natural Resources has a mandate to integrate the 
environment and the economy, as defined in the red book.
<P>
	Regarding federal and provincial overlap and duplication, it is 
important to act on what is known. In the late 1980s the federal 
government delegated authority for the monitoring and 
enforcement of mining regulations to the provinces. In his 1990 
report the then auditor general Kenneth Dye stated: ``In the one 
area where the federal government has already delegated 
monitoring and enforcement authority to the provinces, there has 
been a serious deterioration in compliance. A review of the metal 
mining liquid effluent regulations issued under the Fisheries Act 
indicates that compliance fell from 85 per cent in 1982 to 48 per 
cent in 1988.'' This conclusion seems to be important and should 
be kept in mind when we hear calls for voluntary programs to 
reduce emissions.
<P>
	Voluntary programs such as the accelerated reduction and 
elimination of toxics, ARET program, are not substitutes for 
regulations. This conclusion is substantiated by a 1994 Kellogg 
Peat Marwick management survey, which found that 95 per cent of 
respondents from Canadian organizations cited compliance to 
regulations as the principal motivator on environmental issues, 
while only 16 per cent cited voluntary government programs as a 
principal motivator.
<P>
	In conclusion, the suggestion that greater investment incentives 
to the mining industry should be offered at a time when 
governments are desperate for revenues is not synchronized with a 
government agenda attempting to reduce deficit and debt. Instead, 
it would be preferable to ensure sustainable development in a 
variety of ways, including an efficient management of minerals, for 
example, by ensuring that recycled materials and virgin materials 
are treated equally under the tax system.
<P>
	It is important to note that a 1994 study entitled ``A Comparison 
of Tax Incentives for Extraction and Recycling of Basic Materials 
in Canada'' concludes that ``there is a potential bias in the tax 
system toward the use of virgin materials relative to recycled 
materials''. This bias ought to be addressed and corrected.
<P>
	In addition, to ensure sustainable development we could 
consider programs aimed at new technologies for mineral 
extraction and environmentally sensitive exploration methods and 
equipment. We could ensure that regulations aim at 
environmentally responsible  exploration methods and that the 
regulations are enforced. We could ensure that exploration, mining 
operations, and reclamation 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16465"> 16465 </A></B>
<P>
projects are conducted in an environmentally sound manner and do 
not compromise vital land uses such as ecologically sensitive areas 
and parks.
<P>
<B>(1805)</B>
<P>
	Mining and sustainable development can be integrated for the 
long term benefit of Canadians and the economy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. George S. Rideout (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Natural Resources, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to address 
the House today on Motion 292, which would require the 
government to consider a new program of incentives to encourage 
exploration and development in Canada. In part the question is the 
definition of incentives and what that actually means.
<P>
[Translation] 
<P>
	I would like to thank my colleague, the hon. member for 
Timaskaming-French River, for having brought these important 
matters to the attention of the House.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Mining makes an enormous contribution to the Canadian 
economy and way of life, representing a vital source of 
employment in more than 115 communities throughout the 
country. It provides direct jobs for more than 300,000 Canadians 
and contributes more than $20 billion to the economy every year.
<P>
	Moreover, mining activities have a significant indirect effect on 
the Canadian economy, from the small local supplier to the 
specialized financial institution in Toronto, Montreal, or 
Vancouver. For every job created in the mining industry an 
additional job is indirectly created in other sectors of the Canadian 
economy.
<P>
	The Canadian mining industry is known throughout the world 
for its leadership in developing and applying state of the art 
exploration and mining techniques and technologies. We are very 
proud of the expertise that was developed here in Canada to take 
full advantage of our rich mineral endowment.
<P>
	The government appreciates the key role of mining to our 
economic well-being. However, we are also aware of the 
challenges the industry has been facing, especially from increased 
global competition and mineral investment. We must meet these 
challenges by working with all the mining stakeholders to sustain 
the vitality of the industry and provide conditions that will foster its 
growth.
<P>
	In our opinion, the best way to support and encourage the mining 
sector is to reduce the level of long term structural impediments to 
mineral investment. Many of these impediments were identified by 
the Whitehorse Mining Initiative, which saw the federal 
government, along with the representatives of industry, provincial 
governments, environmental groups, labour unions, and  aboriginal 
organizations, come to the table to work together. A consensus was 
reached and the WMI leadership council accord was signed in 
September 1994, which outlines agreed upon principles and goals 
to guide the development of mining in this country.
<P>
	To help develop an action plan to address the WMI issues that 
fall within the jurisdiction of the federal government, the Minister 
of Natural Resources established a private sector ministerial 
advisory committee. One of its first tasks is to provide commentary 
and advice on the sustainable development of mineral, mines, and 
metals issues paper the minister released in September in 
Vancouver. This release fulfils a promise the minister made. After 
discussion on the paper, the minister will work with the 
stakeholders to develop a mineral and metal policy for 
consideration by cabinet.
<P>
	To address the most fundamental industry concerns we 
introduced a measure in the 1994 budget allowing a deduction for 
mine reclamation trust fund contributions. Our commitment to 
mineral development was also reaffirmed when the mining sector 
was identified as one of the six key sectors where the government 
wants to see significant improvement to the regulatory regime. 
Furthermore, our natural resources standing committee is currently 
examining this very issue.
<P>
	Some specific areas where we are working to make tangible long 
term improvements include administration of the Fisheries Act, 
land use and related decision making, the definition of waste, 
regulatory regimes north of 60, regulatory impact analysis, and 
toxic management policy and practices. Important improvements 
on issues of overlap and duplication could also be achieved through 
various initiatives to harmonize federal and provincial regulatory 
regimes.
<P>
	On October 19 Natural Resources Canada and the Mining 
Association of Canada co-sponsored a seminar on regulatory 
streamlining in order to help identify concrete ways of accelerating 
progress on these issues. In support of the same objectives for jobs 
and new investments, NR Canada has been marketing Canada's 
mineral opportunities in Canada and abroad in an effort to attract 
much needed capital investment for our mineral industry.
<P>
<B>(1810 )</B>
<P>
	The Minister of Natural Resources is a strong champion of the 
Canadian mining industry. Earlier this year she participated in the 
international ``Investing in the Americas'' conference, where she 
vigorously promoted Canada as an attractive country for mineral 
investment.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	These efforts are very important, because investments are 
essential to ensure the industry's future.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="16466"> 16466 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We know that Canada's geography and geology are attractive. 
Exploration levels have recently started to recover, thus reflecting 
increased confidence in Canada as a mining country.
<P>
	Of course the 1995 budget must be counted among our efforts to 
help solve the problems of the mining industry. By forcefully 
proceeding to put our economic house in order, we are sending a 
clear signal that we want to regain control of our country's 
finances. The measures implemented in the last budget will result 
in more favourable investment conditions in Canada, which will 
certainly benefit the mining industry.
<P>
	The government remains committed to a prosperous mining 
sector in Canada and promotes actions that are consistent with our 
budgetary objectives and the efficiency of the federation. Mining, 
more than most industries, is global. The influence that Natural 
Resources Canada exercises in national and international fora 
makes a significant difference to the sustainable development and 
competitiveness of the industry. Our science and technology and 
our policy investments are cost-effective and bring benefits to 
Canada in all regions.
<P>
	The initiatives I have discussed are fundamental critical steps 
that will result in greater levels of certainty for the mining investor. 
This government understands that reality. We will continue to work 
in partnership with provinces and territories to ensure that our 
geological potential is fully realized and Canadians have an 
opportunity to benefit from a strong mining industry.
<P>
	In conclusion, this government appreciates the important 
contribution the mining industry makes to our country's job 
creation and economic growth. We understand the challenges that 
face the industry today. This government is following a policy 
agenda to put in place an attractive investment climate that 
encourages and supports a prosperous mining industry committed 
to sustainable development.

<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 deemed 
to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="INTERNATIONALCRIMINALCOURT">INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT</A></H4>
	<B>Hon. Warren Allmand (Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on September 29, 1995, I asked the Minister of Justice 
whether he and the Canadian government supported the proposal 
for an international criminal court and, if so, what they were doing 
to advance this proposal. While the minister gave me a very 
positive response on that date, I want to pursue this further in order 
to put more details on the record of the House with respect to the 
proposed international criminal court.
<P>
	Right away I should clarify the difference between the 
International Court of Justice, that is, the world court presently 
sitting in The Hague, and the proposed international criminal court.
<P>
	The existing International Court of Justice, the world court, 
deals with disputes between the states; in other words, a dispute 
between the United States and Nicaragua or a dispute between 
Canada and Spain. If a country breaks its obligations under an 
international treaty a group of countries or another country may sue 
the accused country, the state, in the International Court of Justice. 
However, the International Court of Justice does not deal with 
international offences committed by individuals which are in 
violation of the same human rights treaties passed by the United 
Nations.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="16467"> 16467 </A></B>
<P>
	For example, although it has been 50 years since the Nuremberg 
trials following the second world war, nothing has been done to set 
up courts which can do  what the Nuremberg trials did. The 
Nuremberg trials tried individuals who had committed war crimes 
during the second world war and held them responsible for their 
acts before the international community.
<P>
	While there was a lot of talk following those trials that we should 
set up a permanent international criminal court, nothing was done 
until 1953. In 1953 a draft statute was prepared to establish such an 
international criminal court but it fell victim to the disputes of the 
cold war and never went anywhere.
<P>
	However, times have changed and there has been a new initiative 
in recent years to once again establish an international criminal 
court which would hold individuals responsible when they commit 
crimes against humanity, crimes of genocide, crimes of 
international terrorism and crimes of international drug trafficking. 
Although such individuals might be charged before their own 
domestic court or before the court of the country in which the 
victims were found, there is more credibility if there is a standing 
international criminal court in which such individuals can be tried.
<P>
	We can recall a few years ago when certain Libyans were 
accused of putting a bomb in a plane which blew up over Scotland, 
killing many people. There was an attempt to bring the Libyans to 
trial in Scotland but there was a credibility question because many 
individuals doubted whether the Libyans would get a fair trial in a 
Scottish court when the passengers were killed in Scotland. It is 
much better that we have an international criminal court for those 
kinds of offences in which the judges are from many countries, not 
necessarily from the country of the victims, and therefore there is a 
semblance of credibility and fairness.
<P>
	This matter has advanced quite far. In 1994 the United Nations 
set up a special ad hoc committee on the establishment of an 
international criminal court. The ad hoc committee has met twice 
since last December and the whole matter seems to be well on its 
way.
<P>
	My purpose tonight is to ask the parliamentary secretary, since 
the very positive response of the minister in September, whether 
the ad hoc committee has completed its work and has reported to 
the sixth committee of the General Assembly of the United 
Nations.
<P>
	When does he expect we will see agreement to a statute setting 
up such an international criminal court? It will be a great step 
forward when this is done. I congratulate the Canadian government 
on the work it has done so far. I hope this whole project will soon 
see the light of day.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jesse Flis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Justice after 
question period today asked me if I would respond to the hon. 
member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce  on his initiative and his 
perseverance to establish a permanent international court.
<P>
	Events such as those in Rwanda and in the former Yugoslavia 
have amply demonstrated the need for a permanent international 
court to try individuals responsible for those most atrocious crimes 
of all: genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity.
<P>
	The end of the cold war and a new found political will permit the 
international community to consider the establishment of such a 
court as a worthwhile and serious idea.
<P>
	The permanent international criminal court would serve two 
crucial purposes. First, an important deterrent to criminal acts is 
the knowledge that perpetrators will be persecuted either by 
national authorities or by an international court.
<P>
	Second, the establishment of such a court responds to desire for 
justice on the part of victims of these offences, thus permitting the 
international community to contribute meaningfully to the 
maintenance of peace and security by discouraging reprisals or 
other acts of vengeance.
<P>
	Canada is at the forefront of efforts to create this court. The 
Department of Justice together with the Department of Foreign 
Affairs and International Trade and the Department of National 
Defence have been participating this year in two meetings of an ad 
hoc committee created by the General Assembly of the United 
Nations to review the major substantive and administrative issues 
arising out of the draft statute for the court.
<P>
	In accordance with the recommendations the ad hoc committee 
will be presenting this fall to the general assembly, Canada is now 
pushing for the convening of an international conference to 
negotiate the creation of the court.
<P>
	We are very proud of the contribution Canada is making toward 
the establishment of the court as well as our current work on cases 
to be tried by the ad hoc courts for the former Yugoslavia and 
Rwanda. I hope this satisfies the hon. member for 
Notre-Dame-de-Grâce who, I say again, has shown leadership on 
this issue.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Pursuant to Standing Order 
38, the motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been 
adopted. Accordingly, this House stands adjourned until tomorrow 
at 10 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24.
