	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (York North, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, pursuant to Standing Order 36, I am pleased to present to 
this House two petitions. In the first the petitioners draw to the 
attention of the House that Canadians of all ages view our health 
care system as a defining element of Canadian society.
<P>
	The petitioners therefore call on Parliament to continue to 
uphold the fundamental principles of the Canada Health Act so that 
public health care remains accessible, comprehensive, portable, 
universal and publicly administered.

Speaker, in the second petition the petitioners draw to the attention 
of the House that the plight of endangered species in Canada is a 
national problem that continues to worsen and that there are 
compelling ecological, economic and ethical reasons to save 
Canada's irreplaceable wild species.
<P>
	Therefore the petitioners call on Parliament to enact enforceable 
legislation which will protect Canada's endangered species.

<P>
	Pursuant to Standing Order 36, I am pleased to present two 
petitions. The first concerns taxation of the family and it comes 
from Winnipeg, Manitoba.
<P>
	The petitioners draw to the attention of the House that managing 
the family home and caring for preschool children is an honourable 
profession which has not been recognized for its value to our 
society.
<P>
	The petitioners therefore pray and call on Parliament to pursue 
initiatives to eliminate tax discrimination against families that 
provide care in the home for preschool children, the chronically ill, 
the aged or the disabled.

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="ALCOHOLCONSUMPTION">ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
the second petition comes from Kingston, Ontario and it concerns 
the labelling on alcoholic beverages.
<P>
	The petitioners draw to the attention of the House that the 
consumption of alcoholic beverages may cause health problems or 
impair one's ability and specifically that fetal alcohol syndrome 
and other alcohol related birth defects are 100 per cent preventable 
by avoiding alcohol consumption during pregnancy.
<P>
	The petitioners therefore pray and call on Parliament to enact 
legislation to require health warning labels to be placed on the 
containers of all alcoholic beverages to caution expectant mothers 
and others of the risks associated with alcohol consumption.

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House recognize Montreal as the economic mainspring of Quebec 
society and, therefore, condemn the federal government's lack of concrete initiatives 
in supporting the Montreal area economy, primarily: the federal government's 
under-investment in research and development; its inequitable allocation of federal 
purchases of goods and services; its lack of willingness to support Montreal as a 
major financial centre in North America and its termination of Montreal's role as a 
major transportation centre.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Mrs. Dalphond-Guiral:</B> On a point of order, Madam Speaker. I 
wish to inform you that, pursuant to Standing Order 43(2), the 
members of the official opposition will divide their speaking time 
in two, each speaking for 10 minutes.
<P>
<B>(1015)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier:</B> Madam Speaker, in politics, the greatest quality, 
in my opinion, is sincerity, honesty. When politicians address their 
electors or the public in general, I believe they have the duty to 
speak as truthfully as possible about situations as they see them but 
they must meet certain standards regarding what they say about the 
reality of the situation.
<P>
	Yesterday, in this House, we questioned the Prime Minister. A 
few days ago, he had addressed a group of citizens in Montreal, 
where he told the chamber of commerce that the federal 
government was so concerned about the development of their city, 
that the federal government was so terribly upset about the 
financial difficulties Montreal is facing and, finally, that the federal 
government was taking oh so effective steps to support of 
Montreal's development. That is basically what the Prime Minister 
said.
<P>
	As the official opposition, and concerned as we are about what 
happens to Montreal and even more so about what happens to the 
people of Montreal, who all too often find themselves jobless and 
living in poverty, we decided to check whether the statement made 
by the Prime Minister before the chamber of commerce had any 
basis whatsoever. Expressing concern about a city's difficulties 
before its chamber of commerce, in itself, is not enough to solve 
the problem. It takes more than the  Prime Minister of Canada 
paying lip service to a healthy economy in Montreal, Quebec's 
metropolis, for economic prosperity to be restored there. It takes 
some concrete actions.
<P>
	We asked the Prime Minister if he was prepared to act on this, 
that or the other issue. We referred to very specific issues that may 
help restore a healthy economy in Montreal, issues we will discuss 
in a moment. Not once did we get a clear answer from the Prime 
Minister, a positive and firm answer like: ``In my capacity as the 
Prime Minister, I undertake to implement this initiative, which will 
create jobs for the Montreal area''. Not once did we succeed in 
obtaining this kind of a commitment during oral question period.
<P>
	Yesterday, to my colleague from Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, the 
Prime Minister gave an answer that spoke volumes about his vision 
of Quebec development. The hon. member for 
Hochelaga-Maisonneuve's question was this:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Why does the Prime Minister not agree to making federal procurement in Quebec 
proportionate to the size of its population?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Why would Canada not adopt a procurement policy based on 
equity, so that the purchases made with taxpayers' money are 
distributed according to the relative demographic weight of the 
various regions? This, I think, would be an interesting way of 
stimulating the economy in every region of Canada and not always 
buying, by a strange coincidence, from the same source.
<P>
	The Prime Minister's answer was this:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Will the hon. member rise in this House and tell the public that, under the 
equalization payment system through which the Canadian government provides 
assistance to any region of Canada experiencing financial difficulties-last year, 
because its revenue was below a certain level, Quebec actually received an extra 
$500 million from the federal government?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The truth was out. For the Prime Minister of Canada, being fair 
to a region like Quebec, being fair to Montreal and helping with its 
development, means equalization payments. For the Prime 
Minister of Canada, being fair to Quebec means giving Quebec a 
share equal to the taxes it pays to Ottawa.
<P>
<B>(1020)</B>
<P>
	For the Prime Minister, real development that comes from 
producing goods and providing services is good for some regions 
of Canada, while, for other regions, fairness, material well-being 
and development mean equalization payments.
<P>
	What the people listening to us must know is that, indeed, 
equalization payments are used when a region is unable to generate 
its own wealth. When a region finds itself in a difficult economic 
situation, these payments provide needed assistance.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5647"> 5647 </A></B>
<P>
	When the Prime Minister comes to Montreal to shed a tear over 
the issue of development, he does not think  about concrete plans 
or a shift in government policy, about real situations or a new way 
of looking at things, but about equalization payments.
<P>
	Even though any economic development the federal government 
may foster through its purchases and its R and D spending just 
happens to favour Ontario-90 to 95 per cent in some cases of 
professional service procurement, while in other cases the figure is 
58, 59 or 60 per cent-the Prime Minister tells us: ``We have a 
procurement policy we must adhere to. Would we want to be 
unfair? The Government of Canada is so honest, so frank, that we 
call for tenders''. But, by a curious coincidence, purchases are 
always made in the same place. By some strange coincidence, they 
are rarely made in Montreal.
<P>
	How can the Prime Minister of Canada explain a vision of 
economic development based solely on equalization payments? For 
him and his government, social assistance is the key to Montreal's 
well-being. That is what the Prime Minister of Canada thinks.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> This is unbelievable. The jobs go to Ontario.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier:</B> Madam Speaker, we accuse the federal 
government, its predecessor, and the one before that, of which the 
Prime Minister was also a member, having been here since the 
Auto Pact or just about. Federal governments have always made 
decisions that penalize Montreal.
<P>
	In the railway industry, federal decisions have cost Montreal 
15,000 jobs in the past 15 years. Air traffic has been transferred 
and, as passengers are now arriving in Toronto instead of Montreal, 
our airports are in trouble. Government decisions which favour 
Canadian International over Air Canada will also create problems 
because Air Canada jobs are located in Montreal, while Canadian's 
jobs are elsewhere. Indeed, the federal government keeps favouring 
Canadian over Air Canada.
<P>
	As for shipping, they are taking decisions which could prove 
very harmful to St. Lawrence harbours. The Centre for Information 
Technology Innovation in Laval has lost 80 jobs. The St. Hubert 
Command Centre is down by at least 480 jobs. The federal 
government's decision to save $7.5 million means there will be no 
more research and development in the Montreal area at the 
Tokamak installation in Varennes. Helped along by the federal 
government, Atomic Energy of Canada is heading toward Toronto 
and could take with it some high technology companies in the 
sector. The creation of a Canada-wide securities commission, 
which will transfer the nerve centre from Montreal to Toronto, will 
shift even more activities to Toronto.
<P>
	But what decisions is the federal government taking that favour 
Montreal, other than those concerning equalization payments? Last 
week the Prime Minister was  happy to announce for the first time a 
good decision for Montreal. He was happy, and rightly so, because 
otherwise he would have had nothing to report. He says he is 
concerned about the problems of Montreal, about the city's poverty 
and economic difficulties, but he does nothing.
<P>
	This is why we chose today to speak about what the government 
should do, but will not do.
<P>
<B>(1025)</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Martin Cauchon (Secretary of State (Federal Office of 
Regional Development-Quebec), Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I first 
want to thank members of the official opposition for giving the 
government an opportunity to state its position on the greater 
Montreal area and to say how it envisions its economic recovery.
<P>
	Later on, I will have an opportunity to mention the initiatives we 
have taken in a speech. But I want to reply to the speech delivered 
by the leader of the official opposition, in which he mentions what 
concrete measures he would like the government to take. I have the 
distinct feeling that the leader of the official opposition does not go 
to Montreal very often if he cannot think of concrete measures 
taken by the government, because we regularly take action and 
implement integrated projects that benefit the Montreal region 
from a national and an international perspective.
<P>
	In the case of government contracts, the fact is that, in its 
advertising, the federal government makes sure the private sector 
has a clear understanding of these contracts which, incidentally, 
total over one billion dollars in Canada.
<P>
	As for equalization, why are members of the official opposition 
against the idea? Because equalization is a basic principle of our 
political system, of Canadian federalism, and it enables us-and 
this is something we are proud of-to distribute, in an equitable 
way, our overall wealth across the country.
<P>
	What really saddens me is that, once again, members of the 
official opposition are incapable of rising above purely partisan 
views. I will not ask the opposition leader to name five projects that 
were recently announced by the Canadian government in the 
Montreal region, because he simply would not be able to do so. But 
I will ask him if he and his head office in Quebec can, in the interest 
of Montrealers, make constructive proposals based on a vision, in 
the context of the strategy unveiled this week by the Prime Minister 
of Canada before the chamber of commerce, something I will come 
back to later on, in my speech.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier:</B> Madam Speaker, you will understand that I can 
hardly keep a straight face when I hear a Liberal like the hon. 
member opposite telling me that we are not able to rise over 
partisan politics. In this House, we know all about the 
government's eagerness to promote its red book, to use government 
services to promote its funding drives, to appoint its friends 
everywhere, and the member has the gall to talk about partisanship. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5648"> 5648 </A></B>
<P>
Yes, we are partisans, partisan of development. We are in favour of 
real development for the Montreal area.
<P>
	The hon. member is asking for suggestions; I made some and I 
will make more. The government should have the courage to fairly 
allocate research and development funding in Canada and to take 
initiatives for the development of the Montreal area. I think that 
instead of buying flags for $20 million, the government should 
invest $7.5 million in the Tokamak project in Varennes, that way it 
would effectively support the economic development of the 
Montreal area.
<P>
<B>(1030)</B>
<P>
	I am in the process of providing an answer.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> The hon. 
member's speaking time is up. Is there unanimous consent to give 
the hon. member more time?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Yes.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> The hon. 
member does not have unanimous consent.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, it is quite revealing that the secretary of state for regional 
development in Quebec should thank the opposition for giving him 
the opportunity to talk about Montreal. Just imagine. He needs to 
be given that opportunity by the opposition because the 
government does not give it to him. That is quite something.
<P>
	Today, my colleagues will be talking about a whole series of 
actions, or non actions, rather, of the federal government affecting 
Montreal. But first of all, I think it is worthwhile to set some 
objective criteria to better understand the situation in Montreal.
<P>
	A very interesting study has been made of 15 big cities in the 
world, including three Canadian cities, Toronto, Vancouver, and 
Montreal. Various indicators can be used to better assess the 
situation in Montreal. On that basis, we will see who is responsible 
for what, and what the federal government is doing or not doing in 
Montreal.
<P>
	If we look at labour cost indicators, we see that Montreal ranks 
third, behind London and Stockholm, for directors general; second, 
behind London, for secretaries and professional engineers; third, 
behind London, Stockholm and Vancouver, for system analysts; 
third, behind Atlanta and London, for laboratory technicians, and 
fourth, behind Toronto, Atlanta and Los Angeles for electronic 
assemblers.
<P>
	We compare very well, contrary to what some would have us 
believe, such as the militant community paper of the West Island, 
<I>The Gazette</I>, which paints quite another  picture of Montreal for its 
North American and worldwide readership.
<P>
	On the business tax indicator, Montreal ranks second, behind 
Stockholm. On the R and D cost indicator, Montreal is the very first 
city in the world. On the telecommunications cost indicator, it 
ranks second, with Toronto, behind London. Montreal has the 
cheapest first class office space in the world.
<P>
	On the industrial land cost indicator, Montreal ranks second 
behind Atlanta. It stands in third position, behind Toronto and 
Atlanta, on the industrial construction cost indicator. Montreal 
holds to the third sport, behind Vancouver and Stockholm, on the 
hydro cost indicator, despite our harsh winter. For natural gas, 
Montreal ranks fifth in a group of 15 cities, which is not bad.
<P>
	In terms of the quality of life index, Montreal is third with an 
index of 1000, behind Toronto and Vancouver, which are about at 
the same level with indexes of 1002 and 1003 respectively. In terms 
of public security, Montreal is sixth out of 15 cities. The cost of 
living index has Montreal in second place right behind Vancouver, 
with only a point difference. Montreal ranks first for its cost of 
housing index.
<P>
	So, these are very encouraging statistics, and yet Montreal faces 
some serious problems. There are those who would say this is due 
to political uncertainty. That is the expression they are using these 
days. In answer to which we argue that there is one certainty, which 
is that the members opposite are doing absolutely nothing. And we 
can prove it.
<P>
	When they talk about political uncertainty, I can still hear the big 
names supporting federalism, such as Laurent Beaudoin of 
Bombardier, for instance, who said during the 1992 debate: ``You 
know, political uncertainty is preventing people from investing in 
Montreal and that is terrible.'' The same week, he announced the 
biggest investment Bombardier ever made outside the country. It 
bought Short Corporation in a city known for its incredible 
stability, Belfast. Belfast is a very stable city.
<P>
<B>(1035)</B>
<P>
	When the Prime Minister travels with Team Canada, he goes to 
visit Russia, another very stable country, Russia is. We see it all the 
time, the mafia is practically running the whole country over there. 
The rouble is not worth much. They are out of money. Yes, indeed, 
a very stable country.
<P>
	Now we have free trade with Mexico, and is Mexico more stable 
than the province of Quebec? Do we have something like Chiapas 
in Quebec? Is the former premier of Quebec in hiding somewhere 
in the world, because he is accused of fraud and suspected of 
murder? Come on! Get serious. We are all in favour of trade with 
our Mexican friends, but do not compare the stability in Quebec 
with the situation in Mexico. That is pushing it! You might be 
Liberals, but I hope you can still reason a little bit better than this.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5649"> 5649 </A></B>
<P>
	Still on the issue of stability, we are now negotiating a free trade 
agreement with Israel. That country is on the news every night. Can 
you compare the political stability in Jerusalem with that of 
Montreal? Of course not.
<P>
	They like to use the expression ``political uncertainty'' and when 
they do I can see them smiling, because they are glad to see what is 
happening in Quebec. They say one thing when they are in 
Montreal and something else when they are in Ottawa. That is what 
the Prime Minister likes to do. We all know that.
<P>
	Now we are going to talk about the real things, the real figures, 
and I guess my hon. colleague, the Secretary of State for the 
Federal Office of Regional Development, does believe in the work 
of Statistics Canada. I guess it is a reliable federal institution, 
graded A+. We will see about that.
<P>
	Expenditures on goods and services: federal structuring 
expenditures in Quebec in 1994, 19.7 per cent; grants and subsidies 
to businesses, 20.5 per cent; capital financing, 18.3 per cent; total 
structuring expenditures in Quebec, 19.7 per cent; Quebec 
population, 24.9 per cent. We seem to be short of 5 per cent here. 
And yet this is published by Statistics Canada and not by the Bloc 
Quebecois.
<P>
	Federal investments in Quebec: 1993, 18.5 per cent; 1994, 15.7 
per cent; 1995, 15.3 per cent; 1996, 13.2 per cent. These are the 
figures. These are the facts. Everything else is only rhetoric and lip 
service on the part of all of the prime ministers, from Trudeau to 
this one. And I see that the one who is getting ready to take over is 
sending the same signals, is thinking along the same lines, is 
backing us into the same corner.
<P>
	That party, as paleontologists would say, is an exemple of an 
evolutionary dead end.
<P>
	To conclude, I move, seconded by my colleague from 
Laval-Centre:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the motion be amended by adding immediately after the word ``recognize'' 
the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``the area of''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1040)</B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> I declare the 
amendment in order.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Martin Cauchon (Secretary of State (Federal Office of 
Regional Development-Quebec), Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, again 
I thank the official opposition for giving me the opportunity to talk 
about our vision for Montreal. As my colleague from 
Laurier-Sainte-Marie said, if the government did not talk about 
the metropolitan area, why then is the opposition making it the 
subject of this allotted day.
<P>
	The Canadian government takes this opportunity to tell the 
people that it has been and will continue to be present in the 
metropolitan area. The whole of Team Canada is present in the 
metropolitan area. Frankly, I must say that I now understand why 
members of the official opposition, when I ask them to propose 
concrete and constructive ideas for the strategy we set forward as a 
government, are unable to make any real suggestion.
<P>
	The answer comes from my colleague from 
Laurier-Sainte-Marie. The members opposite are still stuck on 
statistics, they are still at the drawing table, while we on the 
government side have been acting for a very long time. We have 
been working hard so that the metropolitan area can take its place 
in the province of Quebec and continue to play a major role within 
Canada, and that Montreal can continue to be the international city 
all Canadians are so proud of.
<P>
	This being said, I would like to ask the hon. member for 
Laurier-Sainte-Marie if he can propose any real solution, today, 
in terms of our strategy for Montreal. I know that they know 
nothing about this strategy and, naturally, they are a little bit more 
eloquent about it. But could the member at least try to tell us that 
his party is now past the stage of studies and statistics and has gone 
as far as the government, which has been acting for a very long 
time. Do you have any concrete solutions?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> Madam Speaker, it is amazing that a secretary of 
state who wants to become a minister tells us that he does not want 
to hear about statistics. He should follow the basic political training 
from the Minister of Finance. He talks about it all day long. I think 
he knows his subject better than the person responsible for regional 
development in Quebec. While we do not agree with what he does, 
at least we understand what the minister says. That, however, is 
another matter.
<P>
	The secretary of state asks for suggestions. The leader of our 
party just submitted some to him. Yesterday, we asked questions. 
Sometimes, it is better to talk less and to listen more. You can make 
another effort. Take a pencil and write down my suggestions; or, 
better yet, I can make a copy of them for you. There are four of 
them.
<P>
	Regarding the financial sector, can the government make a 
commitment not to establish a Canadian Securities Commission? 
That is one suggestion. That is the first one. Here is the second one. 
Regarding the development decisions dealing with energy, can the 
government abandon the idea of transferring-I speak slowly 
because it takes time to write these suggestions down-the offices 
of Atomic Energy of Canada from Montreal to Toronto? And will it 
also undertake to maintain the subsidies to Tokamak , 
T-O-K-A-M-A-K? That is for the second suggestion.
<P>
	As for federal spending, will it guarantee with respect to regional 
development, defence spending and capital spending that Quebec 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5650"> 5650 </A></B>
<P>
will benefit from more than 19.7 per cent of development 
spending? That is the third suggestion. But the secretary of state is 
not listening, that is why he does not understand.
<P>
<B>(1045)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bergeron:</B> He did not write down anything.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe: </B>And the fourth suggestion relates to tax equity: 
will the government sign an agreement regarding the GST, as it did 
with the Maritime Provinces?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Iftody:</B> That is not true.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe: </B>Ma-ri-ti-mes.
<P>
	That is the fourth one. We made quite a number of suggestions 
since yesterday. As the day goes by, the secretary of state will have 
filled all the pages of his notebook. If, one day, he can start 
listening and taking notes, he will then be able to act. Meanwhile, 
he does nothing.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Martin Cauchon (Secretary of State (Federal Office of 
Regional Development-Quebec), Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I can 
understand that members of the official opposition have nothing 
concrete to suggest for our Montreal strategy because I think they 
have not quite yet understood the big picture with regard to the 
Canadian government's intervention in the Montreal metropolitan 
area.
<P>
	I will take a few minutes to explain our intervention in a region 
that is vital not only to Quebec but to Canada. When we look at 
Greater Montreal, it is, in many respects, the economic force 
behind the whole country.
<P>
	I like to say this because I think it is true: Montreal is Canada 
and Canada is Montreal. The metropolitan area is at the heart of our 
history. Therefore, you will certainly understand that for the 
Canadian government, which I represent, the development of the 
metropolitan area is most important and, as such, is included in our 
priorities.
<P>
	The government's desire for dynamic intervention in the 
metropolitan area must be understood and must be put in 
perspective. It must be understood in the sense that a modern 
country, a country that wants to have a dynamic economic structure 
and that wants to be highly competitive, must ensure that its large 
metropolitan areas are economically healthy.
<P>
	Vancouver, Calgary, Toronto, Halifax, Montreal, these cities are 
all vital to our country, and they all must be in excellent financial 
health.
<P>
	Canada is sensitive to the vitality of these cities. We have 
developed an intervention strategy for the Montreal metropolitan 
area, as we have done for other regions of Canada. As secretary of 
State responsible for regional development, I can talk proudly 
about this strategy. I think it is important for the people who are 
listening to me today to understand what the Canadian government 
means to the metropolitan area.
<P>
	There are 32,500 federal employees in Greater Montreal. This 
means that the federal government's second largest service centre 
is in the metropolitan area. That is why this area so important to the 
Canadian government, and that is also why we can say that the 
federal government is a major partner in this area.
<P>
<B>(1050)</B>
<P>
	The salaries paid to these federal employees represents $732 
million a year. When we are speaking about development 
programs, we speak about programs which cost $765 million a 
year. When we speak about one hundred per cent research and 
development programs, we are talking about interventions totalling 
$485 million in 1993.
<P>
	Therefore, as you can see, our involvement is structured and our 
presence is enormous. We have chosen for the region of Montreal 
an essentially horizontal intervention strategy, that is, one which 
allows all the departments to act in a concerted way, to work, as 
Team Canada, for the metropolitan region in order to maximize all 
the different federal programs provided to Montrealers.
<P>
	We did the same thing in the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean area. 
We did the same thing recently with certain regional development 
initiatives, such as the Gatig Fund in the 
Quebec-Chaudière-Appalaches region. We did the same thing 
when the time came to help the Lower St. Lawrence-Gaspé region 
with the ground fish strategy, and we are doing the same thing for 
other Canadian regions.
<P>
	To get involved in the metropolitan area means to provide 
structure and to act with vision. To do this, we have chosen focuses. 
The Canadian government's intervention is focussed essentially on 
its fields of jurisdiction, on elements which may lead to a 
considerable and significant progress for the metropolitan area.
<P>
	The focuses of intervention are as follows: the development of 
science and technology; the development of the metropolitan area 
for the international market; helping the small and medium size 
businesses; the development of culture and tourism industries, 
which are fundamental elements; and the social and economic 
development at the local level of the different communities of 
Montreal.
<P>
	These are the structuring measures we are taking in the beautiful 
Montreal region, and I think that it is important to underline the 
fact that these measures come within the scope of the major 
priorities of the government. In 1993, we received a mandate from 
the Canadian people. We did what we were elected to do and the 
strategy, of which I just enumerated the five elements, revolves 
around the government's priorities.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5651"> 5651 </A></B>
<P>
	These priorities are, of course, job creation, economic growth, 
helping businesses to adapt to the new economy and support for 
Canadian youth.
<P>
	That being said, I think that we all have a basic role to play with 
regard to the structuring elements in greater Montreal. The 
Canadian government gets involved and has its strategy for the 
Montreal area, but I think that we must understand that the greater 
Montreal area concerns the Canadian government, the Quebec 
government, Montreal itself and all the surrounding towns and 
cities, as well as the private sector.
<P>
	In greater Montreal there is a whole spectrum of stakeholders 
who have decided to work in partnership. Now, let me review our 
interventions with concrete examples.
<P>
<B>(1055)</B>
<P>
	In the area of science and technology, I made a speech yesterday 
before the members of the space industry, not the aerospace sector, 
but a very specific part of it, the space industry. The Canadian 
government has been involved in the space industry for more than 
20 years. We played a major role to help an industrial area 
recognized not only here in Canada, but all over the world. So, 
when we talk about the first element, science and technology, we 
can say that the Canadian government has been a major partner in 
aeronautics, biotechnology, pharmacology, telecommunications, 
information technologies and multimedia.
<P>
	In connection with the elements I have just mentioned, which 
come under science and technology, a number of companies have 
sprung up, thanks to the vision of the Canadian government, and 
thanks also to the infrastructure in the Montreal area, to the quality 
of the workforce, and to our vision, because we focused on science 
and technology.
<P>
	And as for the successes we are seeing today, with respect to 
concrete projects, I must say that the government is rather proud to 
be associated with these achievements, because these companies 
are, in a way, one of the cornerstones of our Canadian society. I will 
list them for you. There is Bell Helicopter, Ericsson, Biochem 
Pharma, Merck Frosst, CAE Electronics, Spar, SR Telecom, Harris, 
Farinon, Lallemand, the Institut Rosell, and I could go on. These 
success stories are all because of the Canadian government's vision 
and its strategy for action.
<P>
	Again, just recently, it was with great pride that we entered into 
partnership with Bombardier and Canadair in the aerospace field, 
with the result that the 70 seat stretch CRX jet was finally 
developed. This will allow us to create or maintain over 1,000 jobs 
in the greater Montreal area. We are focusing on partnership, and I 
think that one of the messages I want to get across today is that we 
are doing so because it is together that we are  going to be able to 
rebuild and recreate the dynamic level of activity that Montreal has 
a right to expect.
<P>
	Other examples. In biotechnology, there is the Biotechnology 
Research Institute of greater Montreal, founded in 1983, was the 
impetus behind a good number of technology firms that are 
international successes today. Think of Ibex Technologies, Bio 
Signal, or Quantum Biotechnolgies. The institute has such a 
reputation that we are now attracting international investments. 
There is also the Dutch company Bio Intermediair.
<P>
	This has all been made possible through the National Research 
Council of Canada. And again, recently, proud of the assistance it 
has provided, proud of its contribution to science and technology, 
the Canadian government, through my colleague, the Minister of 
Industry, has announced a $20 million expansion of the institute, 
which will make room for 20 additional firms. This is what we 
mean when we talk about structuring activities.
<P>
	The second area is international development: 40 per cent of the 
jobs created in 1995 are related to international development, the 
conquest of new markets by our small businesses. Naturally, we 
play a role by providing advice to these businesses, helping them to 
fine-tune their export capabilities, but we also play an international 
role with our added value, which is the pride of Quebecers, in the 
form of our network of embassies and consulates in over 126 
countries, with their trade advisors, who are there to assist our 
small businesses.
<P>
<B>(1100)</B>
<P>
	On the international scene, we seem to forget that the Canadian 
government has been very dynamic in its promotion of Montreal as 
the site for certain secretariats. Whether with the secretariat of the 
North American Commission on Environmental Co-operation, the 
secretariat of the United Nations Convention on Biological 
Diversity, or the secretariat of the Convention to Control 
Desertification, we have been doing our level best to help Montreal 
consolidate itself as an international region. And what about the 
Centre de conférences internationales de Montréal, which we 
support not only through its operating budget, but also through 
funding for international development.
<P>
	Those are fundamental interventions, in some cases involving 
partnerships with the Government of Quebec and the private sector. 
We shall shortly be announcing Montréal international, another 
developmental element, one which will enable Montreal to fully 
assume its deserved role in terms of international endeavours.
<P>
	The third concerns the development of small and medium 
business. The right balance between small and big business must be 
struck. In my opinion, announcements such as the one by 
Bombardier and Canadair are full of promise for small business, 
because they will lead to sub-contracts, which are good not just for 
the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5652"> 5652 </A></B>
<P>
metropolitan region but for all regions of Quebec, for 
sub-contractors are located just about everywhere in Quebec.
<P>
	The Government of Canada intervenes with small and medium 
businesses, first of all to help them adapt to the new economic 
context, but also to ensure that young entrepreneurs can get help 
starting up and becoming competitive. We do so-and I feel this is 
an important point-because the new government is one which 
offers support and expertise, for instance via such programs as 
Strategis for small business.
<P>
	And then we could also mention the Centre d'entreprise et 
d'innovation de Montréal, just another example of how we are, 
always have been, and will continue to be, major partners in the 
development of small business in Quebec.
<P>
	The fourth bridge is development of the cultural and tourist 
industries. Such elements as the Vieux Port, the parc des Îles and 
the Pointe-à-Callière museum are all of importance to the 
metropolitan region. Tourism, for instance, represents 40,000 jobs 
in greater Montreal. We play our part in this sector through the 
Canadian Tourism Commission or the OCTGM with which we 
entered into a $2.5 million partnership.
<P>
	In the case of local communities, we act with the greatest respect 
for their realities and needs in terms of development, through 
CDEC, for example. All those examples show that the Canadian 
government has been and continues to be major partner.
<P>
	If you will allow me a few more minutes, I referred, as part of 
this intervention, to a horizontal strategy and I must emphasize the 
collaboration of all the federal departments, which contributed 
their share to metropolitan Montreal and are working in close 
collaboration, be it Industry Canada, Heritage Canada, Transport 
Canada, to name just a few.
<P>
	When we refer to partnership, this means we also count on the 
collaboration of all stakeholders. I know that there will be a 
socio-economic summit at the end of this month in Quebec. In this 
regard, I will quote what the Prime Minister said this week when he 
spoke before the Montreal Chamber of Commerce. He said: 
``Premier Bouchard will host an economic summit. It is very 
important that tangible results come out of it for Montreal and the 
rest of Quebec''. This is what the Canadian government is: a 
partner with a vision, a partner that lends a hand and that is present.
<P>
<B>(1105)</B>
<P>
	In short, we play our part, for instance the way we did in 
Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean. I wish to emphasize, in closing, as the 
Prime Minister did so well this week, that there is something 
important we have to do and it is to get rid of this sword of 
Damocles, which we have over our heads at this time and has a 
damaging effect on Montreal as well as on the rest of Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ): </B>Madam 
Speaker, I want to thank the Secretary of State for his speech. He is 
aware of my concern about the situation in Montreal. I am very 
confident speaking about these issues since I am a Montrealer, born 
and bred in Hochelaga-Maisonneuve. I have always lived there 
and cannot imagine living anywhere else. However, I cannot say I 
share the optimism of the Secretary of State.
<P>
	There is something we should all remember. I am sure the 
Secretary of State is aware that a few days ago, the mayor of 
Montreal, who is not a Bloc member and has no sovereignist 
leanings, appeared before the committee on taxation. In his brief, 
and I am sure the Secretary of State had occasion to read it, the 
mayor reminded us of an undisputable fact, which led the 
opposition to move the motion before the House on this opposition 
day. He reminded us that as a result of the government's neglect, 
and I would challenge anyone on the government benches to prove 
otherwise, today Montreal is the poverty capital of Canada.
<P>
	I may recall a quote from a report by a federal agency. In his 
brief, the mayor of Montreal said: ``A recent report by the 
Canadian-and I insist on the word Canadian-Council on Social 
Development shows that in Montreal, the poverty rate is at 22 per 
cent, the highest of any Canadian city. According to the report, in 
Montreal one child out of five lives in poverty''. I am not the kind 
of political demagogue who believes that poverty is the 
individual's fault. That is not what we are discussing today.
<P>
	Will the Secretary of State admit that a number of measures 
deliberately introduced by his government have helped to make 
Montreal a city where poverty is widespread? I am referring to the 
unemployment insurance, now employment insurance reform. In 
Quebec, both the Fortin report and the Bouchard report indicated 
there was a connection between the reform and the fact that people 
were going on welfare. Will the Secretary of State rise in the House 
to tell us that the government admits that this kind of measure is 
helping to pauperize Montreal?
<P>
	Finally, I would like to quote from the red book, which has now 
become the black book for Montreal, in which the government 
made three promises. I would like to hear what the Secretary of 
State has to say on the subject. It said that the government would 
promote the use of community groups and partnerships to 
revitalize local economies. Would the Secretary of State agree that 
the proposed reform in which he was very much involved has 
helped to pauperize Montreal?
<P>
	The red book also referred to revitalizing the housing industry 
through a renovation program that would be of particular benefit to 
old neighbourhoods. That is all very well, but today, the federal 
government is not putting a cent into subsidized housing. It has 
withdrawn completely. Will the Secretary of State work actively in  

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5653"> 5653 </A></B>
<P>
his caucus on obtaining compensation for Montreal? That is my 
question, and I ask it as a friend.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cauchon (Outremont, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to answer the question asked by my colleague for 
Hochelaga-Maisonneuve. with whom I had the opportunity to 
work this summer. I will come back to this.
<P>
<B>(1110)</B>
<P>
	The mayor of Montreal was mentioned earlier. I must say that 
the mayor of Montreal is exceptionally co-operative as far as the 
intervention strategy is concerned. He is a man who does a great 
deal for his region, who is committed and with whom we work very 
well because he also understands that we can develop the 
metropolitan area in partnership.
<P>
	I listen to the members of the official opposition and, what I like 
about the question of the member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve is 
that he has given me the opportunity to be more specific. When one 
talks about the fifth intervention in the area of economic and social 
development at the local and community level, my colleague 
knows very well that the Canadian government is one of the major 
partners in the metropolitan area in terms of respect of the 
community development, of intervention, of partnership.
<P>
	Think of the CDEC network, think of the pilot project conducted 
jointly with the Minister of Finance. The Réseau Centre-Sud has 
just been established in order to be able to adapt 
development-after the disappearance of some big corporations in 
about 20 years-to adapt development to regional realities. I say to 
the Member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, think of the Société de 
développement Angus.
<P>
	This summer, I received a call from my colleague who was 
asking me to see what can be done in his region in terms of 
revitalization or local development, but always in a perspective of 
tourist or cultural economic development.
<P>
	That is what the Government of Canada can and must do, and 
that is what we did together. We visited his community together, 
meeting with stakeholders. He knew very well that the Government 
of Canada had not only the structure and the capacity, but also the 
necessary concern about the various neighbourhoods of the 
metropolitan area, because such is our role.
<P>
	That is why I want to conclude by saying to the official 
opposition that, in statistical terms, we are far past the stage of the 
drawing board. It seems to me the the strategy of the members 
opposite is to slow down government action which has proved 
effective in the past in the greater Montreal region, and which will 
remain effective, because we are eager to work for the benefit of 
the everybody in the metropolitan region and in Quebec, as well as 
in the rest of Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I want 
to ask a question and make a comment. I hope the secretary of state 
will pay close attention.
<P>
	If he is to be believed, the federal government is doing 
everything for Montreal. What a lot of rhetoric. He said we are way 
beyond the drawing board or the planning stage, statistics are 
irrelevant now.
<P>
	I would like to ask the secretary of state a few questions. Given 
the statistics we heard earlier, it is clear that every time Montreal 
gives a dollar to Ottawa, Ottawa returns $0.75 to Montreal. That 
means Montreal is receiving three quarters for each dollar it pays.
<P>
	The secretary of state will have to admit that, according to 
Statistics Canada, and its figures should be reliable, all those 
accomplishments he just listed are nothing but a description of the 
way those three quarters are spent. What about the fourth one? Is it 
that generosity, that charity, called equalization? Montrealers do 
not want charity; they want jobs.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. de Savoye:</B> Thank you, dear colleagues.
<P>
	So, essentially, the secretary of state is promising strategic 
action, an action plan, is explaining the past, but is he ready to 
commit yourself, before the House, his colleagues and the public, 
to spend that fourth quarter in Montreal, so that next year Statistics 
Canada will be able to say that 25 per cent of all Canadian 
expenditures have been made in Quebec and that Montreal got its 
full and fair share? Or will there be, one year from now, another 
official opposition day when we will once again stand in this House 
and say that Montreal is once again not getting its share? I await his 
answer.
<P>
<B>(1115)</B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> The hon. 
member has only 30 seconds to answer.
<P>
	<B>Mr. de Savoye:</B> Then, is it yes or no?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cauchon:</B> Briefly, in 30 seconds, we are asked to promise to 
get involved. We are not promising to get involved because we are 
already actively involved in the metropolitan area and have been 
for a long time.
<P>
	I did not like the fact my colleague talked about spending money 
in the metropolitan area. The Canadian government does not spend 
money in the metropolitan area and throughout Canada, it invests. 
This is the way we look at it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to speak to the Bloc's motion on the current economic 
situation in Montreal. This is one of those times when I feel I do not 
belong, being part of a different family, but that I must still take 
part in their debate. Anyhow, the motion reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5654"> 5654 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House recognize Montreal as the economic mainspring of Quebec society 
and, therefore, condemn the federal government's lack of concrete initiatives in 
supporting the Montreal area economy, primarily-</BLOCKQUOTE>
It then lists several particular areas in which the federal 
government has failed.
<P>
	I notice that we are dealing here with the Montreal area, where 
the support for the Bloc is not as strong as in the rest of Quebec. 
This may not be pure coincidence, but I believe that there is here 
reason enough to blame both the federal government and the 
sovereignist movement. If I may, I intend to move an amendment 
later on reflecting my point of view and my party's to the effect that 
both sides are to be blamed for their policy with regard to this 
economic crisis.
<P>
[English] 
<P>
	What has happened to Montreal? When I was a young boy 
growing up in Toronto, Montreal was a substantially larger city 
than Toronto and was recognized in Toronto at the time as being the 
economic centre of Canada.
<P>
	Before I was a teenager all of that had changed and today in 
Montreal, which I visit frequently, one can see on each visit the 
gradual decline in the economic importance of that beautiful and 
important city. One can see evidence of decline in its infrastructure, 
the growth of unemployment and the decline of employment 
opportunities. One can see evidence of the decline of business and 
the shift of growth and economic activity and opportunity outside 
of Montreal, particularly to Toronto, but also in some cases to other 
parts of Canada.
<P>
	No doubt today we will be treated with arguments which are 
basically the following from the federalist side. I am a federalist. 
However, we shall hear from the Liberal side that the separatist 
movement is solely responsible for the decline in Montreal and for 
the economic uncertainty it faces and that the sovereignty 
movement has chased away any economic prosperity and activity.
<P>
	I often point out to the people in western Canada that the 
separatists will say: ``Look at what being part of the federation has 
done to Montreal over the past 30 years''. I think there is a lot of 
insincerity on both sides of the debate. The separatists never want 
to use the word independence to describe their proposals for the 
province of Quebec, economic independence and economic 
separation from the rest of Canada, as the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs has noted. Also some of the federalists 
in the province of Quebec today do not seem to want to say the 
word province to describe their view of Quebec's position in 
Canada. They want distinct society or whatever the latest buzzword 
is to get the separatist vote.
<P>
	Both, in blaming each other, are right. There is an old quote by a 
political scientist which says that in a democratic system both 
major parties-speaking here of the province of Quebec-spend 
most of their time trying  to prove that the other is incompetent and 
unworthy of government. Both succeed and both are usually right. 
That may apply in this case.
<P>
<B>(1120)</B>
<P>
	I am not terribly interested in taking sides on this other than if 
push came to shove I would certainly vote against this motion. We 
certainly do not see anything in the separatist proposals, either 
economic, constitutional or political, that would resolve any of the 
difficulties. Clearly they have worsened it.
<P>
	Let me digress on some of the difficulties that Montreal faces 
and some of the reasons for its decline. I will make some reference 
to a paper that has recently been written by Professor John Richards 
of Simon Fraser University entitled ``Language matters: ensuring 
that the sugar not dissolve in the coffee''.
<P>
	Professor Richards was at one time a social democrat or 
socialist. I think he still calls himself that but increasingly his 
friends in the New Democratic Party do not. He has been labelled a 
budding conservative, although that may be premature.
<P>
	Professor Richards has asked me on numerous occasions to write 
something about the situation in Quebec and I promised him that 
and I have yet to deliver. I promised to review this paper he has 
written for the C.D. Howe Institute.
<P>
	His argument is worth examination, and that is what I am doing, 
that the provinces generally, but Quebec specifically, should have 
enhanced jurisdiction over language as part of a solution to the 
national unity problem. That is perhaps in a different form part of 
the Reform Party's own proposals.
<P>
	He does make reference on page 3 of his paper to the following:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-the Quebecois want provincial legislation to promote French and, to some extent, 
to limit the use of English.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Their Charte de la langue francaise (Charter of the French Language) most often 
still called Bill 101 although it was enacted in 1977, has done the job. It has 
strengthened the status of French as the working language in the province, preserved 
Montreal as a predominantly francophone metropolis, and confirmed that French 
remain the dominant language in the school system. Bill 101 has been controversial 
but necessary.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is mentioning something in the very narrow context of 
language policy but I think more significant is what is not 
mentioned here. It is quite arguable that the success of Bill 101, of 
nationalist policies and nationalist language policies specifically, 
has not really been to strengthen French in Montreal but in fact to 
weaken English in Montreal, to be part of a massive exodus we 
have seen of English language people and allophones outside of the 
province of Quebec, taking with them much of the economic 
activity they have generated, both capital and labour.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5655"> 5655 </A></B>
<P>
	The consequence has been a dilemma for all Quebecers, not just 
for separatists, in the attempt to make Montreal an entirely French 
city or to encourage Montreal as a French city as opposed to an 
English city or a bilingual city. It has meant the decline of 
Montreal as a national, international and particularly a continental 
centre. This is the great dilemma.
<P>
	Those who want to preserve, protect and strengthen the role of 
Montreal as the francophone capital of Canada have no answer to 
the problem of how they will stop the decline of Montreal as a 
centre that has economic importance outside of the province of 
Quebec. This is certainly a dilemma for the separatist movement 
but is also a dilemma for nationalist movements that are nominally 
on the federalist side. If I have time I will make some mention of 
those later.
<P>
<B>(1125)</B>
<P>
	This is a dilemma. It is at the heart of the decline of Montreal as 
an economic centre.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This is not my own theory. I will give as an example an article 
written by William Coffey and Mario Polèse for the publication 
<I>Recherches sociographiques</I>. It is entitled ``The Decline of the 
Montreal Empire. An Overview of the Economic Situation in a 
Changing Metropolis''.
<P>
	Here is an excerpt:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>For the past three decades, the Montreal economy has taken a nosedive, resulting 
in the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs. Cut off from its Canadian imperial 
economic hinterland, Montreal is reduced to being merely Quebec's metropolis.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This article is more optimistic than many others, even though it 
makes reference to the same problem I mentioned.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	There is, however, no doubt that decline has happened, whatever 
one believes the cause of the decline is. Let me also be very 
specific about this by mentioning some facts which are reported in 
various publications that one can read on a monthly basis.
<P>
	<I>Maclean's</I> magazine indicates that during the 1980s the 
population in the Montreal region grew by a modest 9.6 per cent. 
Toronto expanded by 22.1 per cent. Vancouver grew by 25.2 per 
cent. The number of jobs in Montreal between 1971 and 1991 
increased 60 per cent, but well behind Vancouver, Toronto, Ottawa, 
Edmonton and Calgary, all of which saw jobs grow by more than 
100 per cent in the same period.
<P>
	Let us look at some recent economic statistics. Here I quote the 
Toronto <I>Star</I>. The unemployment rate in Toronto in recent months 
is 2 to 3 percentage points below Montreal. Frankly, that is a fairly 
narrow gap compared to what we have seen in recent years.
<P>
	Employment as a percentage of adult population was 5 per cent 
lower in Montreal. The percentage of the population below the 
poverty line in 1994 was 17 per cent in Toronto and 25 per cent in 
Montreal, the economic engine of Quebec.
<P>
	Housing starts were up 9 per cent in Toronto and down 9 per cent 
in Montreal. Bankruptcies are double in Montreal what they were 
in Toronto. Consumer bankruptcies are about 25 per cent higher. 
There is slower growth in sales as the economy recovers.
<P>
	These are all substantial and significant pieces of evidence of the 
relative weakness of the Montreal economy. Nobody should deny 
that, not the Liberals, not the separatists, not the federal 
government and not the provincial government.
<P>
	There are always explanations offered by separatists who try to 
blame entirely the federalist side. Some of them are more far 
fetched than others. One is mentioned in an article.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It is an article which describes the sovereignist perspective on 
the economy of Quebec and Montreal. It says ``the incompetence 
of Mr. Jean Chrétien is reason enough to worry investors'', writes 
Mr. Roy in <I>L'Action nationale</I>. He also mentions several reasons in 
the sovereignist perspective, including the role of the air 
transportation sector and he compares Canadian Airlines and Air 
Canada. In his article about what might worry investors, Mr. Roy 
does not mention what we find time and time again in polls, that is 
that sovereignty, the next referendum and the separatist movement 
is what worries them.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	He does mention the role of Air Canada versus Canadian 
Airlines. I give this as one of the more far fetched examples. The 
supposed favouritism of the federal government for Canadian 
Airlines, which is based in Calgary and Vancouver to a lesser 
extent, over Air Canada, which is based in Montreal and Toronto to 
a lesser extent, is given as a reason.
<P>
<B>(1130 )</B>
<P>
	First I should mention that very few people at Canadian Airlines 
believe this and I know that for a fact. However, let us not forget 
the facts here. Whatever separatists or others want to pick at as a 
particular incident, the reality is that the existence of Air Canada as 
a corporation based in Montreal is entirely the consequence of the 
federal government having basically created and funded that 
corporation for decades and then by legislation placed its head 
office in the city of Montreal. There is no such parallel for 
Canadian Airlines.
<P>
	Furthermore, I just have to mention these uncomfortable facts. 
For all the favouritism that  supposedly generated, Air Canada is in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5656"> 5656 </A></B>
<P>
fact making money. Canadian Airlines has not turned a profit since 
1988 and as we know is constantly under financial pressure.
<P>
	There are other facts and there are certainly failings of the 
federal government and federalists. There is demonstrable and 
researched uncertainty, it has been said over and over again by the 
business community of Montreal, about the next referendum and 
the sovereignty movement.
<P>
	There is as well the particular problem of the language wars and 
the language legislation. This summer the premier of Quebec, Mr. 
Bouchard, was personally involved and responsible for heating that 
up. We had some protests in Montreal about English language 
customers in English language areas of Montreal demanding from 
English language businesses service in English to be completely 
acceptable under the laws of the province of Quebec. Yet Mr. 
Bouchard jumped into the debate and with elements of the Parti 
Quebecois threatened to once again raise the issue of further 
language legislation and debate.
<P>
	It is important to point out to people outside Quebec that this was 
contrary to the wishes of virtually all Quebecers. This was not just 
the anglophones but the vast majority of francophones, including 
most francophones who actually supported the sovereignty side in 
the referendum. This was once again the pet project of a particular 
element of the separatist movement. The federal government is not 
all to blame.
<P>
	In this regard let me mention the tax burden in the province of 
Quebec. A major reason that people often live in Ottawa as 
opposed to the Outaouais is the tax burden at both levels of 
government. Let me mention some facts on this which are not 
arguable. These are not reasons for the economic performance of 
Montreal.
<P>
	The combined federal-provincial top marginal tax rate in Quebec 
is 52.94 per cent which is the third highest in the country. Quebec 
payroll taxes are 4.26 per cent, the highest in the country. 
Non-financial corporation capital tax is 0.64 per cent, the highest in 
the country. Gasoline taxes are the highest in the country. Interest 
rates on provincial bonds demanded by the international 
investment community are the highest in the country.
<P>
	In the time that remains let me mention in all fairness to the 
sovereignty movement some of the failures of the federalists and of 
the federal government because these are important. On the 
provincial level, let us not forget that the Liberal Party was 
supposedly a federalist party that governed Quebec for part of the 
period of this decline. It has often pushed the same kind of 
damaging nationalist policies that we see from the Parti Quebecois. 
It is the same type of financial mismanagement as we have seen 
from the federal Liberals in Ottawa over the past generations. 
Therefore that side is not blameless.
<P>
	I might even point out that I have questioned many times even 
giving that party the title of a federalist party. The Quebec Liberal 
Party certainly wants Quebec to remain part of Canada but it also 
supports the idea that there is a unilateral right to separate. This 
would be six of one, and half a dozen of another.
<P>
	Let us look specifically at the economic philosophy of the 
federal government. This federal government in the classic style of 
a centralist party that governs without vision and principle but only 
on the basis of power and patronage brags about the kind of 
largesse it can dispense to various Canadians. There is no shortage 
of its bragging about the kind of largesse it has often dispensed in 
the province of Quebec. This is well documented. I can point to 
studies by Professor Mansell at the University of Calgary in which 
I participated.
<P>
<B>(1135)</B>
<P>
	It is interesting to note the nature of these things: subsidies, 
unemployment insurance, equalization payments, social assistance 
in all forms. It is never what the Reform Party or others have 
proposed. It is never the idea that we should have a competitive 
economy, that we should lighten the tax burden, that we should 
make sure that economic opportunity is available to all Canadians, 
that we should lighten the load of the federal government, bring 
decentralization to the country. Unfortunately I am not going to 
have time to elaborate on these things.
<P>
	What is generally interesting is that the parts of the country that 
have benefited from these Liberal programs, massive movements 
of money across the country, are the have not provinces. The 
question to really ask over time is, are they getting this money 
because they are have not provinces, or are they have not provinces 
because of these economic policies? Instead of exploiting their 
natural advantages and the dynamism that is possible in the 
resource base of those economies, they have been reduced to 
economies that operate on subsidy through the various regional 
development offices and through social assistance.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance, a Quebecer, yesterday condemned the 
Reform Party saying its policies would deny welfare to single 
mothers. Perhaps its policies would offer a job to single mothers so 
they would not need welfare. That always escapes the Liberal Party 
in this kind of thinking.
<P>
	In conclusion, I would like to move an amendment. I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the amendment be amended by adding the following after the word ``the'', 
``separatist threat is hampering the''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleague, I will take this amendment under 
advisement and I will render a decision on it in just a short while.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5657"> 5657 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ringma:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order, to help in your 
deliberations regarding the subamendment which was just 
proposed, I would like to direct your attention to a similar motion 
that is on today's Order Paper.
<P>
	On page 11 of today's Order Paper there is an amendment to the 
speech from the throne and it reads as follows:
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the following words be added to the Address:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``This House deplores that Your Excellency's advisers have demonstrated a lack 
of vision in the face of the fundamental issues confronting Canada and Quebec, such 
as job creation, better administration of public funds, the re-establishment of fiscal 
justice for all, the recognition of Montreal as the economic hub of Quebec society, 
the need to protect Quebec culture;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>and show a lack of sensitivity toward the poor by proposing a reform of the social 
programs that strikes at those who are unemployed or on welfare, as well as 
seniors and students;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>and show a total lack of understanding of the referendum results''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1140)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	There is also a subamendment by the member for Okanagan 
Centre. As listed on today's Order Paper, his subamendment reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the amendment be amended by adding after the words ``Quebec Society'' 
the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``and, in particular, recognition that it is the separatist movement in Quebec that 
threatens the economy of Montreal''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I would refer to Beauchesne's sixth edition, citation 580.(1): 
``The purpose of a subamendment-is to alter the amendment-.it 
should deal with matters that are not covered by the amendment''. 
And finally, citation 584.(2) states: ``A subamendment must be 
relevant to the amendment it purports to amend''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order, I think that the 
situation is fairly clear. A subamendment can only modify the 
amendment, and not the main motion.
<P>
	The proposed amendment, which was accepted this morning, 
reads as follows: ``the region of''. We could of course amend this 
amendment and, to this end, propose a subamendment. We could 
say: ``the beautiful region of'', ``the great region of''. But it must 
relate to the words, the ideas, the concept of the amendment. It 
cannot deal with the whole motion, only the amendment. A 
subamendment should seek to modify the amendment and not the 
main motion. This seems clear to me and I urge you, once you have 
read the amendment and reflected on it, to reject this initiative of 
the Reform Party.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I always thought the Reform member was a serious and 
informed man, and I am sorry to advise the House that I was 
mistaken. I think he is, to say the least, unacquainted with Quebec's 
situation, which the Reform Party has itself admitted to being, and 
I can reassure him today by telling him that, with such a statement, 
he can rest assured that his party will be considered to be many 
generations away from Quebec.
<P>
	The hon. member stood in this House, and showed a lack of 
consideration that had not been seen for a long time, to tell us that 
the cause of economic hardship in Montreal-we know that, as we 
are speaking, Montreal is one of the capitals of poverty-is the 
language situation, Bill 101 and, finally, that it is because a 
majority of people want to speak their language that things are 
going badly on the economic level.
<P>
	You will understand that the hon. member is just repeating the 
same old platitudes, the same obsolete approaches, which are not 
serious at all and are based on absolutely no analysis. I think what 
the hon. member must be reminded of is that there is a nation in 
Quebec. There are people who speak French, who control a 
territory, who have a history, who have a legal system, and that is 
called a nation. You know very well that a nation is destined to 
become sovereign.
<P>
	Having said that, if the hon. member wants to look up the history 
of this concept, I refer him to the recent regional commission and 
to the bill that was introduced in the national assembly. I speak 
about this with firsthand knowledge, because I was a member of 
that commission, and I have excellent memories connected with of 
it.
<P>
<B>(1145)</B>
<P>
	It was recognized that there is in Quebec an English speaking 
founding minority to which were conferred very specific rights 
over the control of a number of institutions. I know the hon. 
member is aware that it is possible to take courses in English from 
childhood to university in Quebec. It is possible to be served in 
English to obtain health services in Quebec. When it is rrequested 
specifically, it is also possible to receive correspondence from 
public authorities in English.
<P>
	What the hon. member did not understand is that we are saying 
that, collectively, we think a language is not insignificant. The 
common language of a nation is not something to be treated lightly, 
because it is a rallying code, an identity code. That is how we can 
communicate with one another.
<P>
	As sovereignists, we are for people speaking or understanding 
many languages-English, Chinese, Spanish, Portuguese. It was 
Montaigne who said that to learn a new language was to learn a 
new way of thinking. As parliamentarians, I believe we all agree 
with that.
<P>
	That said, our point is that our situation is not the same in 
Quebec as in Prince Edward Island, Saskatchewan or other

<P>
language of ours which is unique in North America. That is why the 
legislator passed Bill 101 and, later, Bill 178.
<P>
	I would like our hon. colleague to tell us whether he agrees that, 
since we are a nation enthusiastically moving toward sovereignty, 
the legislator acted responsibly in ensuring that French-speaking 
citizens in these parts of America can continue to do so in the next 
few years?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member claims I blamed 
Montreal's economic situation on Quebec's language situation. 
This is not true. I said it was one of the problems in Quebec's 
current economic situation.
<P>
	I repeat what I said. There are people in Quebec-not only the 
sovereignist movement, but also the Quebec Liberal Party-who 
think Quebec and Montreal should be French. The price of this 
policy is that Montreal's importance as an economic centre has 
declined in the rest of Canada and North America where the 
language is English. I am not saying that this policy is wrong or 
mistaken, but that it is the price to be paid.
<P>
	In my opinion, Montreal's strength as a city in Quebec, Canada 
and North America is that it is the only city of its size on this 
continent where Canada's both official languages are widely 
spoken. This is Montreal's strength. If the provincial government 
decides not to capitalize on this strength, it is one of the 
consequences it must accept. It cannot have it both ways.
<P>
	I should point out that, in this regard, sovereignty would make 
the situation worse than it is today. My friend mentioned that 
Quebec is a nation that should achieve sovereignty. I assume he is 
right. But I also see that, in the two referendums held in Quebec, 
the people made themselves heard and decided they were part of 
the Quebec nation, of course, but also of the Canadian nation. As I 
said several times, only through federalism can both sides of 
Quebec's personality be expressed.
<P>
<B>(1150)</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Martin Cauchon (Secretary of State (Federal Office of 
Regional Development-Quebec), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, you 
realize that we will oppose the resolution, because it is way too 
divisive. This resolution goes against any idea of partnership.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	With respect to my colleague from the Reform Party, I would 
like to mention, without going through all the details which he 
mentioned in his speech, that I am pleased to see that the Reform 
Party recognizes the economic problems that exist in the Montreal 
area. Of course the idea of an upcoming referendum in the province 
of Quebec does not help the Quebec economy. That was mentioned 
by the Prime Minister at the beginning of the week.
<P>
	I would like to remind my colleague from the Reform Party that 
we voted here in the House, with respect to the province of Quebec, 
on a resolution for a distinct society designation, which is 
important. That not only means something for the province of 
Quebec, it means something across Canada.
<P>
	We recognize the economic problems of metropolitan Montreal. 
The Canadian government is acting on those problems. Our action 
is one of vision. We are getting involved in five areas, which I will 
mention again: science and technology, international development, 
SMEs, culture and tourism, social and local economic 
development. We have been working hard with the province of 
Quebec, and with metropolitan Montreal, in those five areas.
<P>
	We are doing many things in the Montreal area, the Saguenay, 
Lac-Saint-Jean and many other regions of Quebec. We have done 
many things in cities across Canada: for example, Halifax, 
Moncton and Winnipeg. We are also doing things in other regions 
across Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Calgary West):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am not sure how to 
respond to that. It sounded more like an extension of the member's 
speech than a question put specifically to me.
<P>
	Let me repeat that Reform members do not doubt for a minute 
that the policies being pursued by the government in Quebec are 
also being pursued by it in other parts of the country. What we 
quarrel with is the appropriateness of those policies.
<P>
	Our governments do not need to be involved in giving large sums 
of money to major corporations, which also happen to contribute to 
the Liberal Party, in order to spur economic development. What the 
country really needs, for example, is a lighter tax burden. Take 
away the subsidies and lessen taxes, both in Quebec and in other 
regions of the country and the private economy could exploit the 
advantages which our resources and the North American market 
offer to us.
<P>
	It should be mentioned that Quebec was a leader, not just the 
federalists but also the separatists, in the free trade debate. They 
supported the extension of free trade and the economic 
opportunities that brings. Let us exploit the opportunities of a 
market economy rather than trying to do it through big government 
and corporate subsidies. That is one objection I have.
<P>
	I also have to mention the reference to the distinct society 
motion, which my party opposed and will continue to oppose. We 
will continue to say that the solution to this problem is not for 
so-called federalists in Quebec to walk around repeating separatist 
claims that the French language is in some kind of jeopardy in the 
province of Quebec, which it is not, and needs some kind of special 
status to protect it. We have said repeatedly that there are things 
which can be done to improve this federation, but putting separatist 
slogans in the Constitution is not the way to proceed.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5659"> 5659 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Separatists themselves recognize that the true distinct societies 
of this world sit at the United Nations. Quebec is a province of 
Canada. It fulfils an important role and its name must not be 
changed.

<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Before returning to debate I have been asked to 
rule on an amendment to the amendment. So that we are all dealing 
from the same spot, the motion stated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House recognize Montreal as the economic mainspring of Quebec 
society and-</BLOCKQUOTE>
The amendment was:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House recognize the region of Montreal as the economic mainspring of 
Quebec society and-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The amendment of course was acceptable.
<P>
	By adding the words after that this House recognize ``the 
separatist threat is hampering the region of Montreal as the 
economic mainspring of Quebec society and-'' in my view 
enlarges on the scope of the amendment and it should not.
<P>
	The hon. member from the Reform Party was very kind to give 
me his advice and I thank him for intervening. However, in my 
view this would enlarge the scope of the amendment. Therefore, it 
is not receivable.
<P>
	We will continue the debate.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is with 
anger that I will speak this morning to support my party's proposal. 
I am angry because the speech delivered by the Prime Minister to 
the Chamber of Commerce of Metropolitan Montreal is tainted 
with a dose of cynicism that is hurtful.
<P>
	When the Prime Minister stated, as quoted in this document, that 
we have a duty to target, as a priority, the problems of a city, he 
should have referred to a region with 675,000 poor, which is twice 
as many as in all of Atlantic Canada, a region where one 
unemployed Canadian in seven lives. When the Prime Minister 
says we have a duty to target the problem as a priority, he should 
remember what his government did to the poor, who are found in 
very large numbers in Montreal, since he took office.
<P>
	The fact is that his government did not target poverty, it targeted 
the poor. The employment insurance reform follows another UI 
reform. Together, these reforms will result in a shortfall of over 
$900 million for Quebec, almost $1 billion. In 2001, according to 
the government's own figures, the figure will reach $1.2 billion. 
Forty per cent of this $1.2 billion, that is at least $500 million per  
year, will be a huge shortfall in the fight against poverty in the 
Montreal region.
<P>
	In other words, the government decided to target the deficit by 
making the poor pay, and since there is a large concentration of 
poor people in Montreal, the city's contribution to reduce the 
deficit is greater than that of a lot of others.
<P>
	Have job creation projects been set up to make up for what is 
taken away from the poor?
<P>
<B>(1200)</B>
<P>
	We would have heard about them, because they made such a fuss 
over an $87 million loan. The attention given to this $87 million 
loan shows how little the government is doing in this city, in this 
area, which has the misfortune to hold the Canadian record for 
poverty.
<P>
	I would like to add, for the benefit of my colleague in the Reform 
Party who spoke earlier, that separatism is not the cause of all this. 
I would like to remind him that in 1962-63, for example, there was 
a commission in Quebec, the Boucher Commission, which looked 
at poverty. It concluded that the leading cause of poverty was the 
weakness of the Quebec economy at that time.
<P>
	What has federalism done since then, before there arose this 
nationalist movement of Quebecers, the majority of them raised in 
these poor neighbourhoods where these victims of poverty wanted 
to take control of their future? Anyone in Canada who fails to look 
at this aspect of the fight against poverty by Quebec's nationalist 
movement is missing the key to understanding a large part of the 
movement.
<P>
	I spoke about the cost of unemployment insurance, the Liberal 
cuts, the Liberals' gift to Montreal. This year, the cost is $400 
million and by the turn of the century, 1999, it will be $500 million.
<P>
	The Prime Minister cannot stand up and say, even with a smile 
on his face: ``We have a duty to give priority to the problem of a 
city where there are 675,000 people living in poverty''. But that is 
not all.
<P>
	If only the cuts were limited to unemployment insurance. But 
there were also large cuts in social transfer payments. These 
transfer payments were reduced by $7 billion over a period of two 
years, which leaves about $1.9 billion for the entire province of 
Quebec. Again, this means 40 per cent for the Montreal region, or 
more than $400 million.
<P>
	This shortfall affects health care, education and social 
assistance. But the worst part is, and we cannot repeat this often 
enough, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5660"> 5660 </A></B>
<P>
this Canada social transfer includes a dimension that should be 
criticized loud and clear. This Canada that is so anxious to meet the 
needs of its population, this Canada is changing by reducing 
equalization. That is what is happening. And it will become 
increasingly obvious, because without the resources that belong to 
the Canadian state, the city of  Montreal, the municipality and the 
region will have tremendous problems, even with the support of the 
Quebec government. That is why we want to have all our resources 
to deal with this situation.
<P>
	I repeat, the Canada social transfer is bringing about 
fundamental changes. Unfortunately, every recession sees an 
increasing number of people who must rely on social assistance to 
survive. This social assistance was 50 per cent funded by the 
Canada assistance plan.
<P>
	With the Canada social transfer that is no longer the case. When 
the conditions are renegotiated, something that is still pending 
because of pressure from other provinces, especially Ontario which 
also has a comparatively high poverty rate, and we understand 
those pressures, what will happen? The government will want to 
relegate Quebec to a role based on its population. Here again, 
Quebec will be alone in bearing the additional load of new welfare 
recipients who will arrive in a steady stream, since we know there 
will be another recession, especially with the economic measures 
to reduce the deficit, because these cuts are the result of offloading 
the deficit on the provinces, on Quebec and Montreal.
<P>
<B>(1205)</B>
<P>
	It is outrageous. I repeat, because of these changes, the deficit 
will be fought at the expense of the poorest in our society. What 
happens to the surplus in the unemployment insurance fund? What 
happens to this adjustment? People are talking about tax cuts for 
everyone, including the rich.
<P>
	That makes no sense at all. People in Quebec were already 
talking about what the federal government did not do, but they said 
that at least they had more unemployment insurance and social 
assistance. From now on, even that will no longer be true. For 
many people, sovereignty was not the only option. But 
increasingly, that is changing, and it is high time it did.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Martin Cauchon (Secretary of State (Federal Office of 
Regional Development-Quebec), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, when I 
listen to my colleague for Mercier, I note her rather amazing talent 
for painting a sombre picture of what the government has done, 
whereas these have been actions with concrete effects, extremely 
beneficial effects, for all of the people of Quebec and of Canada, 
and this is something my colleague for Mercier knows full well.
<P>
	When they refer to employment insurance they refer to cuts, but 
I want to speak to you of basic reforms, reforms called for by 
everyone in this country, as well as a good many international 
organizations.
<P>
	Employment insurance reform means that today people needing 
jobs can use this new program to gain access to tools, to means of 
acquiring additional skills for getting back into the work force. 
This is one of the elements, one of the goals of employment 
insurance reform.
<P>
	With the change from a system based on weeks worked to one 
based on hours worked, employment insurance reform will provide 
coverage to thousands of men and women who work part time. 
They will be able to draw benefits, which they cannot at present. 
Before, as my colleague has said, the existing system was based on 
areas. It is true that, over the past 20 years, certain companies have 
closed down. The economy of the metropolitan region is changing, 
as it is everywhere in Canada, as well as in a good number of G-7 
countries.
<P>
	We have answered the call, we were present and accounted for 
when needed. We worked with the CDECs in the metropolitan 
region, those grassroots bodies which work together in 
collaboration. Think of RESO and the Corporation de 
développement Angus already referred to. These are approaches 
we will be continuing to use. They already have the means, means 
that could do with some fine tuning, and I would just ask them to 
focus their efforts on that.
<P>
	Just think about the education issue, the tax agreements with the 
metropolitan region-two fundamental elements which come 
under their jurisdiction and where they have plenty to keep them 
busy.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Lalonde:</B> Mr. Speaker, I mentioned a $400 million a year 
reduction of benefits in one region. He counters with the 
employment insurance, saying that it will provide $200 million 
more a year throughout Canada, because of pre-existing active 
programming. The only difference between the employment 
insurance and the old active programming is that, from now on, the 
money will no longer come from the consolidated revenue fund, 
but from the unemployment insurance fund. Active programming 
did exist before.
<P>
	He then goes on saying that the federal government is involved 
in CDECs. An so it should. Despite this $400 million cut, despite 
the shortfalls in federal spending in Quebec, when Ontario was 
awarded a contract to build tanks, all the east end of Montreal got 
was a contract to repair old tanks.
<P>
<B>(1210)</B>
<P>
	The ones who have to watch what they are saying are people 
speaking on behalf of the Canadian government. They cannot just 
ramble on. People who live in poverty want to get out of it. The 
hon. member may not know what poverty means. I bet that some of 
his constituents who would like to work could tell him all about it. I 
am not saying that some may not want to, there may even be some 
among members. However, there are lots of people who want to 
work but cannot because there are no jobs.

<B><A NAME="5661"> 5661 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, could you please let me know when there will be only 
one minute left, because I am announcing right now that we will 
be moving an amendment.
<P>
	I am really convinced that the official opposition is taking on its 
responsibilities and is doing its job by apprising the House of the 
seriousness of the financial situation, and therefore the social 
situation, in Montreal; it is sounding an alarm that this government 
must hear.
<P>
	I want to talk about one characteristic in particular and that is the 
defense economy. Before that, however, let me remind you that 
people from outside this House, people who are not sovereignists 
and who were not elected under the Bloc Quebecois banner, are 
joining their voices to that of the official opposition today to 
express their concern over the situation in Montreal.
<P>
	Let me remind you that, a few days ago, the mayor of Montreal, 
who is after all the official spokesperson for his city, tabled a brief 
with the commission on taxation. In this brief, he presented several 
facts that government members should try to understand. If 
Standing Orders allowed me to be more specific I would do so, but 
I will resist temptation because, as you all know, I abide by the 
rules.
<P>
	The mayor quoted a recent Canadian Council on Social 
Development report stating that 22 per cent of all Montrealers are 
classified as poor and that, in Montreal, one child out of five does 
not get enough to eat. Furthermore, there is a problem with the 
rental housing stock because 60 per cent of all housing units were 
built before the sixties and now, it must be said that all the taxes 
Quebecers send to Ottawa are no longer applied to the maintenance 
and construction of social housing.
<P>
	Someone reminded us that employment growth is very slow in 
Montreal; Montreal is losing jobs, particulary in the manufacturing 
sector. Who among us, whether a member of government or of the 
opposition, could rise in the House today and speak seriously? I am 
not thinking about the few amusing comments that we heard earlier 
because you will admit that this is not the kind of talk we should be 
hearing. Who could rise and say that the federal government really 
took some significant measures in order to solve the critical 
situation prevailing in Montreal? It is so true.
<P>
	This debate today is not a device to garner popularity. We all 
stand to benefit from Montreal doing well. Montreal is my passion, 
my life, my city even since I was born. I have lived in Montreal all 
my life, always in the same neighbourhood. I will not go as far as to 
say that I lived in the same house all that time, I did not. But if there 
is someone in this House who is familiar with the back streets of 
Montreal, the sheds, the Olympic Stadium and the subway, it is 
yours truly.
<P>
	I know Montreal like the back of my hand. And today, I am not 
too pleased to see that Montreal has become a city of poverty, a city 
on the decline. We must recognize that, beyond the changing 
international circumstances the secretary of state keeps referring 
to, there were deliberate choices made that have undermined the 
economic vitality of Montreal.
<P>
<B>(1215)</B>
<P>
	Let me give a specific example. This way, the secretary of state 
will not complain later that I talked in generalities. He knows that I 
do my homework; rigour is a quality of mine he appreciates. I am 
telling him that what hurt Montreal was a decision made by a 
minister from Ontario, who deliberately chose to weaken the 
defence component of the Montreal economy.
<P>
	The secretary of state spoke earlier and he was right. I agree with 
one thing he said. Two in fact. The first one was when he said that I 
am a good MP and that I had invited him to come and visit my 
riding. I thank him for his support to the SIDAC Ontario 
merchants. L'économie de la défense? I have always thought that 
economic problems were non-partisan issues.
<P>
	The second thing he said that I agree with is that there is in 
Montreal a strong area that makes us proud, the aerospace industry, 
and that Montreal is the only region in Canada where airplanes and 
helicopters can be built from nose to tail so to speak, without 
having any part of the aircraft shipped in from outside. That was 
what we called the defence component of the economy, on which 
nearly 30,000 jobs were dependent in Montreal.
<P>
	This was one program we were benefiting from equitably. We 
rose time and time again in this House to complain about being 
treated unfairly. There was only one program in the history of the 
federal government where Quebec ever got its fair share and it was 
DIPP. This is not a venerial desease, it stands for Defence Industry 
Productivity Program.
<P>
	Fifty six per cent of the aerospace industry is concentrated in 
Quebec and in Montreal in particular. Quebec would usually 
receive about 50 per cent of program funds. We must keep in mind 
that, in good years, this program had a $300 million budget, of 
which Quebec would receive 50 or 51 per cent. Why? Because the 
flagship aerospace industry was based in Montreal.
<P>
	What did the Minister of Industry, who comes from Ontario, do 
when he realized this could benefit Montreal? He abolished the 
program to all intents and purposes. This year, DIPP has a $22 
million budget and, in 1998, it will cease to exist. Is this the kind of 
decisions the Secretary of State is proud of when he comes to 
Montreal to talk about federal support for that region?
<P>
	Does the Secretary of State agree with me that the defence 
industry will need help in the next few years? We need help. I want 
to be clear. I am asking the Secretary of State in a friendly, 
non-partisan way-because we are both from Montreal-to put in 
place a fund to help defence industries convert to civilian 
applications.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5662"> 5662 </A></B>
<P>
	What you do not know and I will tell you is that, if nothing 
is done within two years, 10,000 jobs will be lost in the defence 
industry in the greater Montreal area. DIPP could have been a way 
for the government to take concrete action and support industries 
that need help in converting to other uses.
<P>
	I am not shy. I went to see public officials. I went to that bastion 
of intellectual reflection that is Industry Canada, and I wish you 
had been with me. I asked industry officials to tell me what they 
thought of DIPP. They told me it was a great program.
<P>
	I have here documents I will not use. But I saw documents I 
could table anytime if the Secretary of State asked me to. 
According to these documents, every dollar spent on DIPP 
generates the following economic benefits: $25 in sales, $18 in 
exports, $4 in research and development. Industrial performance 
shows that the industry was successful in converting to more 
desirable applications. This allowed the industry to grow and be 
ranked sixth in the world. The aeronautical industry is recording 
trade surpluses.
<P>
	If nothing is done in Montreal, where the defence industry is 
concentrated, 10,000 jobs will be lost. If the Secretary of State is 
serious, he will take action. The conversion of the defence industry 
to civilian uses is important.
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
	We need market studies, we need help in finding niches, new 
products upstream or downstream of what we already produce. I 
hope I have been convincing in my serenity and that the Secretary 
of State will not turn a deaf ear.
<P>
I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the amendment be amended by adding immediately after the word ``of'' the 
following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``the Greater''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The amendment to the amendment is in order.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Martin Cauchon (Secretary of State (Federal Office of 
Regional Development-Quebec), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as regards 
defence industry conversion, the Canadian government took action 
a long time ago. The hon. member referred to the famous DIPP. 
This program is now called TPC, or Technology Partnerships 
Canada, and it also relates to the issues raised by the hon. member 
for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve. It gives very concrete results, as 
was hoped, and these results benefit the whole community.
<P>
	This dynamic and concrete initiative is part of Industry Canada's 
program, and we co-operate together. As you know, regional 
development officers are on Industry Canada's team, and we all 
work together regarding the point raised by the hon. member.
<P>
	As for defence industries, here are some examples of contracts 
awarded between April 1996 and now: ammunition purchase from 
SNC, $140 million; automated systems for low altitude air defence 
from Oerlikon, $62 million; DND uniforms from Logistik and 
Newcourt, $42 million; Spar Aerospace, $39 million for space 
program trinkets for Canadarm and RADARSAT; DND aircraft 
repair and overhaul by Allied Signal Aerospace, $22 million; 
Godfrey Aerospace, $16 million-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ménard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank Myriam Goodwin for having 
sent to the Secretary of State what he had to say about Industry 
Canada. The real issue is that there is currently no support fund for 
industry conversion.
<P>
	I challenge the Secretary of State to tell us today that Technology 
Partnerships Canada has actual funds available for feasibility 
studies, so that we can truly change production technologies. The 
fact is there is no such fund.
<P>
	In spite of the commitment made during the election campaign 
by the Prime Minister's team to allocate specific funds for 
conversion, this has not been done. Let me remind you that, if 
nothing is done, 10,000 jobs will be lost. We cannot remain 
impassive to this situation.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> We will return to the debate. I will now recognize 
the hon. member for Parry Sound-Muskoka. My colleague, 
before you begin, it is my understanding that you will be splitting 
your time with the hon. member for Winnipeg. You will have 10 
minutes and 5 minutes.
<P>
<B>(1225 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andy Mitchell (Parry Sound-Muskoka, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the member for Winnipeg 
St. James
<P>
	I am pleased to have an opportunity to talk on this opposition 
motion offered by the Bloc in respect of Montreal. I have no doubt 
that its suggestion that the economic situation in Montreal is 
critical is a reality. However, I firmly believe and I know most 
Canadians, most economists and most people who know how 
economies work believe that the analysis that the Bloc has put forth 
in its opposition motion is at best flawed.
<P>
	The situation in Montreal today is caused in large part because of 
the political uncertainty that exists in that province and in that city. 
If Bloc Quebecois members want to know why Montreal is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5663"> 5663 </A></B>
<P>
suffering economically today, I suggest they and their PQ cousins 
look themselves clearly in the mirror and they shall see the enemy.
<P>
	For the economy in Montreal, in Quebec and indeed for the 
Canadian economy in general to prosper and move forward we 
need political stability. That means that  this experiment, this 
flawed idea of sovereignty must be put aside. For Montreal to 
prosper as a community, for it to serve as the engine of the Quebec 
economy, political stability has to be brought to that province. The 
constant and continual constitutional debates must come to an end. 
The Quebec government must, as this government does, focus its 
energy on the economy, on job creation and on seeing the economy 
move forward. If it wants to identify a problem that is where it 
should be looking.
<P>
	As part of the specific comments that were made in that motion, 
I am going to take the opportunity to talk a little about Natural 
Resources Canada and its R and D investment. I have the 
opportunity of serving as the chair of that committee. I know 
Natural Resources Canada is going to continue to fund energy 
research and development activities, those that are expected to 
generate benefits in the short and medium term. We are also not 
going to abandon the long term activities. We are placing a priority 
on research and development activities that will address critical 
long term issues like climate change and will be doing that sooner 
rather than later.
<P>
	The natural resources portfolio of this government is doing a 
great deal of work. It is setting research and development as a 
priority. We see things across Canada. We see things like the oil 
sands where we are working to have sustainable development of 
the Alberta oil sands. We are looking at the area of energy 
efficiency where we are working to create alternative sources of 
energy which create no pollution. These are the priorities of 
Natural Resources Canada and they demonstrate that we are in fact 
investing in research and development in this country.
<P>
	There is a great and lengthy story that I could espouse about in 
Natural Resources Canada's development activities, but I want to 
be more specific about the motion before us today. I want to point 
out very clearly that the investments that Natural Resources 
Canada is making are not just in western Canada, eastern Canada or 
Ontario; they are right across the country. No one would know it 
from reading this motion, but these investments are happening in 
the province of Quebec as well.
<P>
	Natural Resources Canada is working on the advanced houses 
program, including two in Quebec, and is just completing its one 
year public demonstration period. These houses deal with the 
whole issue of air quality requirements. These are houses in which 
we are dealing with the whole issue of air quality requirements. We 
are looking at an advanced housing program that will see better and 
more efficient homes built in this country. This project is 
happening across Canada. It is happening in Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1230)</B>
<P>
	The expertise assembled at the Natural Resources Canada energy 
diversification research laboratory at Varennes, Quebec, was 
instrumental in the European space agency's award to EDRL of a 
$100,000 contract to  evaluate the potential of advanced heat 
pumping technologies in space applications. That is happening in 
the province of Quebec.
<P>
	Natural Resources Canada with Environmental Canada and the 
Government of Quebec funded a field trial of the combustion of old 
tires in a cement container at the St. Constant, Quebec, cement 
plant of Lafarge Canada. Again, that is new technology which is 
working to protect our environment. It is investment in research 
and development by Natural Resources Canada and it is happening 
in the province of Quebec.
<P>
	Natural Resources Canada is working with the École 
Polytechnique at the University of Montreal and Canadian gas 
utilities to develop an energy efficient process which uses natural 
gas to reduce organic contamination in industrial waste water. That 
is important research and development that continues to occur in 
this country and it is occurring in the province of Quebec.
<P>
	At Laval University's hydro-turbine test laboratory, Natural 
Resources Canada supported the development of a 120 kilowatt 
tubular S-turbine which has now been licensed for international 
manufacturing and marketing. Again, that is sound research 
development into future energy needs and it is taking place in the 
province of Quebec.
<P>
	The suggestion that the Bloc is trying to make, that we are taking 
one part of the country and playing it off against another part of the 
country, is totally absurd. That is not what the government is doing. 
It is what the party on the other side of the House is trying to do. It 
is trying to play one part of Canada against the other. It is trying to 
play one part of Quebec against another part of Quebec.
<P>
	It is clear on the research and development aspect that the 
government has not favoured one part of the country over another. 
The Minister of Natural Resources has had to make some tough 
decisions in this fiscal climate. She has had to govern. The Minister 
of Natural Resources has had to make those hard choices which any 
government is required to make. She has made them understanding 
what sound fiscal management is all about. She has made them 
understanding what leadership is all about. She understands that 
governing is for all of Canada. She understands that she must make 
decisions which are in the best interests of all Canadians.
<P>
	The ministers that make up the government, and the Prime 
Minister in particular, understand their obligation to the whole 
country. That obligation is not just to Ontario, the prairies or the 
maritimes, and it is not just to Quebec, it is to the whole country.
<P>
	The province of Quebec, as all other provinces in Canada, has 
the opportunity within this great nation to move forward. The 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5664"> 5664 </A></B>
<P>
province of Quebec has, the province  of Ontario has, the east and 
the west in Canada have as well.
<P>
	As an individual who represents a riding in rural Ontario, I can 
say that I resent the insinuation in the motion that the government 
is ignoring its obligation in one part of the country. That simply is 
not true. The government recognizes its obligation to all parts of 
the country, including the province of Quebec. It has exercised that 
obligation in a sound manner. It has exercised its obligation 
showing leadership, making tough decisions when they have been 
required, but always remembering that we are one nation from 
coast to coast to coast. We govern that way and we govern that way 
effectively.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
carefully to the speech made by my hon. colleague opposite. If we 
believe what he said, things could not be any better. So, why have 
not only his government but the previous federal government and 
all the governments during the last 30 years allowed the economic 
situation in Montreal to deteriorate? It did not happen overnight, it 
occurred over a certain period of time.
<P>
	We only have to think about the Borden line which closed down 
three refineries in eastern Montreal. About Mirabel airport that 
reduced traffic in Dorval without increasing its own, which 
explains why air traffic shifted to Toronto.
<P>
	Earlier, I heard the hon. member put the blame on the political 
instability and so on. In 1966, it was a federalist and not a separatist 
government that was in office in Quebec, as far as I know. And in 
1976, Mr. Bourassa ran into trouble with the Borden line, which led 
to the closure of three refineries.
<P>
	In 1984, Mr. Bourassa was re-elected and remained in office 
until 1994. Of course, we had Mr. Johnson the last few months but 
all these Quebec leaders supported federalism. Meanwhile, 
Montreal was getting poorer and poorer. To argue that the 
sovereignty issue or political instability was at the origin of 
Montreal's problems is totally wrong.
<P>
	In fact, let us examine these things clearly. Canada has a free 
trade agreement with Israel. As far as I know, people are not 
throwing rocks or firing machine guns off in the streets of 
Montreal, but such things do happen every day in Jerusalem. So, 
please, do not bring up the issue of political instability.
<P>
	We are talking about helping Montreal with some investment. 
We know that the government opposite donated $11 million to 
Vietnam. Vietnam is a fine country, I agree, but let us not forget 
that Montreal is the poorest city in our country. Montreal needs $7 
million  for the Tokamak project to go on. Can the hon. member tell 
me why his government seems to prefer Vietnam to Montreal?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> Mr. Speaker, in his question and comments the 
hon. member requires that I repeat a couple of the things I said in 
my speech. If he wants to stand in this House and say through the 
television cameras to the people of Quebec and to the people of 
Montreal that the political climate and the political instability 
brought to that province through of the pursuit of the sovereignty 
option has absolutely no impact on the economy of Quebec, then he 
can say that. There is not an economist, not a reasonable person in 
Quebec or anywhere else in Canada or the world that believes that.
<P>
	If the hon. member is going to suggest to me that the political 
climate in Quebec is conducive to economic activity, he is just 
plain wrong because it is not. In order to have an economy grow, 
move forward and create jobs it needs to have political stability.
<P>
	The member forgets something else. Economies operate within a 
market system. They are not dictated simply by what the provincial 
government in Quebec City does. They are not simply affected by 
what a federal government might do in Ottawa. They are dictated in 
this country in large part by the markets within which we operate. 
Those markets are affected by external factors.
<P>
	One of those factors is the political stability within which that 
market operates. Until that political stability is brought into line, 
until that sovereignty option is put aside and the concentration is on 
the economy in Quebec there will continue to be economic 
problems in that part of this country.
<P>
<B>(1240 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Harvard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
let me begin by describing the principles of the Department of 
Public Works and Government Services' procurement process. It 
will make it obvious that the member for Roberval's motion is 
unsubstantiated. It will also make it clear that as the federal 
government's main contracting arm and the largest purchasing 
organization in Canada, the Department of Public Works and 
Government Services is committed to-I want to say this with all 
clarity-an open, fair and competitive procurement process that 
respects its commitments under international and national trade 
agreements.
<P>
	The department annually issues 80,000 contracts worth almost 
$8 billion through a procurement process that is transparent, fair 
and open. The fairness and integrity of the process is rarely 
challenged.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5665"> 5665 </A></B>
<P>
	In its day to day operations, openness, fairness and competition 
are the guiding principles for how the department does business 
with suppliers and contractors. Its approach is a very practical and 
visible example of the government's commitment to governing 
with integrity.
<P>
	One might ask how this is done. First, the department competes 
contracts. In other words, bids are invited on a competitive basis 
and contracts are let on a competitive basis. It does not allocate 
them on a share basis to particular regions. Second, the department 
provides fair access to government business through open and 
competitive bidding opportunities. Third, its procurement policies 
ensure equal and fair access to competitive bidding opportunities 
for potential suppliers from all regions of Canada.
<P>
	I have a few words about contracting statistics and why they are 
not a reliable indicator of economic benefit. The contracting 
statistics produced by the Department of Public Works and 
Government Services reflect the billing address of suppliers. 
However, it is clear that a supplier's address does not necessarily 
reflect economic activity.
<P>
	For example, large national oil firms are likely to process all 
federal sales through an Ottawa mailing address but we all know 
there is no oil production or refining here in Ottawa. There are 
many examples of this nature which is why it is futile to examine 
contracting statistics as a means of evaluating economic benefits.
<P>
	It is accurate to say that procurement is probably the most 
scrutinized activity of government. It is scrutinized not only by 
Parliament but also by Treasury Board, the Auditor General of 
Canada, the Canadian International Trade Tribunal, disappointed 
suppliers, the news media and taxpayers.
<P>
	I assure the House that the Department of Public Works and 
Government Services' procurement system operates with the 
highest level of integrity. I emphasize that within the department, 
great efforts are always made to ensure that the procurement 
system is a transparent one and that we are accountable for our 
decisions. Important illustrations of this are open bidding, our 
supplier promotion program and the bid challenge mechanism 
offered by the Canadian International Trade Tribunal.
<P>
	Open bidding is the key to helping Canadian firms do business 
with the Government of Canada. Open bidding opens up the 
purchasing needs of federal departments and agencies to suppliers 
that then decide for which requirements they want to compete. I 
emphasize that the decision on whether to compete or not rests with 
suppliers.
<P>
	At the heart of open bidding is the open bidding service, often 
referred to as OBS, an electronic bulletin board that publicly 
advertises bidding opportunities for suppliers. The OBS is 
accessible with a personal computer and modem from anywhere in 
Canada. Users can log on a DOS or Windows basis and via the 
Internet. This information is also available in paper format in a 
publication called ``Government Business Opportunities'' for those 
suppliers without computers.
<P>
	Equal access to business opportunities is one of the guiding 
principles of Department of Public Works and Government 
Services' open bidding system. The system is open to all Canadian 
firms, large or small, 24 hours a day and it operates in both official 
languages. The department is continually striving to improve the 
service. In fact, it views the open bidding service very much as a 
work in progress, one that has come a long way since it was 
introduced in 1989.
<P>
<B>(1245)</B>
<P>
	Today more than 27,000 subscribers use the OBS to obtain 
consistent, timely information on federal government and other 
public procurement opportunities. A recent OBS subscriber survey 
shows that 90 per cent of subscribers rate the service as good or 
very good which tells me that the people using the system like it.
<P>
	The OBS is just one of the ways in which we are working to 
make the procurement system as accessible, fair and effective as 
possible for all Canadian businesses.
<P>
	I should also emphasize that promoting competition, providing 
greater access to business and ensuring fairness in public sector 
procurement opportunities are the principles at the heart of this 
country's agreement on internal trade which has been signed by all 
provinces, including Quebec, and the two territories.
<P>
	The key part of the agreement on internal trade deals with 
improvements to government procurement. These improvements 
commit all 10 provinces and the two territories not to discriminate 
on the basis of province of origin or nature of business.
<P>
	I trust that I have been able to make clear that the notion of a 
regional fair share of federal procurement is a misguided one. That 
is not the way we operate. That said, we recognize the important 
role that procurement plays in creating jobs and growth here in 
Canada. Wherever feasible, within the confines of agreements such 
as the World Trade Organization agreement and NAFTA, regional 
benefits are given a high priority when evaluating bids for major 
government projects.
<P>
	Assisting Canadian suppliers large and small to do business with 
the federal government is a key activity in the Department of 
Public Works and Government Services. The main tool used to 
accomplish this is the supplier promotion program. Each year this 
program holds seminars in all parts of Canada giving participants 
practical pointers on marketing to the government and putting them 
in touch with key departmental contacts. Last year 170 seminars 
were held throughout the country.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5666"> 5666 </A></B>
<P>
	In addition, the supplier promotion program has fax sheets 
available, written in plain, clear language on a variety of topics 
including the open bidding service, free trade and much more. A 
booklet called ``Your Guide to doing Business with PWGSC'' is 
also available. The booklet provides basic information on doing 
business with the department. Today this wealth of information 
and a list of upcoming seminars is available 24 hours a day, seven 
days a week to anyone with Internet access.
<P>
	Let me return again to the principle of integrity. As well as being 
a cornerstone of how the government operates, integrity in 
procurement is also a reflection of the international marketplace. 
Our international trade obligations require that our government 
procurement practices and transactions be fair and be seen to be 
fair. There must be equal access to information about procurement 
opportunities, clear rules on how the process is conducted and there 
must be an independent appeal mechanism for suppliers seeking 
redress.
<P>
	The Canadian International Trade Tribunal, known as CITT, is 
Canada's third party appeal mechanism established to hear 
complaints from suppliers who believe that they have not been 
treated fairly during any stage of the procurement process for 
federal government requirements.
<P>
	The CITT has the right to issue subpoenas and to make awards to 
suppliers in cases where a supplier's complaint is validated by the 
CITT. It is interesting to note that of the 80,000 contracts the 
Department of Public Works and Government Services awarded in 
1995-96, the CITT only received complaints on 37 of these 
procurements and of these, only three were upheld as valid 
complaints by the tribunal. I think that is a pretty darn good record. 
On that note, I end.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, this is 
a very fine and articulate theory but what about practice?
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
	Here is practice, and my question to the member opposite will be 
based on it. Last year, the Canadian government signed a contract 
for armoured vehicles worth $2 billion, that is $2,000 million. This 
is not peanuts. This very big contract was awarded without a call 
for tenders to, naturally, an Ontario manufacturing industry, which 
in turn subcontracted the turrets to a California company for $500 
to $600 million, still without a call for tenders.
<P>
	I know that in Saint-Jean, on the outskirts of Montreal, Oerlikon, 
which specializes in this type of equipment, could have fulfilled 
this contract at a competitive price, since there was no call for 
tenders. But it was not to be.
<P>
	My question for the member opposite is this: Why did we choose 
to give our own taxpayers' money to workers in California rather 
than to workers on the outskirts of Montreal?
<P>
	I want a concrete answer, not only rhetoric.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harvard:</B> Madam Speaker, I know that the hon. member 
from the province of Quebec is trying to leave the inference with us 
that contractors, companies and all the people of Quebec are 
somehow being shafted. They have used that story over and over 
again but I can say that in this House of Parliament it does not 
work.
<P>
	The record stands for itself. Quebec companies are doing very 
well. In my opinion the member and all members of the Bloc cast a 
slur on companies in Quebec every time they stand up and 
complain. These companies have strong leadership. Their 
executives are good, their workers are very strong and they 
compete very well. Looking at the record, we see that Quebec 
companies are doing quite well. Let me go down a short list.
<P>
	SNC Incorporated of Montreal. Everybody knows about that 
company. Right now it is supplying the Government of Canada 
with munitions. That contract is worth $140 million. Another 
company is Allied Signal Aerospace Canada. It has a contract for 
$20 million to supply systems for light armoured vehicles. SHL 
Systemhouse Inc. has a contract to supply the Canadian Armed 
Forces with a computer program to control supply systems. That 
contract is worth $30 million.
<P>
	There is a long list but I will give one more example. Textron 
Canada Limited of Mirabel is supplying 100 helicopters to the 
Department of National Defence and the benefits to Quebec are 
$400 million.
<P>
	Those members complain, yell and shout that somehow the 
province is let out. Do you know what? Yes, the economy is not as 
strong as it should be in Quebec. In fact, it is not as strong as it 
should be right across the country but if those people would stop 
hollering, if they would stop contributing to political instability in 
this country and especially in the province of Quebec, their 
companies would do even better.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am very pleased this morning to take part in this debate, 
which the Bloc Quebecois considers a fundamental debate.
<P>
	When one looks at the decline of Montreal, when one sees all the 
hopes that were dashed these past few years, one can understand all 
the frustration not only on our part but on the part of our fellow 
citizens at the government's inaction.
<P>
	I listened earlier to the hon. member for Outremont and 
Secretary of State responsible for the Federal Office of Regional
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5667"> 5667 </A></B>
<P>
Development-Quebec. I listened to his  arguments and I do not 
question his good will in the least.
<P>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
	However, I do question the good will and good faith of some of 
his colleagues, in particular the Prime Minister of Canada who 
came to Montreal to bemoan the decline of the city in front of the 
Montreal board of trade and talked about almost everything but the 
real issues and the joint actions needed to successfully counteract 
this decline.
<P>
	When I look at all the decisions his government has made in the 
last three years, I do not question the good faith or good will of the 
hon. member for Outremont. But I do question the good will and 
good faith of the Prime minister and his colleagues and, in 
particular, the Toronto establishment. I need only look, for 
example, at what was done to Air Canada these past few months. 
Decisions were made that ran counter to maintaining jobs in 
Montreal, which put at risk the very existence of Air Canada's head 
office in Montreal with its 1,200 employees. I need only look at 
what is being done in shipping, where the St. Lawrence ports are 
completely disadvantaged. I need only look at the government's 
decisions, and I will consider only the Laval information 
technology research center, where the federal government has cut 
$10 million and 80 high quality jobs. I need only look at the closure 
of the Saint-Hubert Land Force Command, causing the loss of 480 
jobs in metropolitan Montreal.
<P>
	I need only look at what happened to Atomic Energy of Canada's 
Tokamak project in Varennes, where 20 per cent of the employees 
were transferred to Toronto. And when I hear the Prime Minister 
say that he will do everything he can to save Montreal, I doubt it. I 
doubt that the Prime Minister is capable of anything except saying 
that he will act, without ever putting his words into actions.
<P>
	I need only look only at the project of creating a Canada-wide 
securities commission to have my doubts about whether the Prime 
Minister and greater Toronto members in particular are working for 
Montreal. Why? Because do you know what the establishment of 
such a Canada-wide commission would mean for Montreal? It 
would certainly mean the transfer of a major part of Montreal's 
financial activities, of its infrastructures and superstructures in the 
securities sector. This means a transfer of the decision making 
process, of the financial sector's resources from Montreal to 
Toronto. This is quite clear. It is so clear that it has nothing to do 
with the fact of being sovereignist or against the government.
<P>
	There are even some good Liberals who have been saying for 
years to the federal government that it must not interfere with the 
securities sector and, above all, that it must not create new 
institutions like a Canadian securities commission that would make 
decisions leading to a transfer in Toronto of almost all of 
Montreal's  financial sector, including tax experts, securities 
experts and the whole securities network.
<P>
	If the government really wants to save Montreal, create jobs and 
strengthen economic activity, it cannot create a Canadian securities 
commission that would siphon off all of Montreal's financial sector 
or large portions of it toward Toronto.
<P>
	How do you expect us to believe the Prime Minister when he 
says that he will help Montreal to recover? Do you really expect us 
to believe in his goodwill when it is clear that he will take 
deliberate measures to make Montreal lose all of its securities 
sector and a good part of its financial sector?
<P>
	How do you expect to reinforce economic activity if you move it 
to Toronto?
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	So, as I was saying, I do not question in any way the good faith 
of the member for Outremont, but I certainly may question the 
good faith of his government and especially the capacity of the 
members from Quebec who sit on the other side to stand up to the 
establishment in Toronto, to stand up to the backers of the Liberal 
Party of Canada, who are concentrated mostly in Toronto, and to 
stand up to the lobbying by the Ontario financial community, which 
wants to have this Canada-wide securities commission. And do you 
know why they want that? Because, from now on, Toronto will be 
the heart of the financial sector and the securities sector.
<P>
	Not so long ago, Daniel Johnson was premier of Quebec. It was 
another era. Lots of things have happened since then. But when he 
was premier, he had deemed appropriate to write to the then 
President of the Treasury Board and Minister responsible for 
Intergovernmental Affairs, the member for Hull-Aylmer.
<P>
	Allow me to quote what Daniel Johnson said about the federal 
government's interference in the securities sector. He said: 
``Perhaps I may remind you first of all that the Government of 
Quebec has never supported an expanded federal role in the 
securities sector, which is the exclusive responsibility of the 
provinces''. That is not us talking, but Daniel Johnson, a good 
Liberal.
<P>
	He goes on to say: ``In the five-year report she tabled in the 
National Assembly last December, the finance minister reiterated 
Quebec's concerns about the federal regulations regarding the 
securities sector, which would be part of this legislation. She 
stressed that federal regulations would be inappropriate, both 
constitutionally and from the point of view of efficiency''.
<P>
	I do not often agree with Mr. Johnson, but on this issue we are in 
total agreement. In fact, a broad consensus exists in Quebec. At the 
end of last spring, the Quebec government's committee on 
employment and the economy held hearings regarding the financial 
sector, more specifically the securities sector.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5668"> 5668 </A></B>
<P>
	All the stakeholders who appeared before the committte 
unanimously criticized the federal government's interference in 
this sector and the creation of a Canada-wide securities 
commission. Federalists and sovereignists alike were unanimous 
on that point. Political stripes are never important in Quebec when 
the issue is saving and creating jobs, maintaining activities as 
important as the securities sector and decision centres in Montreal. 
Everyone in Quebec is opposed to this government proposal.
<P>
	Therefore, they should stop bemoaning the situation in 
Montreal. They should put aside this ill conceived proposal, which 
verges on madness, especially when one speaks from both sides of 
one's mouth. One cannot save or help Montreal, on the one hand, 
and kill whole sectors of the financial industry, on the other hand.
<P>
	I suggest to the hon. member for Outremont, who is the minister 
responsible for regional development in Quebec, that he try to 
convince his colleagues, especially those from Toronto, to overturn 
the decisions and reject the policies of the Prime Minister and the 
finance minister in this regard. Once he has done that, I will be 
even more convinced of his good faith than I am today.
<P>
	I have one last comment. I see that the member for Outremont is 
anxious to answer, and I am anxious to hear what he has to say, to 
hear that he will commit himself to working to have this decision 
overturned. Nevertheless, I would ask the following question: 
Where are the other members from Quebec today? We are talking 
about Montreal and saving Montreal. A single member from 
Quebec is here, and he is the minister responsible for the regional 
development. This is outrageous.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Martin Cauchon (Secretary of State (Federal Office of 
Regional Development-Quebec), Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, first 
of all I must thank my hon. colleague, for whom I have great 
respect, for his show of confidence. I would just like to point out 
that, notwithstanding the trust put in me, when in the same breath 
the will and the good will of the Prime Minister of Canada is put 
into question, it is also my own will and good will that is being put 
into question.
<P>
	In that sense, I must say that the Canadian government's policy 
in the Montreal strategy is a noble one in that it acts on a serious 
situation.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	I describe the situation as serious because there are more poor 
people in greater Montreal alone than in all of Atlantic Canada. 
When a government with a national vision wants to ensure that the 
country has a dynamic economy, is able to export and can be 
competitive-as I said this morning-it has to make sure that large 
urban centers throughout Canada have a dynamic economy. It is 
our duty to remain active, and I emphasize remain, because we 
were already active and will continue to be active in the Montreal 
area.
<P>
	What we are asking official opposition members is basically to 
heighten the awareness of their colleagues in the Quebec 
government so that they work in partnership with us, a partnership 
already endorsed to a very large extent by city officials in 
Montreal.
<P>
	I shall be brief, Madam Speaker. The issue of transportation was 
raised earlier, and many aspects were listed. Someone mentioned 
for instance that, on June 6, 1996, Via Rail Canada announced its 
was consolidating all its operations in the greater Montreal area. 
That is quite something.
<P>
	Regarding the Canadian Securities Commission, I respectfully 
submit that it is wishful thinking on the part of my hon. colleague 
to say that Quebec will be swallowed up and will have to join in. In 
establishing a Canadian Securities Commission, my colleague, the 
Minister of Finance, is essentially acting on a request made by a 
number of provinces across Canada. With this structure in place, 
Quebec will not be required to join in. Its jurisdiction will in no 
way be affected.
<P>
	I think criticism can be good, but it must be constructive 
criticism. Now that we have made quite extensively clear the will 
to act and plan of action of the government and the Prime Minister 
of Canada, I urge them to join in and fall into step.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier: </B>I thank the hon. member for Outremont and 
minister in charge of regional development. But if he really wants 
to work, I urge him to show his unflagging faith in Montreal's 
future and to publicly undertake to oppose the project for a 
Canada-wide securities commission.
<P>
	The answer he gave when he quoted the Minister of Finance is 
far from satisfactory, and I will tell him that no Quebecer believes 
in that statement from the Minister of Finance that, if Quebec 
refuses to participate in the activities of the Canada-wide securities 
commission, the Quebec Securities Commission will remain, and 
there will be two commissions.
<P>
	Nobody believes that, for two reasons. First, when there is a 
securities commission for all of Canada, a national commission, it 
takes precedence over all of the others. Financial circles will turn to 
the Canada-wide securities commission, which will probably be 
established in Toronto, because all this government's financial 
decisions revolve around Toronto. Second, the government wishes 
to increase efficiency, yet it will agree to maintain provincial 
securities commissions in addition to a national commission. This 
is absolutely inefficient and not in the interest of the financial 
circles, which are looking for stability and certainty.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Tremblay (Rosemont, BQ):</B> As you know, Madam 
Speaker, a large centre like Montreal does not change overnight, or 
even in a year. We are currently  experiencing the consequences of 
decisions made in the last few decades. Similarly, our children's 
lives will be largely influenced by the decisions we make today. In 
order to understand Montreal's situation, we have to put things in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5669"> 5669 </A></B>
<P>
perspective. When we have convictions, it is because we put things 
in perspective.
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	It is no accident that we are convinced today that Montreal is a 
metropolis in need of a country, of a capital that cares for its 
metropolis.
<P>
	Montreal was once a city and a region whose population was 
primarily anglophone. At that time, the anglophones were the 
masters and we were their servants. There was the affluent 
Montreal and the poor Montreal. Poverty had a language, ours.
<P>
	Things have changed. Today, Montreal is a primarily a 
francophone city, and I hope it will be so forever. But, things have 
also changed politically. Montreal was once the metropolis of 
Canada. Today, political Canada has chosen its metropolis, 
Toronto. This is largely due to a series of decisions made by the 
federal government.
<P>
	Montreal is the metropolis of Quebec and it can clearly be 
demonstrated that its major problem is that most of the decisions 
affecting it are still made in a capital which has another metropolis. 
This is the major problem Montreal faces.
<P>
	When the Prime Minister of Canada came to Montreal to tell us 
that we, the sovereignists, are the ones responsible for the 
uncertainty and suggested that this uncertainty is responsible for 
the decline of Montreal, he just wanted us to forget about our ideals 
and, why not our language while we were at it, and to concern 
ourselves with concrete things.
<P>
	I accept the challenge, but only for a few minutes, while I 
examine the concrete decisions that the federal government has 
taken in the last few years in areas under its jurisdiction.
<P>
	The Prime Minister presents himself as the reassuring buddy, 
and us as the uncertainty. Let us look at each individual issue. In 
something that is exclusively under federal jurisdiction, the rail 
industry, I would like to ask the 15,000 workers who lost their jobs 
in the last years in Montreal if they are reassured by the federal 
government's decisions. I would like to ask them who is 
responsible for the uncertainty they have to live with now.
<P>
	I would like to ask the 8,000 workers of the shipbuilding 
industry, who lost their jobs as a result of federal decisions, if they 
are reassured by the Prime Minister's statement. Do they still want 
the federal government to take care of them?
<P>
	I ask the same thing to the thousands of workers of Montreal's 
petrochemical industry, who lost their jobs to Sarnia, Ontario, 
following a federal decision to draw an  artificial line down the 
Ottawa Valley known as the Borden Line. This decision allowed 
petrochemical development to take place in Ontario while this 
industry declined in Montreal. All Montreal's workers know that 
those who are responsible for their uncertainty are not the 
sovereignists.
<P>
	The attitude of the federal Liberal government was similar in 
other sectors. I need only think of civil aviation and the 
pharmaceutical industry. Let us ask managers and workers of the 
pharmaceutical industry if the federal decision power concerning 
patents is reassuring for them.
<P>
	During over 20 years, Canada was the only western country to 
deny real patents to a research industry that was well settled in 
Montreal. When the Conservative government wanted to change 
the legislation and give real patents to this industry, the whole 
region had to rally for months instead of putting its energies into its 
own development. We constantly have to put a lot of energy into 
bringing the federal government to make positive decisions.
<P>
	Who delayed the bill? Not the Conservative government, but the 
Liberal Senate, during several months, in Toronto's pay. Let the 
Secretary of State for Regional Development answer that. The 
federal government's attitude toward the pharmaceutical industry 
could change.
<P>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
	We are asked to make concrete proposals. What we want are 
basic decisions for Montreal's economy, not an announcement to 
the effect that some funding will be provided. In order to dispel the 
uncertainty concerning Montreal and drug patents, it must clearly 
be stated that the drug patent legislation will be amended by 1997. 
The government must pledge that the pharmaceutical industry will 
be able to get patents similar to those available everywhere in the 
western world. If this is done, investments will increase in 
Montreal.
<P>
	Let me say to those who are listening to us that fundamental 
changes have occurred over the years and will continue to occur. 
The most important of these changes is the presence, in Ottawa, of 
the Bloc Quebecois. The days when federal ministers, or even the 
Prime Minister, could secretly make basic decisions that were 
unfavourable to Quebec's economy and then try to look good by 
announcing some subsidy are over. These days are over.
<P>
	We do not want the government to announce some subsidy; we 
want it to make basic decisions regarding Montreal's economy. 
Here is another suggestion. The Sarnia industry, which was 
developed at the expense of Montreal's petrochemical industry, is 
now asking that the Sarnia-Montreal pipeline go the other way. My 
suggestion would not cost one penny to the government. The 
government only has to demand that these multinationals revitalize 
Montreal's petrochemical industry, in exchange for the service. 
They would then contribute to Montreal's development.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5670"> 5670 </A></B>
<P>
	What is needed for that? No money is necessary. We know that 
governments do not have any money and when they do, it comes 
from our pockets. But political will is necessary. The two 
suggestions I am making would not cost a thing; they only require 
political will. We will be watching to see if this political will is 
there. If it is not, the Liberal government will have to pay the price. 
Put an end to economic uncertainty.
<P>
	I want to ensure the Prime Minister that we are still part of 
Canada. The No side won the last referendum by a very narrow 
margin. Quebec pays $30 billion to be part of Canada; it is a rather 
high contribution. We are here to protect the interests of Quebec 
and to demand that these $30 billion be used.
<P>
	I also want to tell him that we will keep our ideals. We will keep 
our will to develop our identity, and the Bloc Quebecois will 
continue to promote sovereignty and Quebec's interests in Ottawa, 
until the fundamental decision on our future is made. We are not 
prepared to give up our ideals for a subsidy.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Martin Cauchon (Secretary of State (Federal Office of 
Regional Development-Quebec), Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I have 
listened with a great deal of patience to the remarks of the hon. 
member for Rosemont. When I listen to him, I get the impression 
we do not live in the same metropolitan area.
<P>
	When people opposite say that what is expected from the 
government are fundamental decisions and concrete projects, I 
wonder where they have been for the last 20 to 30 years, when the 
federal government has been building the modern economy of 
Quebec, when it has been contributing to that as a partner.
<P>
	I wonder also where members opposite have been for the past 
few months when we have been taking action everywhere in the 
country, particularly in the Greater Montreal area. One needs to 
have a vision in order to make fundamental decisions. The Prime 
Minister of Canada stated our government's vision this week 
before the chamber of commerce, and I have explained it again this 
morning.
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	Each and every action we take, based on this vision, from the 
most modest ones to the most significant, have been fundamental 
actions. The most modest ones have been important for small 
businesses. Take for example the Info-entrepreneurs centre in 
Montreal which has a resounding success in the business 
community because it is filling a need.
<P>
	Another example is the Centre d'entreprise et d'innovation of 
Montreal which has just changed its focus. Members opposite say 
we are talking peanuts. These thing are important. The Centre 
d'entreprise et  d'innovation has just changed its focus in order to 
help small businesses more, and young people who want to start 
their own business in the new economy.
<P>
	There have been other federal contributions and more structuring 
projects, like Bell Helicopter, in which Quebec and Canada take 
great pride. Just think of the latest announcement. They were 
talking about peanuts a while ago. But Bombardier-Canadair will 
be producing a new regional 70-passenger jet aircraft, and the 
Quebec aerospace industry will keep its enviable position on 
international markets.
<P>
	This morning, I spoke about the leading edge in the space 
industry. The Canadian Space Agency in Saint-Hubert is part of the 
aerospace industry, and it has a ten-year plan representing $2.3 
billion.
<P>
	These are fundamental and concrete projects. This is what it 
means to act in a structuring manner and, most of all, with a vision.
<P>
	In concluding, I will get back to an issue. If my hon. colleagues 
opposite want to put their shoulders to the wheel and work 
constructively within the framework of the strategy we have 
developed, we will be pleased to take all their remarks, provided 
they are made in the spirit of that vision and that strategy. However, 
they already have elements in their hands. They can surely talk to 
their colleagues in Quebec City about the sword of Damocles the 
Prime Minister was talking about, and also about the areas under 
their jurisdiction, like education, to use them to adequately respond 
to the needs of our population and the needs of our young people. 
They could also talk to some people who are in charge in the 
metropolis, so that we move forward in a partner like manner.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Tremblay (Rosemont):</B> Madam Speaker, it is interesting to 
see how impatient the minister gets when we remind him of the 
Liberal government's decisions concerning the rail system, 
shipping, civil aviation, the pharmaceutical industry and the 
petro-chemical industry.
<P>
	The people who are watching this are no fools. Of course, a 
corporation was granted a subsidy recently. However, I questioned 
the minister about two decisions. If he had listened to me the first 
time, he would have been able to give me an answer. I put two 
questions to him. It would not cost a penny, at a time when millions 
of dollars are given away, while hospital budgets and 
unemployment benefits are cut. I put two questions to the minister 
and he did not answer either one of them. These two decisions are 
political and would not cost a penny. What do you intend to do 
about the drug patents and about the pipeline to revitalize the 
petro-chemical industry in Montreal?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul DeVillers (Parliamentary Secretary to President of 
the Queen's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I will share 
my time with the member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5671"> 5671 </A></B>
<P>
	My remarks will deal with the Montreal port, a major element 
not only in this country's shipping industry but also in intermodal 
tranportation and international trade.
<P>
<B>(1325)</B>
<P>
	The Montreal Port Corporation was created in 1983 by the 
federal government as a local port corporation, under the Canada 
Ports Corporation Act. In keeping with the national shipping 
policy, this port has been designated a Canadian port authority.
<P>
	Our government's national shipping policy will ensure that the 
Canadian shipping industry continues to contribute significantly to 
the Montreal economy, by allowing the port to become even more 
commercially orientated.
<P>
	Montreal is one of the busiest inland ports in the world and one 
of the main transatlantic traffic transfer centres. With its port, its 
international airport, its road and railway networks linking it to 
every corner of North America, Montreal is undeniably one of the 
hubs of transportation in the world.
<P>
	Every year, the Montreal port contributes $1.2 billion to the 
economy of Montreal, Quebec and the country as a whole. It 
accounts for 7,400 direct jobs which, coupled with indirect jobs, 
amount to 14,000 jobs.
<P>
	These economic benefits are more obvious with regard to the 
North Atlantic ocean. Of all the eastern seaboard ports, Montreal 
provides the most direct and fastest access to the main Canadian 
markets, as well as to American markets in the Midwest and the 
North East.
<P>
	This is where transatlantic routes interconnect with the rail and 
freeway networks thus reducing the time and cost of door to door 
transportation of goods. Traffic back and forth is so important that 
it promotes economies of scale and allows shipping lines to offer 
regular and frequent services. Importers and exporters can fully 
profit from all the advantages of just in time delivery.
<P>
	The Montreal Port Corporation is financially independent. 
Between 1984 and 1995, it generated total net profits amounting to 
$148.4 million. During that time, thanks to internally generated 
funds, the corporation invested $180 million in capital 
expenditures.
<P>
	In 1987, the Government of Canada approved a transfer to the 
equity of the Montreal Port Corporation in the amount of $231 
million, comprising $133 million in annuity certificates and $98 
million in accrued interests on those certificates.
<P>
	Therefore, between 1986 and 1995, the government wrote off 
part of the debt and accrued interests for a total of $231 million and 
the Montreal Port Corporation contributed $108.7 million to the 
consolidated fund of Canada in the form of a special contribution 
and dividends, so the net result was a positive difference of $122.3 
million.
<P>
	In 1995, the Montreal Port Corporation paid six million in grants 
in lieu of municipal taxes. On the other hand, tenants of the port 
paid directly $7.7 million in property, municipal and school taxes. 
Therefore, in 1995, the Montreal Port Corporation and its tenants 
jointly paid $13.7 million in grants in lieu of taxes, municipal taxes 
and school taxes.
<P>
	Given those data and the economic impact of the port activity, 
we can conclude that not only is the port not a burden for the 
Canadian taxpayer, it is a real motor for the Canadian economy.
<P>
<B>(1330)</B>
<P>
	In the Montreal Port Corporation's business plan, investments or 
capital expenditures of almost $110 million are expected for the 
five-year period from 1996 to 2000.
<P>
	With containers on top of the list, the total traffic of goods 
handled in the port of Montreal during the first six months of 1996 
reached 9.3 million tonnes, an increase of 1.3 million tonnes or 16 
per cent compared to the same period last year. There was a traffic 
increase in all categories of goods, except one.
<P>
	During the first semester of 1996, the port of Montreal handled 
3.9 million tonnes of various containerized goods, an increase of 
more than 570,000 tonnes or 17.2 per cent compared to the first six 
months of last year. We must recall that, for the whole of the year 
1995, container traffic had reached an unprecedented level in the 
main Canadian container port, despite a labour dispute that 
paralysed activities on the wharves for 16 days last year.
<P>
	For the first half of 1996, the port of Montreal has increased its 
share of the container market in a context of fierce competition. It 
has succeeded to fare better than its competitors on the North 
American east coast, and there is every indication it will be another 
record year in this sector.
<P>
	The growth in freight traffic combined with tight control of 
administrative and operating costs had a positive impact on the 
Montreal Port Corporation's financial performance. As of June 30, 
1996, the corporation's net profits amounted to $3.6 million 
compared to $1.1 million for the first half of 1995.
<P>
	All user fees have been frozen for the fourth consecutive year. 
Additional improvements were made to the discount program put 
in place to stimulate container traffic, and rebates aimed at 
increasing other types of freight have been added.
<P>
	A highlight of the first half of 1996 was the arrival of three 
brand-new containerships linking Montreal to northern Europe. 
Two of these three ships were christened in Montreal. Canada 
Maritime's <I>Canmar Courage</I> and <I>Canmar Fortune</I> each have a 
capacity of 2,200 TEU containers, while OOCL Canada, which  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5672"> 5672 </A></B>
<P>
belongs to Orient Overseas Container Line, can carry 2,300 TEU 
containers.
<P>
	These three deep-draft ships are currently the largest 
containerships sailing on the St. Lawrence. They are on the leading 
edge of technology and equipped for winter sailing. The 
commissioning of these three great vessels is further evidence of 
shipowners' confidence in the Port of Montreal's future.
<P>
	The highlights of the first semester include improved carrier 
services between North America's industrial heartland and 
northern Europe and the Mediterranean, as well as the opening of a 
new fruit terminal operated by Logistec Arrimage Inc.
<P>
	This shows the positive economic impact of port operations in 
the Montreal area on all trade activities linked to shipping.
<P>
<B>(1335)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
listened with interest to what the hon. member opposite just said. In 
a way, he just sang the praises of the port of Montreal. The fact is 
that Montreal did do rather well after all. I say after all on account 
of the statistics referred to earlier by the hon. member for 
Laurier-Sainte-Marie, data from our revered Statistics Canada 
indicating that for every dollar it pays in taxes to the federal 
government, here, in Ottawa, Montreal gets only 75 cents back. All 
in all, Montreal did quite well on its three quarters out of a buck. 
But how much more would Montreal have been able to accomplish 
with that last quarter? That is the real question. You see, for 
decades now, the problem has not taken the form of sword of 
Damocles dangling over our heads, but rather that of a ball and 
chain that we have to drag behind us all the time and that keeps 
getting heavier and heavier every time we send money to Ottawa. 
We keep getting less and less back and end up getting 
shortchanged.
<P>
	I notice that the majority of government members standing up 
are not from the Montreal area. Where are the hon. members for 
Pierrefonds, Saint-Laurent, Verdun? I am not saying that they are 
not in the House-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> I am sorry to 
interrupt the hon. member. I recognize the hon. member for 
Stormont-Dundas on a point of order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont-Dundas, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
members may be tempted from time to time to comment on the 
presence or absence of other members, but I do not think that this 
serves the important and very sensitive debate we are having today 
on the Montreal area.
<P>
	<B>Mr. de Savoye:</B> Madam Speaker, why are the members I just 
mentioned not standing up in this House at this time? I would like 
to hear from them. After all, they have the right to represent the 
views of their fellow citizens from the Montreal area. I am sure that 
they would have  something to say on the subject. Why are we not 
hearing from them?
<P>
	I would like my hon. colleague opposite, who made such 
complimentary remarks about the port of Montreal, to tell me why. 
Once the bill the House is currently considering, the one that will 
charge user fees for navigational aids is passed-I hope it will not 
but, unfortunately, the government majority holds the opposite 
view-when it is in force, resulting in the St. Lawrence seaway 
becoming less competitive in the eyes of a number of American 
carriers, what will happen to the port of Montreal then? Is Quebec, 
and Montreal and its port in particular, not at the mercy of yet 
another bad decision made by a centralizing government in 
Ottawa?
<P>
	<B>Mr. DeVillers: </B>Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
question. I am pleased to inform him that I am sharing my time 
with the hon. member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, who is from 
Montreal. That should make him happy.
<P>
	Furthermore, what I said in my speech clearly shows that the 
Port of Montreal is doing very well. The hon. member asks me 
questions as if I could forecast the future, as if I knew what will 
happen after a certain bill becomes law. He has no arguments to 
refute what I said in my speech, that the Port of Montreal is doing 
fine, better than last year, despite all the cuts made across the 
country, and not only at the Port of Montreal.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont-Dundas, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
think you will find unanimous consent for the following motion:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That any recorded division on the opposition motion now before the House be 
deemed deferred until Tuesday, October 29, 1996, at the conclusion of Government 
Orders.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1340)</B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> Does the hon. 
government whip have the unanimous consent of the House to 
propose the motion?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> The House has 
heard the motion. Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the 
motion?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	(Motion agreed to.)
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Warren Allmand (Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, as the member of Parliament for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce in 
Montreal and a fifth generation Montrealer who loves his city, 
loves his province and his country, I take this debate very seriously.
<P>
	The separatists in all their forms, whether sovereignists or Parti 
Quebecois or Bloc Quebecois or Société Saint-Jean-Baptiste, 
continue to bury their heads in the sand. They refuse to face the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5673"> 5673 </A></B>
<P>
reality that their policies are seriously hurting the economy of 
Montreal. They are hurting the recovery of Montreal as one of the 
world's great cities.
<P>
	They refuse to recognize that their policies to hold continual 
referendums, to make statements with respect to exclusivity as to 
who is really a Quebecois, and from time to time their extreme 
language policies are scaring away jobs and new investment. 
Obviously not all investment; there is investment in Montreal, but 
there could be much more without these negative policies which I 
have just referred to.
<P>
	It is true that Montreal suffers the same problems as all other 
smokestack industrial cities, the old industrial cities: the need to 
convert to the new economy, the need to convert to high technology 
and to globalization. We can debate on another occasion the 
effectiveness of these policies by the government to help all 
Canadian industrial and commercial cities that are faced with those 
same challenges.
<P>
	In addition to suffering the same difficulties as other North 
American cities and cities in Europe that are trying to adapt to the 
new economy, Montreal is hit with the additional burden of 
continual referendums, extreme nationalism and extreme language 
policies.
<P>
	The Parti Quebecois and the Bloc Quebecois talk about 
democracy and self-determination and the respect for democracy 
and self-determination, but they refuse to recognize the results of 
two referendums which have already been held. Their policy seems 
to be to continue to have referendums until they win one, no matter 
what kind of question and no matter by what margin. They refuse to 
recognize the rule of law. They say that they will not recognize 
decisions of the supreme court with respect to the universal 
declaration of independence issues.
<P>
	Do such policies encourage employers to come and stay in 
Montreal? I would think not. Consider their statements as to who is 
and who is not a Quebecois. One day we hear them speak of the 
Quebecois in a very exclusive fashion, as if only those who are 
descendants of vieille souche Quebecois are really Quebecois, 
which results in two types of citizenship in Quebec.
<P>
	On another day, in a more reflective mood they will say that I am 
included, the Blacks are included, the Indians are included, 
everyone else is included. But then we had statements in this House 
by one member of the Bloc Quebecois who suggested seriously that 
only those who fit his definition of Quebecois should have the right 
to vote in the referendum. By that he meant the descendants of the 
vieille souche Quebecois.
<P>
	I hear this again. I hear ``nous Québécois avons besoin de notre 
état''. When they say ``nous Quebecois'' they do not include me 
and many of my electors in Notre-Dame-de-Grâce. They are 
speaking of an exclusive ethnic type of nationalism. I ask again: 
Does  this sort of policy encourage employers to come and stay in 
Montreal?
<P>
	In the same vein, we had the statements by the former premier of 
Quebec, Mr. Parizeau and the minister of finance, Mr. Landry, 
which attacked the ethnic minorities in Quebec for their votes in 
the referendum and the interpretation of the poll results. These 
were statements which terribly upset the ethnic minorities in 
Quebec. There were recent statements which were even more 
extreme from Mr. Villeneuve who attacked the Jewish community 
in Quebec and said that they would get theirs once independence 
was brought about.
<P>
<B>(1345)</B>
<P>
	Do these kinds of statements encourage employers to come to 
Montreal: extremism in language policy; proposals to bring back 
the language police, which has even been attacked by part of the 
sovereignist community in Quebec and by the trade unions. 
However, there is still a proposal to bring back the language police 
and other extreme language policies. There is the recent situation at 
the hospital in Sherbrooke. The hospital put up bilingual signs to 
assist the elderly anglophone community of the eastern townships 
who must go to the Sherbrooke hospital and instructions came from 
Quebec City to take down the English signs even though they were 
in a secondary position.
<P>
	There have been attacks on Mr. Galganov. In the first place, all 
he was doing was asking major businesses on the West Island of 
Montreal to respect the Quebec language laws and simply put up 
English language signs in accordance with the law of Quebec, 
which is English in a secondary position and in smaller letters. He 
was asking the stores to do that because their signs were only in 
French and yet he was attacked.
<P>
	Does extremism in language policy encourage other Canadians, 
Americans, Europeans and Asians to invest and stay in Montreal?
<P>
	I want to make clear that I fully support policies, and have for 
years, to assure and promote the French language and culture in 
Quebec and have it flourish. The federal government has done that 
for years and continues to do so. It has done it through 
Radio-Canada, CBC, the Canada Council, the CRTC, Telefilm 
Canada and assistance to theatres, museums, libraries and research.
<P>
	It is without a doubt that Quebec, French Canada in general, is 
now the second strongest French culture in the world after France. 
Nobody can rival Quebec or French Canada. It is strong in writing, 
theatre, music and academia. It is very strong and has done that 
within the federal system. These extreme policies that I referred to 
are not necessary. All they are doing is hurting the economy, the 
jobs and the people of Quebec.
<P>
	The purport of the resolution states that Montreal and Quebec 
are not getting their fair share. With respect to federal transfers to 
Quebec, in 1996-97, this fiscal year,  while Quebec has 25 per cent 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5674"> 5674 </A></B>
<P>
of the population of Canada, 31 per cent of the money transferred 
from the federal government to the provinces goes to Quebec. I 
support that because I think that is a fair share. It amounts to $11.1 
billion. It has been approximately at that level for the last six years.
<P>
	Yesterday there were questions in the House to the Prime 
Minister with respect to the granting of contracts in Quebec, saying 
that Quebec was not getting its fair share. The Prime Minister 
answered correctly that, first of all, we grant contracts on a tender 
basis and give out contracts to companies and professionals who 
apply for different jobs on a tender basis.
<P>
	However, it is a question of the chicken and the egg. Quebec 
does not have the same number of entrepreneurs and professionals 
that it did when I first started in politics here in the 1960s. A lot 
have left. A lot have not come who would have come. A lot of 
former Montreal businessmen in Montreal head offices are now in 
Toronto, Calgary and elsewhere because of the extreme policies of 
the PQ governments with respect to these matters. They scared 
away firms that would have been there to bid on these contracts and 
probably get them for the Quebec people.
<P>
	With respect to the assistance to industry, I was present this week 
when the Prime Minister announced the repayable loan of $87 
million to Bombardier to develop a new aircraft. The federal 
government has been very supportive of the aircraft industry in 
Quebec. I will list them off. There was a contribution by Industry 
Canada of $940,000 to Matériaux techniques Côté; a contribution 
of $825,000 to École Polytechnique chaire industrielle; $5 million 
to Institut de recherche en biotechnologie; $1.7 million to 
Mallinckrodt Medical Inc. It goes on and on. Bell Helicopter 
received $8 million. Aliments Delisle received $1.5 million. 
Galderma received $1.6 million.
<P>
<B>(1350 )</B>
<P>
	With respect to the infrastructure program which has just taken 
place over the last two years, the region of Montreal received 400 
projects, of which the federal government contributed $236 million 
for 12,000 employees.
<P>
	I see that my time is up. I simply want to say that if the Parti 
Quebecois and the Bloc Quebecois really want to help with jobs in 
the economy in Montreal, they should forget about referendums 
and the extremism of their nationalistic policy, co-operate, take up 
the offer of the Prime Minister and together we will create jobs and 
develop Montreal as it used to be.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
listened very carefully to the speech made by my friend, the hon. 
member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce. I cannot, in  any way, share his 
views on the Quebec sovereignist movement.
<P>
	The term ``Quebecer'' is not exclusive, it is inclusive. It includes 
anglophones, such as the hon. member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, 
and allophones, such as the member for Bourassa. The hon. 
member condemns the comments made by Villeneuve toward 
Jews, as we all did here in this House and elsewhere but, at the 
same time, he congratulates Mr. Galganov. The same rules should 
apply to two extremist members of Quebec's society.
<P>
	The hon. member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce and other Liberal 
members remained silent when a minister of this government, the 
former Minister of Human Resources Development, asked me to 
leave Canada, to look for another country, because I do not approve 
the government's policy and because I am a sovereignist member 
of Parliament. The member did not say anything then, nor did other 
government members.
<P>
	It is unbelievable to hear a minister tell us there are two types of 
Canadians and Quebecers: those who agree with the federal 
government's policy are welcome, while those who do not must 
leave the country. I cannot accept such comments.
<P>
	I also want to put a question to the hon. member for 
Notre-Dame-de-Grâce. The federal government's inaction is the 
reason why Montreal's economic situation is catastrophic. It is 
because of measures taken by this government if, for example, 
Canadian International moved and is now concentrating its 
operations in the west, if it secured the rights to fly to the Czech 
Republic and is now Canada's carrier to the Asian market.
<P>
	Air Canada is adversely affected because its head office is in 
Montreal. It cannot fly to Asia, it cannot fly delegates to the Liberal 
Party convention this weekend. Canadian International does it, as it 
will also fly those who will attend the rock concert, etc. Why? Tell 
me.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The hon. member will agree that this is a 
comment rather than a question. Nevertheless, I will give the hon. 
member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce an opportunity to reply.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Allmand:</B> Mr. Speaker, while I share many things and some 
policies in common with my hon. friend, I guess this is an area 
where we disagree.
<P>
	To being with, it is true that some members of the Bloc 
Quebecois and some members of the Parti Quebecois when they 
speak of Quebecois do include in their reflective moments all of us 
in Quebec, anglophones, minorities and so on. But there are others 
and even some in this House who when they speak about nous les 
Quebecois do not include us.
<P>
	For example, I cannot remember the seat, but one hon. member 
during the referendum campaign stood up and said that only ``les 
Québécois doivent avoir le droit de voter au référendum''. He 
meant and he clarified that, and it was also said by a member of the 
<P>

<B><A NAME="5675"> 5675 </A></B>
<P>
PQ in Quebec, that this meant the real Quebecois. By that he meant 
those who were the descendants of vieille souche.
<P>
<B>(1355)</B>
<P>
	There is abiguity over there. The hon. member says that the 
definition is inclusive. However, there are many others who speak 
of it exclusively and I could give many examples.
<P>
	With respect to Mr. Galganov, I did not congratulate him on 
everything he did and said. I said he was right, however, when he 
campaigned on the West Island of Montreal to assure that the signs 
were both in English and French in accordance with the Quebec 
law which the Quebec government supported up until now. When 
Mr. Galganov did that he was right. He was not attacking the 
Quebec government. He was telling the various major stores on the 
West Island ``do what the law gives you the right to do''. In that he 
was right. I do not congratulate him for calling certain people 
bastards. I think he went too far on that.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I have much more to say.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Yes, I would imagine. I know you meant that in 
sort of an oblique sense. At least I hope you did, my colleague.
<P>
	In any case, I am going to save all of us because it is almost two 
o'clock. If we are ready we will proceed to Statements by 
Members.

Speaker, from time to time members search for acceptable words to 
use to describe blatantly inaccurate statements by other members. 
Well, the Prime Minister has kindly provided us with a new one.
<P>
	On a recent trip to the west, the Prime Minister made numerous 
statements of very questionable accuracy. When challenged, his 
response was that he was using linguistic shorthand. That explains 
a lot.
<P>
	When the Liberals claim they have fulfilled their red book 
promise to create jobs in the face of unemployment figures which 
show that unemployment is still just as high as when they took 
office, it is linguistic shorthand.
<P>
	And when the finance minister claims to have fulfilled the red 
book promise to break the back of the deficit while increasing our 
debt by $111 billion and increasing our debt servicing costs by 
more than the total transfers to provinces for health care, that is 
linguistic shorthand.
<P>
	The next federal election is coming soon and Canadians will get 
to decide whether they want more linguistic shorthand from the 
Liberals or a fresh start from Reform.

Speaker, this week is Small Business Awareness Week. With more 
than 1 million small businesses in Canada, they are the engines 
driving the economy and creating the jobs, and women are the 
leaders in business today. Before they used to be behind the scenes. 
Today they are front and centre.
<P>
	In fact, business firms led by women entrepreneurs are creating 
jobs in Canada at four times the average of all other firms. Between 
1984 and 1990 in Atlantic Canada the percentage of women owned 
business employing five or more full time employees increased 
from 16 to 28 per cent. This is extraordinary growth and women are 
indeed succeeding in business.
<P>
	I urge the government to develop programs to help small 
businesses that are particularly sensitive to the economic potential 
of women entrepreneurs.

	Instead of negotiating in good faith, the company is challenging

meet with me to discuss the Radwanski report. The Canada Post 
review is a public report but the Post Office refuses to discuss 
allegations made in the report.
<P>
	This government promised more open government yet it could 
not even get in the doors of the Winnipeg post office. Why is this? 
What is this government trying to hide? The red book says that if 
government is to play a positive role in society, as it must, honesty 
and integrity in our institutions must be restored.
<P>
	According to the Radwanski report on Canada Post, Canadians 
presently own a crown corporation which has a complete monopoly 
on first class mail, that is faced with serious allegations of unfair 
competition and cross subsidization in the courier business, and is 
seriously under performing in its delivery of mail. However, when I 
asked to meet the Winnipeg postal officials to discuss the 
allegations in this report, they refused.

dramatic increase in the poverty level worldwide.
<P>
<B>(1405)</B>
<P>
	While extreme poverty is growing at an alarming rate, official 
development assistance is being cut repeatedly everywhere in the 
world, including in Canada. The government must respond to the 
United Nations' invitation because development is the antidote 
against poverty.
<P>

	<B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Canadian 
sugar industry's access to the United States continues to be 
restrained by unfair trade restrictions by the U.S. government. 
Canadian sugar exports to the U.S. were drastically reduced last 
year when the Americans lowered our export quota. As a result, the 
Lantic Sugar Refinery in my city of Saint John has had to lay off 
employees.
<P>
	These tariffs are estimated to cost many hundreds of Canadian 
jobs in the sugar industry. The U.S. has refused to respond to its 
NAFTA obligations to terminate its re-export of sugar-containing 
products by October 1, 1996.
<P>
	The all-party sugar caucus, of which I am a member, has just 
passed a unanimous resolution. The resolution calls for measures to 
protect Canadian jobs and investment. As a member of the sugar 
caucus I call on the Minister for International Trade to immediately 
challenge these unfair trade restrictions and request formal 
consultations under NAFTA in order to preserve our sugar industry 
and save hundreds of Canadian jobs.

<P>
	We learned that lesson a quarter of a century ago and for 25 years 
the businesses and municipalities in this community have been 
working to develop a vibrant and diverse economy.
<P>
	Perhaps the leader of the third party has heard of companies 
called Nortel, Corel and Newbridge, local companies that have 
gone international and are developing jobs by the thousands. They 
are one of the reasons our unemployment rate has dropped from 11 
per cent last August to just over 7 per cent this past month.

	This demonstration and the celebration of its anniversary are a 
good illustration of the position of Canadian federalists. Quebecers

	A response by our Deputy Prime Minister during question period

company that performs work for Syncrude Canada and other oil 
and gas operators. It has only been in operation for five years and in 
that short time it has grown from a tiny enterprise to a $4.5 million 
annual operation. It has grown from six employees to 70 full time 
workers, 90 per cent of which are aboriginal.
<P>
<B>(1415 )</B>
<P>
	Not only has 2000 Plus won this award but they have been 
nominated for the Candu award for economic development. The 
secret of its success is flexibility in planning and a high degree of 
attention to safety, reliability and quality with a great record of 
customer satisfaction.
<P>
	My caucus colleagues and I would like to congratulate the 
employees of 2000 Plus and, in particular, Ed Courtoreille, 
president of 2000 Plus and Mikisew Cree Chief Archie Waquan for 
winning this award.

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the time has come for the Liberal government to meet 
with its party faithful this weekend, in order to look at the 
commitments it has made to the Canadian people. The Prime 
Minister claims he has kept his commitments but, essentially, his 
record has been a big fat zero.
<P>
	The Liberal government got itself elected with its slogan of 
``jobs, jobs, jobs'', which it repeated high and low in order to 
convince the public that employment was its top priority.
<P>
	What can the Prime Minister say today to the million and a half 
Canadians who are not working, still not working, despite the 
Liberal promises, while the unemployment rate still hovers around 
the 10 per cent mark? What can the government and the Prime 
Minister  say to these people, except to admit that they have not 
met their commitment?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I would like to reassure the 
leader of the opposition and to tell him that the Government of 
Canada will be extremely proud to meet the Liberal Party faithful 
during this weekend's magnificent convention.
<P>
	Of course, while the unemployment level is still too high to 
satisfy us, it has nevertheless improved considerably since 1993. 
We have made a magnificent contribution through three of the 
finance minister's budgets, which have left interest rates at 3.75 per 
cent, lower than they have been in 38 years, three points lower than 
the level in the U.S. The investment climate in Canada has never 
been better.
<P>
	Transition toward the new economy is sometimes hard, but there 
are 600,000 more jobs in Canada today than there were in 1993. In 
the next few weeks, moreover, we are going to announce some 
extremely interesting youth employment initiatives, since we are 
concerned with the employment future of our young people.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, one more who feels everything is just going fine. This 
government is totally clueless.
<P>
	The new Minister of Employment-I do not know if the former 
one has clued him in completely-must know that we would need 
more than 870,000 jobs to get the economy back to the way it was 
in 1989. He tells us everything is fine, yet we are 870,000 jobs 
short of the way things used to be. Clueless.
<P>
	In the red book, in 1993, the Prime Minister said, and I 
quote-and I hope the other side is listening properly, for it is their 
Prime Minister speaking: ``Today, after nine years of Conservative 
government, Canadians are facing hardship: 1.6 million 
unemployed, millions more on welfare, a million children living 
below the poverty line, record numbers of bankruptcies and plant 
closings''.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister realize that three years later, he could 
write that same thing again, exactly, for their next campaign 
platform?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I realize that the leader of the 
opposition has a problem: he is very hard of hearing. I never said 
everything was fine, and I am not in the least proud of the 
unemployment situation at this time.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	What I said is that we still have a lot to do, but we have done an 
enormous amount of work in putting public finances in order, with 
the result that we are saving millions, billions of dollars as a 
society at the present time in interest rates, because the 
international markets have confidence in our government. That 
creates jobs.  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5680"> 5680 </A></B>
<P>
That is reality, an extremely important reality and one in which we 
shall continue.
<P>
	We shall have an even more interesting program for young 
people within a few months. As for the 800,000 jobs referred to, 
many jobs were lost. That is reality. That is normal. We are 
undergoing an economic transition which means that jobs are 
constantly changing. If jobs had not been lost, we would be in even 
more trouble, because the economy has changed. I am very much 
aware that the opposition does not realize that we are in a period of 
evolution, but we are in the process of adapting our programs in 
order to help get workers back to work. And the 600,000 jobs are in 
addition to the 800,000 which were-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I am sorry to interrupt the minister. The Leader of 
the Opposition has the floor.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Do not 
worry, Mr. Speaker, he will eventually learn.
<P>
	The former teacher in me would mark his oral presentation as 
follows: ``A'' for the number of words, ``Z'' for the number of 
ideas.
<P>
	The red book, which will be discussed this weekend, contains 
these words: ``Whose job will go next? For the first time in 
decades, Canadians are seriously concerned that children will be 
less well off than their parents''. That is what the Liberal Party 
wrote in its red book in 1993.
<P>
	What can the Minister of Employment say to young Canadians 
without jobs, when Statistics Canada shows that the Liberal regime 
brought a decrease of 25,000 jobs for 15 to 24 year-olds? What 
does he have to say now?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, he has plenty to say. The 
Minister of Human Resources Development Canada has plenty to 
say. First, he would like to ask young people to stay in school as 
long as possible, and to get the best training possible, for the 
statistics the Leader of the Opposition has just cited do not refer to 
young people with training, whose rate of unemployment is lower 
than the Canadian average, if you look at your figures properly.
<P>
	So, what I have to say to young people today is this: Stay in 
school, get as much training as you can. That is your best chance 
for a job. I can also tell you that what society needs at this point is 
economic stability, political stability. Early this week we had an 
extraordinary speech by the Prime Minister of Canada, to which I 
shall refer again this afternoon. He went to Montreal to offer his 
co-operation, his solidarity to all Canadians to rebuild Montreal. 
And what have we had ever since? The only vision these people are 
capable of is division, constant division and redivision, like the 
hon. member for Rosemont tried to do, when he spoke to us this 
morning of the way Montreal used to be, divided between the 
English and the French.

	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Words, 
words, words, Mr. Speaker. We do not want words, we want action. 
We want job creation.
<P>
	In their notorious red book, the Liberals promised more justice, 
fairness and transparency in the Canadian tax system. But 
remember the Minister of Finance, when he said he would not 
eliminate the GST as his government had promised and naively 
admitted to misinforming the entire population of this country.
<P>
	My question is directed to the Deputy Prime Minister. Now that 
her government has offered a bribe of nearly one billion dollars to 
three maritime provinces so they will harmonize their sales tax 
with the GST, will the Deputy Prime Minister have the courage to 
admit that her government did not abide by its campaign 
promise-and here it comes, in case she forgot-to eliminate the 
GST, not harmonize it, not hide it in the sale price, not shamefully 
waste one billion dollars of Canadian taxpayers money?
<P>
<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
first of all, we have just set up the process for harmonizing sale 
taxes in this country. The Atlantic provinces were the first to get on 
board, after Quebec, because they know it is crucial to job creation.
<P>
	In fact, I wish to congratulate the former Government of Quebec 
for having the courage to harmonize its sales tax, and I congratulate 
the Atlantic provinces, because they want to create jobs and know 
that by reducing their costs and becoming competitive, they will be 
able not only to compete with the other provinces but the United 
States as well. That is how we build a strong economy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I want to congratulate the Government of Quebec, 
because it is doing its job and gives the people real information. It 
does not shamefully waste one billion dollars on political 
compensation for an agreement entered into locally with the 
maritimes. That is what I have to say. I cannot congratulate the 
Minister of Finance.
<P>
	My supplementary is also directed to the Deputy Prime Minister.
<P>
	In the red book, the Liberal government also promised to make 
the tax system more equitable. Will the Deputy Prime Minister 
admit that by refusing for more than three years to initiate a 
thorough tax reform, as the Bloc Quebecois asked it to do, the 
government has reneged on its promises in the red book and even 
perpetuated inequities through its shameful cover-up of the family 
trust scandal?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5681"> 5681 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
this is ridiculous. The hon. member for the opposition knows 
perfectly well that we eliminated all the tax benefits for family 
trusts. I have four pages of tax loopholes here, and I will read them 
to you. They are too long, and I cannot remember them all.
<P>
	Eliminate capital gains tax exemptions of $100,000; eliminate 
tax benefits for limited recourse financing; tighten the rules for 
debt remission; eliminate the use of butterfly transactions, and I 
could go on. We have eliminated the loopholes. Thanks to this 
government, the tax system in Canada is fairer than it has ever 
been.

	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I see 
that the Prime Minister has unveiled yet another piece of Canadian 
fiction, a record of achievements. I am sure that Margaret Atwood 
is just shaking in her pants, as the Prime Minister would say.
<P>
	We have taken a look at the red book and at the Liberal record. 
The reality is that the Prime Minister has broken more promises 
than he has kept. Seventy per cent of the red book promises have 
gone unfulfilled. The Liberals have broken 136 commitments they 
made to Canadians in the last election campaign.
<P>
	I ask the Deputy Prime Minister, how can she imagine that the 
Liberals have kept 80 to 90 per cent of their promises when fully 70 
per cent of the red book promises have gone totally unfulfilled?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, unfortunately the 
member's arithmetic on this one is about as good as it was on the 
fresh start platform.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, that 
kind of an answer is exactly the proof that Canadians sitting in the 
gallery here and right across the country need a fresh start.
<P>
	The imaginary friends in the Prime Minister's life believe that 
the Liberals may have kept their promises but real Canadians will 
not buy it. They remember the Liberal broken promise of jobs, 
jobs, jobs; renegotiating NAFTA; stable multiyear funding for the 
CBC; protecting universal day care and medicare; and their 
promise of course to kill, scrap and abolish the GST. Those are only 
five of the biggest whoppers in the red book. There are 131 more.
<P>
	Why has the Prime Minister resorted to this piece of creative 
opportunism the Liberals have just released today instead of just 
telling Canadians the truth, the plain simple truth, that the Liberal 
Party of Canada, this government, is truly the home of the 
whopper?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, obviously the Liberal 
Party has not done as much as it intended to do in terms of 
completing the promises in the red book. We have only completed 
78 per cent of the promises in the red book.
<P>
<B>(1430)</B>
<P>
	We hope that the people of Canada will give us the confidence to 
continue to govern. We are not perfect, but we are going to do our 
best. Our party is the only party in the history of Canadian politics 
that has actually put its promises in writing completely in advance 
of an election so we could let the people be the judge. That is what 
we intend to do.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, there 
certainly is wisdom in getting a platform out ahead. That is exactly 
what we did last week.
<P>
	Jobs, jobs, jobs. Some promise. There are 1.4 million Canadians 
unemployed. One in four Canadians are worried about the jobs they 
have.
<P>
	Protecting medicare? A $7 billion Liberal cut to social programs, 
with $3 billion of that coming directly out of health care, and the 
Liberals know that.
<P>
	Stable funding for the CBC? The Liberals cut its budget by a 
third.
<P>
	The list of broken promises goes on and on: free votes, an 
independent ethics counsellor-remember that one?-day care 
centres and spaces. ``We will restore Canadians' faith in 
themselves and their government'' was a promise in the red book. I 
can hardly believe it.
<P>
	Why did the government not provide Canadians with a reality 
check, that is, that 62 promises have been kept and 136 promises 
are unfulfilled, instead of this list of imaginary red book 
achievements?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the sad thing about the 
Reform Party and probably the reason it is at single digits in the 
polls is that when the government comes forward with jobs 
initiatives, all it gets from the Reform Party is criticism.
<P>
	We made an announcement earlier this week in Montreal to 
create Canadian jobs in a city which desperately needs them. 
Reformers said nay. We announced a cultural production fund that 
will create 30,000 jobs in Canadian television. They said no. We 
announced projects which put $3 billion into the economy by way 
of infrastructure. The Reform Party said no.
<P>
	The fresh start of the Reform Party would send the Canadian job 
situation into a tailspin. That is why the Canadian public has 
massively rejected the policies of the Reform Party.

	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
its red book, the Liberal Party of Canada accused the Tories of 
having jeopardized Canadian culture with their drastic cuts in 
cultural funding. The Liberal Party promised stable multiyear 
financing for national cultural institutions. However, since it came 
to power, it has cut $350 million in the CBC's budget alone, thus 
forcing the corporation to lay off close to 4,000 cultural workers.
<P>
	My question is for the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Volpe:</B> Now, now.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> You may laugh, all of you 
champions in job creation. Does the minister believe that, in 
making unprecedented cuts such as those inflicted upon CBC by 
her government, she is fulfilling her electoral promises in the areas 
of culture and job creation?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.): </B>Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, when the 
Bloc Quebecois talks about culture it is again filibustering since, 
according to the latest survey conducted by Statistics Canada, of all 
the governments having to make cuts, Quebec's is the one which 
has cut the most in the cultural area.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> Mr. Speaker, one 
does not get taller by stepping on somebody else's head.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Ah, ah.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> My supplementary is for the 
Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Canadian Heritage.
<P>
	Since the Liberals came to power, the CBC French network has 
eliminated 1,300 jobs, mainly in the Montreal area. They are 
telling us they are looking after Montreal and always have, and yet 
most of these 1,300 jobs were lost in the Montreal area.
<P>
	Is it not outrageous that while she is making these cuts, she is 
sinking several million in a flag campaign and in an Information 
Canada type committee?
<P>
<B>(1435)</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, it is such a pity that the 
member is insisting on ridiculing the Quebec government. The fact 
is, according to statistics widely available, for every $1.16 the 
federal government spends in Quebec on Canadian culture, the 
Quebec government only spends 86 cents.
<P>
	I think he should appeal to his head office to solve the Quebec 
culture issue, which is undergoing more drastic cuts at the hands of 
the Quebec government than what Canada is doing.

	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
obviously the Liberals should have called the red book the unread 
book.
<P>
	Yesterday's announcement on books was a big zero for students 
and consumers who will still pay GST on reading materials. This is 
despite the fact that the Liberals have passed a priority resolution 
that their government would ``remove the goods and services tax 
on reading materials''.
<P>
	Can the finance minister explain to these same Liberals 
gathering in Ottawa today for their lovefest why his government 
has reneged on this promise, as well as the eye popper that they 
would axe, scrap and abolish the GST entirely?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member is referring to a resolution that was passed at a 
party convention and is not referring to a commitment of the 
government.
<P>
	There is no doubt that every single member in this House and 
every single member in the Liberal Party would like to eliminate 
the tax on books. The problem very clearly is that we also have to 
deal with a very difficult financial condition in this country and we 
are achieving a balance.
<P>
	The balance is to promote literacy. The way in which we have 
decided to do it is to be selective. Yes, we are going to support 
those who are in the front line in the fight to promote literacy. We 
are going to eliminate the tax on books for schools, libraries, 
municipalities and charities. This is very important. If the hon. 
member does not understand how important it is that we take very 
scarce financial resources and promote literacy, then I wonder what 
in God's name he is doing in this House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
minister takes scarce financial resources and gives them to his well 
heeled buddies at Bombardier. That is what he does.
<P>

<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Colleague, please be very judicious in your choice 
of words.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solberg:</B> How about the red book promise on jobs? The 
Retail Council of Canada has called the government's billion dollar 
harmonization deal a declaration of economic separation because it 
is going to cost $100 million annually in Atlantic Canada. That is 
what the job creators are saying.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5683"> 5683 </A></B>
<P>
	Can the finance minister explain to Canadians why his red book 
promised jobs, jobs, jobs while he is cutting political deals like 
these that mean ``higher costs, lower quality, less selection, higher 
prices and fewer jobs''? That is what they are asking in Atlantic 
Canada.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as 
far as the retail council is concerned, we have made it very clear 
that we are prepared to work with the retail council. We will sit 
with the council to make the transition as painless as possible. 
There is no doubt there are going to be changes. The government 
has said it will be very flexible in the administration of those 
changes.
<P>
	As far as tax inclusive pricing is concerned, public polling has 
been done in the last while which shows overwhelmingly that 
Canadians want tax inclusive pricing. They do not want the sticker 
shock. They want to know what the final price is.
<P>
	Why is it that the Reform Party, which claims to be a populace 
party, wants to take actions which are not in the best interests of 
Canadian consumers?
<P>
	The hon. member for Beaver River wants to talk about reality 
checks. Let us look at reality checks. The day that the famous 
Reform Party program was revealed by the hon. member on the 
CBC what was basically said was that it was going to eliminate 
taxes for people making over $150,000 and the member was caught 
speechless. The provincial premiers said that it would devastate 
their cuts.

	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, during the last election campaign, the Liberal Party 
published a red book that talked about the economic recovery of 
greater Montreal. The Liberals promised to create a joint action 
committee for the development of the greater Montreal area.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My dear colleague, members must not anticipate 
an order of the day, particularly when the same question is 
involved. I will hear the question, but the preamble comes a bit 
close.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe: </B>Mr. Speaker, this is not an opposition day about 
the red book, but about Montreal.
<P>
	I therefore ask the Deputy Prime Minister whether she can tell us 
what became of the promise in this party's electoral platform to 
create a joint action committee for the development of the greater 
Montreal area.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Dear colleague, we seem to be having a debate. I 
see that the minister has risen, and I will allow him to reply, but I 
would prefer that we not have debate at this point.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Martin Cauchon (Secretary of State (Federal Office of 
Regional Development-Quebec), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, a few 
weeks before the last election, we put out an electoral platform 
entitled: ``For the economic recovery of greater Montreal''.
<P>
	If you look at this electoral platform, the majority of the 
promises made by the government have been kept. And what we 
did for Montreal was essentially to have all the departments 
involved in the economic recovery of Montreal take a horizontal 
approach.
<P>
	We followed our vision, and today we see the concrete results. 
Here are a few: Bell Helicopter, in the aerospace industry, Ericsson, 
Biochem Pharma, Merck Frosst, Spar, SR Telecom, Harris, the 
Institut-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My dear colleagues, I hope this will not be about 
Montreal again. Perhaps members could look a bit beyond.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> By all 
means, Mr. Speaker, let us look beyond.
<P>
	In other words, what the Secretary of State for Montreal and 
beyond has just told us is that they did not keep this promise. That 
is clearly what he told us: ``We kept a number of promises, but not 
that one''. Let us try again. Maybe something was done way back 
of beyond.
<P>
	They promised a recovery in housing, thanks to a redevelopment 
program that will be of particular benefit to older neighbourhoods 
and beyond, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	Knowing that the Prime Minister has said that he wants to get out 
of the housing sector, which comes under provincial jurisdiction, 
perhaps he can tell us today whether he will be turning over to 
Quebec the money he promised to invest in Montreal and beyond, 
or whether, once again, this was just so much hot air?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Martin Cauchon (Secretary of State (Federal Office of 
Regional Development-Quebec), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, now they 
are talking about greater Montreal or the surrounding area.
<P>
	I am pleased to say in this House, in this democratic forum, that 
between 1986 and 1993, Quebec received in the order of 29 per 
cent of all federal funds set aside for public housing. In 1995, 
through the efforts of our government, Quebec received 32.2 per 
cent of federal funds set aside for social reform.
<P>
	Discussions were entered into with all the provinces. They are 
proceeding well with the province of Quebec, obviously, but there 
is not yet any concrete result. But Quebec is receiving its full share 
of the pie, and then some, as far as public housing goes.

the Prime Minister said: ``I am not going to buy votes with the

Bombardier, a company that had a profit of $167 million for the six

with an investment approach. There is an investment by the federal 
government which requires full repayment and upon profits being 
made, a sharing of the profits in question. But then again, that is not 
a matter that the Reform Party is used to seeing generally in the 
repayment of moneys on matters like this.
<P>
	The federal government is not involved in the business of giving 
grants. We simply give moneys in an investment and then require 
repayment. That is what has happened.
<P>
	It is strange that Reform Party members continuously harp on 
matters such as this but never mention investments that are made in 
western Canada, in particular in British Columbia and Alberta. 
They never mention $9 million to Paprican, never. They never 
mention the benefits that the oil industry is receiving in Alberta 
that will create 40,000 permanent jobs. They concentrate only on 
Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Okanagan Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to refer the hon. secretary to the fresh start book. He will 
see that precisely what we are going to do is eliminate grants and 
subsidies and do away with regional granting agencies.
<P>
	Let me give the spokesperson for the Prime Minister some facts. 
Once Canadians have paid the interest on the so-called loan to 
Bombardier, the cost will be about $150 million, not $87 million. It 
is estimated that 1,000 jobs will be created on this, $150,000 per 
job. If the money had been left to the taxpayer, some 5,000 jobs 
could have been created.
<P>
	How does the spokesperson for the Prime Minister explain that 
to the jobless people of Canada?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morris Bodnar (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Minister for the Atlantic Canada Opportunities 
Agency and Minister of Western Economic Diversification, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is very interesting again that Reformers 
concentrate on this matter when we have a company that is a world 
class manufacturer of airplanes. They concentrate on matters like 
this.
<P>
	The hon. member mentioned elimination of grants in their 
programs. They talk about the elimination of regional agencies as 
well. They would eliminate all the work that has been created in 
areas such as western Canada by organizations like western 
diversification, Hitachi in Saskatoon and other industries. They are 
trying to do that. That is unfair to regions that are developing.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="UNEMPLOYMENTINSURANCE">UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE</A></H3>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	Before the Liberals came to office, the previous government 
made major cuts to unemployment insurance. In Montreal, these 
cuts amounted to over $800 million over four years. The Liberals, 
who were then in opposition, strongly condemned these cuts to 
unemployment insurance. Some members who are now ministers 
even took part in a 1993 demonstration in Montreal in bitter cold 
temperatures.
<P>
	What did they do after coming to power? Their successive 
reforms to unemployment insurance will deprive Quebec of 
benefits totalling $900 million this year and $1.2 billion by the year 
2001.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister admit that his government's past and 
future cuts to unemployment insurance will exceed $900 million 
this year-I am adding the 1994 reform to the EI reform-and $1.2 
billion in 2001?
<P>
<B>(1450)</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the last calculation was a little 
tricky, but I will try to understand it.
<P>
	I can assure you that the shift from unemployment to 
employment insurance reflects the new economy we referred to 
earlier. The hon. member for Mercier should realize that, instead of 
the passive measures favoured in the past, by the year 
2000-which you mentioned-we will have reinvested $2.7 billion 
in active measures so that Canadians can receive the training they 
need to join the labour force.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5685"> 5685 </A></B>
<P>
	Thanks to this EI reform, an additional 500,000 Canadians will 
now be eligible to receive benefits, that is to say, 500,000 
Canadians who were not previously covered by unemployment 
insurance will now qualify. These people include part time 
workers and women from Montreal's east end, which you know 
very well, my hon. friend from Mercier.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleagues, you must always address the 
Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
unacceptable for the minister to have trouble with his figures, when 
this is what he should focus on.
<P>
	If he is not aware that the successive cuts made in Quebec in 
1994, 1995 and 1996 will exceed $900 million this year and 
amount to $1.2 billion in 2001, I wonder what he is doing in that 
job.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>As you know, Mr. Speaker, it is important to 
set the record straight and look at the facts. In 1994, Quebec 
received close to 25 per cent of federal spending in some areas and 
accounted for 21 per cent of federal revenues.
<P>
	Can they not look at the whole picture instead of focusing on one 
particular area? It is important to look at our overall policies and 
not make judgments based on one particular case. Quebecers 
receive a very large share of total federal spending. As far as 
employment insurance is concerned, they have not been penalized 
any more than other Canadians, quite the contrary. All Canadians 
are now participating in an active employment system which 
values work. Quebecers, like all Canadians, benefit from a system 
that values work and, generally speaking, Quebecers benefit 
greatly from federal spending.

	In its red book, the Liberal Party made the following promise,

million, thereby breaking another election promise?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and 
Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
within months of our taking office, it became very clear that the 
previous government had left its fiscal house in much worse shape 
than we had expected, with the deficit having actually risen to $45 
billion.
<P>
	Under the circumstances, we had no choice but to take much 
more drastic measures than those contemplated in the red book 
regarding professional services contracts. We immediately realized 
that a program review had to be put in place to look not only at 
reducing professional services by 15 per cent but also at ways of 
realignign many government programs.
<P>
	By implementing a better idea than the one announced in the red

	The House resumed consideration of the motion, of the 
amendment and of the amendment to the amendment
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to speak to the Bloc Quebecois motion which deals with 
the economic future of the city of Montreal. As I begin my remarks 
it is important to make reference to what was said by hon. members 
during the debate before question period.
<P>
	The hon. member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce pointed, as did 
other Liberal members, to separatism as being the source of the 
problems in Quebec. He was blaming the separatist movement for 
all the economic problems in Quebec. That was the common theme 
which I heard from other Liberal members throughout the morning.
<P>
	On the other hand, the Bloc Quebecois members were pointing 
to the federal government and saying that it had not given Montreal 
enough support. It had not given Montreal enough goodies, 
according to the motion. It says in the motion that Montreal has not 
been given an equitable allocation of federal purchases of goods 
and services, et cetera.
<P>
	Suffice it to say that obviously both sides are not right. I would 
argue that both sides in this dispute, the federal government 
represented by the Liberals, and the province represented by the 
Bloc Quebecois, can accept all kinds of responsibility for the 
problems in Montreal.
<P>
	It is no secret that Montreal is not the city it once was. The hon. 
member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce made reference to that. He lives 
there. He pointed out that several years ago Montreal was a vibrant 
and growing city, that there were all kinds of entrepreneurs. It was 
an international city. Today it still is, but it is certainly a shadow of 
the city it once was. Perhaps it is important, while we are having 
this debate, to ask what happened between the 1960s and early 
1970s and today.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5688"> 5688 </A></B>
<P>
	There have been many changes, not the least of which has been 
the rise of separatism and a very heavy tax load.  There is a 
tremendous amount of debt in this country. We have seen an 
environment, really not for job creation but quite to the contrary, an 
environment that scares off the job creators for two reasons, one of 
them economic. The other is political. Obviously in that type of 
environment we cannot see a prosperous economy.
<P>
<B>(1510)</B>
<P>
	It is important to lay out some of the facts when we are talking 
about the economic problems facing the great city of Montreal. It is 
a great city. I think all Canadians would like to see it restored to its 
former greatness.
<P>
	Since the present government came to power it has added 
somewhere in the range of $103 billion more in debt on to the 
overall debt load in the country. That means average taxpayers owe 
on behalf of the federal government about $45,000 right now or 
$290 per month of their taxes go just to pay the interest on the debt. 
That is $290 per taxpayer. It is an incredible amount of money.
<P>
	A lot of people will be alarmed to learn, and I am certain this 
applies even more so to people in Quebec because of the 
traditionally high tax load there, but since the Liberal government 
came to power the average family's purchasing power has declined 
by $3,000 a year. That is unbelievable. It points to part of the cause 
for the economic woes in Montreal.
<P>
	Since the government has come to power its tax revenues have 
rocketed upward by $23 billion more by the end of its four year 
mandate than when it came to power. That is a tremendous amount 
of money, a huge increase in its overall revenues.
<P>
	When we reflect back on the promises of the last campaign, 
where the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister and the 
current finance minister were running around saying there would 
be jobs, jobs, jobs, all of the facts known today make that promise 
sound very empty and very hollow.
<P>
	I will recount some of the facts on unemployment. As members 
of the Bloc Quebecois know, as do many members of the Liberal 
Party who are members from the Montreal region, Montreal has 
been hit perhaps harder than almost any major city in the country 
with respect to unemployment. However, it truly is a nationwide 
problem. Today 1.4 million people are unemployed.
<P>
	It is interesting to look back over the history of the last quarter 
century to see how the rise in unemployment has paralleled the rise 
in indebtedness in this country. When former Prime Minister 
Trudeau was beginning his spending spree back in 1972 about half 
a million people were unemployed, 535,000 people if my memory 
serves me right. Ever since then unemployment has been on the 
rise. It virtually mirrors the rise in indebtedness in the country.
<P>
	At that point the debt was somewhere in the range of $13 billion. 
Today it is $600 billion. Approximately 500,000 people were 
unemployed. Today it is 1.4 million. It did not matter what political 
party was in power. When the Liberals were in government, 
unemployment was bad and getting worse. When the Tories took 
over they even made it worse. It was up to 1.6 million people by the 
time they had their way with the economy. They added another 
$300 billion in debt. Obviously they did not do a very good job 
either.
<P>
	Today there are 1.4 million unemployed people across the 
country, not to mention the two million to three million under 
employed. When we speak of under employed it is important that 
we define our terms. We are speaking of people who are in 
positions that really are beneath the skills they have spent a lot a 
money to acquire. All kinds of people are working in low wage jobs 
when they have been trained to be in jobs that are far more worthy 
of their abilities.
<P>
	This blocks people who are unskilled from getting some of the 
wages where skills really are not as required. The people whom 
that really hurts are the youth. That is why we have 18 per cent 
youth unemployment in Canada today.
<P>
<B>(1515 )</B>
<P>
	On the eve of the Liberal convention, when a lot of young 
Liberals will be coming to town, I hope they are asking some tough 
questions of their own government about why youth 
unemployment continues to be as high as it is today.
<P>
	However, that is not the whole job story. We have about another 
500,000 to 1 million people who have fallen through the cracks, 
people who are no longer reported in the unemployment statistics 
because they have given up looking for work. We also have one in 
four Canadians who are very concerned about their future. They do 
not know if their job is going to be there tomorrow.
<P>
	I think I can say this is a fact, and I know hon. members in the 
Bloc Quebecois and members from all sides who come from 
Quebec will acknowledge that in Quebec the unemployment 
situation is certainly more pronounced than just about anywhere 
else with the exception of Atlantic Canada.
<P>
	I have laid out a pretty bleak situation. It sounds pretty bad and it 
certainly is. However, that does not mean that we cannot somehow 
get out of this terrible mess.
<P>
	The Reform Party has recently laid out its platform for helping 
not only the people of Quebec and Montreal, but people from all 
across the country. We believe that Canada needs to be defined by 
its citizens, not by its government. The debate over the last couple 
of days really makes the point. We have had all kinds of 
accusations flying back and forth in the House in the last couple of 
days because Bloc members say that we do not  give enough money 
to Quebec and specifically to Montreal. Meanwhile, the 
government 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5689"> 5689 </A></B>
<P>
is saying it gives lots. It just gave $87 million to Bombardier in 
Montreal. However, clearly that has not solved the situation.
<P>
	Governments giving money to big companies, corporate welfare, 
does not work. It does not work when we flood one province with a 
whole bunch of money. That clearly has not helped Quebecers. 
Instead of that why do we not go back and do it the way that we 
used to, the way that created all those jobs back in the 1960s and 
1970s that the hon. member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce was talking 
when he was bragging about the Montreal of old. When we talk 
about that we are talking creating an environment where all the job 
producers have the incentive to go out there and create jobs.
<P>
	How do we get there from where we are at today with a $600 
billion debt, a deficit of $28 billion, record high taxes and falling 
disposable income? Obviously the solutions are not easy. However, 
the Reform Party thinks it does have the solution. We believe we 
have a good plan. We say that the first thing we have to do is make 
the government smaller. We have laid out a plan whereby we would 
cut spending by $15 billion and we would have a $94 billion federal 
government, a smaller federal government that is not in the face of 
Canadians at every level, that is not in the face of the people of 
Quebec who have said over and over again that they do not want all 
this intrusion from the federal government. We are happy to help 
make that happen.
<P>
	Not only that, we want a federal government that will do 10 jobs 
well in areas like criminal justice; knocking down internal trade 
barriers instead of building them up like it has done with the 
harmonization deal; defence, which obviously needs a lot more 
attention from the government than it is currently getting because it 
is truly a mess, certainly at the higher echelons. We would also like 
the federal government to pay more attention to foreign affairs and 
international trade and do 10 things well instead of trying to do 25 
things and obviously doing them very poorly.
<P>
	What we would like to see is a tax freedom day that falls in April 
instead of one that falls in June, July or August. People are taxed to 
the max. They can barely move. It puts a tremendous stress not 
only on the job creators out there but all those people who are 
struggling to make a living and those families that have both 
parents working even sometimes when they do not necessarily 
want to have both parents working, which creates tremendous 
stress in families. What we want is 5 per cent unemployment, not 
10 per cent, not 12 per cent, not 18 per cent like we have for young 
people today. We want 5 per cent unemployment like we have 
south of the border. Somehow the Americans are able to have low 
unemployment. Certainly we should be able to have the same level 
of unemployment. We used to have it in this country.
<P>
<B>(1520 )</B>
<P>
	When I speak of creating jobs through smaller government and 
lower taxes, I will talk about some specific ways we can do that. 
The first priority is to balance the budget. Hon. members across the 
way, who may not have had a chance to read our document, have 
made the accusation that we want to go ahead and start cutting 
taxes and not balance the budget first.
<P>
	I assure my friends across the way that is not the case. We 
believe that would be very irresponsible, particularly when we are 
in such a precarious position with a debt of $600 billion. So we say 
let us balance the budget first. We would do that by reducing 
government spending by about $15 billion. We would run a very 
lean and efficient $94 billion government.
<P>
	We would balance that budget by March 31, 1999. We would 
launch a debt retirement program. We would have balanced budget 
legislation. We would have free trade between provinces and of 
course we would have much lower taxes than we have today. The 
short answer to people who want to know how much tax relief they 
would get would be $2,000 for the average Canadian family by the 
year 2000. We propose a number of ways to make that happen.
<P>
	We would like to increase the basic personal exemption from 
$6,456 to $7,900. We would also like to increase the spousal 
amount from $5,380 to $7,900. Those two measures alone will 
obviously affect every person who files a tax form if their basic 
personal exemption were to go up. It will obviously affect every 
married couple in the country to give them much lower taxes than 
they face today.
<P>
	We speak in favour of extending the $3,000 to $5,000 child care 
deduction to all parents, not just people who send their children out 
to day care, even to people who look after their children at home. 
We think they are just as valuable when it comes to providing 
parenting. It is time in this country that we acknowledge the great 
job that parents do in raising their children by extending the child 
care deduction to all parents. That makes sense to me. It is treating 
people equally.
<P>
	We believe that we must eliminate the 3 per cent and 5 per cent 
Conservative surtaxes. The Tories were great ones for raising taxes. 
Time after time they raised taxes and they spent more and more. 
We have to begin to repeal some of that.
<P>
	We believe that we have to cut UI premiums by 28 per cent and 
we have to cut capital gains tax in half. If we could cut UI 
premiums, it would provide an immediate stimulus for job creation 
in this country.
<P>
	Here is where we get back to Montreal. Many people on both 
sides of the House have been talking about the lack of jobs in 
Montreal, and it is truly a national disgrace. I do not know how else 
to word it. Back in the early seventies we had unemployment rates 
of 4 per cent  and 5 per cent in Canada. Now it is rocketing upward 
well into the double digits in Montreal, well into the double digits 
in Atlantic Canada, well into the double digits in the entire country, 
especially for youth.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5690"> 5690 </A></B>
<P>
	We have a tremendous unemployment problem in this country. 
There is barely an economist in Canada who has not pointed to the 
high UI premiums as one of the principle reasons for high 
unemployment rates. Surely the hon. finance minister and 
members across the way can see this is an impediment to job 
creation.
<P>
	We have to give people some incentive to create jobs. One of the 
best ways is to balance the budget and then to bring down 
immediate reductions in unemployment insurance premiums.
<P>
	We speak about cutting capital gains taxes in half. We have a 
private sector that is dying to invest in the Canadian economy. If 
we cut the inclusion rate in half for capital gains, we will have all 
kinds of capital flooding into the country. There will be all kinds of 
people who want to invest in Canadian business and create the 
types of jobs that people in Montreal and people everywhere need.
<P>
	On the one hand, the finance minister says ``hey, we don't need 
tax cuts, don't worry about it, interest rates will do the job''.
<P>
<B>(1525)</B>
<P>
	Obviously the finance minister and the Prime Minister do not 
believe their own story or they would not be granting Bombardier 
$85 million plus in the form of an interest free loan. They just 
finished saying that low interest rates will spur that kind of 
investment on their own. Obviously they do not believe their own 
story.
<P>
	The difference between the Reform Party and the old 
Liberal-Tory Parties has become fairly clear. The old parties 
believe in bigger government, higher taxes, that government 
should tell you how to raise and discipline your children. They will 
be in your face at every turn. They have proven when they do that 
they have ruined just about everything they have touched.
<P>
	On the other hand, the Reform Party presents a new vision, a 
fresh start, as we say. Reform believe that government should be 
smaller. Canadians should be given the tools to do more of the 
providing for themselves instead of taking their money and 
funnelling it through a big, fat inefficient government and then 
having that government tell them what they are going to do with the 
money. Why not let people keep that money? Why not let 
Canadians keep the money themselves? Why do we keep taking the 
money away and putting tremendous strain on individuals and 
families across the country? This is hugely punitive to all the 
people who create the jobs, the people to whom the government 
should be accountable.
<P>
	In conclusion, I urge the government to drop its stand against tax 
relief for Canadians, to drop its line that low interest rates are good 
enough when clearly it does not believe it itself. Clearly it has 
failed at every step when it has to hand out big grants to its friends 
in Montreal. Obviously it does not believe its own story. Obviously 
it does not believe it is working.
<P>
	I encourage hon. members across the way and people in the Bloc 
Quebecois to quit pointing fingers at each other and look at how 
their own programs are hurting the economy in Montreal and right 
across the country. Look at the Reform approach of giving 
Canadians the tools in the form of lower taxes to begin to look after 
themselves and to create jobs in the Canadian economy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jesse Flis (Parkdale-High Park, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened attentively to the hon. member from the Reform Party 
participating in this debate. Reform's solution to help the sagging 
economy in Montreal is to cut even more.
<P>
	Reform is going to cut $15 billion if it ever forms a government. 
This would mean smaller transfer payments to the provinces. He 
talked about free trade with the provinces and I agree with him on 
that. How will he or his party achieve free trade with Quebec when 
every day, every week in this House the Reform Party does nothing 
but Quebec bashing? Then the Reform is going to sit down with it 
and negotiate free trade. Good luck. I would like to know how it 
plans to do that.
<P>
	Reform is going to operate with a smaller government. Mr. 
Speaker, I am sure your constituents and mine are complaining now 
that we have cut government too far. There are people who want to 
have questions answered from Revenue Canada and from 
immigration. We have already, through our program review, cut the 
public service by 45,000 and probably another 10,000. The public 
service has been cut to the bone now. Reform wants to cut not to the 
bone but into the bone. It claims it is listening to grassroots 
Canadians. So am I and grassroots Canadians are saying do not cut 
anymore. They want the public service to serve them when they 
need it.
<P>
<B>(1530 )</B>
<P>
	My intervention is more of a comment, but I would like the 
member to answer some of these questions. On the one hand 
Reform members continually bash Quebec. Of course Montreal is 
the capital city and the hub of the province and the country.
<P>
	I think Reform fails to recognize that cities like Montreal, 
Vancouver and Toronto are still rated by objective international 
pollsters as the three best cities in the world next to Paris and 
London. If we compare Montreal, Vancouver and Toronto with 
U.S. cities, Boston will place third, whereas Montreal will still 
place in the top ten.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5691"> 5691 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solberg:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am certain the hon. member did 
not mean to say that Montreal was the capital city of Quebec; I 
think he meant Quebec City.
<P>
	One thing I want to point out to the hon. member is that it was 
the member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce who pointed out that 
Montreal is not the city it used to be.
<P>
	The hon. member has to acknowledge that over the last 25 years 
Liberal governments have been in power in this country, with the 
exception of the horrendous Tory government. It did almost as 
much damage as the Liberal governments have done over the many 
years they have been around.
<P>
	The member talked about cuts in services and cuts to staffing in 
the revenue and immigration departments. I do not hear complaints 
about those cuts nearly as much as I hear complaints about cuts to 
health care.
<P>
	Government members campaigned as being the saviours of 
medicare. Then they turned around and cut $7 billion out of 
transfers to the provinces, over $3 billion of which went to health 
care. I sat before the finance committee today and heard all kinds 
of health care professionals pound on the desk very forthrightly 
because they are so frustrated. They know that on the one hand the 
federal government is saying that it is the saviour of health care and 
do not dare try and break the Canada Health Act. Then the Liberals 
turn around and cut every cent they can out of it and tell people to 
go and do what they can. That is blatant hypocrisy.
<P>
	People from Ontario, Quebec, Saskatchewan and Manitoba who 
protest in front of legislatures about cuts to hospital funding should 
get on a plane and come and protest on the lawn of the House of 
Commons because this where the problem began. There is the 
duplicity of the government which on the one hand says it is the 
saviour of health care and on the other hand cuts the heart out of it.
<P>
	On the question of how we would deal with Quebec, the member 
is absolutely wrong when he says that we bash Quebec every day. 
That is completely false. We are very, very upset about the 
Bombardier deal. However we are the ones who propose to give 
Quebecers the tools in the form of lower taxes. One-quarter of all 
taxpayers in the country come from Quebec. We are going to give 
three million people in Quebec lower taxes. A tremendous amount 
of stimulus will go into the economy of Quebec, $2,000 per family 
by the year 2000 in the province of Quebec. They will create a 
tremendous amount of their own jobs.
<P>
	I am sure the member has said when he is speaking to his 
constituents that small business creates jobs in this country. Then 
let us give the people who create the jobs the tools to create them.
<P>
	On the political side, we say let us give the people of Quebec and 
the Government of Quebec the tools they need to chart the future of 
Quebec. The people of  Quebec do have a unique language, a 
unique culture and a unique history. Let us give them the tools and 
give them the jurisdiction to determine the future of the people of 
Quebec. That would go over well if every province had to do that.
<P>
	That is how we are going to deal with the people of Quebec and 
the Quebec government.
<P>

<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> We have only about 60 seconds left. The hon. 
member for Bourassa has 30 seconds.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I also think 
if there is a political party in Canada which is particularly 
anti-Quebec, it is the Reform Party.
<P>
<B>(1535)</B>
<P>
	How can you explain that over the last year, so many Albertans 
have come in Montreal to tell people in Quebec they care for them 
and want them as part of Canada, when your attitude is so totally 
anti-Quebec?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solberg:</B> Mr. Speaker, it was a rather incoherent question 
but I can guarantee that the people of Alberta do want to see 
Quebecers stay in this country. The best way to show that is for the 
federal government to create an environment for economic growth 
on the one hand, and on the other hand provide a decentralized 
Canada that will allow Quebecers and all Canadians to realize their 
aspirations within the broad framework of what constitutes 
Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for giving me the 
floor to address the issue of the future of Montreal, an issue that is 
so very close to my heart.
<P>
	Today's opposition motion will allow us to give the public the 
facts, which have been totally misrepresented. I am extremely 
pleased to rise on this issue, since, as you know, I got into politics 
earlier this year, in January 1996, because, among other reasons, I 
was dismayed by the situation Montreal was in. I thought that the 
only way to boost Montreal's economy was to ensure that Canada 
is a vibrant country, with a modern and flexible federalism that 
would allow Montreal to work well. That is the underlying reason 
of my commitment, and that is why I rise in the House today as the 
member of Parliament for Papineau-Saint-Michel, representing 
eastern Montreal, the Montreal that is having a rough time, the 
Montreal that concerns us so much.
<P>
	Of course, the Prime Minister had absolutely no difficulty 
recognizing earlier this week that Montreal is the economic 
mainspring of Quebec. Montreal has always been, is, and will 
always remain the economic and cultural mainspring of Quebec 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5692"> 5692 </A></B>
<P>
society. Besides, members opposite are among those who have 
been insisting for  years on considering Montreal merely a region 
like any other, always reminding Montreal that it is only one region 
among others, whereas we have always recognized its role as an 
economic mainspring. So, the first words of the motion reflect the 
bad faith of opposition members who would have us believe they 
themselves do not recognize Montreal as the economic mainspring 
of Quebec.
<P>
	Moreover, in the speech he made last Tuesday, the Prime 
Minister of Canada went so far as to say that Montreal is not only 
the economic mainspring of Quebec, but one of the economic 
engines of Canada. When the Montreal economy is in dire straits, 
as it is right now, the Canadian economy as a whole is in trouble.
<P>
	Millions of Canadian citizens feel attached to Montreal. Millions 
of Canadian citizens feel some kind of attachment for Montreal, 
which I appreciate and find very encouraging, because when we 
talk about Montreal in cabinet or in caucus, I can always tell that 
the government members have a lot of sympathy for Montreal. 
Canadians love the city of Montreal. They recognize that Montreal 
is crucial both to the Quebec society and to the future of Canada. I 
think it is extremely important to recognize this.
<P>
	Here is what struck me these last few days. I am quite new to 
politics and I may be rather naive but I am stunned to see that, 
although the Prime Minister of Canada made an important speech 
in front of the Montreal Chamber of Commerce, last Tuesday, 
holding out his hand to the Quebec government, the private sector, 
the community sector, the co-operative sectors, the municipal 
governments in Montreal and the vicinity in a speech which was 
meant to be constructive and unifying, his speech was met 
yesterday and today in question period with anger and attempts to 
revive old illusions that are completely out of date in a modern 
Quebec. And I say to the members opposite: this is 1996, please 
bring yourselves up to date and forget last century's divisions, and 
decisions that were, in some cases, made at the turn of the century 
and which they are trying to update with an anti-Quebec twist. This 
is pure nonsense.
<P>
<B>(1540)</B>
<P>
	What I can say is that we, in the Government of Canada, are 
totally pro-Montreal. The Prime Minister, the head of our 
government, made a speech the Quebec government did not 
ridicule fortunately. The Governement of Quebec welcomed the 
Prime Minister's speech because we want to transform Montreal 
into a job site with a strong job potential for the years to come.
<P>
	What did we have since then? Not a word on the openness shown 
by the Prime Minister, not a word on the pro-Montreal and 
pro-Quebec constructive approach he took by inviting all 
stakeholders of the private sector and community groups. I was 
shocked by this absolutely  mean attitude. What I am afraid of is 
that they are not interested in Montreal's well-being, but, on the 
contrary, in a return to the old divisions.
<P>
	In my office, this morning, I was listening with only half an ear 
to the hon. member for Rosemont, who was reminding us of the old 
rivalries when Montreal was an anglophone city, when the 
anglophones exploited the poor French Canadians who suffered so 
much. They are constantly trying to bring us back to the past, to 
situations which, for the most part, are no longer true in modern 
Quebec.
<P>
	The only way for Montreal to regain its place in the sun, to 
become a prominent economic pole again is to stop reviving the old 
hatreds and divisions. Really, the only vision that comes from the 
opposition, from the Bloc which calls itself Quebecois-but which, 
I have more and more the impression, should be called 
anti-Quebecois-is a vision of division. A vision of division, of 
constant division between people.
<P>
	They try to divide us when we know that we can accomplish so 
much more by staying together. They disappoint me because this is 
not what Montreal needs right now. What Montreal needs is that we 
all work together: the Government of Canada, the government of 
Quebec, the private sector, the labour unions and the community 
sector. This is what we want and the hon. members opposite have 
nothing to offer except division, they did nothing to make any true 
commitment or to create a collective commitment.
<P>
	Fortunately, they do not reflect the reaction of Quebec's premier 
to the great speech made by the Prime Minister of Canada, who 
made all Canadians aware of the needs of Montreal.
<P>
	Do Quebecers get their fair share in Canada? For the past 130 
years, Quebecers have chosen Canada every time they were asked, 
even when all kinds of gimmicks were used to make them say what 
they did not mean. Why is that? Because, in the end, Quebecers 
know very well that they get their fair share in Canada. We must 
see Canada as a land of freedom, individual growth, respect and 
tolerance. This is a lot more interesting than the divisions and 
racial hatred that some people would like to impose on us by 
constantly referring to the old myths of the past when Montreal was 
an English-speaking city.
<P>
	I cannot believe that I am still hearing today, in 1996, the things I 
heard this morning. I sincerely hope people will realize that 
Quebec's society includes all the people, whatever their language 
or their ethnic origin. This is the only Montreal that can reclaim its 
place under the sun. This is the Montreal we need, the Montreal 
that must shine.
<P>
	The Government of Canada, under the leadership of the Prime 
Minister, has taken a structuring approach where various federal 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5693"> 5693 </A></B>
<P>
departments have their own line of  action. These lines of action are 
very interesting and reflect our government's agenda.
<P>
	We want to promote the development of the science and 
technology sector, which is absolutely essential in the new 
knowledge-based economy towards which we are moving. We are 
doing all we can in the area of international development. Most 
jobs that are created today are related to international trade. Our 
country is open to international trade and that is extremely 
important.
<P>
	Our third line of action within our structuring approach is small 
business development.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	The development of the cultural and tourism industries will also 
be extremely important, as well as local economic and social 
development, which is my responsibility as Canada's Minister of 
Human Resources Development.
<P>
	A few moments ago, the member for Mercier was trying to tell 
me again that the poor Quebecers did not get their fair share in the 
new employment insurance program, that our reform was not fair 
to Quebecers, when in fact local economic and social development 
is our main concern. The main purpose of our employment 
insurance reform is precisely to help the most vulnerable people in 
our society re-enter the workforce by investing much more money 
than we did before under the unemployment insurance program to 
give them access to the training that will allow them to re-enter the 
workforce.
<P>
	Do Quebecers not get their fair share? If you look at the figures, 
in 1995, Quebecers received 45 per cent of employment insurance 
transfers, or $4.7 billion, which is $1.2 billion more than the $3.5 
billion they contributed.
<P>
	And in how many other areas is this true? We do not even want to 
get into this kind of highly divisive propaganda at a time when the 
Prime Minister is extending his hand to try to rebuild Montreal, and 
all we are hearing is insults, to the point where it was insinuated 
that the Prime Minister was shedding crocodile tears because he 
said he was sorry about the state of Montreal's economy. Where are 
these people coming from?
<P>
	This reminds me of August or September when Quebec's finance 
minister, Mr. Landry, thought we were not taking statistics 
seriously. He even mentioned me specifically, the minister 
standing before you, who has spent his life working for the 
development of Montreal's economy, of its business community, 
helping it to take its first steps in international markets, as an 
international management consultant.
<P>
	This is nothing more than old style political fighting. Its 
approach is to attack people's motivation, trying to play on our 
prejudices, and we are not having any of it.
<P>
	We think that this narrow partisan discourse, which is unable to 
rise to the challenge of actually building a society, will get what it 
deserves from Quebecers in due course.
<P>
	When I hear the name Bloc Quebecois, I can assure you of one 
thing, and all Canadians must know this, and that is that Quebecers 
are far above this divisive mentality, that they are people with a 
different ideal, a much more elevated community and economic 
ideal.
<P>
	I think it important to reassure the Canadian people at this time 
that the Bloc Quebecois represents a certain part of the population 
and that we will see a sharp decline in its numbers over the coming 
years. In any event, Quebec's share of federal research and 
development spending, which is often mentioned, and I have no 
choice but to speak about it, because of all the figures that have 
been given, has gone from 14 per cent in 1979 to 24 per cent in 
1994-95.
<P>
	In 1994-95, Quebec received close to 23 per cent of the funds 
available for research and development from the Department of 
National Defence. In 1992-93, Quebec businesses received 33 per 
cent of grants and 33 per cent of federal research and development 
contracts. In 1992-93, Quebec universities received 26 per cent of 
federal research and development grants to Canadian universities.
<P>
	Early this week, the Prime Minister announced an $87 million 
investment in Bombardier as part of a technology partnership. 
What did I hear this morning? I heard people saying: ``We do not 
need grants, what we want is action and policies''.
<P>
	They want words, political decisions. They have asked us for 
policies and told us they do not want grants.
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
	We give them the focus of our developmental policy, we show 
them Team Canada proudly carrying the products of Quebecers and 
other Canadians into the international markets. We show them a 
Prime Minister of Canada, who has taken those products all over 
the world, which they have always opposed because they do not 
want international development, they do not want to be part of 
Team Canada, despite the great business success these 
undertakings have enjoyed so far.
<P>
	Just since the time I became a member of this House, a mere 
seven months ago, I have seen how many Montreal businesses have 
received the funding they over there claim they want nothing of. 
Since this morning I have heard nothing but ``We do not want 
grants, we want policies''.
<P>
	I can tell you, however, that what Quebecers want is more than 
words, more than political slogans. What they want is economic 
action. They want partnerships based on returnable contributions, 
for that is where business is at these days. Such was the case early 
this week with  Bombardier, with $87 million in repayable funds, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5694"> 5694 </A></B>
<P>
because we are sharing the technological risk involved, but we 
have confidence.
<P>
	How much has the Canadian government invested in 
Bombardier, which is in the process of moving up from the 
sixth-ranking aerospace company in the world to the fourth? We 
are, of course, delighted with this loan, and I am looking at the list 
of companies, ones like Bell Helicopter, Delisle Foods, Galderma, 
businesses in which we have invested jointly with the Government 
of Quebec. It cannot be such a bad thing as that, if Quebec was also 
involved. Why tell us they want no subsidies, when extremely 
important investments are exactly what is bringing about the 
restructuring of Montreal?
<P>
	I can tell you that what we need at this time is unity and union. 
We need to unite all of our strengths in order to find the strength 
Montreal needs. I am speaking of the east, I am speaking of the 
pro-east group, in which we invested as a government, in the local 
community. Those people are doing an absolutely remarkable job. 
We, the Government of Canada, are there one hundred per cent, 
attuned to the needs of the people of the Montreal region.
<P>
	But the Government of Canada is proposing tangible actions, 
useful actions in order to make Montreal become a great city in 
Quebec and in Canada. We want to help Montreal to be a great 
North American metropolis.
<P>
	We will continue to act in the most structured possible way, with 
employment as a priority. Employment remains our governments's 
priority. We have put some order in our fiscal house and we are 
extremely proud of this achievement. We have transformed 
employment insurance into a very modern system, which takes into 
account the reality of the new economy and covers 500,000 more 
Canadians, many of whom are women from the eastern part of 
Montreal, who had part time jobs.
<P>
	This government intends to continue to improve economic 
growth, employment and the new economy and to work for the 
young people. I am proud to see that there are some healthy 
economic sectors in Montreal. A part of Montreal may be in a 
tough situation but there is also another part of it which is 
economically well. I know the people on the other side rarely talk 
about that successful Montreal because it rarely is on their political 
side.
<P>
	Indeed, the successful Montreal is not on their side because it is 
made of people who have confidence in themselves. They are not 
people who are mean and suspicious, who are afraid of their 
neighbours and who refuse to share their sovereignty with them. 
The successful Montreal is the Montreal of aeronautics, 
biotechnology, pharmaceutical industry, telecommunications, 
information technologies and multimedia. It is this Montreal the 
Canadian government stood by and has helped in priority for many 
years.  Montreal, the Montreal that is doing so well, politically 
supports our approach.
<P>
	That is why they do not want to talk about the Montreal that is 
thriving, because it happens to reject this option of suspicion and 
fear that the neighbours may have done something. That is not our 
approach. We are faced with the tremendous challenge of helping 
the other Montreal which is having trouble adjusting to the new 
economy.
<P>
	We are there. We now have an investment climate with the 
lowest interest rates we have known in 38 years. Now that is an 
extraordinary achievement. Our opposition friends should show the 
same respect we showed the Government of Quebec and the mayor 
of Montreal, Mayor Bourque, who was very pleased with the Prime 
Minister's speech.
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
	If, after the offer made at the beginning of this week, they had 
the decency to say well, we will have to do better than we have so 
far because there is still a part of Montreal that is in trouble, if they 
did, we would be able to do something, because we would all be 
working together.
<P>
	There will be a summit meeting in Quebec on the weekend, an 
important one. We will be watching it very closely. I also want to 
wish all participants in this summit the best of luck, so that by the 
end of the month, when the summit takes place, we will have some 
tangible results. We are going to look at these results, and I can tell 
you right now the Government of Canada will be there. It intends to 
meet its commitments, and we will be glad to continue to help the 
people of Montreal.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leblanc (Longueuil):</B> Mr. Speaker, to say that Montreal is 
not in such bad shape, I agree. It has its problems, but it is not in 
such bad shape. But to say that Montreal is in a good shape, 
referring to the action of the federal government these last twenty 
years, I think that the speech the Prime Minister made in Montreal 
this week does not reflect the reality. I will not go so far to say that 
such a speech is pure hypocrisy.
<P>
	If Montreal is in a somewhat better shape now, it is certainly not 
thanks to the federal government. Let us look, for instance, at what 
the present Prime Minister did when he was Minister of Energy, 
Mines and Resources. He cut part of Montreal's oil supplies. What 
did the Prime Minister do? What did the federal government do in 
respect to inflation and the extraordinary interest rates of 20 per 
cent in 1981-1982 for example? I think such a situation rapidly 
ruins a city.
<P>
	What did the federal government do recently when it shut down 
the Atomic Energy Commission of Canada in Montreal? What did 
the federal government do when it shut down the Tokamak research 
centre in Varennes? What is the government doing? The federal 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5695"> 5695 </A></B>
<P>
government  is doing everything possible to harm the economic 
development of Montreal, and we have lots of evidence.
<P>
	Therefore, when the Minister comes and tells us that the Prime 
Minister made an extraordinary speech-yes, the Prime Minister 
said extraordinary things such as ``We are targeting our 
investments so that we can help Montreal become a leader in the 
emerging technologies of tomorrow'', I say: What hypocrisy! What 
a hypocritical speech!
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleagues, I ask you not to use the words 
``hypocrisy'' and ``hypocrite'', because it could trigger unwanted 
reactions, here, in the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leblanc (Longueuil):</B> Mr. Speaker, I did not say that the 
minister was a hypocrite. I said that his speech was hypocritical. 
That is different.
<P>
	I wanted to say that we, Montrealers, know the minister's 
rhetoric has very little impact. He spoke about the federal 
government's contribution in research and development contracts, 
but in all, they amount to 18.5 per cent. He mentioned National 
Defence. He mentioned areas where the investment was higher 
than the Quebec average, but still, the average is 18.5 per cent. This 
is figure provided by Statistics Canada, and it means at least a $2 
billion shortfall in research and development. He says his 
department also gives $1.2 billion to the unemployed. Do the 
Quebecers, the Montrealers, want to be supported on welfare and 
unemployment premiums? We want to earn a decent living, as any 
other living body in North America.
<P>
	That being said, I think the present minister should withdraw his 
statement and tell the truth, for once.
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
	He must tell the truth, because 18.5 per cent while we represent 
24 per cent of the population means we got $2 billion less than 
what we should have had for research and development. These 
figures are from Statistics Canada.
<P>
	Ontario receives 53 per cent of the federal research and 
development envelope while Quebec has 18.5 per cent-and the 
minister is perfectly aware of it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pettigrew:</B> It is 24 per cent.
<P>
	<B>Mr. LeBlanc (Longueuil):</B> Why does he say such things in the 
House? Why not try to say the truth to Quebecers and Montrealers? 
Why not the truth? I do no know. I think he is taking up the same 
speech his leader delivered in Montreal this week. He probably 
prepared half of it himself. It is more or less the same speech that 
was given by the Prime Minister in Montreal, this week, and parts 
of it are simply not true.
<P>
	That is why we are here as representatives of Quebec in Ottawa, 
and we want Quebecers to know the truth about what the federal 
government does to help Montreal. The worst thing is that this 
government is the  one that most hindered Montreal's development 
in the past, and it is still doing so today.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pettigrew:</B> Mr. Speaker, the member for Longueuil is stuck 
on inflation rates of 14 or 15 per cent. Those were times I hardly 
knew. In those days, I was probably not even in the labour force, I 
have been working for only 25 years.
<P>
	It is incredible how the problems of Montreal are being blamed 
on the inflation in the early eighties, at a time when we all know 
that governments had a different philosophy on the issue. The same 
was true of the Quebec government to which you were very close 
then, in 1980-81.
<P>
	We should focus our debate on the Montreal of today, not the 
Montreal the member for Rosemont talked about, when it was 
mostly English speaking and seemed to be mean to us, not the 
Montreal of the late seventies when the inflation was sky high. I 
will point out that the inflation was the same in Toronto and the rest 
of Canada. It would appear that Montreal was affected in a different 
way. So here are a few things that are true. It was certainly not 
because of an anti-Quebec approach that inflation rates were so 
high, as a matter of fact, they were too high for Canadians as a 
whole.
<P>
	These people should be reminded that for the past three years the 
inflation rate has been below 2 per cent; right now it is around 1.3 
or 1.4 per cent. It is extraordinary to have been able to wrestle the 
inflation to the ground as we have done under the current Liberal 
government headed by the current Prime Minister, whom I cannot 
call by name in this House, although I nearly did, the member for 
Shawinigan.
<P>
	Also, our interest rates are the lowest they have been in 38 years. 
You want to talk about the past? You are right, Mr. Speaker. I must 
address my remarks to the Chair. I want to point out that interest 
rates are the lowest they have been in 38 years. So those who cling 
to the past should also mention that.
<P>
	I am more interested in the future, in the society we are building 
now. They speak about research and development spending. 
Quebec's part in federal spending for research and development 
has reached more than 25 per cent this year. We have made 
considerable progress.
<P>
	But the interesting part are the tangible results of research and 
development. This is the area where we have progressed and where 
we are improving the situation. In the aerospace sector alone, the 
government will invest $2.3 billion over a ten-year period in 
Montreal. Those are structuring investments, considerably more 
important than what we have seen until now.
<P>
	Then there are aeronautics, biotechnologies and the 
pharmaceutical industry. People keep asking: ``When will you 
change the legislation?'' Right now the legislation discriminates in 
favour of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5696"> 5696 </A></B>
<P>
the pharmaceutical  industry in the greater Montreal. You are either 
in the past, or in an hypothetical future. We must remind these 
people that they should put an end to their qualms and their fears. 
We are trying to build a society and that can only be done on the 
basis of trust and confidence.
<P>
	There were two major books written on economic development 
last year. I should send a copy to members of the opposition; they 
would be happy to see that Mr. Fukuyama, a very interesting 
Japanese-American sociologist, wrote a book in which he says that 
the societies which will perform the best in a global economy will 
be those where confidence prevails.
<P>
<B>(1605)</B>
<P>
	The title of his book is <I>Trust</I>. We must have confidence, we must 
stop being wary of what we see on the other side. Alain Peyrefitte 
said the same thing. He studied 400 years of economic 
development to see which societies performed. It was always the 
societies where there was confidence, the societies which-instead 
of turning against their Prime Minister, who is from Quebec, 
against a Prime Minister born in Quebec, the hon. member for 
Shawinigan who, faced with an urgent situation in Montreal, 
extended a hand to the Premier of Quebec-the societies which 
were united. For three days now he has been under attack. 
Everything he has done is being questioned.
<P>
	You were right a while ago when you intervened to stop the use 
of the adjective, the use of the word hypocrite. Insult is the weapon 
of the weak, the weapon of those who have nothing to say. I will 
end on that. The situation is very serious in Montreal and we must 
unite, we must stop fighting each other and work together: the 
Government of Canada, the Government of Quebec, the municipal 
government, the private sector and the community. This is what we 
want and this is what we will do.
<P>
	I would like to ask the opposition to stop slowing us down. 
Indeed, what they are trying to do, faced with the initiative taken by 
the Prime Minister of Canada at the beginning of the week, faced 
with this very constructive and positive speech, is slow down 
government action because it scares them.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to speak to the Bloc Quebecois motion asking the House to 
recognize Montreal as the economic mainspring of Quebec society. 
This motion also asks the House to condemn the federal 
government's lack of concrete initiatives in really supporting the 
Montreal area economy, particularly in the transportation sector.
<P>
	During the last election campaign, the Liberals had promised in 
their red book to give back to Montreal a strong voice within the 
Canadian government, to favour community groups, to support 
small and medium business, which constitutes the essence of 
Montreal's economic fabric, to revitalize housing through a  
renovation program, and to maximize, in the greater Montreal area, 
the spinoffs of the research and development program.
<P>
	Beyond these fine promises, the federal government is doing 
nothing to help with the economic recovery of Montreal. In the 
transportation sector, many issues demonstrate the federal 
government's bad faith. In the last 15 years, 15,000 jobs have been 
lost in the railway industry in Montreal, which is more than half of 
the work force in this sector.
<P>
	The federal government did everything it could to favour rail 
transportation in the west, at the expense of Quebec, and 
particularly Montreal, which used to be the main railway centre in 
the country. Ottawa massively invested in infrastructure in western 
Canada, while supporting grain transportation to the tune of 
hundreds of millions of dollars. Meanwhile, it let the Quebec 
network deteriorate and thus become obsolete.
<P>
	In the air transportation sector, Ottawa's decisions also had 
devastating effects on employment in Montreal. In July, the federal 
government announced it was withdrawing from Air Canada its 
Czech Republic destination, to the benefit of Canadian 
International. This decision is further evidence of favouritism 
toward this company.
<P>
	In this regard, I must add that, for many years, Ottawa has been 
postponing the entry of Air Canada in the Asian market and is 
trying to restrain its access. It then becomes realistic to think that, 
if the government chooses to put forward policies that put Air 
Canada at a disadvantage, it is in fact because it wants to penalize it 
for maintaining its head office in Montreal instead of Toronto.
<P>
	It is important to mention that Air Canada is currently one of the 
largest employers in Quebec, with some 7,000 employees. 
However, we have to wonder why an Air Canada centre is already 
being built in Toronto and what the consequences will be for 
Montreal.
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
	The handling of the Dorval and Mirabel airports issue is another 
example of the kind of mismanagement experienced in air 
transportation in Quebec over the past two decades. Having two 
airports has greatly hindered Montreal's competitiveness vis-à-vis 
the northeastern states. In addition, the decision the federal 
government made in 1986 to allow air carriers departing from 
Europe to transit through other Canadian airports sounded the end 
of Montreal as a major hub. As a result, three times more 
passengers are now going through Pearson Airport in Toronto than 
through Dorval and Mirabel together.
<P>
	I would now like to address briefly the difficult situation in my 
riding of Bourassa, which includes the 86,000 residents of 
Montréal-Nord. Starting in January 1997, the riding will also 
include approximately 10,000 residents of Rivière-des-Prairies.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5697"> 5697 </A></B>
<P>
	The population of Montréal-Nord is becoming increasingly 
cosmopolitan, with the majority, or 38 per cent, coming from Italy 
or Haiti. The Latin American, Middle-Eastern and 
Southeast-Asian components are also growing.
<P>
	The unemployment rate in the adult population of 
Montréal-Nord is higher than the average rate for the island of 
Montreal, at 16 per cent versus 12 per cent. In the 15-24 age group, 
the rate is higher there than elsewhere, at 20.3 per cent versus 16 
per cent. Of the total population of Montréal-Nord, 18.8 per cent 
rely on income security benefits, as compared to 10.7 per cent in 
Quebec. Those relying on welfare are mainly people living alone, 
single mothers, children, immigrants and young people.
<P>
	Many of my constituents are living in poverty. They often come 
to my office to ask me to do something. As hard as I try, I 
sometimes feel torn and helpless, unable to meet their urgent needs 
for jobs, housing, and even food.
<P>
	The Papineau employment center is slated for closure at the 
beginning of 1997. The minister who was praising earlier all the 
great things achieved by Montreal is responsible for this center. At 
the same time, this government is cutting back on grants to those 
organizations responsible for developing job readiness programs. 
The federal government has this great infrastructure program, but 
Henri-Bourassa Boulevard has yet to be completed.
<P>
	So I wish to express my indignation at the extremely unfair 
treatment of the Montreal area, especially Montréal-Nord. Federal 
members and ministers from Montreal are not doing anything for 
the city. The federal government must take concrete action to 
straighten out the disastrous socioeconomic situation of what used 
to be the heart of Quebec's economy.
<P>
	I would like to say a few words about what the Minister of 
Human Resources Development has just told us in this House. He 
told us that the Quebec government treats Montreal like any other 
region in Quebec. That is not true. The Quebec government has 
appointed a minister responsible for Montreal, Serge Ménard, who 
is doing a great job, unlike the federal government.
<P>
	I think the minister is exaggerating when he talks about all the 
great things his government has done for Montreal. He should 
spend more time in his own riding of Papineau-Saint-Michel, 
which borders on my riding of Bourassa, where many unemployed 
Haitian and other immigrants live in incredible poverty.
<P>
	Pearless, a company in my riding, laid off many workers, most 
of whom were from Latin America, Asia and Haiti.
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	This morning, the secretary of state responsible for regional 
development spoke to us about CDECs or economic and 
community development corporations. There is a CDEC in 
Montréal-Nord, but, unfortunately, the federal government is no 
longer providing $25,000 to develop this institution, this 
organization. The Quebec government, for its part, gave $25,000, 
while the city of Montréal-Nord provided $15,000 plus office 
space, which is equivalent to $25,000. There is no federal 
contribution at this time. Is this their way of supporting CDECs, 
which do a wonderful job in the whole Montreal area, especially 
Montréal- Nord?
<P>
	For all these reasons, I support the Bloc motion and condemn the 
Liberal government's policies concerning Montreal and especially 
its failure to take action.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> It is my duty, 
pursuant to Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the 
questions to be raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as 
follows: the hon. member for Shefford, military justice; the hon. 
member for Parry Sound-Muskoka, tourism.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dan McTeague (Ontario, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I listened 
carefully to the comments made by the hon. member for Bourassa 
and I perfectly understand his position.
<P>
	However, I find it somewhat ironic that he and his party should 
try to find a scapegoat, when the scapegoat himself cannot 
understand their separatist policies.
<P>
	I know that from time to time we must take firm positions on 
policies, but that should not, in the end, prevent anyone from 
working, from earning a living. That is why I do understand the 
hon. member's comments.
<P>
	I know that from one end of our beautiful country to the other, 
people are struggling. Just a few hours ago, GM workers on strike 
in Ontario held out their hands to workers on strike at the GM plant 
in Sainte-Thérèse. We saw two communities working together and 
finally succeeding in reaching a satisfactory agreement with the 
company.
<P>
	Using this example, I could suggest-and I easily get involved in 
policies-that the situation in Montreal is not that different from 
the situation elsewhere, except that we do recognize it in our 
ridings.
<P>
	The hon. member is fully aware that Montrealers, anglophones 
and francophones alike, sometimes come to see us to tell us how 
bad the situation is in Montreal and that it is a result not only of 
federal and provincial government policies, but also of the 
changing economy, so we must co-operate and adapt.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5698"> 5698 </A></B>
<P>
	Instead of putting a question to the hon. member who, of course, 
must approve the motion, I hold out my hand to him saying: ``Work 
with us, work with Franco-Ontarians, work with others in this 
country. We are here to help you''. But we must hold out our hands, 
we must have hope in our future, in our future together. Does he not 
agree with this sincere offer from our government?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nunez:</B> Madam Speaker, I agree with the hon. member that 
we should congratulate CAW workers for settling a dispute which 
lasted a few weeks between the CAW and General Motors. Ontario 
and Quebec workers succeeded and I congratulate them because 
they won a difficult battle.
<P>
	Second, the federal government has a major responsibility 
regarding Montreal's problems. The Quebec government did its 
share. It appointed a minister responsible for Montreal. As for the 
federal government, it makes decisions that are detrimental to 
Quebec, and particularly to Montreal.
<P>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
	For example, the federal government favours Canadian 
International, whose activities are concentrated in western Canada, 
at the expense of Air Canada, whose head office is in Montreal. It 
makes decisions concerning Canada's railway system-Montreal 
used to be the hub of the railroad industry until a few years 
ago-with the result that the whole industry is now moving west. 
Montreal used to be Canada's metropolis. Now, Toronto has taken 
that title away from it. A large number of these decisions were 
made by the federal government, at the expense of Montreal. I am 
not saying that the federal government is responsible for all of 
Montreal's misfortunes, but it is largely responsible for its difficult 
and even disastrous economic situation, particularly from an 
employment standpoint.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I always 
like to review the historical background of an issue before 
beginning to speak about it, in order to explain certain things for 
the present and the future. One always has to remember a little 
what happened a few years earlier. I have always thought that the 
past is something of an indication of what the future holds.
<P>
	Judging by what happened a few years ago, I can say that the 
federal government has surely not been the engine behind 
Montreal's economic development, quite the contrary. I will give a 
few examples. I will back a rather long way, but the problems arose 
since then; as you know, there was the so called Borden line 
established by the oil energy legislation. During the period the 
Prime Minister was Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources, that 
Borden line cost Montreal between 8,000 and 10,000 jobs. We have 
to remember that.
<P>
	In 1986, the federal government inaugurated a large airport 
called Mirabel. The following year, it decided to  deregulate air 
transportation, which brought about the fall of Mirabel-Dorval 
airport and a further loss of ten thousand jobs in the area of 
Montreal. All because of the federal government. There too, these 
were badly targeted expenditures by the federal government.
<P>
	A tremendous amount of money was spent between 1970 and 
1980, and programs were not necessarily well directed, which 
meant that they were not consistent with the development of 
Montreal. Once again, we did not get the funds needed to develop 
normally like the other regions of Canada. It is for these reasons 
that I like to look back. We must always remember that, as I said 
earlier, the past is something of an indication of what the future 
holds.
<P>
	When I heard the Prime Minister say this week in Montreal that 
his ``government is targeting its investments to make Montreal a 
leader in the new technologies of the future'', I did not think he was 
very credible. I do not have much confidence in that rhetoric. It was 
a speech meant to please, a pre-election speech to make Quebecers 
believe that he was very much concerned, but we know very well 
that he has been the main source of the problems the metropolitan 
area of Montreal is having. It is not very amusing to see a Prime 
Minister or a government making great speeches when we know 
very well that it will not make much difference.
<P>
	I will explain why I do not trust the government. First, only a few 
months ago, the federal government decided to shut down the 
Montreal offices of the Atomic Energy Commission of Canada. 
The Bloc Quebecois raised this issue several times. We have 
managed to keep almost half the employees of the Atomic Energy 
Control Board, but what the federal government really wanted, as 
was announced, was to close down the board's office in Montreal. 
When the Prime Minister says he wants to turn Montreal into the 
city of the technology of the future, and when at the same time he is 
closing down the board's office, I fail to see how he can have any 
credibility making that speech in Montreal.
<P>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
	That is why we have decided to spend this day talking about his 
visit there and the actions taken recently in Montreal to regain 
some credibility. But we have to emphasize the gap between what 
is said and what is actually done.
<P>
	They wanted to close down the Atomic Energy Control Board 
office, and we managed to keep half of it. We know that in this area 
Montreal will definitely take a back-seat. We also know that 
gradually, as the years go by, there will be no one left in this 
Montreal office. How could we trust that kind of speech?
<P>
	We wanted to condemn this rhetoric, and that is why we are here. 
Quebecers have elected 53 members of the Bloc to represent them 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5699"> 5699 </A></B>
<P>
in Ottawa. We are here to  condemn this kind of rhetoric, because 
we know it is just a sham.
<P>
	I have another reason to think we should not trust this rhetoric, 
and that is the fact that the natural resources minister has decided to 
stop subsidizing the Tokamak project in Varennes, near Montreal. 
This Tokamak project is one the most advanced facilities in the 
world for scientific development. Europe, the United States and 
Japan are partners in this project to develop nuclear energy.
<P>
	We have extraordinary skills to develop in this area. It is the 
energy of the future. But the natural resources minister said that the 
energy of the future and nuclear fusion are not her priority. It is 
easy to understand, because she stands up for the oil industry in 
western Canada. She stands up for the uranium plants in Ontario, 
which is the type of industries she wants to develop.
<P>
	She has forgotten that nuclear fusion is tomorrow's source of 
energy. Twenty or 25 years from now, petroleum products will not 
be used that much any longer. Electrical power consumption will 
be on the decline. We will still use electricity, but it will be 
produced through nuclear fusion.
<P>
	On the one hand, they say they want to help the Montreal area, 
but on the other hand, they cancel some projects and stop funding 
very significant sectors, like nuclear fusion and the Atomic Energy 
Board. So, we cannot believe a word the Prime Minister says in his 
speeches.
<P>
	I met with the general manager of the Tokamak project, who told 
me and proved to me that the $7 million the federal government 
was investing each year in this project had much more significant 
economic spinoffs. Some of the new products that had to be 
invented to develop this form of energy are proving to be useful to 
several businesses in the Montreal area, which, in turn, are 
developing other new products. The products developed through 
the research carried out by the Tokamak project generate much 
more than the $7 million investment made by the federal 
government.
<P>
	By cutting this subsidy, the federal government is running the 
risk of putting an end to this extraordinary Tokamak project and 
stands to lose some money. The Minister of Natural Resources did 
not take the time to properly assess this project. The Prime 
Minister said he has a technological vision of the future, but his 
words do not match the reality.
<P>
	Yesterday or was it this morning, I read in the paper that, 
according to the OECD, Quebec ranks fourth among all the 
countries as far as research and development is concerned. 
However, we know that this government does not invest as much as 
it should in research and development in Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1630)</B>
<P>
	This means that Quebec has to invest its share in R and D, plus 
the $2 million it is not getting from the federal government.
<P>
	Did you really think that we could create jobs when the federal 
government is not paying its share, which comes to $2 million a 
year? If times are tough in Montreal, which has extraordinary 
intellectual resources, people who unfortunately do not have much 
work due to a lack of money, it is precisely because the federal 
government is not paying its share in R and D.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jesse Flis (Parkdale-High Park, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
my wife and I spent the last two weekends in Montreal. We love 
going there. My wife says that no city in the world has smoked 
meat like Montreal has. She will also says that no city in the world 
has bagels like Montreal has.
<P>
	However, on our last visit we were very depressed. We took a 
taxi from Dorval airport to downtown Montreal. When I want to 
learn what is happening in a city I usually talk to taxi drivers and 
barbers. I learn a lot from these two professions.
<P>
	The taxi driver told us that he was not pleased with what was 
happening. He said that he was selling his taxi business, which 
shocked me. He was selling his home. I asked him why. He replied: 
``Things are not certain. I cannot go on living this way''. When I 
asked him how long he had been in Montreal he told me 25 years.
<P>
	He is selling his taxi business and his home. He is moving to 
Toronto. He speaks French, English and Greek. These are the kinds 
of human resources we have in our beautiful country and in la belle 
province, Quebec. He is selling out, moving out to join his brother 
who has a restaurant and an apartment business in Toronto.
<P>
	That depressed me. Here is a true entrepreneur who helped to 
build the economy of Montreal and Quebec for 25 years, and now 
he is pulling out because of political uncertainty.
<P>
	The member for Longueuil has been here as long as I have, if not 
longer, so I am sure he will take my question seriously. Rather than 
blame the federal government falsely, as this motion does, to say-
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>]

<BLOCKQUOTE>-the federal government's under-investment in research and development; its 
inequitable allocation of federal purchases of goods and services-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This is not true.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It is a false motion. Rather than blame the taxi driver I talked to 
who is moving from Montreal, what is the Bloc Quebecois Party 
doing to keep these entrepreneurs in Montreal? By falsely blaming 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5700"> 5700 </A></B>
<P>
the federal government the  Bloc is driving more of these 
entrepreneurs out of Montreal.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois has a responsibility as its members were 
elected by a large group of people, and that I respect. The reason 
they are sitting here is because they were put here through a 
democratic process. What are they doing to prevent this flight of 
entrepreneurs from Montreal?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leblanc (Longueuil):</B> Madam Speaker, what we are doing 
is very simple: we do what we are doing today. First, we call to 
order the people who tell us lies about Montreal. It is important to 
do this first.
<P>
	Second, this thing about political uncertainty is old hat. Every 
expert and business and every poll on the subject said that political 
uncertainty has nothing to do with Montreal's situation. This has to 
be made clear once and for all. Everybody said so. Experts said it 
again last week on television. We read about it every day in the 
papers. The political situation has nothing to do with the loss of 
jobs in Montreal.
<P>
	As we all know, the problem with Montreal is that the federal 
government never took care of Quebec for the last 30 years.
<P>
<B>(1635)</B>
<P>
	It is mainly the fault of this Prime Minister who, for 30 years, 
has been trying to please western Canada and Ontario to be able to 
win votes, because he is a Quebecer. That is the true reason.
<P>
	This same Prime Minister scuttled Meech because Quebec had 
obtained a little more freedom to manage its own things. He 
became the leader of the Liberal Party and to run down the 
Conservative government that was on the point of realizing one of 
the finest Canadian projects, he scuttled the whole deal, and only so 
he could become Prime Minister.
<P>
	Power took precedence over the interests of Quebec. This Prime 
Minister ruined Montreal. This is clear. Everybody can say so, and 
prove it: his attitude toward Quebec was terrible. He has been 
active in politics for 30 years and he has been working against 
Quebec for 30 years. This is why the members of the Bloc, all 53 of 
us, are now here in Ottawa. We are here because we could not get 
members from Quebec to really represent us. To get elected, they 
would do anything to please western Canada, Ontario and the 
Atlantic provinces.
<P>
	This is the old way, the old story of Canada. It was this way 
under the Trudeau government, under the Saint-Laurent 
government and under this Prime Minister's government.
<P>
	Unfortunately, my time is up, although I would have so much 
more to say on this subject.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Finestone (Mount Royal, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
all of us sitting here and particularly the hon. member for 
Longueuil who has been in the House for many years as a member 
of the Conservative Party, know the nature of the discontent that 
has spread throughout this country. The majority of the population 
voted for this party.
<P>
	Now he has the nerve to say that they are unhappy. He crossed 
the floor and joined the Bloc Quebecois. He said there was no way 
that politics or the environment of Quebec are at fault, it is the 
weather and the federal government.
<P>
	Has the weather made it even worse or just the federal 
government?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leblanc (Longueuil):</B> Madam Speaker, politics is not as 
simple as it looks. It implies many attitudes. One must look at 
history a little. A country cannot become impoverished in the span 
of six months, three days or five weeks. One must examine the 
history of the last 30 years to understand the current plight of 
Quebec, which is plagued by a 15 or 12 per cent unemployment 
rate and an almost equal number of welfare recipients. This is a 
reality.
<P>
	When I say the last 30 years, I am speaking of the current Prime 
Minister, who was in the government then. He is responsible for 
this situation.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Finestone (Mount Royal, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
as I read the outline of the debate we are faced with today, I note 
that once again political disinformation is being put before us as an 
object for debate and vote. Members of the Bloc Quebecois blame 
everybody but themselves. They blame the whole world, including 
the weather. They do not recognize what is going on in Quebec 
society or the problems that Quebec is living with today. It is really 
a travesty. It also happens to be untrue, unfounded and unrealistic.
<P>
	I really think that when ideology takes over from reality we 
really have a very serious issue before us.
<P>
	One thing we need to remember is that Canada, Quebec and, in 
particular, Montreal has a population that is a reflection of the 
country we have built together. It is built on a series of values, 
policies, programs and philosophies which are shared by the 
majority of Quebecers, except for one small ideological group 
which is stuck on language and nothing else. I should not say they 
are only concerned with language. They are also concerned with 
culture and cultural issues which are important and valuable.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5701"> 5701 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	However, we also want this reflected in the House. This culture 
is reflected through you, Madam Speaker, as a francophone from 
New Brunswick, through our new minister of la francophonie who 
is a francophone from Ontario and through a number of our 
ministers and secretaries of state who are francophones from 
Manitoba, British Columbia, northern Ontario and elsewhere. We 
also have, by the way, anglophones from Quebec who sit in this 
House.
<P>
	We have many representatives in this House who show the 
diversity of the country. We have aboriginal people who are 
representative of Quebec and this country. One of the problems 
members opposite have is a lack of recognition of the diversity and 
multicultural nature of the province of Quebec.
<P>
	They also lack the desire to recognize the fact that this 
government under the Prime Minister, the Minister of Finance, the 
ministers and all the members of the caucus have expressed support 
for the views put forward a red book. This is an excellent red book 
and covers over 189 issues. We have been very frank and 
forthcoming about what the issues are and what we have 
accomplished. Over 75 per cent of the promises that we made have 
been accomplished. We are an open government that is fair, honest 
and very concerned about the well-being of Quebec.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	There is no magic formula for attracting investors, whatever the 
sector. There is only one reason, and it is the big companies or the 
small and medium size ones that decide how, when and where they 
wish to invest. For the most part, with the changes that occurred in 
the era of communication, of market globalization, businesses 
must find the niches where they can really acquire the expertise and 
become the best in the world. We have this here, in Montreal.
<P>
	I am saying this as a Montrealer as well as a member for a riding 
that has two industrial parks where big retailers and even small and 
medium size businesses were established. These businesses 
received Quebec-Canada partnership grants to be more successful.
<P>
	To attract investment, there is a whole set of factors, such as a 
positive business environment, and the quality of life that we can 
find in Montreal. When businesses, big private companies have to 
make a decision on the location of a new research facility, they 
think about the stability of the Canadian economic climate. 
Inflation and interest rates are low. This is why the member of the 
Bloc Quebecois who spoke before me should realize that we have 
put in place the groundwork for attracting investors.
<P>
	What is this groundwork? It is low inflation and interest rates. 
The Government of Canada is committed to a reduction program 
that should bring the deficit to 1 per cent of GDP by 1999. I think 
that we also recognize that our legislation protecting intellectual 
property and innovation is essential for investments in R and D.
<P>
	The tax incentives granted by the Government of Canada for R 
and D are the most generous in the world. That is why investors 
come to our country. And the Minister of Industry encourages them 
to do so. I must admit I told him that I was very happy he should 
come to my riding to invite three major companies to choose our 
industrial park and to give them assurance regarding the money and 
the support they will get from the Government of Quebec and the 
Government of Canada, through the Quebec-Canada agreement.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	The minister assured that Ericsson, Biochem and the National 
Research Centre that they are welcome in my riding. This implies 
huge amounts of money, but I will talk about this later. Thanks to 
these high technology industries, Montreal now has the critical 
mass necessary to be one of the major centres in the world-and 
they say that we have done nothing-in many leading sectors.
<P>
	Montreal has reached this point through partnership agreements 
with the private sector, the academic and research communities, 
provincial as well as federal governments and people from 85 
countries who have the knowledge and the expertise required and 
who decided to come to Quebec, people who speak many 
languages, who know the work and the business cultures in other 
sectors of this country.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The immigrants who have come to Montreal have been the 
greatest innovators in many ways. Not only are they entrepreneurs 
who have created small and medium size businesses, they are 
people who come from different cultures around the world. They 
understand the cultures and the languages and how business is done 
around the world. They are a precious asset. They are a hidden 
asset. They know how we can seek business and become 
entrepreneurial in this new globalized world where 
competitiveness is the key. They know how to produce manpower 
at a cost per unit of production which is the lowest in the world in 
many fields, the field of pharmaceuticals, the field of aeronautics, 
the field of technology and the field of telecommunications.
<P>
	I only have one minute left. I wish I could talk about all the 
wonderful dollars which we have invested. I have a wonderful 
speech and if I had time I would be pleased to tell hon. members 
about the millions and millions of dollars which have been 
invested.
<P>
	I would like to cite two or three examples. We have approved 77 
projects, which represent an investment of more than $3.8 billion. 
Both governments, with an investment of $575 million, have 
created more than 8,500 jobs. I would like to know how the 
Government of Quebec or more particularly the Bloc Quebecois 
finds that difficult.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5702"> 5702 </A></B>
<P>
	The increase in sales from these investments has amounted to 
more than $5 billion. That money went into the economy and was 
taxed in the province of Quebec, like it is in the rest of Canada.
<P>
	The major part of this growth and development is as a result of 
international sales and Team Canada. I hope the premier of Quebec 
goes with the Prime Minister. Then he will see what the advantages 
of co-operation are between leaders of government in the interests 
of the people and not in the interests of an ideology based on 
culture and language. That is not enough for a country to grow on. 
There has to be an open spirit. There have to be open minds. 
Everyone is welcome and everyone is equal. That is a fundamental 
characteristic and a value of the dignity of human beings and work.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, you might 
find it strange that a member from Quebec City should take part in 
a debate on Montreal. But let me explain why I wanted to speak. 
Montreal used to be Canada's metropolis, but it still is Quebec's 
metropolis. It is a city whose economic development obviously 
meshes with the economic development of the rest of Quebec. 
When Montreal suffers, the rest of Quebec suffers too. This has 
been known for a long time.
<P>
	But what I find somewhat offensive in the hon. member's speech 
is that she suggested-and I do not remember her exact 
words-that the members from the Bloc and the other members 
from Quebec should put the cultural and linguistic issues aside, or 
at least give them less importance-
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Finestone:</B> I did not say that, I did not say that at all.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dubé:</B> Yes, you said that in your last paragraph, just at the 
end of your speech.
<P>
	The hon. member lives in Montreal, I know that she is a sensible 
person, who generally recognizes reality. I do not want to insult 
her, but I would like her to clarify her thinking in this regard.
<P>
	Does she admit that the good health of Montreal's economy is 
important for Quebec? Does she recognize that things are the way 
they are in Quebec because language is important, since we are a 
French speaking majority? Language and culture are important for 
the development of Quebecers, like they are for other peoples.
<P>
	Of course, we are open to immigration. We prove it every day of 
the year. In the Bloc, the hon. member for Bourassa is an example 
of our openness. We are not against immigration, we are not 
against other languages, but it must be recognized that it is normal 
for Quebecers to ask that efforts be made for the economic 
development of their metropolis.
<P>
	I would like the hon. member to clarify her thinking because I 
may have misunderstood. I hope that I misunderstood her because 
she seemed to suggest that we should not attach any importance to 
cultural identity and language.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Finestone:</B> Madam Speaker, first of all, I want the member 
to understand that I am proud to be a Quebecer. I am proud of both 
the French and English languages and cultures. I want them both to 
be respected, as well as the other languages and cultures of the 
people who chose to make our province their home. They are equal 
partners, each in their own community.
<P>
	Secondly, I totally agree with you that Montreal is the heart of 
Quebec, its economic engine. However, if we want to pursue this 
idea, we must have an open mind and recognize that the federal 
government has several objectives, in partnership with the Quebec 
government and under the Quebec-Canada agreement-or 
Canada-Quebec if you prefer-on the development of the various 
sectors. First of all, this agreement is designed to promote the 
coordination of efforts between both governments to improve 
Quebec's competitiveness and economic health, especially in 
Montreal, the province's economic engine. The agreement 
succeeds in reaching this goal by giving financial support to major 
industrial projects capable of diversifying Montreal's and Quebec's 
industrial structure.
<P>
	I think you will agree with me that it is a very good idea, and we 
are doing it in partnership.
<P>
	What bothered me about the previous speeches is that members 
were saying that Mr. Chrétien has been here for 30 years. Well, it is 
a good thing because, as a political leader, he has a vision of 
Quebec that is representative of all Canada, of which I am part as a 
Montrealer. I think it is not fair to say that it is our party and our 
leader who are destroying Montreal and who are hindering its 
economic development. It is not true. It is false.
<P>
	That is what I said before and I am saying it again, and that is all 
I have to say about this issue.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Lachine-Lac-Saint-Louis, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I spent five years in the Quebec National 
Assembly on the opposition benches, and almost four years on the 
government benches.
<P>
	I was in opposition during the Parti Quebecois's second term of 
office. Whenever Quebec's problems were mentioned, there were 
two solutions. The first was that everything wrong in Quebec was 
the fault of the federal government. That was taken for granted. 
Everything that was going badly in Quebec was because of the 
federal government.
<P>
	Every time something went badly, summits were held to find a 
solution. We had endless summits. The summit master of them all, 
Mr. Landry, held summits every week, every month, every quarter: 
economic summits, cultural summits, summits on this, that and the 
other.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5703"> 5703 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	I see that times have not changed. The discourse here has not 
changed. It is always the same old song: ``For 30 years now, 
Quebec has had a tough time, and it is the fault of the federal 
government, the fault of Mr. Chrétien, but it is never our fault in 
Quebec. We will hold a summit and everything will turn out fine. 
We will make wonderful speeches''.
<P>
	And now they come here and tell us that things are not going 
well in Montreal because of the federal government. I live in a very 
prosperous area of Montreal Island. One field that is doing well is 
high technology, as are the aerospace industry, and the 
communications, informatics, and information fields, and all these 
companies are doing extremely well. I am very familiar with them, 
having spoken to many of their general managers and shareholders.
<P>
	I will give you three examples: someone built a computer 
company a few years ago from nothing. Today, this company has 
700 employees and annual sales of $250 million.
<P>
	What has happened? When it looks for scientists and research 
technicians, it cannot find them in Canada and has to bring them in 
from the United States, England, Germany and elsewhere. It cannot 
find them because they no longer want to come to Quebec. So what 
has it done? It has moved its research centre to Florida.
<P>
	Second example: a thriving, fibre optics company. What has 
happened? After the referendum, it lost eight of its best scientists. 
The president wrote to tell me: ``The very heart of my business has 
left''.
<P>
	A third company, also in computers, and also doing extremely 
well, hired all the managers it could in Quebec, through Canadian 
universities. It is still looking for 65 scientists, but cannot find any 
who want to come here. There is all the publicity in the schools 
about the referendum, talk every day about the referendum. These 
are examples from Quebec.
<P>
	If businessmen are discussing it, they say ``No, they are traitors 
to Quebec''. If the Chamber of Commerce does, they say ``It is the 
Chamber of Commerce talking''. If it is the Conseil du patronat, 
they say ``No, they are not us''. But what if it is the mayor of 
Montreal himself? He was quoted in a headline in <I>Le Devoir </I>the 
other day as saying ``Political instability is what is finishing off 
Montreal''. What if it is your Mr. Dumont himself, the good buddy 
of the PQ and the Bloc, who says: ``Put your referendum on hold 
for ten years''? We are not the ones saying this, nor the Prime 
Minister, it is your partner, Mr. Dumont.
<P>
	No, you will not listen. You will not listen because you do not 
want to hear. I could list off all the investments in which the federal 
and Quebec governments have participated. I and my colleagues 
have been at some of  the opening ceremonies myself, and we work 
very closely together.
<P>
	Two years ago, I had the experience of working with a trilateral 
team, made up of the federal government, the Quebec government 
and the City of Montreal, to try to get the secretariat of the 
Convention on Biodiversity here to Montreal. We were successful, 
because on both sides we were neither federalists, nor Quebecers, 
nor Montrealers. We were instead all working together for the 
prosperity of our community.
<P>
	We worked together, regardless of political stripe, regardless of 
what community we came from, whether Quebec City, Montreal or 
somewhere else. We worked together, and we were successful. 
Today we have formed that same trilateral team to get the 
Secretariat for the Convention to Control Desertification to 
Montreal. I am a player on that team, and very pleased to be a 
member.
<P>
	This is proof that people can work together if there is good will. 
Let us put aside our never-ending quarrels about language and 
politics. Surely we can work together to build things that will make 
our community, our country and our province prosperous, without 
regard to race, religion or political considerations, for the sake of 
the people who live there. We can do it.
<P>
	However, the only thing you want is to be negative and say that 
things are not going well and that the federal government, not you, 
is responsible for the present situation.
<P>
<B>(1700)</B>
<P>
	Every time we have an opportunity to build something together, 
you go back to the past and talk about Mr. Chrétien in 1970 instead 
of talking about today, the future and the new century and about the 
fact that Montreal is not well because of the chronic political 
instability which exists there and which everyone denounces. 
Americans and Europeans talk about it. Where there is instability 
there is no investment.
<P>
	I urge you, as people who are proud to be Montrealers, 
Quebecers and Canadians, to forget your mean prejudices, your 
never-ending quarrels, your famous referendum which you will 
never win and persist in holding, and work instead to revitalize our 
city. Montreal is for everyone of us, on this side or on the other, 
something we all take to heart. So let us work together to build 
Montreal instead of having those never-ending quarrels.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I am just saying that we can work together if we want to work 
together. Every day the federal government, the Quebec 
government and the city of Montreal work together in harmony and 
peace. It is only because of the separatists who believe in division, 
who believe in quarrels, who believe in a negative option that today 
Montreal is suffering and sick. The only way to build it is to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5704"> 5704 </A></B>
<P>
breathe hope, unity and political peace into it so investments can 
return and Montreal can flourish again.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This is our most precious wish. I hope that next time you will 
introduce a motion it will be a positive and constructive motion for 
us all, whether we live in Montreal, in Quebec or in Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, when 
federalists do not know what to say, they say the problems are due 
to the fact that we want a referendum. They refuse to face the facts. 
The Liberals say we are against everything, but that is not true. We 
are not against everything. We are just monitoring the federal 
government.
<P>
	I was on the government benches when the drug patent bill was 
passed. Bill C-22 and Bill C-91, that was when I was a 
Conservative, and we worked very hard to bring pharmaceutical 
research to Montreal. It was a vicious struggle. The Liberals took 
advantage of their position in the Senate, and it was a year before 
this legislation was passed. They did not want to see these projects 
in the Montreal region and especially right next to the riding of 
Lachine-Saint-Louis.
<P>
	Hundreds of millions of dollars were invested, which created 
thousands and thousands of jobs. The Liberal government at the 
time did everything it could to prevent the passage of this bill. For 
the first time in Canada's history, researchers from Montreal 
demonstrated on Parliament Hill and persuade the Liberals to adopt 
this bill in order to create jobs in Montreal.
<P>
	You think we can trust the federal government. You think we are 
against everything. In fact, we know we cannot trust the 
government. The evidence tells us we cannot trust the federal 
Liberal government. I repeat, the past shows what the future holds 
in store. That is why Quebecers had so little confidence in the 
federal government that they elected 53 Bloc Quebecois members 
to represent them in a worthy manner and to protect their interests.
<P>
	My answer to the minister who was formerly a minister in 
Quebec City and said we were just a bunch of complainers is that 
Montreal is not in such a bad shape, on the contrary. I have 
confidence in the people of Montreal. I know there are people in 
Montreal with extraordinary intellectual capabilities that can 
accomplish great things. We have done some great things, and if we 
did not have a federal government that destroys everything as soon 
as we build it, we would be better off.
<P>
<B>(1705)</B>
<P>
	I repeat, the OECD says that Quebec ranks fourth on research 
and development, which means that although we get less than $2 
billion from the federal government, as a province we do more 
research and development than almost anywhere in the world. We 
are fourth in the  world. Why? It means the Quebec government has 
to pay twice as much.
<P>
	They tell us they give us more in Quebec City. Sure, they give us 
more as far as unemployment is concerned. Do we want money for 
our poor because we will never be rich, because the federal 
government prevents us from earning an honest living? I do not 
think that is what we want. Quebecers are people with dignity who 
want to work and are resourceful. I believe in Quebecers. We want 
to be sovereign because we think that once Quebec is sovereign, it 
will be in a far better position to develop its potential. It is blessed 
with outstanding natural and human resources. But we do not get 
the help we need.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> You are against everything.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leblanc (Longueuil):</B> We are not against everything, on the 
contrary. We are keeping tabs on the government. He should be 
ashamed for saying that. He was fighting to prevent us from 
passing Bill C-22 and Bill C-91. It was his party. He were not here 
at the time. I was here. I remember. We won, and today, hundreds 
of millions of dollars have been invested in western Montreal, 
especially.
<P>
	Just recently, the Liberals on the House of Commons committee 
on regulations tried to pull a fast one. They tried to change the 
period. Lucky the Bloc Quebecois was there to keep an eye on 
them, because otherwise we would have been had once again. Can 
we trust these people? Never.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lincoln:</B> Madam Speaker, I could have taken time to 
exchange statistics with my colleague for Longueuil. I could have 
told him that, for example, in 1993, according to the last official 
statistics from the provincial and federal governments, Quebec 
received $41 billion from the federal government, whereas it 
returned only $29 billion in taxes. I could have showed him that, in 
recent years, up to 1993, Quebec received an additional $137 
billion.
<P>
	But I think all this rhetoric is in vain. He will say that we gave 19 
per cent more to other provinces for research and development, but 
he will say nothing of the fact that, for instance, Quebec receives 
50 per cent with regards to milk. He could also speak about the 
RCMP, which receives 17 per cent.
<P>
	A federation is a system of balances. Sometimes, we get more, 
and sometimes less. That is why transfer payments exist. That is 
why the national capital exists. The entire national capital and the 
research centre are lumped in with Ontario. However, taking it out 
would mean a completely different set of figures. But I do not feel 
like fighting a battle over figures, even though I could have won 
very easily.
<P>
	I only want to tell him that if Montreal's mayor himself-and he 
is certainly not a member of our party-believes that Montreal is 
being sapped and even killed by political instability, and if all

objective observers tell the same thing, one has to be deaf and blind 
not to believe it. Personally, I firmly believe that such is the truth.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, the 
motion we are debating today, presented by the leader of the Bloc 
Quebecois, the member for Roberval, reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House recognize Montreal as the economic mainspring of Quebec 
society and, therefore, condemn the federal government's lack of concrete initiatives 
in supporting the Montreal area economy, primarily: the federal government's 
under-investment in research and development; its inequitable allocation of federal 
purchases of goods and services; its lack of willingness to support Montreal as a 
major financial centre in North America and its termination of Montreal's role as a 
major transportation centre.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The Liberal Party, despite the commitments it made in its 
famous red book, has done nothing for Montreal and the Montreal 
region. Even worse, because of its job creation policies, the federal 
government directly contributed to the impoverishment of 
Montreal. Over the years, several decisions made by the federal 
government, more specifically, under Pierre Elliott Trudeau, have 
contributed to Montreal's losing of influence to Toronto, a plan 
well orchestrated by the federal government, with the blessings of 
the anglophone majority of Canada.
<P>
<B>(1710)</B>
<P>
	I will not repeat everything that has been said here by my 
colleagues from the Bloc Québécois with respect to 
impoverishment, but for us Montreal is and will always be the heart 
of the Quebec community.
<P>
	What I will say today concerns Montreal as a major 
transportation hub.
<P>
	Early this week, the Prime Minister of Canada addressed the 
Montreal Chamber of Commerce. In his speech, he said that he 
wanted to help Montreal get back on its feet. He even said he was 
willing to associate himself with other government levels so that 
they could together, in a spirit of partnership-just imagine, using 
the word ``partnership'' we are so familiar with-improve the 
situation in Quebec's major city, where poverty now prevails. In his 
speech, the Prime Minister also made reference to the port of 
Montreal.
<P>
	However, he forgot to say how for decades the actions of the 
federal government have contributed to killing the port and rail 
activities, to eliminating any chance Montreal had to once again be 
a hub for the freight and passenger transportation in this region of 
America.
<P>
	Here are some true examples. First, there is the latest 
intervention by the federal government, the bill on Canada's 
oceans, part of which deals with a new fee structure for the services 
of the Coast Guard. In practical terms, the coming into force of this 
bill will result in additional costs for ships sailing through the St. 
Lawrence and the Great Lakes, while the Churchill port, in 
Manitoba, will not have to pay for the coast guard's services. Once 
again, this double standard can only harm the port of Montreal.
<P>
	It is important to point out that in Quebec many industries 
depend on shipping for their livelihood. Every year, they pour $1.2 
billion in the economy. Some 20 million tonnes of freight transit 
through the port of Montreal, which represents 726,000 containers 
a year. This accounts for 14,000 direct and indirect jobs. This is 
what is at stake. But mainly, it is ice free and navigable 12 months 
of the year, which is not the case for Churchill.
<P>
	Bill C-26 would be a double whammy for the Montreal port 
since it already faces very stiff competition from American eastern 
seaboard ports. The passage of Bill C-26 might result in the 
diversion of all shipping towards the United States. This would not 
be the first time the federal government is hampering Montreal's 
profitability. Many decisions have lead to the loss of rail and port 
infrastructure in Montreal.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, I see that I have only one minute left. May I 
have unanimous consent to finish my speech?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> I must put the 
motion to the vote at 5.15 p.m.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Shefford):</B> Madam Speaker, I wanted to talk about 
the building of the St. Lawrence seaway. In the fifties, Canada and 
the United States decided to build the seaway. It had a negative 
impact on Montreal. It killed its economy.
<P>
	As you know, Quebec taxpayers paid their fair share of the 
seaway. At the end of the day, it cost Montreal its competitive edge.
<P>
	To conclude, I would like to say, since I am running out of time, 
that it is with initiatives such as these that the federal government 
has been undermining the role of Montreal as a transportation hub. 
We have lots of practical suggestions to offer-as my Bloc 
colleagues and I have done all day-to put Montreal, the heart of 
Quebec, back in its rightful place in Canada and in America.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> It being5.15 p.m., it is my duty to interrupt the proceedings and put 
forthwith every question necessary to dispose of the business of 
supply.
<P>
	The question is on Mr. Ménard's amendment to the amendment. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the amendment to the 
amendment?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> All those in

	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> In my opinion

Orders period.
<P>
	As for private members' business, the member for Burlington is 
not present in the House to propose the order according to the 
notice published in today's Notice Paper. Therefore, the order is 
dropped to the bottom of the order of precedence on the Order 
Paper.
<P>
	Is there unanimous consent to proceed to the adjournment 
debate?

	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">ADJOURNMENT PROCEEDINGS</H2>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 deemed 
to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="MILITARYJUSTICE">MILITARY JUSTICE</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, the 
Department of National Defence is one of the largest federal 
departments, with a work force of about 25,000 civilian employees, 
a regular force of about 67,000 military personnel, a reserve of 
about 23,000 people and an annual budget of almost $10.5 billion.
<P>
	In the last few years, the minister has been confronted with 
constant internal changes that concern me a lot and, I am sure, 
Canadian and Quebec taxpayers as well.
<P>
	It is true that National Defence went through a program of 
massive work force reduction and put in place a program of 
restructuring its command and internal control, due to the budget 
cuts that were imposed. But what concerns me mostly is the fact 
that all these changes seem to be accompanied by a chronic 
leadership void at the highest levels of the military hierarchy.
<P>
	I was reading this week a document from the auditor general of 
Canada, dated February 1994, concerning the transition within 
National Defence. Some allegations in it are confirming my 
concerns.
<P>
	On page 5 of that document, one can read, and I quote: ``We 
found persistent deficiencies in the department's accountability 
systems and reports to Parliament. We noted inconsistencies in data 
concerning unit combat readiness and we expressed concerns 
relating  to data control in the central performance management 
system.''
<P>
	On the next page, the auditors found out that the largest 
component of the reserve, that is the militia, had no performance 
standards. We learned that the department was providing very few 
data to Parliament about the reserve performance and that the 
information given could sometimes be misleading.
<P>
	Consequently, with this type of situation that has been going on 
for many years within the armed forces, how could there be no 
excesses? How can we make sure that officers in charge can control 
the few individuals who are damaging the morale and the image of 
our troops abroad and at home?
<P>
	How can we prevent scandals such as the Somalia affair or the 
cover-up operation orchestrated by the higher echelons of the 
military structure?
<P>
<B>(1720)</B>
<P>
	I would like the government to explain to me what it plans on 
doing to restore the credibility of our troops, of our military 
interventions and our peacekeeping operations abroad. What 
measures does the new Minister of National Defence plan to take to 
prevent the corruption and abuse problems which not only tarnish 
the department's image, but undermine the morale of the troops?
<P>
	The government must be responsible. It must undertake as fast 
as possible a cleaning operation within our armed forces. It must 
not do what it just did, which is wait until the scandals come from 
all directions before acting under pressure from public opinion and 
negative polls.
<P>
	It is the government's duty to have authority over its generals, 
and all of its senior officers responsible for our security. The 
taxpayers are entitled to respect. Every year, we pay more than 
$10.5 billion to maintain a disciplined institution, and it strikes me 
as normal for those responsible for its administration to be 
answerable for their actions.
<P>
	Does the government have plans for another cross-Canada 
survey to find out what it needs to do now to reinstate a code of 
conduct in our armed services personnel abroad? Does the 
government have plans for another survey to find out what it needs 
to do to get those who manage the Department of National Defence 
to administer the billions of dollars entrusted to them with 
decency?
<P>
	In the interest of transparency and accountability, will the Prime 
Minister shoulder his own responsibilities and call for the Minister 
of National Defence to rectify his code of ethics and to thoroughly 
scrutinize the events which are a constant source of scandal, day 
after day?
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="5707"> 5707 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Richardson (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure, and I thank the hon. member 
for Shefford for his question.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	However, I have to put into perspective some of his concerns. 
When discussing the military justice system it is important to 
recognize that the system is there to support the stringent and often 
unique requirements of military discipline during peacetime, but 
more particularly wartime.
<P>
	This does not mean that the military justice system exists in 
isolation. This is not the case, nor should it be.
<P>
	Indeed the military justice system seeks to parallel the civil 
judicial system. As a result, the military justice system has and 
continues to evolve alongside the civil judicial system.
<P>
	For example, Canadians can rest assured that the Canadian 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms has applied to the military justice 
system from the moment the charter came into force and effect. 
Citizen soldier are treated no differently than other Canadian 
citizens under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
<P>
	There should be no misconception, however, that the military 
justice system as it currently exists is somehow less rigorous and 
holds military members to some lesser standards of justice. In fact, 
recent judgments of the Supreme Court of Canada and the Court 
Martial Appeal Court of Canada have endorsed the independence 
of the court martial system but indeed the integrity and validity of 
the system as well.
<P>
	We do recognize, however, that all justice systems are complex 
and must evolve in order to keep pace with the changing needs of 
the society they serve.
<P>
	As I have already stated, recent Supreme Court rulings support 
the overall validity of the military justice system. Yet there is 
always a need for the legal system to be examined vis-à-vis a 
changing society.
<P>
	We must seek to allay concerns that the military justice system 
may somehow be less than rigorous and unable to withstand public 
scrutiny. Toward this end I can assure this House that the prudent 
and measured examination of the military justice system will 
continue.
<P>
	Of course, the work of the Somalia commission of inquiry 
concerning the military justice system will be an important element 
of any examination. It is therefore with anticipation that we look 
forward to receiving the recommendations of the commission upon 
the conclusion of its work on March 25, 1997.
<P>
<B>(1725 )</B>
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="TOURISM">TOURISM</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Andy Mitchell (Parry Sound-Muskoka, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, further to my question to the Minister of Industry, I wish 
to emphasize that tourism is one of the most important industries in 
my riding. It is an industry that accounts for half the jobs, that is 
one in every two jobs in the riding. It is a significant economic 
generator in Parry Sound-Muskoka.
<P>
	It is also a significant economic generator throughout the rest of 
Canada, which is why our government increased to $50 million its 
support to this important sector. It is why our government 
established the Canadian Tourism Commission to stem the tide of 
the international tourism deficit.
<P>
	Indeed, tourism is a $26 billion industry in this country and 
constitutes in my riding wholehearted support for the federal 
government's action to increase the economic spinoffs from this 
important sector.
<P>
	However, I believe that through the Canadian Tourism 
Commission there is even more that can be done. It is true that in 
partnership with industry members, the private sector and federal 
and provincial governments the tourism commission has been 
successful in achieving a 13 per cent increase in international 
tourism receipts in Canada.
<P>
	These initiatives have also generated an almost 2 per cent 
increase in employment in the tourism sector, which is good news 
for Canadians everywhere.
<P>
	This is good progress, but I want to make sure that everything 
that can be done will be done to enhance economic development in 
areas that are dependent on tourism for their livelihood and, in 
particular, in rural and remote areas of Canada.
<P>
	For example, in my riding the federal government will continue 
to support local projects and events through investments in 
infrastructure and human resources development.
<P>
	Since 1993, through federal programming initiatives, I have 
facilitated an investment of more than $1 million for tourism in our 
riding.
<P>
	The federal government has supported things like a snowmobile 
trail system to develop and lengthen our tourism season. We have 
supported cultural facilities and tourism centres in addition to the 
work that we have done with chambers of commerce through the 
promotion of events and attractions.
<P>
	Our work in the riding will continue because tourism is such an 
important industry and such an important job source for 
constituents. I believe the work of the tourism commission will 
extend this support.
<P>
	One of the commission's most important objectives, of course, is 
to reduce the international tourism deficit. Part of that goal is to 
divert some of the travellers from the United States and encourage 
them instead to travel to our many and varied tourism regions here 
in Canada. This is particularly important to the constituents in my  
riding. The reliance on partnerships is key to the success of that 
relationship.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="5708"> 5708 </A></B>
<P>
	In addition to its success in Canada as a whole, I want to ensure 
that the tourism commission works well in rural and remote 
Canada. We need to take the small business tourism operators into 
account with our policies and with the work of the commission. It 
is important that our government facilitate the creation of 
partnerships among local rural players like those in my riding.
<P>
	Research and development in the tourism industry, new 
technology, access to capital and infrastructure are the things that 
will benefit rural tourism operators. The tourism commission will 
play a key role in that development through undertakings that 
expand on current initiatives and achievements to date.
<P>
	I ask the parliamentary secretary what can constituents expect in 
a rural riding like mine from the commission in this regard?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morris Bodnar (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Minister for the Atlantic Canada Opportunities 
Agency and Minister of Western Economic Diversification, 
Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, the Canadian Tourism Commission was 
created in February 1995. This public/private sector partnership 
was able to take advantage of positive external conditions, for 
example, expanding economies, fluctuating exchange rates and 
structural developments to regain market share in key areas and 
reduce the travel deficit.
<P>
	In his February 27, 1996 response to the speech from the throne 
the Prime Minister spoke of the CTC as a remarkable success 
which will serve as a model of partnership between the various 
levels of government and the private sector for the 21st Century.
<P>
	In establishing the CTC the Prime Minister challenged the 
industry to match the federal government's financial commitment 
of $50 million annually within the three years of its creation.
<P>
	Partners in 1995-96, the first year of operation, provided 
approximately $40 million in co-funding programming. To date, in 
1996-97, it appears that the target of exceeding $50 million in 
partner funding will be met.
<P>
	Results to date are impressive. Canada's travel account deficit 
fell from $4 billion in 1994 to $3 billion in 1995, a decrease of 25 
per cent.
<P>
	In 1995 tourism employed 488,500 persons directly. This was a 2 
per cent increase in tourism employment in 1995 over 1994. 
Statistics Canada estimates that in 1995 tourism spending in 
Canada amounted to $41.8 billion, up from $39 billion in 1994, a 7 
per cent increase. In 1995, 17 million international tourists visited 
Canada, up 6 per cent over 1994. Tourists from the United States 
increased by 4 per cent to 13 million while tourists from overseas 
countries rose by 14 per cent to 4 million.
<P>
