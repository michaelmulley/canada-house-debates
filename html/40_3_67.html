  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The petitioners note that our Constitution guarantees freedom of conscience and freedom of religion. They note that some Canadians object on conscientious and religious grounds to participating in any way in the military and associated activities that train people to kill and use violence, produce and purchase lethal weapons, conduct military related research, prepare for war and killing and other activities that perpetuate violence, thus hindering the achievement of all forms of peace. They support legislation to allow such conscientious objectors to redirect a portion of their taxes from military to peaceful, non-military purposes.</div>

The first petition is a call against Health Canada's authorization of caffeine in all soft drinks. Health Canada announced on March 19, 2010 that the beverage companies will now be allowed to add up to 75% of the caffeine allowed in the most highly caffeinated colas to all of their soft drinks.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soft drinks have been marketed and designed toward children for generations. Canadians already have concerns over children drinking coffee and colas as they acknowledge that caffeine is an addictive stimulant. It is difficult enough for parents to control the amount of sugar, artificial sweeteners and other additives that children consume, including caffeine from colas.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the petitioners call upon the Government of Canada to reverse Health Canada's new rule allowing caffeine in all soft drinks and not to follow the deregulation policies of the United States and other countries that could sacrifice the health of Canadian children and pregnant women.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response to threats of terrorism and in the period just after 9/11, there was much debate about what we would do if we were faced with future terrorist threats, attacks or rumours of attacks or threats to our country and to our people. It was not a unilateral decision but it was felt by this Parliament that two inclusions should be made to our over 100-year-old Criminal Code. For the people who wrote and enacted the Criminal Code in the 1890s, probably the nearest thing to a terrorist attack was the War of 1812 or the raid in St. Albans, Vermont in 1865. That was probably in the psyche of most of the people who wrote the code way back when.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look back to 2001 to the communities like Gander, Newfoundland and Labrador, Moncton and Halifax that welcomed plane loads of people diverted by the terrorist attacks in New York, which we recently commemorated earlier this month. What was the mentality of the Canadian public and parliamentarians with respect to public security? Something needed to be done. As Canadians and parliamentarians, we felt under attack. We felt ill-equipped to handle the next perhaps imminent threat of terrorist activity. We as Canadians felt, because of concerns made known at the time, that our border was porous and that somehow we had something to do collectively in a remote guilt sense for the occurrences in New York and other places on that day. </div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parliament, therefore, decided to inculcate the Criminal Code with two tools to be used if necessary, one being the investigative hearing. In the Criminal Code of Canada an investigative hearing would allow authorities to compel the testimony of an individual without the right to decline to answer questions on the basis of self-incrimination. </div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intent would be to call in those on the periphery of an alleged plot who may have vital information, rather than the core suspects. These are the people on the periphery, who would have an overwhelming incentive to lie to protect themselves, the actual accused. It was an attempt, working in concert with CSIS and our investigative security-based individuals, to find out more information to prevent terrorist attacks and terrorist incidents. That was to be inserted into the Criminal Code of Canada, a very new provision.</div>
</p><a name="Para2076860" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second new provision was the preventive arrest provision, allowing police to arrest and hold an individual, in some cases without warrant, provided they have reasonable grounds to believe that the arrest would prevent future terrorist activity. Those were introduced in 2004. In the context of 2001, the context seemed reasonable. The context was that we were protecting our community. We were protecting our nation.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were many safeguards built in to those provisions, and I might add that it was a Liberal government that brought in these provisions, so I do not think it lies in anyone's mouth on any side to say that Liberals are not concerned with terrorism. This was Liberal legislation, and like all legislation that was new and that dealt with the collision between the need for public safety and the primacy of individual rights, it is the collective versus the individual. Like all of those debates and all those pieces of legislation, the collision always results in imperfection because no one goes home completely satisfied with the result.</div>
</p><a name="Para2076862" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key part of the legislation was the so-called sunset clause. At the end of five years, the legislation would sunset and would be no more. The provision was put in place clearly because parliamentarians, particularly members of the Liberal caucus and members of the government, and committee reports and minutes are replete with speeches to this effect, realized that this collision between the public security goal and the private rights goal would result, potentially, into an intrusion into the latter, so they said, “Let us sunset it. Let us see if it is needed, if it is used wantonly, without regard for personal rights, if it is used at all, and if it can be interpreted by the courts or refined through practice”. </div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many times we lob a ball into the air called legislation and really hope that the courts get a chance to interpret it, to get it right, one might say, but we do try to make legislation work. In this case, the sunset clause was allowed to sunset, despite attempts to bring the debate back to Parliament. At the very end of the time for the period to run out, a debate was held and the sunset clause was not removed, or the legislation was not permitted to continue, so we are without these tools. This is where we are today. This is the debate today, whether we should have these tools in our Criminal Code with respect to terrorism or suspected terrorism. </div>

Our legislation respects individual freedoms and the fact that individuals must never be punished unless we are certain that they are guilty of a crime, and it ensures that the individual's fundamental rights are not intruded upon.</div>
</p><a name="Para2076907" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legislators at the time thought that such an intrusion was possible. That is why they inserted a sunset clause so that the legislation would be reviewed in five years to see whether it was still warranted. To determine whether this was the case, the attorney general was asked to report on whether the legislation was justified, and why. In all of the reports that he submitted, the attorney general noted that the fact that these provisions were not used by the RCMP or federal prosecutors in the first five years and two months of their existence illustrates that officials were proceeding cautiously in using these powers. They did not use them. Not once did the RCMP or other federal prosecutors make use of this legislation.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is it necessary to maintain a tool that has never been used? I think that when this came back for review—in February 2007, if my memory serves me correctly—we made it clear that there was a risk that these laws could be used by a malevolent government to stigmatize political opponents. The leader of the Liberal Party at the time said that one of his reasons for not supporting the renewal, that is, for not allowing the provisions to stand, was that there was a risk of unfairly stigmatizing someone. And that stigma could seriously damage the person's life because he would be subject to a court ruling related to terrorism followed by a recognizance.</div>
</p><a name="Para2076911" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not forget that this recognizance and the proceedings require reasonable grounds, plausible suspicions, but suspicions of a serious offence. Consequently, if it is suspected that someone has potentially committed or may commit a serious offence, that person is then subject to a court ruling. How will this person's life be affected by having a court impose terrorism-related conditions? If these suspicions were unjustified, which could very easily happen since they are only suspicions, how can this person prove that the suspicions are unjustified and then overcome the stigma? I remember that that was the case with Maher Arar, who was flagged not in court, but in reports that were sent to another security service, that of the United States. How can this person be taken off the no-fly list? I am sure that someone who has been subject to a recognizance would be on this list. And since it is public, if his employer hears that he was subject to a recognizance, will he keep his job? Will another employer give him a job in the future?</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed legislation before us today contains no provisions to ensure that someone falsely suspected can somehow get rid of that stigma. The absence of such a procedure would be enough in itself to justify not renewing the clause.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to understand why this measure is more or less useless. When an individual suspected of being involved in a terrorist act is brought before a judge, the only thing the judge can do is impose conditions; the judge cannot incarcerate that individual. And if the individual agrees to sign the recognizance, the judge must release him.</div>
</p><a name="Para2076915" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For heaven's sake, in today's reality, how does a person become the object of such suspicions, which do not allow authorities to lay formal charges against that person? Suspicions probably arise when authorities learn about some of the person's relationships or as a result of electronic surveillance conducted in people's homes. But if those things clearly established the existence of a terrorist plot and that person's involvement, there would be evidence of a conspiracy. Conspiracy is a criminal offence, even if the objective of the conspiracy is never achieved. So that person could be charged with conspiracy and brought before a judge. The judge determines whether it is in the public's interest to incarcerate the individual, considering the evidence of conspiracy that is presented. That judge can incarcerate the individual, unlike a judge whose only recourse is to impose release conditions. The judge can even detain the individual.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then what happens? The proceedings continue and either the charges are dropped and the person is acquitted, or the person is found guilty. If he is found guilty, then so much the better.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonetheless, we have to consider that not everyone who is acquitted owes that outcome to a savvy lawyer or insufficient evidence presented to the judge. In our society, I like to think that people are acquitted because they are not guilty. When a person is acquitted of a charge he can go on with his life. However, when a person is ordered by a judge to sign a recognizance on suspicion of terrorism, he is stigmatized for life.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two main reasons why this legislation should not proceed. First, the measures it provides for are useless. It has never been used because it is useless. Second, it is dangerous. A government could easily be tempted to use it, not for its intended purpose but to stigmatize political rivals, which is often the case. For example, those who want stricter and stricter laws are happy to denounce those who stand for fundamental legal principles and a different attitude toward crime. They are portrayed as being pro-crime. I have heard that many times from those in government now.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are still a number of reasons why this legislation should not be renewed. Not enough changes have been made, according to those who believe they are necessary.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that case, we can charge the person. Those who drafted this bill believe that signing a recognizance is less serious than having charges laid.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why has the legislator, the attorney general, who was presented with these arguments in 2007, not found a solution? Because he has made no effort to do so. That is laziness in addition to recklessness. He is accepting a law that, when initially passed, could be dangerous for individual rights. It is the type of law that terrorist organizations would like to see adopted across the globe. We are playing their game by drafting laws that grant such discretionary power.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will acknowledge that there are two amendments that would improve the legislation. First, there is the fact that police must show that other investigative methods have failed, and second, there is the right to have a lawyer of the person's choice present, as the member who spoke before me mentioned. But we still have the same fundamental problem: this law can destroy the reputation of someone who perhaps does not deserve it.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am referring to the election that was held the year after the War Measures Act was used and almost all those who ran against Mayor Drapeau were incarcerated.

I noted that the previous Liberal speaker talked about rights being in collision and rights being conditional. I note that it was a Liberal government during World War II that violated the rights of Japanese Canadians and interned them. I note as well that it was a Liberal government in 1970 that violated the rights of Canadians and Quebeckers under the War Measures Act. It was also a Liberal government that passed the Anti-terrorism Act after 9/11 that had outrageous violations of the civil liberties of Canadians.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am wondering if my hon. colleague would comment on the fact that Liberal governments seem to take an approach that civil liberties can be violated when times are difficult, the very time when civil liberties are most important. I am wondering if he could share his thoughts on whether civil liberties ought to be respected in times of peace but not in times that are challenging, or whether he thinks civil liberties are a core fundamental Canadian value that must be respected at all times.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legislation would also does something else that is extremely offensive and something that all parliamentarians ought to protect and oppose vigilantly, and that is the concept of preventive arrest.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This summer in Toronto, at the G20 hearings, authorities of the state arrested 1,100 Canadians for simply walking in the street and expressing their views. Why did it do that? It did that for preventive reasons. We know that because for 900 of those 1,100 Canadians, when they appeared in court several months later and the state was forced to actually back up those arrests, the state withdrew the charges. What happened this summer? Eleven hundred Canadians had their civil rights violated, their right to assemble publicly and peacefully and to express themselves under multiple sections of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The government and the state took away those rights because of preventive reasons. It took away the rights of those Canadians to express peacefully to world leaders gathering in our country how they felt about issues affecting the world and the government and organs of the state violated the rights of Canadians in that regard.</div>

It was a Liberal government in 1970 that rounded up Quebeckers without charge and detained them and violated their civil liberties. After 9/11, it was a Liberal government, in a rush to look tough, brought in the Anti-terrorism Act that had a number of serious incursions into Canadian civil liberties.</div>

However, I can tell the House that under our present Criminal Code, which has provisions for conspiracy and provisions that give our police officers the powers they need to investigate any kind of terrorist act, there have been successful prosecutions.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our party felt that the investigative process needed to be better defined.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We were also firmly opposed to section 83.3, dealing with preventive arrest and recognizance with conditions. Not only do we feel that this measure is of little, if any, use in the fight against terrorism but, more importantly, there is a very real danger of its being used against honest citizens. This is important, because it is part of a responsible approach. Some members here say they want to amend the Criminal Code, but really, the goal should be to actually improve the situation.

The Bloc Québécois introduced the first ever reverse onus legislation in this House regarding profits made from the proceeds of crime. As a result—and thanks to the Bloc Québécois—criminals now have to prove that they came by their money honestly, otherwise it automatically becomes evidence of their guilt. That is a choice. These battles have to be fought, and they will be won—as my colleague said in his speech—when more power is placed in the hands of the police.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specifically, what this bill will do is establish investigative hearings under the provisions of the Anti-terrorism Act, whereby individuals who may have information about past or future terrorism offences can be compelled to attend a hearing and to answer questions.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other significant provision of this legislation is a provision for preventive arrest, whereby individuals may be arrested without a warrant in order to prevent the carrying out of a terrorist act. Detention in this case would be based on what someone might do in a certain situation. The arrested individual must be brought before a judge within 24 hours, or as soon as it is feasible. The judge determines whether the individual is to be released unconditionally or released under certain conditions, recognizance with conditions, which are in effect for up to 12 months.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is indeed significant legislation, and it is not the first time we have seen it come before the House. It came out of the Anti-terrorism Act that was enacted after the 9/11 events. At that time, when there were serious concerns about what had recently happened, everybody was worried and fearful, which is not too strong a word to use, about what was actually going on at that time.</div>
</p><a name="Para2077085" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two provisions were included in that legislation, albeit with a sunset clause requiring that they be reviewed within five years. If Parliament did not re-approve them, they would come to an end. In fact, that is exactly what happened. When they were put to Parliament, Parliament did not agree to their extension.</div>
</p><a name="Para2077086" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since that time, there have been several attempts by the Conservative government to reintroduce these provisions into our criminal law, into the Anti-terrorism Act. One was short-circuited by an early prorogation of the House, and others have not been given the priority that, if they were sufficiently important, they should certainly have received.</div>
</p><a name="Para2077087" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not the first time, in my term as a member of Parliament, that we have debated these issues. I have to wonder why, if this is so important, it was not given a higher priority by the government. It belies the importance of these issues that the government has not made sure this legislation got through earlier.</div>
</p><a name="Para2077088" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also have to wonder why this legislation is necessary. I do not believe that we are responding to any serious failure of the Criminal Code of Canada to deal with terrorism, or any of the crimes that might be related to terrorism in Canada. I have not heard that we have failed to convict people who have committed terrorist acts or who are considering terrorist acts. In fact, post 9/11, we have convicted people under the provisions of the Criminal Code, without using these special provisions of crimes related to terrorism. We have seen the group in Toronto. We have seen others who have been convicted. This would say to me that there is not a problem with the existing Criminal Code legislation, that there is not a problem in investigating and actually charging and convicting people in the usual process of crimes related to terrorism.</div>
</p><a name="Para2077089" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to ask, then, regarding these special provisions, which go way beyond the normal provisions of our justice system, and which violate fundamental human rights in Canada, why we would want to go down that road. To my knowledge, no proof has ever been presented to the House or to one of the committees of the House, that the current provisions of the Criminal Code are not functioning when it comes to dealing with acts of terrorism or conspiracy to commit terrorism. Why do we have these provisions before us?</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to consider the serious nature of these provisions. They have a serious effect on what Canadians have come to know as basic human rights, basic civil liberties. The proposal to compel testimony from individuals, to force people to testify in court, violates the right to remain silent. It violates the right not to incriminate oneself before the law. That is a serious violation. It is something that most Canadians appreciate in our criminal law. Before we go down this road, we need to consider carefully why all this is necessary.</div>
</p><a name="Para2077091" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The investigative hearing proposals in this legislation would force someone to testify before a judge if he or she were suspected of having information about terrorist activity that has already occurred or that might occur. It directly compromises the right to remain silent, one of the fundamental principles of our justice system. The refusal to testify at an investigative hearing can lead to one year of jail time. It can also reduce the right to silence for persons who are questioned by the RCMP or CSIS: if they are uncooperative with a police investigation, the possibility of having to go to an investigative hearing can be used to compel cooperation and compromise their right to remain silent.</div>
</p><a name="Para2077092" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to realize that not everyone who chooses to remain silent in such circumstances is guilty, that choosing to remain silent is not an admission of guilt or proof of guilt. People may have legitimate fears and concerns. For instance, they might be concerned about their personal safety. Given the broad definition of terrorism in the Anti-terrorism Act, I believe that this provision is a problem. The definition itself has come in for criticism in the past.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This provision and the one on preventive detention are serious departures from our justice process.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of people today have mentioned the G20 protest and the mass arrests that were held. For the most part, they appeared to be carried out for preventive reasons.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole question of investigative hearings raises another serious issue about how we do justice in this country. It puts judges in the position of having to oversee an investigation, which is a real departure from the normal process in our system.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also the matter of preventive detention. Preventive detention, or recognizance with conditions, is the other key part of the bill. It compromises a key principle of our justice system, namely, that one should be charged, convicted, and sentenced in order to be jailed. This provision would allow for the arrest and detention of people without ever proving any allegation against them. It could make people subject to conditions on release with severe limitations on their personal freedom, even if they have never been convicted of any crime. That is a serious departure from what we would normally expect from our justice system.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a good example to be found in our practice already, and I think it is a very bad practice. It relates to the question of security certificates, which is a measure under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. We have seen this in the post-9/11 period. It was intended to expedite deportation of non-citizens. Under this legislation, we have seen it used as a method of detaining people, a method of preventive detention for people that the state suspected may have been involved in terrorist activity. The most recent cases were the five men who were detained for years, some up to eight years, without ever being charged or convicted of a crime.</div>
</p><a name="Para2077102" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think this was a distortion of the intention of the security certificate legislation. I also think it was a process that violated basic human rights in Canada. Some of these men are still subject to release conditions as a result of the security certificate that this government issued against them and that the previous Liberal government initiated. </div>
</p><a name="Para2077103" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are serious problems, and we have seen some of these problems emerge in the court processes that these men have been involved in over the years. In fact, a number of the security certificates have now been thrown out because of the length of time they have been used and problems related to evidence.</div>
</p><a name="Para2077104" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have to emphasize that these people have never been charged or convicted of any crime in Canada. The security certificate process has had nothing to do with that. I think this is an indication of how a legal measure can be distorted. Security certificates were intended to expedite deportation for people who had violated the conditions of their stay in Canada. But they have been used for other purposes. That is something we need to consider when we are looking at extraordinary measures like the ones in this legislation.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one has demonstrated to my satisfaction that this existing provision will not meet the needs of dealing with terrorist activity.

I have been listening to the debate this morning and feeling so proud to hear my colleagues from the NDP. We heard from our justice critic, the member for <a class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',128527,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" href="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=128527&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Windsor—Tecumseh</a>, yesterday. Today we heard from our public safety critic, the member for <a class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',128327,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" href="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=128327&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Vancouver Kingsway</a>, who made a very compelling speech about what is wrong with this legislation and why we are opposing it.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to begin at that point because I was in the House in 2001 when this legislation was introduced very soon after the events of 9/11. I remember, and the member for <a class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',128529,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" href="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=128529&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Burnaby—Douglas</a> spoke about this, the sense of panic and fear that did exist, even within this Parliament. I remember in debating the legislation at that time, almost 10 years ago now, the sense of the need to act, to bring in something to show that the government of the day, a Liberal government, was responding to these grotesque acts of terrorism and in having that debate back in 2001. It was finally passed in 2002. </div>
</p><a name="Para2077150" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was not on the justice committee, but I remember reading the testimony from the witnesses, people who do reflect upon the law and the state of our criminal justice system. Even back then there were dire warnings and concerns that were expressed about the anti-terrorism legislation, in the manner that it was rushed through, that it was ill thought out, but fundamentally a question as to whether or not we even needed the legislation.</div>
</p><a name="Para2077151" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here we are now, so many years later, in what we could say is a sober second thought and yet, we are poised to move ahead again on those elements of the original bill that were sunsetted. The reason that they were sunsetted, the five-year clause dealing with investigative hearings and preventative arrest, is they were so controversial that certainly the NDP and the Bloc, at the time, pressed very hard to get those measures included so there would be a proper and full parliamentary review on those very serious provisions in the original bill. As others have pointed out, when those sections came to their conclusion, at the end of February, a resolution that came forward in this House to actually extend those provisions for three years was actually defeated. I remember that debate, too, and I remember participating in that discussion.</div>
</p><a name="Para2077152" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think at that point many of us were hopeful that we had had that serious second sober thought about the bill, about its consequences, how it had been used, the fact that it has not been used, and that the time was really to ensure that those sunsetted clause remained that way.</div>
</p><a name="Para2077153" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here we are again debating those same provisions and because of the reversal by the Liberal Party, the Liberal members, it appears that this bill will now continue on to committee. We will see what happens after that, but it does not bode well.</div>
</p><a name="Para2077154" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess what I want to focus on is the fact that it does strike me as very compelling that, on the one hand, we are dealing with a matter as serious as this legislation and anti-terrorism. Some of us are trying to weigh up whether or not this kind of legislation is actually needed and yet, there is so little attention to it. That was my reason for asking the member <a class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',128529,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" href="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=128529&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Burnaby—Douglas</a> because it astounds me that there is so little attention. There is no attention that I can see in the media and no awareness in the general public that we are debating this bill. We are about to march forward with these kinds of provisions that would have such a deep impact on Canadian society, our fundamental rights to remain silent, to remain innocent until there are charges brought.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are very basic things within the Canadian democratic society. Yet, on the other hand we have the perfect storm around the gun registry. The gun registry is important. I am someone who is going to be voting to support the continuation of the gun registry. However, it is so ironic to me what gets attention and what does not.</div>
</p><a name="Para2077156" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, this debate today is really important. As individual parliamentarians and within our caucuses we have to reflect on what it is that we are unleashing again, what we are allowing to unfold.</div>
</p><a name="Para2077157" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing some of the debate, one could be left with the impression that we have no laws in Canada to deal with terrorism and this is why we have to have it. I find that this is very much a disturbing trend that we see coming from the Conservative government. Its whole agenda is on formulating new laws, little boutique provisions, that it brings forward to the Criminal Code when in actual fact, when we look at it in the cold light of day, when we look at it in terms of real evidence and factual information, many of these laws that have been brought forward actually are not required. Our justice system and the laws that we have in the country are very comprehensive.</div>
</p><a name="Para2077158" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is not to say that there are not changes that are needed, but if we look at the drug bill that we had in the House, if we look at the private member's bill on trafficking, they were all proposals that were designed to give people the illusion that somehow we are tackling a major problem.</div>
</p><a name="Para2077159" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As my colleague pointed out earlier, in some instances what we needed to be focusing on was better policing, better intelligence gathering or better enforcement of the provisions that we have.</div>
</p><a name="Para2077160" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This idea that for every issue and problem that we have in our society we need a new and tougher law, and we need to keep bringing these on, becomes like an assembly line of putting these laws one after the other. We end up debating them ad nauseam in the House. I think there is a pattern here and the bill is very much disturbingly a key element in that pattern that is coming forward from the Conservative government.</div>
</p><a name="Para2077161" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have heard today of some of the provisions there are already in the Criminal Code to deal with suspected acts of terrorism. I do not have a shadow of a doubt that within our existing framework we do have adequate provisions to deal with this issue. By allowing these two provisions to go ahead, first, the one dealing with investigative hearings where someone can be compelled to attend a hearing and to answer questions, and second, on preventative arrest whereby someone who might be do something with no evidence necessarily can be arrested and brought before a judge, a decision can be made about whether or not to incarcerate individuals for up to 12 months or whether to release them on certain conditions. We have heard again and again that these provisions actually have not been used.</div>
</p><a name="Para2077162" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was one situation with the Air India inquiry where one of these provisions was used but the evidence was never brought forward. However, in a general sense, over this many years the key provisions of the bill have actually not been used. It should tell us something about this legislation. It should tell us something about Canadian society.</div>
</p><a name="Para2077163" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very striking that we are again debating this legislation and about to move forward on these two very problematic clauses.</div>
</p><a name="Para2077164" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have situations in Canada already where we have had serious movements within the justice system. The security certificate is one.

</p><a name="Para2077165" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have seen cases where individuals have been imprisoned for years at a time, some of whom went on hunger strikes. Their basic rights were violated and they lived in very difficult conditions.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, New Democrats again will firmly stand in opposition to this legislation. We believe that these two provisions need to be abandoned. They do not need to go ahead. We will remain steadfast in that opposition and alert people to what is going on, and hope that other members of the House will come to that conclusion as well.</div>

I am not going to say anything the Bloc Québécois has not already said about this bill, but I am going to provide a few examples to illustrate how inappropriate it would be to renew the sunset clauses, as is the government's intention in introducing Bill <a class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',4448899,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=4448899&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-17, An Act to amend the Criminal Code (investigative hearing and recognizance with conditions)</a>.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any bill we debate the Bloc Québécois likes to see a certain balance. In this specific case, in any legislative measure on terrorism such as Bill <a class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',4448899,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=4448899&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-17</a>, there absolutely must be a balance between security and respecting other basic rights.</div>
</p><a name="Para2077169" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier, I heard an NDP colleague talk about human rights and civil liberties. Indeed, pushing things too far in one direction or another causes problems. That is where the government needs to step in. For example, if we go in the direction of inappropriate security that violates our civil liberties, we can end up in a situation like the one at the G20 in Toronto. People who had gathered together for a peaceful demonstration were arrested in their dormitory. They had not even started demonstrating. </div>
</p><a name="Para2077170" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There may be excessive preventive measures when it comes to security. The same is true in the other direction. If terrorists or potential terrorists can use loopholes to execute their Machiavellian and diabolical plans, then we have to do something about that. </div>
</p><a name="Para2077171" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we look at what has happened since these sunset clauses were established, we realize that they have never been used. That is why the government has come in a few years later with the intention of reinstating these clauses, but there is no evidence to support their usefulness.</div>
</p><a name="Para2077172" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Between December 2004 and March 2007, there were several debates and several committees studied this issue. The Bloc Québécois listened to witnesses, read submissions, and questioned experts, representatives of civil society and law enforcement officials. We have all the tools we need, therefore, to determine our position on investigative hearings and recognizance with conditions, the two points being considered in this bill.</div>
</p><a name="Para2077173" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then as now, we in the Bloc Québécois feel that it is better to provide more guidelines on investigative hearings. That is the first point we want to make. It is obvious to us that this exceptional provision should only be used in certain specific cases to prevent actions involving an imminent risk of serious harm, and not in the case of acts that have already been committed. This does not mean that we are opposed to investigative hearings, but they should be confined to specific cases when it is essential to have them.</div>
</p><a name="Para2077174" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In regard to recognizance with conditions, we are still opposed to section 83.3 concerning preventive arrest and recognizance with conditions. This is a useless and ineffective process. These clauses have never been used in all the time they have existed. Not only are they ineffective at fighting terrorism, but the uses to which they could be put will always be a sword of Damocles hanging over the heads of people, a clear danger to the rights of honest citizens. </div>
</p><a name="Para2077175" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I mentioned the G20 a little while ago. Justice will take its course, but there were clearly some abuses in the arrests that were made following the demonstrations. Some well-known agitators go to demonstrations of this kind, even if they are supposed to be peaceful, in order to create trouble. The police have a duty to arrest these people, and they generally do a good job in order to prevent things from degenerating into a riot.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes, though, the police get carried away, cross the barricades, and go after people who are there for perfectly legitimate reasons. This is still a democratic country. There are valid reasons, therefore, for going to demonstrations and expressing one’s disapproval of decisions the government has made or even decisions made on a global level. That is why these demonstrations occur. I think there was also a problem with this.</div>
</p><a name="Para2077177" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A number of experts testified that dangerous terrorist activities can already be averted effectively—even more effectively—through the normal application of the Criminal Code with none of the harmful consequences that preventive arrest may entail.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So we already have the tools we need. Our job as legislators is to improve the bills that come before us. We are never against that. We are always in favour of doing what we can to improve security, but to do that, we need to change a piece of legislation, amend it or add some clauses to improve and facilitate the work that our police forces do.

There was a reason for the sunset clauses: the measures were made available to the police for a period of time to see whether they could be used effectively.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since September 11, that phrase, driving while black, has actually been recoined as flying while Arab. Profiling is broader than just race now. It takes into account religion, culture and even ideology. Concerns about profiling based on race, culture or religion are real but they are accentuated by threats of terror. There is an alarming tendency to paint an entire group with one brush when in fact it is the act of individuals rather than religious or ethnic groups that are at fault.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the Senate committee hearings in 2005 actually reviewing the Anti-terrorism Act, Canadian Muslim and Arab groups argued that if law enforcement agents were going to use profiling in their investigations, profiling needed to be based on behaviour, not ethnicity or religion.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know that applicants for immigration to Canada do not need to use the services of an immigration representative in order to immigrate here. The Government of Canada treats everyone equally whether or not they hire a representative to deal with Immigration Canada in their application to visit or move here. However, because moving to a new country has its own challenges and because immigration procedures often seem complex, many prospective immigrants seek the services of a consultant for help in navigating the process of immigration.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now while most immigration consultants working in Canada are acting professionally and ethically, the unfortunate reality is that there are a number of consultants who are acting dishonestly or even illegally to try to profit from people's dream of coming to Canada. This is one of the biggest issues that new Canadians raise with me from coast to coast. In many meetings with various ethnocultural communities across Canada, I have heard numerous unsettling stories of people being taken in by dishonest immigration consultants or unethical representatives. </div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are people who take sometimes thousands or tens of thousands of dollars from individuals. I heard a story from a man of Chinese origin who had given over $100,000 in cash to a crooked consultant who had falsely guaranteed him immigration to Canada as an investor immigrant. I have also heard of students giving people sometimes over $10,000 to guarantee them status in Canada and in return get nothing. Often these crooked consultants will knowingly submit counterfeit documents in support of an application with careless disregard that our ministry officials are likely to identify the fraud, reject the visa application and often that will injure the person's chances of visiting or coming to Canada for at least two years. The crooked consultants do not care because they typically have the cash in hand and have already made their profit.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are literally thousands of such representatives, from unauthorized consultants to labour recruiters and student agents both in Canada and around the world. We want people to know that despite what some unethical representatives might say to prospective immigrants, no one has special access to the Government of Canada and all applications are treated the same. It is important to underscore this because many of the bottom-feeders in this industry will imply to people that they have some kind of in, some kind of special access to decision makers in the Canadian immigration system, and that is never true. It is important for people both here and abroad to understand that.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also important for prospective visitors or immigrants to Canada to know that if something sounds too good to be true, it probably is. If someone is offering guaranteed immigration status in Canada for a fee, go the other way, in fact, run in the opposite direction. Immigration fraud takes many forms. Immigration applicants in all immigration categories may engage in fraud against our system and some seek assistance from crooked consultants or other third parties such as labour recruiters or document counterfeiters.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It has taken quite a few years to come up with this bill. The immigration committee recommended legislative changes that would establish a body similar to the Canadian Bar Association or any professional body that would have the power to regulate itself and also to enforce the laws. The bill in front of us did not go that route. It went toward having a body that would be appointed by the minister and ultimately the minister would be in charge. CSIS or the RCMP would be in charge of going after the crooked consultants if it was proven they had done something wrong. That is a slightly different approach. Perhaps the minister could explain why he took that approach instead of the approach recommended by the immigration committee. </div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, what kind of resources are being put in place to ensure that the enforcement would be done properly?

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government claims that Bill <a class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',4588746,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=4588746&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-35</a> would close loopholes currently exploited by crooked consultants and would improve the way in which immigration consultants would be regulated. The proposed draft regulation will amend the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act so that only lawyers, notaries and authorized consultants who are members in good standing of a governing body authorized by the minister may provide advice or representation at any stage of a proceeding or application.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is important because currently the act does not regulate the activities of consultants during the pre-application or proceeding phase. Although not in the draft legislation itself, the government has publicly stated penalties would include a sentence of up to two years in jail or a $50,000 fine, or both. While this is positive, rather than introducing stand-alone legislation to permit the creation of a statutory body to regulate immigration consultants as was recommended by the Citizenship and Immigration committee, the government has decided to amend IRPA to change the manner in which third parties are regulated. It has launched a public selection process whereby organizations, including the current regulator, are competing to be selected to be the arm's-length regulatory body. The legislation provides the minister with the power to designate a body through regulations, not legislation. </div>
</p><a name="Para2077341" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many stakeholders have expressed concern that the decision to change the regulatory body through regulation rather than through stand-alone legislation will not result in the necessary governance and oversight required for the new body. There is also concern that the new body will still not have the power to sanction immigration consultants who are not members, nor have appropriate enforcement powers regarding its membership.</div>
</p><a name="Para2077342" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill also would allow Citizenship and Immigration Canada to disclose further information relating to the ethical or professional conduct of an immigration representative to those responsible for governing that conduct and would expand the time for instituting proceedings against individuals from six months to five years.</div>
</p><a name="Para2077343" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are positive changes. We are still very concerned about the resources that have not been made available to the regulatory body and to the Canada Border Services Agency, for example, to enforce sanctions against ghost consultants and legitimate but wayward ones. We are concerned about the missing legislation that might give more teeth to the body to reprimand its own members.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am, however, in favour to sending the bill to committee because I believe in the safety of our future Canadians and of the family and friends of our new Canadians.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has been a long-standing issue. There are people committing fraud and profiting from others' naïveté, and this has always been the case in all areas. And even though we as parliamentarians or citizens fight daily to lessen its presence, the problem will most likely continue to exist. You only need to watch television shows like <i>J.E. </i> or <i>La facture</i> to see that this is true. There will always be people who will abuse others to try to make a lot of money in a short amount of time.</div>
</p><a name="Para2077618" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That said, there is something different about immigration. The people going through this process are much more vulnerable than the average person, which means that there are many more people trying to take advantage of them. This issue has become very troubling.</div>
</p><a name="Para2077619" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MPs, especially those of us from urban areas, have all heard stories about people who have had unfortunate dealings with immigration consultants, with people who defrauded them, gave them bad advice or took their money. I would say that this is the tip of the iceberg because the people living in our ridings are those who have been able to navigate the process and settle in Canada. There are many people living in other countries who were fleeced by such consultants and whose voices we seldom hear. That is just as worrisome.</div>
</p><a name="Para2077620" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why are these people more vulnerable to fraud than the average citizen? Because of their ignorance of the legal system and their rights as citizens. Even though they are not Canadian citizens, anyone who lives in Canada is protected by Canadian law. Immigrants often have a vague idea about the country they are going to. It is often a dream and some people are prepared to make sacrifices to make it come true.</div>
</p><a name="Para2077621" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people do not immigrate for themselves but do so for their children. They hope to give their children a better life and are willing to make many sacrifices. They find themselves dealing with disgraceful people who tell them that they can easily obtain permanent resident status, a visa and Canadian citizenship, but that it will be expensive. They claim to be good consultants with the necessary contacts and say that they are needed in order to follow the procedures.</div>
</p><a name="Para2077622" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is obviously not true; they are taking advantage of the immigrant's ignorance. In theory, anyone should be able to immigrate to Canada without using a consultant or someone paid to help them. Some people feel reassured. The department probably has some work to do in order to simplify the process and make people feel comfortable navigating the immigration system by themselves. </div>
</p><a name="Para2077623" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In general, I tell people that they do not need to spend a fortune on immigration consultants and that they can apply on their own. I often tell them that if they have legal problems or a special legal situation they can see a lawyer or notary, who will be more qualified to help them with the process.</div>
</p><a name="Para2077624" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, lack of knowledge is the first factor. Another factor is often the political culture. Some people come from countries where corruption is common and where many things happen through nepotism or shady deals. Something like that seems to happen here sometimes, even in this Parliament.</div>
</p><A NAME="T1515"></A><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1515"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1520"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1510"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1515">(1515)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para2077625" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally speaking, I am sure everyone would agree that we have far fewer problems here than in certain other countries, where that is the norm and that is how things are done, and where one must know a politician to make things happen.</div>
</p><a name="Para2077626" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people therefore believe that someone from the political sphere needs to intervene directly in order to move their file along. So consultants claim, either truthfully or more often falsely, that they know the right people to help someone get his or her visa and become a permanent resident. Once again, that is obviously absurd, since there is no need to know any one particular person to immigrate to Canada. One must simply meet all of the criteria and make the application. Although the system is not perfect, generally speaking, no matter who examines the application, the decision should always be the same.</div>
</p><a name="Para2077627" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the lack of knowledge about Canada's legal reality and the political perceptions that they may bring from their home country to a destination country, there is a third factor, namely, the bonds of trust that certain consultants abuse when dealing with people of the same ethnic origin. Some consultants will use the fact that they went through the immigration process themselves and will tell their clients that they can do the same thing for them, because they are of the same ethnicity, come from the same country and are now successful immigrants. People will blindly trust such individuals, and that is clearly abusive. We looked at this issue in the Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration, because we were told that this is a very common problem. We are therefore very concerned about this issue.</div>
</p><a name="Para2077628" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The committee did a comprehensive review and prepared a report with a number of recommendations. The first recommendation made by the committee—not the last or second last—was that in the committee's opinion, consultants working in Quebec who make applications in Quebec should be officially recognized under Quebec laws. Canadian laws should therefore take into account this reality and ensure that a transfer is made to Quebec with regard to regulating the profession, in order to address the specificity of Quebec in terms of its immigration powers under the Canada-Quebec agreement, and because of its specific professional system. Furthermore, Quebec is its own nation with its own particularities and it is important that Quebec has control over this type of tool and the way immigration consultants are governed.</div>
</p><a name="Para2077629" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This recommendation exists. I hope that the parties that supported it will continue to defend this same position and defend Quebec's right to govern its immigration consultants. What is more, the Government of Quebec subsequently developed supplementary rules to take these characteristics into account because the need truly exists. Immigration consultants in Quebec need to speak French and must pass an exam on aspects of the immigration process that are specific to Quebec, such as the Quebec selection certificate. They will have to know related standards and how to assess and evaluate individuals in Quebec. It is quite different from the system used in Canada.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Quebec government put these regulations in place, it referred to the Canadian Society of Immigration Consultants, which already exists.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The abject failure of the Canadian Society of Immigration Consultants proves that the federal government does not have the competence to do this because it does not have the necessary expertise. In Quebec, the Office des professions du Québec oversees all professional groups. The regulations are a hundred or so pages long. The laws are substantial and provide real powers to investigate, intervene and sanction. The federal government does not have that. It would have to start from scratch and come up with all-new legislation for something that Quebec is already equipped to deal with. Personally, I do not think that is an efficient way of doing things at all. </div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Québécois is concerned about the transfer of information proposed in the bill.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For all these reasons, the Bloc Québécois will be supporting this bill—at least at second reading—in order for it to be considered in committee. This is an issue we care about. We agree with the government and the other parties that the Canadian Society of Immigration Consultants is not working.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In closing, I would like to talk about the bill’s title. The government is carrying on its ridiculous tradition of giving bills ludicrous titles. In this particular case, the title is, “The Cracking Down on Crooked Consultants Act”. The title in English is even more ridiculous. That has to stop. They will tell me that what I am saying is of scant importance and that it has no bearing on anything, but as parliamentarians, we pass laws that should be objective and not subjective.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To answer the question, honestly, I do not think the committee or any other body has ever taken a close look at the degree of competence of consultants based on what province they come from. What we have noted in Quebec, in terms of numbers, is that there are far fewer immigration consultants, at least those who are officially registered with the association. Does that mean the phenomenon is more marginal? We do not know. Does it mean fewer consultants register because they do not identify with the association?</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some members came to see us, saying that they had difficulty taking the tests and communicating in French. One thing may explain the other; it is difficult to say. There is no doubt, however, that Quebec, with its civil code, has a different legal reality than Canada, with its common law. With the Canada-Quebec agreement on immigration, Quebec's immigration framework is quite different, so people need to have training that is specific to Quebec, and not Canada, in order to practice in Quebec.</div>

For far too long, we have been soft on those who prey on the most vulnerable, prey on those who have dreams to make Canada their home. The media is littered with stories of potential immigrants who pay some consultants thousands of dollars, sometimes tens of thousands of dollars, and are taught to lie and end up having their applications destroyed because they were given poor advice. The New Democratic Party of Canada has been pushing for tough and effective legislation to crack down on these unscrupulous and crooked consultants.</div>
</p><a name="Para2077677" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many years ago, in the early eighties, I was an assistant to a former member of Parliament, at that time the NDP critic for immigration, Mr. Dan Heap. During my time with him at the constituency office, I saw a wall of potential immigrants being cheated out of thousands of dollars and having their dreams of being able to stay in Canada destroyed.</div>
</p><a name="Para2077678" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Working at that time with the <i>Globe and Mail</i>, I had my mother carry a concealed tape recorder to look at some of these unscrupulous consultants. This was in the early 1980s. Subsequently, there were a series of articles in the <i>Globe and Mail </i> that documented many cases where she was given the wrong advice or overcharged. Back then, we were hoping that something would be done.</div>
</p><a name="Para2077679" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, even in the 1990s, nothing much was done and matters became worse and worse until 2002, when the House of Commons immigration and citizenship committee conducted a study, and then in 2004, when the former Liberal government enacted legislation and set up an organization. Unfortunately, the advice from the immigration department and the community was ignored and the organization had no power to regulate. The agency that was charged with protecting the vulnerable newcomers did not improve the situation. In fact it got worse. The Liberal government just never got the job done.</div>
</p><a name="Para2077680" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill before us today, Bill <a class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',4588746,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=4588746&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-35</a>, is a step in the right direction. Consultants must be licensed in order to charge fees or act on a person's behalf. The Canadian Border Agency must be given resources to enforce this law. We could have the best law, but if there is no enforcement, it would not be worth the paper it is written on. Immigration officers must be trained to detect fraud. They must be trained so that sufficient information is given to applicants and there is no need to hire an expensive consultant or a lawyer for straightforward immigration applications.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the immigration committee, we have studied this issue for many months and we have issued two reports. During our travels, we have heard that the existing organization, the Canadian Society of Immigration Consultants, has a lot of shortcomings. The membership fees are too high and membership examinations are prepared and marked in a questionable way. We also heard that CSIC has failed to develop an industry plan. We heard that their decision-making lacks transparency and is not conducted democratically. We heard that the CSIC board of directors is not accountable to anyone. This is the board body that was established in 2004. There is no possibility for CSIC members to call a special meeting of the society. Compensation for CSIC board members, like their spending, is extravagant, ill-advised, and unaccounted for. CSIC board members are in a conflict of interest, because they created and currently serve on the board of the Canadian Migration Institute, a related for-profit corporation. </div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We heard that many members had little choice but to pay $800 to buy an outdated educational video in order to obtain sufficient continuing professional development points to maintain a CSIC membership; that the ability of members to voice concerns about CSIC has been limited since the CSIC rules of professional conduct were amended, making it a professional offence to “undermine” CSIC and compelling members to treat CSIC with "dignity and respect”; and finally, that the CSIC website is set up so that members cannot communicate with one another by sending bulk email messages.</div>
</p><a name="Para2077683" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are allegations, complaints that we have heard. The committee, after this long study, decided to take action. We issued a report recommending that we find some ways to protect the most vulnerable; that we establish a new corporation with the power to license its members, examine their conduct, and resolve complaints; and that the Government of Canada remain involved in its affairs until it is fully functioning.</div>
</p><a name="Para2077684" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also recommended that a regulator establish no-cost complaint procedures to support immigrants with precarious Canadian status in lodging complaints. That is important, because some of those who are the most vulnerable feel that if they complain, they will get deported, which means that their case would not be examined by the immigration department. We have to establish complaints procedures for these immigrants. Part of the recommendation said that we have to inform immigrants that their complaints to the regulator will have no negative impact upon their immigration applications.</div>
</p><a name="Para2077685" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, we recommended coordinated investigations and enforcement of the law. We wanted a lead agency to be named to coordinate investigation, communication, and enforcement efforts within four months after the 2008 report. It is unfortunate that this never quite happened, but I sure hope that if this bill passes a lead agency will be named as quickly as possible to make sure that the law approved in Parliament is enforced properly. If not, it would be a real mistake.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In November of last year, I moved a concurrence motion on these recommendations. The House of Commons supported these recommendations and supported the concurrence motion, so the intention of this House is clear. We want new regulations, new legislation to protect the most vulnerable. We want clear enforcement guidelines. We also want to make sure that education will continue so that potential immigrants, even if they are overseas, will understand their rights and know how to go about filing a complaint.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new regulations would provide the minister with the power to designate a new body to govern immigration consultants, and we need to make sure that this body is picked in a way that is transparent, and that this body is legitimate, democratically run, and willing to go after those who are violating the law.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We note that under their rules of conduct, a consultant must never “knowingly assist in or encourage any dishonesty, provision of misleading information, fraud, crime or illegal conduct”. Yet through the <i>Toronto Star </i>series, we have noticed that a number of CSIC members allegedly gave wrong information and told people how make up a story to get into the refugee claimant process, even though they had no such refugee experience. They end up giving the entire immigration system and refugee claimants a bad name.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One day I hope immigration regulations can be clarified and simplified in a way so potential immigrants do not feel they need to hire someone to submit applications for them. I also hope the laws will be applied in a way that immigrants do not feel is arbitrary. They should be transparent so immigrants know where their applications are. Also the whole process should be on the Internet so applicants can tell how far along their applications are, how much longer they have to wait, what their application numbers are and whether they have submitted all the right documents.</div>
</p><a name="Para2077692" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note the minister has just returned from Australia, which has that kind of processing. Because it is e-filed, immigrants can tell whether all the documents are done in a way that is appropriate. This kind of processing would be transparent and immigrants would not need to hire a consultant, a lawyer, or even come to a member of Parliament to get a status update of their applications.</div>
</p><a name="Para2077693" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also one day I hope visitor visas or refugee claims are done in a way that is clear. Then migrants or potential visitors who want to come to Canada will not feel they need to hire consultants. After all, we are supposed to serve those who want to come to Canada.</div>
</p><a name="Para2077694" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why is this important? It is critically important because we know some of these immigrants have a choice to go to other countries and we want the brightest and the best to come to Canada. If they keep hearing all these horror stories of relatives, neighbours or friends who have been ripped off by the most unscrupulous consultants, they will not have confidence in Canada's immigration system.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also note that Australia's website shows almost every month which immigration consultants have been de-listed, for what reason and which new consultants have been listed. Those kinds of lists on the Internet are kept up-to-date so any time people want to hire a consultant, they will know clearly who is qualified and who is not. I certainly hope this would be the kind of system we would go toward.</div>
</p><a name="Para2077696" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last, it is critically important that through the Canada Border Services Agency there would be some kind of investigation of the type of fraud now being committed by some of these consultants. Those who are victimized will then feel they have a chance to speak out. If the investigation of their claims proves their case was completely messed up because of bad advice by unscrupulous consultants, their claims should be re-evaluated. </div>

In some cases they may give advice that would determine the course of action immigrants would take on whether they would move for one type of visa or the other.

A lot of immigrant service organizations, non-profit ones, will continue to give that kind of advice as long as a fee is not charged. It is illegal to charge a fee if not licensed. MP's offices will not charge a fee. If no fee is charged, then it is totally legal to provide advice, and that includes relatives, MPs' offices, or any immigrant serving agency.

I hope that the global approach will not mean that there will not be a possibility for us to intervene when we think the decision taken is the wrong decision. However, he is working on a global approach and I hope that global approach will make it simple and accessible for those prospective immigrants so that they do not feel the need to go to an immigration consultant, and that they, and here I am in agreement with the MP from the NDP, are not taken advantage of as is the case sometimes.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member asked how we can monitor consultants who operate abroad. If a person is representing an applicant for a visa or immigration to Canada anywhere in the world and he or she represents that person to Citizenship and Immigration Canada, it does not matter whether the person is in Canada or India, we will not deal with the person unless he or she is a registered member in good standing of the designated regulatory body.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do we monitor these consultants? We identify whether they are registered by going to the CSIC website and seeing if they are a member in good standing. What typically happens is that the larger consultancies in Canada, the more legitimate ones, will establish offices in our major immigration source countries and have them register and become members of the regulatory body. The problem is that most of the consulting and representational work done abroad is done by ghost consultants.</div>
</p><a name="Para2077763" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legislative changes here will clarify that acting as a ghost consultant is illegal for Canadian legal purposes. However, the real problem is that most of the really nasty stuff is the production of counterfeit documents and the like where people will never report. They will continue to operate as ghost consultants abroad, which is why we need the co-operation of governments abroad in bringing in legal frameworks and focusing more enforcement resources on this area of exploitation of their own citizens.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member asked how we will follow up with these countries. There are 180 source countries for immigration to Canada and we cannot realistically expect all of them to have a seamless legal system for the regulation of immigration consultants. I am focusing on, by far, the three largest source countries where we tend to see fairly high levels of fraud, which are China, India and the Philippines. </div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had very productive meetings. My officials are now bringing together some of the dossiers on the worst offenders in the industry. For example, we are aware of one guy in India who took at least a quarter of a million dollars from students in one scam alone, producing clearly counterfeit banking documents that he submitted, probably knowing full well that CIC would reject the applications, but he had the cash in hand. We will take that information, put a bow on it, take it to the state police in Punjab and say that we want the guy prosecuted. I got an agreement from the chief minister in Punjab that the police will follow through with enforcement on cases like that. So we are making progress finally.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do we stop the proliferation of counterfeit documents? It is the same kind of thing. We just need to work with those local governments. I can give the member one case. Our officials In Delhi and in Mumbai brought the local police clear evidence of the counterfeit of Canadian visas that were being sold, if I am not mistaken, for $10,000 a piece. The Indian police arrested the perpetrators and they are now facing criminal charges. Therefore, by proactively co-operating with local police services we can actually deal with the problem. </div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the government announced these measures, it also announced some non-legislative measures. We have heard from the minister again about those.

This is a very important aspect of it and I hope the government puts the appropriate resources toward ensuring co-operation between regulatory bodies and various police agencies to ensure that this kind of crackdown can occur and can occur both here in Canada and in countries where consultants are being hired.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be great if in some way we could cut down on the need for this industry, and there are a number of ways we could do that. One of them is by ensuring that we do not have the huge backlog in immigration applications that we currently face. One of the reasons we drive people to talk to a consultant is the fact that their applications take so long. When people see an application sitting for years with no action on it they begin to wonder if they have not done something wrong and begin to think they need assistance through this process. It drives them into the hands of immigration consultants, and often into the hands of an unscrupulous immigration consultant. If we were really serious about ensuring the effectiveness of our system, we would work to get rid of that backlog and to make sure that the system functioned smoothly and effectively.</div>
</p><a name="Para2077794" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should also simplify the forms. We drive people to a consultant when we make the form difficult, when it is hard for them to understand. Maybe we need to make forms that are more appropriate in different cultural contexts and have different forms in different contexts that get us the same information, but we need to make sure that people find it easy to make the application and provide the information that is required. That is something we could do that would reduce their reliance on a third party to assist them.</div>
</p><a name="Para2077795" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another route we could go to ensure that people feel that they have an alternative is visitor visa appeals. Often people apply to have a friend or relative visit them here in Canada and that is turned down with very little explanation. If there were an appeal system in place, people would feel less of a need to approach a third party to help them with that application for fear that they may have done something wrong, that they are missing something in the process, that there is information they should have to ensure a successful application. If they felt as well that there was recourse should they not have a successful application, it would also reduce the number of people who feel that it is absolutely necessary to engage a third party in dealing with their failed application or with an application that they perceive to be more difficult. So there are a number of things we should also be doing, as well as this legislation, and I hope some of those get the attention, and continued attention, in some cases, of the government.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration looked at the whole question of immigration consultants and studied the situation of the Canadian Society of Immigration Consultants it noticed a number of issues that needed to be addressed about the operation of CSIC, about that body that currently attempts to have some role in the regulation of immigration consultants in Canada. There was a long list of observations the committee made about the functioning of that and we have heard this afternoon in this debate some of those issues that were observed. It noticed that CSIC membership fees were too high and that it was prohibitive and was interfering in the effectiveness of the organization. It said that CSIC membership examinations were prepared and marked in a questionable way, so that there were questions raised about the viability of the examination process. It said that CSIC failed to develop an industry plan, something that is crucial especially in this new and developing industry, this expanding industry where so many people's hopes about their future are caught up and can easily be manipulated by unscrupulous people.</div>
</p><a name="Para2077798" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration also noticed that CSIC decision-making lacked transparency and was not conducted democratically. So internal functioning of the organization was a concern, as well as the fact that the CSIC board of directors was not accountable to anyone. It noted that there was no possibility for CSIC members to call a special meeting of the society. It said that compensation for and the spending of CSIC board members was extravagant, ill-advised and unaccounted for. It pointed out that CSIC board members are in conflict of interest because they created and currently serve on the board of the Canadian Migration Institute, a related for-profit corporation. So there were many concerns raised about the governance of the current organization, CSIC. </div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The standing committee also noted that many members of CSIC had little choice but to pay $800 each to buy an outdated educational video in order to obtain sufficient continuing professional development points to maintain their CSIC membership. Even the upgrading of skills, the ongoing professional development of the organization and how it provided that, was a concern.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It noted that CSIC does not communicate with members or provide services to members equally in French and English, which is a very serious problem for any national organization seeking to regulate an industry dealing with immigration in Canada.</div>
</p><a name="Para2077801" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ability of members to voice concerns about CSIC was limited since the CSIC rules of professional conduct were amended to make it a professional offence to undermine CSIC and compelling members to treat CSIC with dignity and respect. Even trying to deal with problems within the organization became a problem in itself, and the ability of members to raise concerns was limited by the operation of the organization.</div>
</p><a name="Para2077802" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration finally noted that the CSIC website was set up in such a way that members could not send bulk email messages to all other members. The inability of CSIC members to correspond with other members of their profession was limited by the organization itself.</div>
</p><a name="Para2077803" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly there are serious problems with the existing organization. I think many people will be relieved that the government is now seeking to establish a different organization and the minister has put out a request for proposals to deal with the establishment of a new regulatory organization, because there are very serious issues that need to be addressed in how such an organization would operate to best serve Canadians who are engaged with the immigration process.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of my constituents had a spouse who was a refugee claimant in Canada. The immigration consultant first charged her around $5,000 to put in a humanitarian and compassionate application and an extension application. When those applications failed, the consultant advised the spouse to fly back to the country of origin and return to Canada by air without actually having an authorization to return, which can take up to a year in any case. Since the person was advised to do this, he tried it and he was deported again from the airport, complicating his case in a very serious way. When the sponsor tried to contact the immigration consultant again, the consultant retracted his original advice, saying he had never advised that. So the situation this family ended up in is a very serious one. Once someone is deported, it is a very serious matter and something that was completely unnecessary. It is very expensive to get this kind of bad advice. </div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The applicants' medicals were expiring in three weeks and the embassy asked the consultant if they wanted medicals redone or if it should issue a three-week validity visa in the hope that the people could reach Canada within that time. Because there was a delay by a relative of the couple in making a payment to the consultant, the consultant told the embassy to issue three-week visas, which expired by the time they reached the applicants. This meant that the applicants had to start the application process over completely from the beginning. It was incredibly frustrating for that family who had gone through a rather lengthy immigration process, successfully as it turns out, only to have it messed up at the end by an immigration consultant who was less than helpful to them when push came to shove, when they really needed assistance from someone who they anticipated knew the Canadian immigration system, had some professional ethics and professional standards, was well trained and could assist them appropriately in this process, a process that is so crucial to so many families and to our communities and our society.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a lot that we could be doing, and I am pleased that we are debating this bill today. I am glad that it is going to go to committee where witnesses can be called and where further discussion can be had about it. It is absolutely crucial that we get our act together on this. The situation with immigration consultant regulation in Canada has gone on too long and it has caused too many problems for too many people.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I agree with him. Our ministry has taken some really significant steps in that direction. To give the member an example, three years ago it was taking five to six years to process applications for the federal skilled worker program, our core economic stream of immigration. Five or six years was completely ridiculous.</div>
</p><a name="Para2077821" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of our action plan for faster immigration, over the past two years we have been processing new applications we receive in that program within several months. We have gone from several years to several months. Six to 12 months is the range, but in most missions it is happening in about seven or eight months. That is great news. The credit goes to our officials as well as to the additional resources voted by this Parliament.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the provincial nominee program has grown substantially. He will know that in British Columbia it may have outstripped the federal skilled worker program as a source of permanent-resident economic immigrants. It operates on a priority processing basis. Usually those applications are processed in a matter of a few months.</div>

I know that the circumstances of those cases are often the most difficult cases my staff deal with. I have great staff in terms of caseworkers who work on these issues for me. Ayesha Haider, Caren Yu, and sometimes Jane Ireland do this important work for me. They sit with people who are trying to figure out the immigration process.

It would be really nice if our system could function so that people could make those applications directly, using their own skills and abilities.

It is about the realization of an ambition and a dream that individuals and their families have for fashioning a future not just for themselves but in co-operation with and in collaboration with a collective in another place, a place that they will turn into their home.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me that a former minister, the Hon. Elinor Caplan, used to be criticized a lot by her own caucus colleagues when we were on that side of the House some 12 years ago. She talked about this precise matter. She said, “We have to stop those snakeheads, those human smugglers from abusing people abroad and from abusing relatives of those people here in Canada. I am going to travel abroad. I am going to go to Beijing”. That was becoming a big source area for many of our immigrants. She said, “I am going to go to other places, like India and the Philippines, because that is where most of the people are coming from. I am going to see if I can get the co-operation of those governments in order to pursue those who are so unscrupulous that they would take advantage of their people”.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keep in mind this is about taking advantage of people who would become part of Canada but who are not yet a part of Canada.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I noted that the minister agreed with that, in essence, in response to a question from my colleague from <a class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',128263,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" href="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=128263&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Laval—Les Îles</a>. He said that we have to co-operate with foreign authorities in order to pursue and prosecute those who take undue advantage of others, even if it appears to be more acceptable in other places than it does here, because, of course, we have the rule of law. It is one of the values that draws people to this place. In other places that particular value is less ingrained and so people work within different parameters.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We say we are going to get rid of unscrupulous consultants. Some of my predecessors and some of the current minister's predecessors tried the same thing. One of the measures undertaken at the time was to provide educational material to those who would have become consultants, in other words, have them work with the department and the legal societies in order to come up with a body of expertise that would be acceptable to our functionaries abroad and in Canada.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We even went so far as to give them their own regulatory authority. Do you know what that means, Mr. Speaker? I know you relish this sort of thing. What happens is governments say that they have to put together an organization, but people are mature enough, educated enough and responsible enough to make the decisions to make that organization function properly, in other words, for their members but also for the people that they would serve. </div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do we say that? We say that because there is a basic principle of law in all western societies that is called <i>caveat emptor</i>, buyer beware. But we try to make sure that all the vendors adhere to a particular policy, a particular set of standards that make us proud but reinforce as well all of the values that we build as a society as we invite more and more people, like Stefano's grandparents, to come to this country and to build it.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The law societies, of course, were not completely sure that they wanted to have the consultants in place. However, there is a fine line between accepting the criticism as valid from one group against the other. It must be recognized there is a competitive spirit between the two of them. What they need to do is look at that market. I think last year some 230,000 people were given their permanent residency to this country and there were tens of thousands more who had to go to those people for the expertise to develop their applications for other types of visas. One can understand there is a commercial issue here. </div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, there are immigration lawyers, some more competent than others, and what is the recourse for satisfaction? That was the question that everyone wanted to have addressed by my predecessors. So many of the consultants at the time were actually lawyers. In fact, the first president of the immigration consulting group was a lawyer. As I said earlier on, the very first thing is <i>caveat emptor</i>.

As I said, what happened at the time was that my predecessors, in their wisdom, put together an educational system in place for licensing that satisfied what committees in the House were telling them needed to be done and what stakeholders in the community wanted to have done. But I go back to the point that was most important. It was not that the process required the greatest urgency. The process represented what the substance; that is, what immigration was supposed to do for people. Was it going to lead out an opportunity for hope, for improvement for those who would immigrate, and was it going to provide an increased enhancement of a Canadian experience for those of us who were already here? </div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems clear to me that this bill should be passed quickly. It should have been passed in 2005. There is one restriction that we should examine, and that is the opinion of the Barreau du Québec, which has already written to the Senate, although the Senate did not feel the need to consider this opinion.</div>
</p><a name="Para2077971" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barreau du Québec pointed out that the French version of the bill uses the term “attentat suicide”, while the English version uses the term “suicide bombing”. There is a difference. Generally, when legislation has different effects on the guilt of someone accused of a crime, jurisprudence dictates that the less serious provision applies, the provision that would have fewer consequences for the accused.</div>
</p><a name="Para2077972" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should perhaps look into this. I will admit that “attentat suicide” and “suicide bombing” can have different meanings, but I would not be able to say which one is less serious. I think that really depends on the circumstances. It would be a good thing if the committee could study this issue that the Senate seemed to want to avoid.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All members of my party, the Bloc Québécois, will vote in favour of this bill. This is one of many bills that we have supported for a long time, but for various reasons, the government has seen fit not to introduce them, and has then accused the opposition of delaying passage of its bills.</div>
</p><a name="Para2077974" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That tactic is well known to those on the other side of the House. The Conservatives' main concern when introducing Criminal Code amendments is not whether the amendments can have a positive impact on legislation as a whole, but whether the party can benefit politically by passing itself off as the only party that is tough on crime and wants to do something about it.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We often hear Conservative ministers say that while they are in favour of punishing criminals, the opposition is defending criminals' interests. That is not even an exaggeration; it is simply not true. They need to understand that in a democracy there are people who stand up for individual rights and who feel it is important to follow correct procedures in criminal law. It is not about defending the rights of the accused or of criminals. Quite the opposite. It is about defending the rights of any citizen who might one day face criminal charges.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at the bill itself. Like many others, I think that if there were suicide bombings in Canada, there would need to be proof that someone helped plan them. If a suicide bombing is successful, then the outcome for the person who committed it is clear. Here we do not convict people post mortem, as was previously the case in other jurisdictions. However, here, the definition is important when it comes to punishing those who prepare or contribute to the plot, who threaten to commit suicide bombing, who are accomplices after the fact and who encourage the perpetration of suicide bombing. These are punishable acts. It has to be clear in the legislation that these offences have to be prosecuted.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an improvement to the legislation. I wonder why, for something so simple that was first presented in 2005, we are discussing this issue here five years later?

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This same government keeps blaming the opposition for holding up the government's legislative agenda and for defending the rights of criminals.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have heard arguments and I want to address those. We have heard that the bill is not necessary in that there are a number of other sections in the Criminal Code that would prohibit suicide bombings and that that should be sufficient. We do not need to address it. I think that is part of the reason that we have not seen legislation in other jurisdictions of similar backgrounds as Canada's.</div>
</p><a name="Para2077982" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, that argument misses an essential point of why we should pass the bill. The use of criminal law is not just for the purposes of creating a crime and providing a penalty for breach if conduct amounts to that crime. Criminal law generally also has a role to play in expressing society's condemnation and denunciation of that particular conduct. That is why the bill is so important that in fact suicide bombing be included in the Criminal Code as a specific offence.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a lawyer who has practised law for a long time and as the justice critic for a number of years, one of the reasons I would like to see the bill go to committee is to see if there are some additional provisions in terms of giving our prosecutors in particular tools that would help them in prosecuting should they be confronted with this kind of criminal conduct. I must say that I am skeptical that in fact that is the case but I would like to hear that at committee.</div>
</p><a name="Para2077984" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other reason I would like this matter to go to committee is that there is an educational value in debating this legislation. Our committee structure within our parliamentary system is certainly one of the ways of doing that.</div>
</p><a name="Para2077985" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part of what might come out at that point would, which I did not see come out in the Senate hearings, is that we need to look at the history of this kind of criminal conduct. It is not new to the 1980s, 1990s and 2000 period. It was quite a common criminal conduct device used by the anarchists, as they were described at that time, starting in the early 1900s right through until the 1930s. In fact, during that period of time we had various pieces of legislation passed in response to that conduct. However, bombings, including suicide bombings, not exclusively but including suicide bombings, were quite common. They were very common in Russia prior to the revolution in 1917. They were fairly common throughout western Europe during that same period of time with democratically elected governments being oftentimes the targets and royal families more commonly being the targets by anarchists.</div>
</p><a name="Para2077986" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were fairly regular in the United States at that time. I am not aware of any in Canada but they were fairly common in the United States, but less so than what we saw in Europe. There was a response by our legislatures at that time. The historical material that I have read suggests that the response was not very effective but that eventually they stopped into the 1930s.</div>
</p><a name="Para2077987" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We now see them coming back. It is interesting because most people think of the suicide bombers in the Middle East, whether it be in Palestine, in Iraq, in some of the Middle Eastern countries. The reality is that they started back in Sri Lanka. The Tamil Tigers and the leader of the Tamil Tigers initiated the use of suicide bombings in the modern era, if I can put it that way. They were used very commonly. Then we saw them spread, particularly into the Middle East, but, again, they are quite common in a number of countries in Asia. However, they have generally been restricted to that area of the world. We can think of some notable exceptions but they have generally been restricted to that area of the world.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part of the reason I support this legislation is that whether it was the anarchist who justified the use of suicide bombings on an ideological philosophical basis as a way of undermining the capitalist societies and the democracies as they saw it at that time or whether it is, as is more common today, being based on religious arguments, we as a legislature must say that whatever the argument is and whatever the fanaticism is that the argument is based on, we condemn that. There is no justification, philosophically, religiously or on any other basis, for this type of criminal conduct. The results have been seen in so many horrendous scenarios with huge losses of life.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that kind of information needs to come out in more detail than I have been able to give today. It is important for us to hear that this legislation will be useful but, more important, we need to understand those people who counsel and advocate suicide bombings. I think that may be one of the advantages that we will get out of this. These people, interestingly, never perform the bombings themselves. Those who do that kind of work are basically cowards. Oftentimes they will find people who are of limited intelligence, have mental health problems or who are so fanatical, whether it be on an ideological basis or a religious basis, that they do not think clearly and can be manipulated into sacrificing themselves.</div>
</p><a name="Para2077990" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can remember being at events where people have talked about this conduct as being a form of martyrdom. We have to condemn that. It is not that. This is purely a criminal act resulting in injury and so often in death. That is the way it has to be portrayed.</div>
</p><a name="Para2077991" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am quite satisfied to support this bill, even though I recognize that it may not in any way increase our ability to fight this kind of conduct in the courts, and I am leaning toward believing that, but in the court of public opinion, it will be the first time a government and a legislature has done this. It will provide leadership, hopefully, for other democratic governments to follow suit. Perhaps there are ways of strengthening this bill.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am quite supportive of the bill going to the justice committee to be dealt with as expeditiously as possible. If there are amendments that will improve it, I am assuming everybody in the House and everybody on that committee would support those amendments and would get it back here quickly to get it passed, have it completed and on our books both for the message that it sends to the perpetrators of these types of crimes and to the rest of the world. This will say that this is leadership, that this is a way of denouncing this type of conduct and that everyone should be looking at doing the same.</div>

The point is worth repeating and it comes from Senator Grafstein in a speech he gave in February 2009. The way the senator articulated in his speech, he said:</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the essence and the substance. Bills have words and those words have to have meanings. It is not simply an amendment to the Criminal Code to make suicide bombing an element in the definition of a terrorist act. The process and the mechanics are one thing, but the objective of the bill is to have us represent our concern and abhorrence to that act. In fact enshrining it in our legislation is to secure its place so that if those matters should ever occur, no matter whether they are within Canada or around the world, others can draw upon the values that have been placed in our society for the protection of the public and the abhorrence of heinous tactics.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I spoke briefly on this bill about a year ago. One of the points I raised, and I made it in good faith, is that the bill has had at least five iterations. It has gone through the Senate five times. It has gone through this House to various extents. It is not being very helpful to the House, I would suggest, to have us continue to go through an extensive process.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A member had suggested previously that when the House has a strong consensus on a matter, it is not necessary to go through the full legislative process. There are tools and mechanisms to deal with this bill. There was an urging, and it is an urging that I made the last time I spoke to this legislation and it is being made again this time, for those who are interested in this bill and the representatives of each party to come together and say that they are comfortable at this point and that they want to accelerate the process. </div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is appropriate when all parties agree. It is not something that has to be done during the debate on the bill.

I would like simply to be on record as supporting the call that this bill not die yet again on prorogation, or dissolution of Parliament and an election, only to have this legislation come up again for a sixth time and go through both Houses. It does not make a lot of sense. Members know it is a distinct possibility; it has happened before and there is some concern about that.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brevity of the bill is a reflection of its accuracy in addressing a particularly critical situation which is relatively new to us but of which we are painfully aware.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not very many years ago suicide bombings were not something we would contemplate or even consider on North American soil, or in any first world democracy. Of course, they are very real and they are ever present as a threat against us.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suicide bombings are a new tactic. They are a very real tactic and a very dangerous one. Not too long ago it would never have been considered that someone would cause self harm in inflicting a criminal activity to endanger or to harm others. In fact, our whole civil society is predicated on a belief of effective policing and effective enforcement, which is centred around the assumption that those who would commit a crime would take whatever steps are necessary not to impose harm upon themselves, just on others. However, suicide bombings have changed the rules on that. Because of the fanaticism which is implied by a suicide bomber, reasonable thought gets thrown out the window.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now we have circumstances in which our safety and security and the very stability of the institutions around us are indeed threatened by this very, very real act that has been imposed and has caused such harm to others. Our objective is to prevent that, to minimize it and to take specific proactive actions to allow our justice system to deal with it in an effective way.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In essence, the bill reflects the growing need by law enforcement agencies and by the justice system to accurately target, label and prosecute what exactly is a suicide bomber. In so doing, by this legal change in terms of definition, inclusion of the term and supplied definitions, it would allow authorities to take certain actions based on statutes that are already in place.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our terrorism provisions are very strong and robust, but they are very specific. This particular legislation allows for certain courses of action to be taken, by labelling, by actually targeting, by describing what this Parliament will not tolerate. We will actually enact legislation, amend legislation, to provide definition and accountability for suicide bombing and those who would perform that act, as has been pointed out by other members, to include in that set of legal mechanisms, provisions to actually stop the propagation through coaching, counselling and other measures. That seems to be a worthwhile activity for this Parliament to pursue.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot begin to describe how victims of this horrendous tactic feel about this.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the crafters of this legislation from the other place did their job and did it well. The bill itself is extremely brief, but its brevity reflects its accuracy in dealing with the issue at hand. I think we can take full charge of the fact that as we debate this it would be very helpful to continue the debate around it. However, we have to be resolved in the notion that by defining this horrendous, almost insatiable, act of terror, we help to defeat it. By describing it within the confines of the Criminal Code, we do not allow any language to be used that glorifies it, that allows it to be portrayed in any other manner. It is a criminal act. That is an important step forward in providing some definition and context to this act. </div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support this legislation because it does, indeed, empower law enforcement agencies and our judicial system to deal with it effectively. Where it was not dealt with before because it was a vague issue which we had not encountered in many respects very often, the threat is ever present around us. It behooves us to deal with it and there have been pleas for us to deal with it in that kind of proactive fashion.

It allows our discussions in this House to be very focused and concentrated on the issue at hand.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is worth mentioning just some of the many organizations that have come out and said that the registry is essential: the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police, which has more than 430 chiefs of police across the country and of them only three chiefs oppose the registry; the Canadian Police Association, which represents police across this country with more than 160 police associations and of those, only six are opposed and many are reconsidering based on the facts that have been presented over the last number of months; the Canadian Association of Police Boards; Fédération des policiers et policières municipaux du Québec; the Canadian Association of Emergency Physicians; the Canadian Association for Adolescent Health; the Canadian Paediatric Society; the Canadian Public Health Association; the Canadian Federation of Nurses Unions; the Alberta Centre for Injury Control and Research; Association Quebecoise pour le prevention du suicide.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These groups have said clearly that the gun registry is needed and they are asking members of Parliament to save it. The reasons are clear. </div>
</p><a name="Para2078033" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was talking to an inspector in Mississauga who told me a story of being called into a domestic violence situation. He knew that approximately nine guns were registered in that home. The situation was broken up and the man was removed. When he returned to the home the police were assured those guns had been removed, that he was not going back to guns. In the minds of that officer, in that situation the registry saved lives. If that individual had gone back into that home and guns had been there, the officer feared death would have ensued, either for the woman or for the man himself.</div>
</p><a name="Para2078034" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In countless other situations, as we travelled across the country we heard individual stories just like that one. We heard of an instance where somebody was suicidal. A family member called in and said the situation had become unstable. The individual called police and said the guns that were in that home needed to be removed. In the minds of the officers we spoke to there was not a doubt that lives were saved by removing those guns from the home and making sure the person did not commit suicide. They would have had no idea of how many weapons were there. Because of the spontaneous nature of crime, because it is in the heat of the moment, because of the fact that suicide often can come out of nowhere, they would have had absolutely no idea that guns were in that home or that something could have been done.</div>
</p><a name="Para2078035" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly in these examples the registry saved lives.</div>
</p><a name="Para2078036" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we were in Halifax, an officer spoke to me about how much the registry did to promote accountability in ownership. Just in the same way when we register our car, it gives us a sense of responsibility for owning that car. If something goes wrong, we know instantly that the police would be able to find out exactly what went wrong and who was responsible. Gun ownership is no different. Registration of guns promotes accountability back to the owner of the guns. </div>
</p><a name="Para2078037" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also heard from officers about when weapons are stolen, taken from a home. The registry makes it easy to return those weapons to the rightful owner. In a criminal investigation it can be very useful to know from where the gun was taken, and what time it was taken. It helps to establish where that individual was and at what time the gun was taken.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also know that, aside from knowing exactly where the weapons are in those situations for crime, it also is a vital tool in solving crime. When we were in Toronto with the women's caucus, we heard from somebody who talked about an inquiry in Collingwood. The inquiry clearly said, if it had not been for the gun registry, they would not have been able to solve that homicide, period. So people can look at this, and I encourage them to look at that inquiry and others. The one in Collingwood could be no more clear that the registry in that example led directly to a conviction.</div>
</p><a name="Para2078039" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is a reality. In the vast majority of crimes, because they are spontaneous in nature, that means that registered weapons do get used and it does give us an opportunity to trace back ownership and help get convictions.</div>
</p><a name="Para2078040" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As well, we know that in situations that are heated, such as in domestic violence, when somebody knows their gun is registered it perhaps gives them pause for thought to know it is going to be a lot harder to get away with a violent act.</div>
</p><a name="Para2078041" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of this, all of this value and so much more, enforcing prohibition orders and others, costs us about $4 million a year, the RCMP says. So, to delete all of that, it would cost about $4 million a year. To put that in context, a complex murder investigation undertaken by the police costs $2 million. If we want to consider some of the spending the current government has undertaken, the fake lake and accessories cost $2 million. So $4 million dollars for that? Come on.</div>
</p><a name="Para2078042" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We hear the government say about prison spending, the $10 billion or more, that there is no price too high for public safety. Yet apparently when it comes to protecting women and dealing with things that prevent suicide and something that helps get convictions, $4 million is just too high a price.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had the opportunity to sit through committee with other members and listen to the families of victims from École Polytechnique. It was painful to watch as they came and fought this battle yet again. They thought they had won. They thought they had gotten through this.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, if there is a silver lining in this debate, I hope, and in fact polls showing increasing support for the registry actually illustrate, that this is a chance once and for all to explain to Canadians why we need the registry, a chance once and for all to put this debate to rest so we can say to the families who suffer because of what happened at École Polytechnique, “Not again; you are not going to be dragged through this a third time”. This debate will be done, here, now. All these national associations that have stood up and said this registry saves lives, all the facts and information that have come out of the RCMP internal report and from others, will end this debate. </div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a number of reasons that I believe this motion needs to be defeated. The primary reason I am going to begin with is the need for my bill and this issue to come before members of Parliament, who represent Canadians.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an issue that Canadians have been watching for the last 15 years and we know that even over the last several months and weeks Canadians have been, on both sides of this issue, looking to see what the arguments are for registry and against registry.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What this motion does is actually stop debate on the long gun registry.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have been travelling around the ridings throughout northwestern Ontario, throughout the Yukon, and throughout Canada, and as I listened to testimony at the standing committee, there are a number of myths that have been perpetuated in regard to the long gun registry. Those myths thankfully are being dispelled and have been dispelled through testimony we heard.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the first myths is that police officers check the long gun registry 11,000 times a day. There are the facts, but sometimes the facts do not actually tell the truth of the story. The fact is that the registry, the entire Canadian firearms database, is checked probably between 8,000 and 11,000 times a day, but that does not constitute police officers purposely going in to directly check the long gun registry.</div>
</p><a name="Para2078061" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What that means is that police database systems are set up to automatically check the registry any time they even pull someone over to check a licence plate. If someone is speeding, if a tail light is broken, if they have to pull someone over, across this country what happens when they put in the vehicle licence plate is that it automatically hits the firearms registry.</div>

Then they have to go, knock on people's doors and tell them that they have broken a paper law.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we look at what it would cost to register the 7 million-plus long guns that are still out there, I am worried that if it cost $2 billion to register 6.5 million long guns, what is it going to cost to register another 7 million long guns?</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back 15 years ago we heard that the long gun registry would only cost $2 million, and it cost $2 billion. Now we are hearing only $4 million. Does that mean it might cost $4 billion to actually carry it out and make it accurate?

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other myth is that the long gun registry protects women and it stops domestic violence and suicide. That is one of the most misleading and inaccurate statements that has been used in this argument. Emergency doctors are dealing with suicide and they are dealing with people who are coming to the hospitals wounded, sometimes by accident.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where we can actually have an impact to ensure that people who should not have guns do not get guns is in the licensing process. That is where they are screened and are stopped from getting a gun. They go through a background check.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an important process and we need to ensure it is strong, but once people have a gun, spending between $106 million and $2 billion to count their guns does nothing to stop violence.

I asked her where that statistic came from, and she told me that it came from a report by the great professor, Gary Mauser. This gun-toting gentleman is the Conservatives' expert.</div>

I showed this photo because the discussion revolved around it. He answered yes. I asked what kind of gun it was, and he said that it was a Smith &amp; Wesson revolver. I asked whether it was registered, and he replied that it was, of course. I asked him how many weapons he owned, and he said that he was not sure, that it varied.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I repeated that he did not remember how many weapons he owned and asked if he had any long guns. He said that he was not sure; it varied. I repeated that he did not remember. He said that he was getting old. Fortunately we have a firearms registry for those who are getting old and who have forgotten how many guns they have in their home. I mentioned this only to show the absurdity.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another thing I found extremely striking was when Mr. Cheliak, the former director of the Canadian Firearms Program, appeared before the committee. I say former director because unfortunately, he has been sent to complete other tasks, namely to learn French. After nearly a year, people suddenly realize this man is not fully bilingual and he is removed, in a matter of speaking, a few weeks before the major debate we are having here.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What he said that was so disturbing is that in 2009 alone, 7,000 registration certificates were revoked for public safety reasons. I asked him whether the certificates were for handguns. He told me that registration certificates for 7,000 long guns were revoked for public safety problems. This might come from judges, spousal violence complaints, or simply a school reporting a slightly disturbed young person in order to have the police check whether the parents own a firearm. This can save lives.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to talk about something that came to light on September 15, 2010. Heather Imming said that the gun registry saved her life. The registry helped in removing guns belonging to her violent ex-husband. She survived a final savage beating. She truly felt that the only reason she was at the conference was because the registry made it possible to remove the guns belonging to her ex-husband.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Mr. Vallee, author of <i>Life with Billy</i>, he said that according to research, a gun in a house increases the risk of women being killed.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is quite obvious to most of us now that, in fact, this motion is going to be successful tomorrow.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is certainly a valid debate, from a democracy standpoint, as to whether we should be dealing with this issue as a procedural motion or whether we should be dealing with the merits of the bill.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had nowhere near enough time to deal with this issue because of the constraints the private member's bill procedure imposed on us. We had eight days of hearings, two hours each time. We had from the opposition parties something like 275 to 300 witnesses, either groups or individuals, who wanted to testify, and we were able to hear about 30 to 35 of them in total. We have not had anywhere near the information or education that would have come out had we had a government bill to deal with fully over a much more extended period of time.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other reason we are going to see it killed tomorrow is the way the government has conducted itself. For example, it hid until the last minute reports that showed the viability and validity of the long gun registry. There was the dismissal of Chief Superintendent Cheliak, who did a great deal to improve the usefulness of the long gun registry while he was superintendent and was responsible specifically for the administration of the Firearms Act.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have repeatedly heard attacks on our police chiefs and police forces by members of the Conservative Party. At times they were almost saying that they were liars because they stood up and said that this is a viable investigative tool for them and that they use it. They use it extensively, and they use it to protect their members and communities. Because of that, they have been castigated repeatedly by the Conservatives to, I think, their eternal shame.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An interesting thing did come out of those hearings. We saw it sometimes juxtaposed very clearly. On one occasion, the chief of police from Calgary, one of the few chiefs of police in the country who is opposed to continuing the long gun registry, was confronted by the chief of police and the officer in charge of the firearms division of the Toronto police force. The question was put to him: “You don't have anywhere near the investigative tools used by the Toronto police when you take into account the difference in population between those two cities”. Ultimately, Chief Hanson of Calgary had to admit that they basically were not trying to use it.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is where I would be critical of the former Liberal government when it instituted this. There were all sorts of problems with the system.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What happened was that a number of police forces were so jaded about the system, they stopped using it. As we moved into the period from 2005 to 2009 and the system became much more efficient, they did not follow it. One of the shames of losing Superintendent Cheliak was that one of the things he did quite successfully was go across the country to educate individual police forces, one at a time in some cases, about how to use it and how to use it effectively.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After he did that, they responded affirmatively, and the usage of it went up dramatically. The use of it as an investigative tool went up dramatically. It is to the shame of police officers like Chief Hanson that he did not learn that lesson. He was given the opportunity. His force was given the opportunity, and he did not take advantage of it. Yes, there are a lot of “ifs” about the role the police have to play in this, but the reality is that police officers who have used the system and know how to use it know that, in fact, it is a tool they have to have.</div>

This government, since it has been in power, has had the opportunity in a number of ways to improve the system. They have had recommendations from officers within the system to improve the system in a number of ways and to get rid of some of the irritants. The most dramatic one is the one we are proposing. The Liberals support us. We propose to decriminalize the first offence in this regard, to take away the stigma that has been attached to honest gun owners, legal gun owners.

The vast majority of the costs in the present system for licensing, for registering restricted weapons, including handguns, and for registering in the long gun registry, a significant portion of that budget, of the expenditures every year, are on the licensing side. </div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I listen to the member's argument, one of the fears I have is that if the long gun registry goes down, what is going to go down next? Will it be the registration of restricted weapons? Then are we going to move to the U.S. style of minimal licensing? The only way we are going to save any money is to get rid of licensing to any reasonable degree. That is very much the intention of some of the really fanatical gun owners in this country. </div>

If they are right, and those of us who support the registry are wrong, the worst is that we have inconvenienced gun owners, and we have cost Canadians somewhere between 10¢ and 12¢ a day.

Detective Sergeant Grismer was a team leader at the Olympic security force and had the opportunity during the 2010 Olympic and Paralympic Games to speak with police officers from across Canada. His testimony during committee hearings was that the vast majority of officers he spoke with did not support the continuation of the registry. Why? It was because, in his words, they did not trust the information it contains and they see it as a waste of money. Detective Sergeant Grismer added that police across Canada, in his words, cannot and must not place their trust and risk their lives on the inaccurate, unverified information contained in the registry, and that if doing away with the long-gun registry saves even one life of Canada's front line officers, then it is worth it.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chief Rick Hanson of the Calgary Police Service testified at committee hearings that in his opinion the registry only marginally addresses the broader issue of gun crime and violence in Canada. The real need, he said, was for governments to deal with the criminal activity of individuals who possess and use guns in the commission of offences. Our government agrees, which is why we have introduced and passed measures to crack down on crime, violent gun crimes in particular. </div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The committee also heard from Dave Shipman, who served for 25 years with the Winnipeg Police Service and spent nearly 19 of those years investigating violent crimes in the homicide robbery division. He asked the same question that many law-abiding Canadians are asking: How does the gun registry assist the police in preventing gun crime? His answer was that it does not. In fact, he said that it offers nothing to protect our citizenry from being victims of gun crimes perpetrated by well-armed criminals. </div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those were his words, and they are words all of us heard time and time again at committee hearings and words all of us have heard from our law-abiding constituents with regard to the wasteful and ineffective long gun registry. They are also the words all of us have heard from the Auditor General. In the Auditor General's report from both 2002 and 2006, she noted that the Canadian Firearm Centre was unable or unwilling to provide information to substantiate the need for a long-gun registry as a public safety tool. She stated, “The centre does not show how these activities help minimize the risk to public safety with evidence based on outcomes such as reduced deaths, injuries and threats from firearms”. </div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bottom line is that if the long gun registry fails to do what it intends to do, then any amount of money spent on it is a waste. As the Yukon minister of justice wrote, “Canadians would be better served if the funds invested in this program had been spent on increased funding for violence prevention initiatives or more enforcement personnel. Yukon's position is that the registry does not deliver positive results at a realistic cost to taxpayers”.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The government could not agree more. We can and should put those resources to better use in funding programs and initiatives that actually have an impact in targeting gun crimes. Our focus should be on getting tough with gangs and crime guns, not on turning goose hunters into criminals.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must say that I am often saddened and even shocked by what is happening in some of our communities. Blatant acts of violence committed by gun-toting criminals all too often make the headlines. There are many perpetrators and too many victims. We hear of gang members gunning down their rivals on the sidewalks or in parking lots, or even in local parks where children play. Don Morgan, Saskatchewan's justice minister has noted that Saskatchewan is investing in programs to combat gang activities, assist victims of crime, and put more police officers on the street.</div>

It seems like every few weeks there is a new report about some dangerous or faulty product. Many of these products are products for children. In 2010 we saw children's toys, cribs and medications all being subject to safety concerns.</div>
</p><a name="Para2078171" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately Health Canada does not have the tools it needs to ensure the safety of the public. For example, it cannot issue mandatory recalls. In 2009 Health Canada posted more than 300 voluntary recall notices, a third of them for children's products. Lots of these products were not made in Canada, but still the government did not have the power to make the recalls mandatory.</div>
</p><a name="Para2078172" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hazardous Products Act of 1969 has not been effective in identifying or removing dangerous products. This has meant in the majority of cases Canadians have been dependent on the product alerts and recalls issued by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission instead of Health Canada. In 2005 and 2006 more than 40% of product recalls were ordered as a direct result of U.S. initiated action.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Successive Canadian governments, this one included, have been happy to promote and applaud corporate trade over the last few decades but not to police it. This is unacceptable. It is putting people at risk.</div>
</p><a name="Para2078174" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"></a><p xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt">
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need Health Canada to be taking the lead in these instances, identifying and removing dangerous products in a timely fashion. This is why I have asked this several times in the House since becoming health critic for the NDP, just as my colleague Judy Wasylycia-Leis asked before me. When will the government get serious about product safety legislation?</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been asking and asking and finally the government did introduce Bill <a class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',4591264,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=4591264&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-36</a> last spring.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is a summary of what we have gone through. The first attempt was Bill C-51 in 2008. The NDP opposed Bill C-51 because instead of strengthening safety, it was a continuation of the previous Liberal government's interests and permissive attitudes toward big pharma. Fortunately Bill C-51 did not become law, but this was not due to political courage or insight from the government but because of Conservative prorogation after the federal election of 2008.</div>

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right now our legislation supports only a reactive approach. The vast majority of consumer products are unregulated by the Hazardous Products Act.

  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arguably, the most significant gap in our ability to respond to safety issues is the absence of any authority to issue mandatory recalls for consumer products.
