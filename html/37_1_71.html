<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>THE ACT OF INCORPORATION OF THE CONFERENCE OF MENNONITES IN 
CANADA 
</H3><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK3"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reg Alcock (Winnipeg South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
think you would find unanimous consent for the following motion. 
I move, seconded by the member for Provencher: 
<A NAME="LINK4">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That notwithstanding any standing order and the usual practices 
of the House, Bill S-25, an act to amend the Act of incorporation 
of the Conference of Mennonites in Canada, be now called for 
second reading; and 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the House do proceed to dispose of the bill at all stages 
including committee of the whole. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B>  The House has heard the 
terms of the motion.  Is there unanimous consent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(Motion agreed to) 
<A NAME="LINK5">&nbsp;</A>
<P><A NAME="LINK6"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reg Alcock (Winnipeg South, Lib.)</B> moved, seconded by 
the hon. member for Provencher, that Bill S-25, an act to amend 
the act of incorporation of the Conference of Mennonites in 
Canada, be read the second time and, by unanimous consent, 
referred to committee of the whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, this is very straightforward business for 
the House.  The act is being brought forward at the request of 
the Mennonite Conference of Canada.  The church has undertaken 
some work over the last few years on its articles of 
incorporation which were originally passed by this House in 1947. 
It wishes to change the name from the Mennonite Conference of 
Canada to the Mennonite Church of Canada.  As well, there are 
some other organizational and operational changes contained 
within the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill was introduced in the Senate at the request of the 
church, and I am now introducing it on the floor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate the support and assistance that has been offered by 
all parties.  As everyone here knows, the Mennonites have 
contributed enormously to the quality of life in Canada.  They do 
tremendous work not just in Canada but around the world.  It is a 
great honour for me to be part of the process of assisting them 
in this renewal. 
<P><A NAME="LINK7"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Vic Toews (Provencher, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the bill coming forward and I appreciate 
the opportunity to speak very briefly to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Mennonite community in Manitoba, of which I am a part, has a 
long history and a proud and distinguished place in the 
religious, educational, cultural and business life of my 
province.  Their contribution to the industrial development of 
Manitoba has been outstanding and continues to grow.  Their 
commitment to fundamental values is a positive force at home, 
across Canada and around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Mennonite community is an outstanding example of how 
immigrants bring their distinct qualities, character and beliefs 
to the building of our nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although this bill is routine in character, I think 
it is always timely to note the contributions of the Mennonites 
who first immigrated to Canada in a number of immigration waves. 
My own people, both on my father and my mother's side, came to 
Canada in the 1920s, escaping famine and Lenin's brutal communism 
in the Soviet Union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Mennonite Church and its agencies, specifically the 
Mennonite central committee, were instrumental in bringing my 
family to Canada.  I thank the government member for his 
sponsorship of the bill and for his kind words. It is my pleasure 
to support the bill. 
<P><A NAME="LINK8"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I too would like to take this opportunity to put a few 
comments on record pursuant to Bill S-25. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the member for Winnipeg South for sponsoring the 
legislation which, as he indicated, is routine by nature and 
reflects the will and interests of the Mennonite community to 
change its incorporation from the Conference of Mennonites in 
Canada to the Mennonite Church of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an opportunity and a time for us to reflect on the 
contribution of Mennonites to this country and the work of that 
community internationally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we often overlook the kinds of inroads that have been 
made by newcomers to this country and the very important 
contribution they have made to building this country.

<A HREF="#LINKT1"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member for Winnipeg South indicated, the Mennonite 
community of Canada has played a very important role in 
developing this country and in ensuring Canada's responsibility 
is met with respect to international concerns and disastrous 
situations facing people around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to personally reflect for a moment since my roots with 
the Mennonite community run deep.  I was raised in a Mennonite 
community in the Waterloo county area of Ontario.  I went to 
school with old order Mennonites where we had many opportunities 
for interaction.  I am also married to a Mennonite.  The Leis 
portion of my name is Amish Mennonite and I carry it very proudly 
along with the traditions of the community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me put on record the very important contribution of the 
Mennonite Church and, in particular, the Mennonite central 
committee in our deliberations on Bill C-11 pertaining to 
immigration and refugees.  The Mennonite community has been 
leading the charge in terms of ensuring Canada carries on a 
humanitarian, compassionate approach to refugees, displaced 
persons and people in need of protection around the world.  They 
have made some very important recommendations throughout our 
debate.  I want to acknowledge the work they have done and I want 
to add my support and the support of our caucus for the bill. 
<P><A NAME="LINK9"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
too rise in support of Bill S-25.  Those were the shortest 
speeches I have ever heard made by the member for Winnipeg North 
Centre and the member for Provencher.  I am shocked.  It is also 
nice to see that all members can come together on legislation in 
a non-partisan manner and put forward a breath of fresh air in 
the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I speak in favour of the legislation.  I too have numerous 
constituents of the Mennonite faith in my riding.  I would like 
to add to the words of the previous speakers that it is the 
Mennonite faith that brings together church, family, community 
and generosity.  I am shocked that the member for Provencher did 
not recognize that the Mennonite community is the most generous. 
Manitoba in particular has been recognized as having the largest 
charitable givings anywhere in the country. This is part of the 
philosophy and mindset of the Mennonite Church and the Mennonite 
people themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-25 is housekeeping legislation that can and should go 
through the House very quickly.  It is a name change and it 
brings the new corporation into the 21st century and allows 
it to expand and prosper.  The Progressive Conservative Party 
supports the legislation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK10"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I would like to say something about the administrative aspect of 
the legislation.  It is time that we seriously considered freeing 
up parliament from the necessity of passing legislation to change 
a name.  I know the act was originally passed by parliament so 
only parliament can change it, but surely we could figure out 
some way that name changes and other changes in the incorporation 
of various institutions that come to the House from time to time 
could be done in a more efficient manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also have roots in the Mennonite community.  The name Epp has 
the characteristics of a typical Mennonite name, as the do 
Dycks, the Friesens, the Klassens and on and on.  I hesitate to 
say that I am proud to come from a Mennonite background because 
of the fact that pride is one of those things that we do not 
pride ourselves on.  Pride is one of the seven sins that we try 
to avoid.  The object is to walk humbly, to serve other people 
and to serve God. 
It is a very strong religious commitment made in the Mennonite 
community.

<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have never said this before in the Chamber, and maybe it is 
slightly inappropriate, but I grew up in that kind of environment 
with my parents and grandparents all very solidly teaching us to 
follow the ways of the Scriptures, the Bible as we call it in the 
Christian tradition, and to live by it, not just say we believe 
it but to actually act on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It says we are to love our enemies and pray for those who 
use us spitefully.  That is a very important teaching of the 
Mennonites.  I honestly believe that if more people of all kinds 
of different cultural and religious backgrounds would practice 
that, it would certainly help to reduce the total amount of 
conflict, not only domestically and socially within our own 
country, but around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the reasons my family, as with the member for Provencher, 
was basically forced out of then Russia was that the Mennonites 
being pacifists were not ready to take up arms and shoot their 
fellow man.  Because they were not friends of the revolution, 
they were considered enemies.  Therefore, the Bolsheviks and the 
other revolutionaries entered Mennonite communities and shot the 
men and boys who were old enough to fight.  The Mennonites 
offered little or no resistance, at least for the most part. Many 
escaped serious injury because of their philosophy.  A lot of 
people were actually let go because they were not a threat to the 
other side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, there were many sad stories of the atrocities committed. 
Those are also in our history book.  They really tear me apart 
when I think of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember reading a little book, the <I>Diary of Anna Baerg</I>, which 
I got from the Liberal House leader, who some may know has 
studied the Mennonite way of life.  Recognizing that I was of 
that background, he lent me the book, for which I was very 
grateful.  It made good reading.  I have to admit that at times 
there were tears in my eyes because of some of the atrocities 
that occurred. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In one case she talked about attack and invasion by 
government officials of the day, and listed a number of people 
who were killed.  She then talked about one young girl who was 
not killed.  Her next sentence said there were some things that 
were worse than death.  When I think of that, I have nothing but 
respect for the people who lived through that kind of 
persecution, yet came to Canada and positively made a 
contribution to the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to emphasize that in my family, in our church 
and in the part of the country in which I grew up, frequent 
statements of thanksgiving for being in, Canada were made.  I do 
not think I ever went to my grandparents place without realizing 
my grandmother was particularly overwhelmed by the freedom and 
opportunity.  That was back in the thirties and forties.  I 
obviously do not remember too much from the thirties, but in the 
forties I remember my grandmother said over and over how blessed 
we were to be in this wonderful country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only have the Mennonites as a group contributed to Canada, 
as has already been stated, but they were very grateful 
recipients of what Canada offered.  I would simply like to say 
that I share that gratitude.  I am very happy that my 
grandparents made the decision, even though it was under some 
coercion, to bring their family to this country.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is sort of a free for all, a time to talk a little about 
the Mennonites.  The actual purpose of the bill is to change the 
name, and some of the articles of the constitution of the 
Mennonites, from the conference to the church.  They are a church 
and a solid faith community.  They have much to offer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another aspect they have become involved in under the auspices 
of MCC, the Mennonite Central Committee, is with respect to 
justice in our country, and it has been a very important 
intervention.  They have emphasized being involved in restorative 
justice by bringing victims together with the perpetrators of 
crimes and having them work that out.  They have found that, when 
young perpetrators break into homes or things like that and go through 
that process, the recidivism rate is way lower than when we 
simply put these young offenders in prisons and teach them better 
ways of doing crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the House for this opportunity to speak about what I 
think are very important social issues as they affect the very 
deep meaning of the people who live in our country. 
<P><A NAME="LINK11"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cannis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I too am very pleased to 
participate in this debate today on Bill S-25, sponsored by the 
member for Winnipeg South.  Let me also add my comments, after 
hearing the member for Elk Island give us an historical 
perspective.  It gives everybody the opportunity to maybe 
appreciate why we are doing this.  It is such a unique 
experience, as we begin a Monday in this House, to see such 
tremendous co-operation among members.  It is amazing what can be 
accomplished when everybody comes together and rises above 
political stripes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will also point out, as the parliamentary secretary, that the 
bill is very straightforward.  None of the changes proposed in 
the bill are unusual or revolutionary in any way, as the House 
heard from other members.  Rather the changes are designed to 
ensure clarity of operation for the Mennonite church. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill was requested by the Conference of Mennonites of Canada 
and was sponsored in the other place by Senator Kroft to start 
with.  Senator Carstairs then sponsored the private bill in the 
last parliament, but unfortunately it died on the order paper. 
So here we are today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to point out that even though the bill is routine 
and non-controversial, it speaks to the larger issue that builds 
on the foundations of Canada's economy.  That issue is important 
for the framework of legislation affecting corporations as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether these corporations are aimed at making a profit in the 
global economy, or whether they are co-operatives aimed at 
advancing the interest of their members, or whether they are not 
for profit corporations, or in this case churches as was 
mentioned earlier, any corporation must have its rules and 
regulations built upon a solid base of framework law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the past years the government has worked to modernize its 
corporate framework legislation as we all know.  A sound 
corporate governance structure is a fundamental requirement for 
healthy investment, innovation, trade and economic growth.  In 
recent weeks we have debated Bill S-11 which amends the Canada 
Business Corporations Act and the Canada Cooperatives Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the framework laws that establish basic rules for 
corporate governance in these kinds of bodies.  For example, they 
set out the rights and obligations of directors, officers, 
shareholders and co-operative members.  Part of the objectives of 
Bill S-11 are to eliminate duplication and reduce costs of 
compliance.  Let me emphasize, we want to allow business 
corporations and co-operatives the flexibility to organize their 
affairs within a sound legislative structure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We place a high priority on this kind of co-operative framework 
legislation because it helps Canada compete in the global 
economy.  We amend these pieces of legislation to position 
Canadian businesses, investors, shareholders and co-operative 
members to respond quickly and creatively to rapid developments 
in the marketplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This brings me to the bill before us today, Bill S-25.  At first 
it may seem that there is very little in common between the 
corporate framework law affecting companies and co-operatives and 
that which affects the Mennonite church.

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>After all, the House will see in subclause 3(4) that the first 
objective of the corporation in question is: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—to promote the spiritual welfare and the unity of spirit of the 
members of the Corporation and, by mutual assistance, to foster, 
diffuse, encourage, advance and strengthen the work of the 
kingdom of God; 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We rarely find these objectives as part of the corporate goals 
of the business covered under Bill S-11. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next object listed for the corporation is: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—to build Christian communities in the Mennonite tradition; 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That tradition has existed in Canada since the 18th century when 
the first Mennonites came to Canada from the United States 
following the American revolution.  It was clearly pointed out by 
the member for Elk Island.  I appreciate him providing the 
history, because it gave everyone the opportunity in the House 
and across our country to understand fully what the bill all 
about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me point out that another wave of immigrants came from Russia, as 
I mentioned earlier, in the 19th century following the Russian 
revolution.  More recently Mennonites from many different 
backgrounds have made Canada their home, including Chinese, 
Vietnamese, Laotian, Cambodian, Taiwanese, French and Spanish, as 
well as German. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the centuries the tradition has produced a unique 
socio-religious culture based on self-sufficiency within tight 
communities.  It is a culture that emphasizes peace and relief 
projects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since its incorporation in 1947, the needs of the Conference of 
Mennonites in Canada have changed.  Corporate governance laws in 
Canada have also changed.  This is why, even though the aims and 
objectives of the Mennonite conference are different from the 
kinds of corporations covered in Bill S-11, there is a unity of 
purpose in the need to provide framework law that meets today's 
needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-25 would give the Mennonite church in Canada greater 
flexibility to carry on its affairs and makes its incorporation 
status consistent with modern corporate legislation.  The bill 
would remove the factors that limit the corporation from 
operating internationally.  In this way we can see a commonality 
of spirit between the bill affecting a church and our corporate 
framework legislation designed to make industrial corporations 
competitive internationally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a routine piece of legislation.  I am sure and know, as 
we have heard, that my colleagues unanimously support this 
effort.  At the same time, the bill reminds us all of our 
importance to work together in the House co-operatively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I personally want to thank everyone here for this 
co-operation.  I know that as we move forward we will do the 
right thing. 
<P><A NAME="LINK12"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as a 
member of parliament from Winnipeg, Manitoba, I too would like to 
take this opportunity to add my support for Bill S-25.  I am very 
pleased to hear of the level of co-operation and good will from 
all parties in the speeches we heard to date. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will briefly point out that my riding of Winnipeg Centre is 
home to quite a large Mennonite population.  It has been my very 
good fortune to get to know many of the activists in the 
Mennonite faith in my neighbourhood and in the area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will add some comments on how impressed I have been with the 
level of commitment Mennonite people in my riding have shown to 
issues such as building a sense of community, social justice, 
goodwill on a number of levels and certainly a sense of personal 
sacrifice.  The Mennonite people feel very strongly that their 
faith in their day to day lives must be integrated to the point 
where I believe the social gospel really is the overwhelming 
motivating influence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Bill S-25, as has been said, would enable Mennonites to 
restructure their administrative side so they could be more 
effective in the work that they do, then it is incumbent upon us 
to support it without any hesitation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things that I have been most impressed about is 
meeting anti-war activists, pacifists in the truest sense of the 
Mennonite faith.  As recently as this month, I received a number 
of letters at my offices from people of the Mennonite faith 
pointing out that they did not choose to pay income tax that 
would be put toward military development.  They did the 
mathematics which showed that if 6% or 7% of the total budget 
goes to the military, they would withhold that amount of money 
from their income tax.  They would not give it to the government 
to spend on those things.

<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a longstanding gesture in the pacifist anti-war movement 
and I have nothing but admiration for those who make that comment 
with their spending power, with their taxation dollars.  I 
believe it becomes an administrative nuisance, certainly for 
Revenue Canada, but it is the type of peaceful demonstration that 
very clearly puts their point of view front and centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To speak briefly on the work that they do in my immediate area, 
I have said many times that the riding of Winnipeg Centre is an 
area of great need, it being the core area of Winnipeg.  The 
Mennonite activists, to their credit, have actually targeted this 
part of my city to move into deliberately in order to try to 
elevate the standard of the neighbourhoods in that area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are middle class people, be they teachers, nurses or 
whatever, who could afford to live out in the suburbs where it 
might be safer and more pleasant and where there would be more 
access to services, but they consciously choose as a group, en 
masse, to move into an area of the greatest need and therefore 
bring the stability of their two parent families and well 
educated children with them to elevate the overall standard of 
the neighbourhood.  That in itself is a level of civic duty that 
we do not really see.  When people go beyond making a donation to 
a charitable organization, when they actually alter their own 
personal lives to do what is right for their home community, I 
think there is nothing more admirable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Others have pointed out that they have personal contact with the 
Mennonite faith.  My family as well has integrated with the 
Mennonite community in that I have cousins, uncles and aunts in 
the Schroeder family from the Portage area.  Even though I was 
raised as a Catholic, not as a Mennonite, I did gain a great deal 
of personal knowledge about the Mennonite faith by virtue of our 
shared family issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other thing I would like to point out is the development 
work that they have done in the Mennonite communities of Winkler, 
Altona and Morden in Manitoba.  This part of Manitoba is actually 
the most stable and prosperous part of the province now, due in 
no small part to the entrepreneurial skills and industrialization 
of the area brought about by the Mennonite people.  It was 
otherwise just an agricultural community.  They started small 
businesses and small manufacturing such as the wood manufacturing 
industry in Manitoba.  The largest single private sector company 
in Manitoba is Palliser Furniture, which is the largest wood 
products manufacturer in all of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just wanted to take this opportunity as a member of parliament 
from Manitoba and from Winnipeg to add my enthusiastic support 
for the bill.  If it helps the Mennonite community in the 
structuring of the good work it does, we should certainly be 
foursquare in their corner on this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the other services the Mennonite community has brought to 
us in the province of Manitoba is the mediation and conciliation 
service they offer through their church.  Whenever there is an 
issue like two neighbours arguing over a fence, they have the 
option of taking it to the mediation service offered by the 
Mennonite church rather than going to litigation.  It has been 
and continues to be of very great value. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very proud to be part of this.  Bill S-25 is one of those 
things that we should be able to do as a cleanup at the end of 
parliament, with multiparty support and easy passage. 
<P><A NAME="LINK13"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I will be brief.  I just want to comment on the 
procedure behind the bill and to object formally to having the 
bill originate in the Senate.  The Senate is not elected, is not 
democratic and is not accountable.  It seems to me that any bill 
should originate in the House of Commons, not in the other place, 
which is not accountable to anyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to file that objection as a matter of principle.  I think 
we have to do something about the Senate.  I believe it should be 
abolished.  Some members, like my friend from Calgary, would like 
to see an elected Senate, but the polling I have seen shows that 
only 5% of the country supports the existing Senate.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>IMMIGRATION AND REFUGEE PROTECTION ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK26">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from June 1 consideration of Bill C-11, an act 
respecting immigration to Canada and the granting of refugee 
protection to persons who are displaced, persecuted or in danger, 
as reported (with amendment) from the committee, and of the 
motions in Group No. 2. 
<P><A NAME="LINK27"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise to speak to Motions Nos. 5, 6 
and 7 at report stage of Bill C-11 respecting the Immigration and 
Refugee Protection Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill has raised a lot of concerns at the hearings that have 
gone on across the country.  A lot of people have expressed 
opinions on the immigration bill.  The bill talks about the 
granting of refugee protection to persons who are displaced, 
persecuted or in danger.  It also talks about supposedly bringing 
the Immigration Act into line after such a long period of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the problems is that our immigration policy requires a 
tremendous amount of review.  The current legislation has not 
been implemented in the way it should have been.  If it had, we 
would have no need for a haphazard bill that is trying to address 
the issue but failing to hit the key point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  They are our amendments too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai:</B>  That is right.  Our amendments were 
made after consultations with many groups across the country.  My 
colleague who is the critic for immigration brought in amendments 
to address what is viewed out there to be a very flawed bill and 
an immigration system that needs a complete administrative 
overhaul.  We do not need a legislative overhaul; we need an 
administrative overhaul. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cuts that have taken place have resulted in a situation 
where the Department of Citizenship and Immigration is having a 
difficult time meeting the growing needs of what has become an 
attractive place to which to come.  We are happy that a lot of 
people want to come to Canada.  Nevertheless, sitting in my 
office I have seen my workload in immigration increase.  I am 
sure every member of parliament has seen an increase of 
immigration inquiries in their offices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a direct result of the cuts that have taken place, which 
threw the burden on members of parliament to try to address the 
concerns.  I had an opportunity to travel with the minister of 
immigration and I have seen firsthand the problems. Even spousal 
applications, which the minister said should take six months, 
have extended to the level where they are taking eight or nine 
months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we make inquiries of the department or of our missions 
overseas the delays are longer.  The typical response is that 
they do not have the resources to address the growing need.  What 
is the solution to all these things? 
The bill tries to address some of them, but it fails to provide 
for effective administration of our current policy which would 
see cases of legitimate immigrants and those who jump the queue, 
who bypass the system, handled expeditiously.  If they have a 
legitimate claim they can stay.  If they have an illegitimate 
claim they should leave.

<A HREF="#LINKT9"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are mired in so much bureaucracy, so much red tape and so 
many issues of a smaller, frivolous nature that genuine 
immigrants are finding it difficult.  Those who abuse our system 
are taking advantage of these lax laws and the result is that 
Canadians are losing confidence in our immigration policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are all immigrants.  This is a land of immigrants and 
immigration will be a focal point in Canada for years to come. 
Let us do it right.  Let us get the confidence of the Canadian 
people.  Let us attract the people we want to attract.  Let us 
give hope to refugees who are fleeing their homes and do it in 
such a manner that the message goes out that yes, Canada is a 
land of opportunity which welcomes genuine refugees and genuine 
immigrants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However because of the cuts, the way administration is done and 
the haphazard laws that are brought in, confidence in immigration 
is evaporating.  This is true not only for Canadians but for 
prospective immigrants who would come to the country, build it 
and bring prosperity to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have spoken to the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration.  I 
have heard from a lot of people that we have a system in which 
they do not feel comfortable.  When they apply we go through a 
process that is too long, a process where we challenge small 
things.  It is interesting that the focus is on smaller 
administrative issues and ignores the bigger picture, which is 
that we have almost 230,000 immigrants coming into the country. 
All the resources are focused on smaller issues while ignoring 
the real objective: making the process easier and faster for the 
legitimate immigrants Canada needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be realistic.  There is competition out there to attract 
good immigrants.  There is competition from Australia, Britain, 
Germany and the U.S.A.  They are streamlining their procedures. 
They are out there aggressively trying to attract good 
immigrants.  What do we do in Canada?  We work slowly.  We are 
mired in small administrative issues that in the long term would 
not have a major impact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should rightly be concentrating on those who are queue 
jumping.  However we have dragged it out so long, as my colleague 
said, that we now have a higher load of refugees in Canada whose 
issues have not been addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opposition parties have called on the government to look at 
the issue to see if amnesty can be given so that we can clear the 
backlog and carry on.  However, as the Minister of Citizenship 
and Immigration has said, it would mean rewarding those who come 
through the back door. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However they have come through the back door because our system 
allows that to happen.

have used the system and this has eroded confidence in it.  We 
need to restore confidence in our immigration system so that 
everyone is comfortable with it and can trust and have confidence 
in it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is difficult to achieve this with the bill the government has 
brought in.  As usual, it is a haphazard band-aid solution.  My 
colleague will speak to it further.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I will say a couple of words at this stage of the debate 
about immigration and Bill C-11 that is before the House today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our party, through our critic from Winnipeg North Centre, has 
moved at the committee stage some 80 amendments to the bill.  I 
will make a couple of general comments and observations about the 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have somehow along the way lost our vision in terms of 
immigration and the value of immigration to this great land of 
Canada.  Many of us in the House are either immigrants or sons or 
daughters of immigrants.  My father emigrated from Sweden in 
1910.  My mother's parents both came from Britain at roughly the 
same time.  I am a first generation Canadian on my father's side 
and a second generation Canadian on my mother's side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Saskatchewan is a tremendous province that has been settled by 
immigrants.  A lot of people from the Ukraine, Russia, Germany 
and many countries around the world came to Saskatchewan and 
founded the province in 1905.  In doing so they joined with the 
first nations and Metis people who were there well before the 
Europeans and people from other lands came. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During those days, following the great national policy of Sir 
John A. Macdonald, Sir Wilfrid Laurier talked about the value of 
immigration and how we had to bring in skilled people from all 
over the world to build this great country with its vast regions, 
vast resources and lack of population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had that vision of the country for 50 to 80 years.  We 
welcomed immigration as much as possible and tried to build this 
great mosaic of people from many lands and cultures along with 
our two great languages and first nations people.  That was the 
whole vision of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember the Trudeau years in the House of Commons.  I was 
elected in 1968 when this vision was recharged.  It started 
recharging during the Pearson years from 1963 to 1968. The vision 
was about what the country could be in terms of bringing in 
immigrants.   The Official Languages Act, which was enshrined in 
our constitution, established the two official languages of 
Canada.  In 1982 the charter of rights and freedoms enshrined in 
our constitution multiculturalism, which was a reflection of 
those who came or whose ancestors came from other lands; 
languages; and the rights of first nations people.  These 
included treaty rights and a reference to the Metis people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was the whole dream, to create this big cultural mosaic. 
Canada became like a pearl necklace with all these beautiful 
pearls, all of them a bit different and all of them connected to 
form this great country of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Somehow during the Mulroney years and then continuing on through 
the most recent government, this dream and this vision seems to 
have been tightened up.  We seem to be looking at obstacles to 
uniting families and bringing skilled people into the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the committee stage our critic, the member for Winnipeg 
North Centre, moved several amendments to try to recreate the 
vision and the dream, which is what the bill was supposed to be. 
It was supposed to an overhaul and a revamping of the Immigration 
Act.  We in our party believe it has fallen far short of doing 
that. 
Before the bill becomes law, we encourage the government to 
seriously consider taking a look at some amendments that would 
once again make our country more visionary in terms of 
immigration.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to give the House a couple of examples.  What we 
see in the legislation is the continuation of a landing and 
administration fee commonly referred to as the head tax. This is 
something that is repugnant in a modern day society and in fact 
came in a number of years ago because it was not part of our 
general practice in terms of immigration in Canada.  The bill 
does not address the issue of a head tax and it should when we 
are talking about a major revamping of immigration laws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a failure in the bill to expand the family class 
category.  This is one of the amendments suggested by my 
colleague from Winnipeg North Centre that would expand the family 
class category to include an immigrant's immediate family, such 
as brothers, sisters and grandparents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is particularly important when we look at provinces like 
Saskatchewan or Manitoba which have populations of slightly over 
one million people apiece. When immigrants come to Canada they 
tend to go to the larger centres, such as Montreal, Toronto or 
Vancouver, and, to a lesser extent, to places like Ottawa. It is 
more difficult to get people to go to Saskatchewan or Manitoba. 
However, by changing the family class category it would be easier 
through family unification to get immigrants into smaller towns 
in rural Canada and to provinces like Manitoba, Saskatchewan, the 
Atlantic provinces and so on.  This was a suggestion made by our 
party and we believe these are some of the things that should be 
done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The United States, Australia and in some cases western Europe 
are winning the battle to get more highly skilled and educated 
immigrants into their countries.  We should look at being more 
aggressive in terms of getting more highly skilled and trained 
people into Canada because it would have a direct impact on our 
economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is the third largest country in the world and yet its 30 
million people are spread over various parts of the country. 
Canada is a country with vast resources and reserves that could 
be spent bringing in more people from around the world and 
creating a more dynamic and exciting country in the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has the greatest potential in the world.  It is still 
ranked number one by the United Nations.  We should not be 
hesitant in revising the Immigration Act to ensure that we bring 
in more highly skilled immigrants and unify families.  We should 
get rid of the head tax and all kinds of discrimination based on 
economics or whatever and create a great mosaic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spent much of last weekend in Regina going to what is an 
annual tradition in that city.  It is called a cultural mosaic. 
This year there were some 17 pavilions celebrating the heritage 
of people from places like China, the Philippines, Hungary, 
Ukraine, Austria and Germany.  There was also a francophone and 
first nations pavilion.  This has become an event with tens of 
thousands of people lining the streets waiting to go into the 
pavilions to taste the traditional foods of these countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Saturday night I could not even get near the Ukrainian 
pavilion because it was so popular.  People were lined up around 
the block.  There were hundreds of cars containing people who 
wanted to see the shows, the dancing and the traditions as well 
as looking at souvenirs from these countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This event has worked well in bringing people together in a 
celebration of a great cultural mosaic that Canada really is. 
This cultural mosaic has made us more tolerant as a nation in 
terms of preserving our two official languages and in terms of 
enshrining some rights for first nations and Metis people in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge the government to be a bit more generous in terms of the 
legislation and the proposed amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion I would like to make reference to Alex Kuziak who 
is over 90 years old and lives in Yorkton.  He was the first 
Canadian of Ukrainian descent to be a member of a cabinet in 
Canada.  He was a member of the CCF cabinet of Tommy Douglas back 
in 1948 in the province of Saskatchewan.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was here in 1969 when that act came in and there was a great 
division in the country over it.  Mr. Kuziak was a very strong 
supporter of the Official Languages Act.  What he said to me has 
always remained in my mind.  He said that because our country was 
more tolerant of diversity and was open in terms of immigration 
of people from all lands, it made us more tolerant in other ways 
as well, including recognizing that Canada has two official 
languages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a lot of wisdom in Alex Kuziak's words.  He referred to 
diversity and how it made us a more tolerant, loving and caring 
nation in terms of how we treat all peoples from all over the 
world.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron (Fundy—Royal, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member for Regina—Qu'Appelle is indeed a learned member of this 
institution.  I do however want to square part of the immigration 
comments he made with respect to the Conservative government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember former prime minister Brian Mulroney stating that 
there was no obligation more compelling and no duty more 
irresistible in Canada than to ensure that our minorities, 
linguistic and otherwise, live at all times in conditions of 
fairness and justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Regina—Qu'Appelle probably remembers Gordon 
Fairweather as well.  In that regard it was the Mulroney 
government that initiated the IRB concept because refugees' 
rights are indeed human rights and by no means do we want to 
determine on mere paper the future of individuals, whether they 
live or die, or face persecution.  Establishing the IRB and an 
oral hearing was a testament of that time and ironically it is 
the Liberal Government of Canada that now appears to be the most 
reticent of any political party in the House to protect the 
rights of permanent residents and protect refugees in that 
perspective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment that we are advocating would ensure that permanent 
residents who have been in Canada for at least three years would 
have the capacity to apply for an appeal should they face being 
removed under the criminality clause of Bill C-11.  Permanent 
means that there is a right to due process and we should embrace 
that particular issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Motion No. 5 the Canadian Alliance wants to be able to define 
danger to security.  Right now it is far too broad.  It wants to 
utilize the definition used in the CSIS Act, and we support that 
initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 6, which would amend clause 50, deals with removal 
orders and enforcement.  The initiative is supported by groups 
such as the Maytree Foundation.  We consider it to be a question 
of accountability.  It is an important issue that a ruling made 
by SIRC would be utilized should CSIS step out of bounds.  The 
intent is that SIRC is supposed to be a watchdog over CSIS in the 
event that it makes an intervention which is potentially over the 
top, unfair or just not Canadian.  That is a good initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, a watchdog must have teeth to serve any protective 
function and that is why our party supports the Canadian Alliance 
initiative in that regard.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to speak to Group No. 2 at report stage of 
Bill C-11. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments being proposed in Group No. 2 deal with very 
fundamental concerns with respect to Bill C-11.  The concerns 
pertain to our ability as a nation to ensure that all people on 
Canadian soil are guaranteed basic rights and liberties.  We are 
talking about the application of the charter of rights and 
freedoms for all people on Canadian soil, which is one area where 
Bill C-11 falls down very seriously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not need to encapsulate the numerous presentations made by 
many presenters on Bill C-11 but we do need to talk about how to 
make the bill better.  It is a seriously flawed bill and it must 
be amended in order to bring us in line with our traditions, both 
in terms of being a compassionate humanitarian nation and in 
terms of applying the charter of rights to all our citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the most egregious sections in Bill C-11 is clause 64. 
One of the amendments before us today tries to deal with that 
serious problem in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard from many groups, not just the Canadian Bar 
Association, about the problems with clause 64.  I hope the 
minister and the government will read those broad ranging 
concerns because, in the view of my NDP colleagues and in terms 
of members in all opposition parties, the notion that is 
contained in clause 64 is repugnant.  It is a denial of the 
rights of citizens with permanent resident status in this country 
to pursue normal appeal procedures in the event that they face a 
deportation order.  The clause reads: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—on grounds of security, violating human or international 
rights, serious criminality or organized criminality. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As many groups said to us in committee, no one condones any 
criminal actions nor believes that we should ignore or be lenient 
regarding any such charge that falls into one of those 
categories.  What we are talking about is the right of an 
individual to appeal a decision and the right to pursue through 
the courts what we have come to accept as a normal course of 
action pursuant to a civilized society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not just the Canadian Bar Association that has raised 
those concerns.  Earlier today we debated and discussed in 
collegial terms Bill S-25 pertaining to the Mennonite Church of 
Canada.  I want to put on record the concerns of the Mennonite 
Church of Canada and, in particular, the Mennonite Central 
Committee regarding Bill C-11, particularly the clauses that we 
are trying to amend today and the clause that deals with human 
rights and civil liberties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Mennonite Central Committee noted very clearly that Bill 
C-11 would create inadmissible classes of people in an unjust and 
unnecessary manner.  Grounds for inadmissibility include: 
security, human or international rights violations, serious 
criminality, organized criminality, poor health, being poor or 
being from a country against which Canada has imposed sanctions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee went on to state that those provisions would take 
us beyond the limits called for in the United Nations convention 
relating to the status of refugees.  It also stated that the 
provisions would take us beyond what is necessary for a humane 
and just society.

<A HREF="#LINKT14"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what we are talking about today:  how to make sure that 
this bill has the provisions for taking all the necessary actions 
in terms of criminal elements while assuring that we adhere to 
the principles of the charter of rights and that applied basic 
rights of appeal and rights for proper review be incorporated 
into that process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Time and time again Canadians came before us at committee as we 
dealt with Bill C-11 and told us that we will have missed a 
golden opportunity if we allow Bill C-11 to go forward as 
drafted.  What has caused Canadians so much concern is the tone 
of the bill.  It is not just the tone in terms of words and 
rhetoric, but a tone that is carried through into the actual 
application of the law.  Time and time again Canadians and 
organizations in the country who appeared before the committee 
and have written to all of us on numerous occasions have said 
“Goodness gracious, we have operated for 25 years under an old 
law that needs revamping”.  They said that we have new 
circumstances to deal with, the world has changed and Canada is 
missing the boat by not coming forward with a visionary piece of 
legislation that will take us forward into the millennium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The questions for us today are threefold.  First, how do we 
uphold and maintain Canada's past involvement in terms of 
offering refuge for Canadians and ensuring that we operate always 
on the basis of humanitarian and compassionate grounds?  Second, 
do we always, at every step of the process, ensure that the 
charter of rights applies to everyone on Canadian soil?  Third, 
are we able to compete for immigrants internationally, globally, 
in a very competitive world? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think what we have all come to conclude from discussions on 
the bill is that we have missed the boat on all three of those 
fundamental issues.  We have missed the opportunity to be 
visionary and to educate and challenge Canadians about the most 
fundamental reason for having an Immigration Act for the next 
century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the concerns that we heard during our committee hearings 
had been brought to the attention of the government earlier, when 
the previous minister of immigration actually embarked upon a 
major consultative approach and heard from Canadians in the 
spring of 1999.  That was a process to hear from Canadians in 
order to revamp the legislation and resulted in a report called 
“Not Just Numbers”.  That title says a lot about what we are 
supposed to be about as a country and where we have missed the 
boat here today with Bill C-11. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should not be just about numbers, but about our vision for 
the future and our responsibilities on the global scene.  It 
should be about our adherence to international conventions 
pertaining to refugees and torture.  It should be about shaping 
the kind of society we want, not only for this country but the 
kind of example we want to pursue globally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we could go back and do this again, I would say this to the 
Government of Canada:  listen to the voices of Canadians who have 
spoken out so clearly on this bill.  I do not think we can point 
to any voices at all in Canada who are absolutely satisfied with 
Bill C-11.  To the contrary, most people who have paid attention 
to this matter and are concerned about immigration and refugee 
policies feel that the bill is a bad bill and should not become 
law today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are talking about entering this millennium with vision and 
with commitment to the principles that have built this country, 
then we have to reconsider.  That is why we in the NDP feel so 
strongly about the bill, why we tried so hard to amend it and 
why, unless the government listens to some of the concerns being 
raised today, we will have to oppose it.  It is not good public 
policy.  It is not good legislation.  It will not ensure that 
Canada is able to deal with the need to attract immigrants, the 
need to be welcoming to newcomers and the need to ensure that we 
play our role globally in terms of people in need of protection. 
Not to carry out that fundamental objective is to do a great 
disservice to parliament and to the country.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I actually was not going to say much here this morning but I feel 
I must respond to the comments of the two previous speakers to 
the bill, the critic for the NDP and the critic for the 
Conservative Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When they talk about the fact that the government is not living 
up to its charter of rights obligations and that it is taking 
away appeals from people, I think there are a couple of things 
that are conveniently left out.  One of them is who it is we are 
talking about here in terms of permanent residents who are facing 
deportation.  A permanent resident is a landed immigrant.  I am 
sure everyone knows that no government would in any kind of a 
light fashion institute deportation proceedings against someone 
who has attained landed immigrant status.  It would have to be 
pretty serious, and what exactly does it mean? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a rule in the bill that we refer to as the 10 and 2 
rule.  The people we are talking about who could, may or might 
face deportation proceedings in this instance are people who have 
committed a crime for which they have been charged, tried, 
convicted and sentenced.  The sentence must be a minimum of 2 
years and the crime must allow for a maximum of 10 years.  It is 
the 10 and 2 rule. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the crime is serious enough to have at least a 10 year 
sentence applied and the decision by the judge is that the person 
who has been convicted, and that is very important, must serve at 
least 2 years out of a possible 10, then the person has committed 
a crime that the ministry would see as serious enough, possibly, 
to institute deportation proceedings.  It is not automatic.  A 
notice would have to be sent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The suggestion that people do not have a right of appeal is just 
patently false.  What they do not have a right to do is jam up 
our federal courts in appealing.  They do not have a right to 
come out after their sentence is over and they are facing 
deportation proceedings and then jam up the judicial system while 
they continue to stay in the country, avoiding the deportation 
order and perhaps reoffending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members opposite say the government has not listened to 
Canadians.  I am sorry, but I represent a riding, Mississauga 
West, where immigration is one of the hottest issues.  I can tell 
members that Canadians have told me loud and clear that they do 
not want Canada to be seen as a safe haven for criminals, 
convicted felons, violent perpetrators, terrorists or 
subversives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some would say this is against the charter of rights.  Come on. 
There is a right within the bill for people who have been 
convicted and sentenced.  By the way, they would most likely have 
appealed it, so they would have gone through the criminal justice 
system appealing everything all the way.  If the appeal did not 
set them free, they would have been incarcerated.  When they get 
out this government wants the right to say that it no longer 
wants those people in the country continuing with those kinds of 
offences.  That is number one.  Let us be clear about that.  The 
government has done the test on whether or not the bill will 
stand up to charter challenges and it is absolutely convinced it 
will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian people have a right to feel safe in their communities. 
One of the arguments I hear from the Progressive Conservative 
critic is that people who come to this country could be here for 
20 to 30 years and then the government would turn around and 
deport them because they have committed a serious crime.  If they 
have been in the country for 20 or 30 years and have not sought 
Canadian citizenship that clearly is their option.  There is no 
obligation on them to become citizens, but if they want to become 
citizens and a productive part of our society then we welcome 
them to do that.  If they choose not to do that and they simply 
maintain the status of being landed immigrants or permanent 
residents, as it is referred to in the bill, then they run the 
risk, and they should know they run the risk, following a 
conviction on a 10 and 2 crime, a serious enough crime, that they 
may well be deported.

<A HREF="#LINKT16"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They can appeal that decision to an independent adjudicator, who 
will make a decision as to whether or not that deportation order 
should be upheld.  The decision of the independent adjudicator is 
judicially reviewable in the courts.  If the order continues to 
be upheld, it can be appealed under humanitarian and 
compassionate grounds, which is also judicially reviewable in the 
courts.  I count that as four reviews. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members opposite would paint some kind of a clandestine approach 
to this, as if we are simply saying, no, they are out of here, 
they get the boot and they do not get a chance to have their 
cases reviewed.  That is simply not the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, the Canadian Bar Association did come before the committee 
and appealed to it to allow for continued extensive use of the 
court system.  Frankly, in the bill we have listened to 
Canadians.  They do not want these people abusing our court 
system while they are free to reoffend.  We as a government must 
have the right to make sure our citizens are safe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have one final point with regard to refugees.  The member for 
Fundy—Royal, the Progressive Conservative critic, wrote an 
article that was published in one of the Toronto dailies on 
Friday, wherein he said that refugees only get to apply once in a 
lifetime.  I do not know why he would say that when he knows that 
in fact is not the case, that if there are changed circumstances 
a person can reapply every six months, not just once in six 
months but every six months.   With new evidence, new 
information, with changed circumstances, refugees can apply again 
and again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For people who have applied for refugee status and have no 
change in their circumstances, the bill does not allow appeal 
after appeal.  We have all seen and heard of the abuse and we 
know about such situations.  In fact there have been some 
recently mentioned in the media, about people who have stayed in 
the country illegally for five, six or seven years while they 
abused the system and used the appeal system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To suggest that the bill is flawed because we have stripped 
people who are on Canadian soil of their rights is just 
fundamentally inaccurate, in my view, and is not a fair portrayal 
of the bill.  Canadians have told us that they want our 
immigration system to be open and welcoming to immigrants and 
refugees who need our protection and who will come here and help 
build a greater Canada, but they no longer want to tolerate the 
kinds of abuses they have seen where people have been free in our 
society to reoffend, to commit additional crimes.  We have lost 
some of our best young people to such tragedies as the Just 
Desserts file and many others.  We will simply not tolerate it. 
That is what Canadians have told us and that is what the 
government intends to do.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mario Laframboise (Argenteuil—Papineau—Mirabel, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak to the proposed motions to 
amend Bill C-11, the immigration and refugee protection act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-11 had a predecessor, namely Bill C-31, introduced during 
the last parliament, on April 6, 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a bill that did not get passed in 2000 for the simple 
reason that the government decided to call an early election. 
As a result, more than 400,000 men and women in Canada or 
elsewhere in the world are still waiting on permanent resident 
status or permission to come to Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has lost a whole year while men and women who 
view Quebec, for instance, as the promised land where they wish 
to spend their future, could have been allowed to immigrate to 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois could not disagree with the principle that it 
was high time to amend the immigration and refugee protection 
act. This bill allows men and women who qualify as good 
potential citizens to settle in Canada, while closing the door 
to all those who, for all manner of reasons, do not and would 
not have the ability or the right to settle here.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister, who described her bill as tough and intended “to 
close the back door to those who would abuse our generosity—so 
that we can open the front door wider to the immigrants”, cites 
fine principles, which we must support.  The Bloc Quebecois 
supports all ideologies aimed at preventing people who are not 
good citizens from settling in the promised lands of Quebec and 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, those good citizens in the various parts of the world 
could still come and enrich our fine country, which has again 
set as a objective, it must be said, 300,000 new arrivals annually 
in order to consolidate the fabric of the community affected by 
the aging of the Canadian population.  Canada must see 
immigration as promising for the future.  The objective of 
300,000 new arrivals Canada set for itself has never been met. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That means that its immigration policy never met projections or 
estimates or demands from coalitions made in the course of 
discussions and dealings with the stakeholders from the various 
sectors.  Finally, it means that the objectives set by the 
stakeholders, expert and elite, who can represent immigration 
across Canada, were creditable, 
but I repeat, Canada has never met its objective.  In 2000, 
barely two-thirds of the objective of 300,000 new arrivals was 
met.  All this to say that it is time we made a major amendment 
to the immigration and refugee protection act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the motions tabled by our wise member colleagues, 
there are three I would like to comment on.  They are the 
motions in Group No. 2, but I would like to return to the 
motions in Groups Nos. 1 and 3 as well.  I would, by this, like to 
have the members understand the ideology and philosophy that 
should underlie any legislative amendment to legislation as 
important as that on immigration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this bill, we should always keep in mind a fundamental 
principle, namely the principle of coercion, concentration and 
discussion that has always guided previous amendments to the 
Immigration Act. All the stakeholders must be given a real 
opportunity to discuss things together. This is why critical 
work was done in committee to support the amendments that were 
tabled regarding this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 2 tabled by the hon. member for Laval Centre deals 
with clause 5(4) of the bill, which would allow the governor in 
council to make the regulation at any time after the proposed 
regulation has been laid before each House of parliament. The 
bill does not include all the components of the important 
immigration host system or program. 
This bill does not explain all the host programs. Regulations 
have been and will continue to be tabled from time to time to 
improve this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regulations are adopted to improve existing acts. Clause 5(4) 
would allow the governor in council to make or approve 
regulations that were tabled in the House without first having 
been reviewed in committee. I can only agree with the hon. 
member for Laval Centre on this matter. The bill was considered 
in committee and it has already been the object of a major 
debate during the last parliament, as Bill C-31.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have trouble seeing why the governor in council is being 
allowed to approve regulations tabled directly in the House, 
without prior discussion in committee, as in the past.  I 
therefore support Motion No. 2 moved by the member for Laval 
Centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that members will understand that the purpose of 
legislation as important as the Immigration Act must be debated. 
All stakeholders, all those who have made immigration as 
important as it is in Canada, must be allowed to continue their 
work in a climate of consensus.  That is the purpose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The consensus is there.  All parties in the House are agreed 
that they do not want bad citizens settling in Canada, but they 
do want Canada to reach its objective of taking in 300,000 new 
arrivals annually, which it has yet to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we therefore need is legislation which will create a 
climate conducive to consensus and discussion so that 
immigration may play its rightful role in our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for Motion No. 5, moved by the Canadian Alliance member for 
Surrey Central, not only must there be the consensus to which I 
referred in my speech on Motion No. 2, but we must ensure that 
bad citizens are not allowed into Canada.  I think that this is 
a view shared by all Canadians and recognized by all parties in 
the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Paragraph 34(1)(<I>d</I>) of the bill mentions: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>34.(1) A permanent resident or a foreign national is 
inadmissible on security grounds for 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>... 
</I></B></P><P align=left><I>d</I>) being a danger to the security of Canada; 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously the word danger is open to interpretation.  Our 
colleague from Surrey Central submits that it might be 
worthwhile to replace this wording with the following: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left><I>d</I>) being a threat to the security of Canada— 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 2 of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service Act 
provides a definition of threats to the security of Canada. 
Examples are provided, such as espionage or sabotage, foreign 
influenced activities within or relating to Canada that are 
detrimental to the interests of Canada, activities in support of 
acts of violence. 
These definitions are far more specific than the single word 
danger, which can lead to serious confusion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will close with a brief discussion of Motion No. 9 from my 
colleague the hon. member for Laval Centre.  The purpose of her 
motion is to put an end to the interminable delays in processing 
new arrivals in Canada.  As a result of these delays, the 
provinces often have to meet the costs of supporting people who 
are already on Canadian territory or, in the case of Quebec, on 
Quebec territory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members must understand that all of us here in this House 
should support Motion No. 9, which will make it possible to 
reduce the long delays involved in examining people's status as 
immigrants to Canada. 
<P><A NAME="LINK33"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Paquette (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am extremely 
pleased to speak to Bill C-11, the immigration and refugee 
protection act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very important matter for me.  I have been interested 
in it for a number of years, because I sit on the board of the 
Greater Montreal United Way.  We manage assistance for agencies 
providing help to refugees and immigrants.  We know that each is 
treated in much the same way.  Often problems related to the 
arrival of refugees impact the way we look at immigration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague for Argenteuil—Papineau—Mirabel said, legislation 
adapted to the new realities of Canada and Quebec and the world 
as a whole is most welcome.  The environment has hugely changed 
the pressures of population movements that are a part of 
globalization. 
It is not said often enough, but the arrival in numbers not only 
in Canada but in all western countries of persons from southern 
countries is part of the globalization process we speak of 
daily.

<A HREF="#LINKT19"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an extremely important bill. It is also a bill that 
calls on the most fundamental values shared by Quebecers and 
Canadians and that reflects a commitment to international 
solidarity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All members will agree that our primary concern with this bill 
must be to show extreme generosity toward those who, for reasons 
having to do with their political opinion, sexual orientation or 
religion, must leave their country to save their lives and those 
of their loved ones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This commitment to international solidarity must transcend our 
concerns when we review Bill C-11. This is particularly 
important for Quebec and Quebecers, because, as we know Quebec 
welcomes more than its fair share of refugees on a per capita 
basis, and we are proud of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, we must, as members representing Quebec's 
interests, remind this House that there are major costs 
involved. Quebec must pay some $80 million to provide the 
necessary assistance to refugees even though this is a federal 
jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this respect, Motion No. 9, to which the hon. member for 
Argenteuil—Papineau—Mirabel referred and which was moved by the 
hon. member for Laval Centre, is an absolute priority for us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, the system must be much more efficient, not only for 
administrative reasons, but also for reasons that relate to 
international solidarity and to which I referred.  We need to 
create the proper environment to make the system much more 
efficient. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This brings me to a third point. When we talk about efficiency, 
we must think about the rigour with which we should deal with 
refugee and immigration issues in general, to admit to Canada 
and Quebec people who not only have refugee status, but who also 
meet immigration requirements. We must be able to prevent 
undesirables from entering Canada and Quebec. This rigour must 
not mean that the federal government can get around providing 
appropriate resources to administer the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 9 deals with this issue.<SUP></SUB></SUP> 
The proposed legislation could be extremely rigorous, extremely 
comprehensive with respect to this obligation to show 
solidarity, this obligation to ensure the safety of residents of 
Canada and of Quebec, but the government's primary concern in 
introducing Bill C-11 must not be to make this bill as repressive 
as possible in order to keep refugees out of Canada and to try 
to economize on the necessary resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this regard, I think it is extremely important to remind the 
federal government, the Liberal government, that additional 
resources are needed to implement any legislation, although I do 
agree that this legislation must be rigorously enforced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one final point I wish to make before looking at the 
individual motions. 
It is clear that the government's wish to introduce this bill is 
also motivated by a certain pressure from our neighbours to the 
south, whose view of this obligation to show solidarity towards 
refugees perhaps differs from that of Canadians and Quebecers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would not want decisions taken in the House to be coloured by 
this desire to comply with our American neighbours, as has 
unfortunately been the case in various connections in recent 
months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, we have noticed a certain anxiousness on the part of 
the government to comply with pressures that had less to do with 
public opinion in Canada or in Quebec than they had to do with 
public opinion in the United States or with what the U.S. 
government wanted.  The missile defence shield, the energy 
agreement, and so forth, are just a few examples that come to 
mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore think it extremely important that our concerns not 
be allowed to overshadow our obligation to show solidarity, that 
the necessary resources be made available to enforce the 
legislation, and that the toughness of the legislation reflect 
our values and needs, not those of our neighbours to the south.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is in that context that the Bloc Quebecois views Motion No. 5, 
for example, as extremely important in order to better define 
what constitutes a threat to the security of Canada. As we have 
mentioned already, we feel that section 2 of the Canadian 
Security Intelligence Service Act would be a good basis for 
defining what is a threat to the security of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that law, the definition includes espionage, sabotage, 
activities detrimental to the interests of Canada, activities in 
support of the threat of acts of serious violence and activities 
intended ultimately to lead to the destruction or overthrow of 
the constitutionally established system of government in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that those activities would indeed constitute 
threats to the security of Canada. However, it is also clear 
that people who defend causes in their countries, who protest or 
show their disagreement with policy directions, who are doing it 
democratically whenever possible and with a will to resolve 
problems peacefully, should not be covered by that definition. 
In our opinion, the universal charter of human rights should be 
respected in the spirit of the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, we feel that a much clearer and more specific 
definition of the concept of threat to the security of Canada is 
absolutely necessary for this legislation to be applied to the 
fullest extent, but without arbitrariness and most of all without 
injustice toward people who, in all good faith, defend a cause 
with which we sometimes are in agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the same spirit, while we agree with the motion and the 
amendment to more clearly define through the Canadian Security 
Intelligence Service Act the concept of threat against the 
security of Canada, we disagree with the idea that the Security 
Intelligence Review Committee would be the organization that 
should make recommendations to this effect. We question the 
appropriateness of involving the SIRC review committee in this 
regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to focus mostly on Motion No. 7, proposed by my colleague 
from Laval Centre. Its purpose is to maintain a level of appeal 
for people who have been refused refugee status or admission 
into Canada on grounds of serious crime, security,  violation of 
human rights or organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, the present act provides for two stages. When the 
adjudication division takes expulsion proceedings, an appeal 
division can hear the arguments that the refugee or the 
permanent resident might make to challenge the decision. In our 
opinion, it is very important that this level of appeal be 
maintained. In this sense, clause 64 of the bill must be removed 
entirely. Once again, I feel that through clause 64 the 
government is trying to hide the lack of resources to apply the 
bill that will eventually be passed by invoking administrative 
reasons and removing a level of appeal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the Bloc Quebecois hopes that Bill C-11 will be 
amended to respond to the real values of Quebecers and 
Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Loyola Hearn (St. John's West, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the speaker from the Bloc Party expressing 
concerns about a number of the amendments shows that if members 
in this hon. House have so many concerns about the legislation, 
undoubtedly there are a number of flaws in it. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1250"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to concentrate on clause 64 and the amendment suggested 
to it.  Perhaps first we should ask what does Bill C-11 do in 
relation to appeals for permanent residents? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-11 as it is denies an appeal for permanent residents if 
they are subject of a report under section 44.  Permanent 
residents can be deported without an appeal or without 
consideration of their circumstances as a result of a single 
criminal sentence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know it is hard sometimes for people to have patience.  We say 
that people who come into the country should live by the laws and 
rules of the country.  If they do not and they break the law, 
then they should be expected to pay the price.  However, every 
court in the land has an appeal process.  It is only fair that, 
regardless of how serious perhaps the offence is, at least the 
person should have the right to an appeal, because no one ever 
knows what might come up in the appeals process that will throw 
an entirely different light upon the case itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even if they have lived here since infancy or whether they have been 
here for 20, 30 or 50 years, immigration officers will be solely 
responsible for making the decision as to whether deportation of 
these permanent residents is appropriate.  Again, it is an awful 
onus or pressure to put on immigration officers of having the 
sole responsibility of deciding whether or not these people 
should be deported. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once that decision is made, the wheels of enforcement turn and 
there is no review of that officer's discretionary decision.  For 
all the talk from the department that these decisions are taken 
seriously, that they are serious decisions and that there will be 
safeguards to prevent inappropriate deportation for long term 
residents, the legislation provides no such safeguard at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are reminded sometimes of the statement “I am from 
government, trust me”.  That is basically what is being said 
here, that we should not worry about it because there will be no 
problem.  If the legislation does not give any protection, then I 
am afraid we are depending, as is said, on a rotten stick. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the department speaks of an adjudicator making a tribunal 
decision and the subsequent possibility of judicial review, it is 
only with respect to whether the permanent resident has the 
necessary conviction and sentence.  There is no jurisdiction for 
the tribunal or the federal court to look behind the decision to 
proceed with enforcement.  That is what has been lost by taking 
away the appeal jurisdiction, one of the most fundamentally 
important parts of Bill C-11. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While it may be necessary to remove individuals since they have 
reneged on the responsibilities that come with having status in 
Canada, we must for reasons of fundamental justice give them a 
real appeal opportunity.  That is what the amendment asks. 
Despite the fact that once they cross that line they know what 
lies ahead, they should in all fairness have at least an appeal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe in 1985 the Singh case set out the importance of the 
oral appeal and said that people should not be deprived of the 
rights to have their case heard.  Canada prides itself on being a 
land not only that accepts immigrants.  In fact, our country has 
been built because of people who have come from all over the 
world, settled here and have contributed so much.  We also 
realize there are people who come here, break the law and must 
pay the consequence.  Being the fair and honest government that 
we are, the type of free country where we feel everyone is equal, 
the least we could do for someone is to give him or her an 
appeal.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the amendment suggests in this case is that the appeal 
rights shall be given to all permanent resident who have 
maintained permanent resident status for a three year period 
before being subject of report under section 44.  The three year 
period is chosen in order to be consistent with the length of 
time one must be a permanent resident before applying for 
Canadian citizenship.  Therefore, if within that three year 
period someone breaks the law, he or she then should at least 
have the right to an oral appeal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a lot of good stuff in the bill, like most bills, but 
there are also some weaknesses.  In passing legislation that is 
going to determine how we will treat immigrants coming to the 
country and how we treat immigrants who will be deported from the 
country, the least we should do is make sure the legislation is 
proper and that laws and rules apply in the spirit of the type of 
country Canada really is.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is with great pleasure I rise to speak to Bill C-11.  As the 
Chair can see by the interest of our party, this is a very 
serious issue with respect to immigration and the bill now before 
us.  I am pleased to have the opportunity to echo some of the 
comments made by our critic from Fundy—Royal who has had the 
carriage of this bill, as well as others like the member for St. 
John's East. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-11 is a very important piece of legislation.  As I 
mentioned earlier, my colleague from Fundy—Royal spoke to the 
salient points.  However, it is important that we identify a 
couple of major issues in the legislation, which are necessary to 
bring forward because Canadians as a whole must recognize there 
are some deficiencies.  The government itself has not seen fit to 
change some of those deficiencies in the legislation.  Going 
forward with Bill C-11 as it is now is not going to resolve all 
of the issues with respect to immigration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first issue is with respect to the refugee status.  We 
recognize it in the legislation.  The refugee board itself will 
be reduced in numbers.  There will be an adjudicator.  Let us see 
this in proper perspective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An individual from outside the boundaries of this great country 
of Canada who wishes to apply for refugee status makes a 
presentation, not to an adjudication board but simply to one 
person.  That is not to say that the individual will not give 
full concentration to that one application, but a judgmental 
decision will be made.  One person listening to an 
applicant in some instances may not hear the full story or may 
not be apprised of all the issues, may make a decision based 
upon the judgment of the day, and perhaps the applicant was 
not as forthcoming as that one individual should have been. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mistakes can be made.  At that point the applicant 
unfortunately has no further appeal process.  The applicant is 
then told that he or she no longer can file for refugee status in 
Canada and must go back to the country of origin. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1300"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT24"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT24"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1300

<A HREF="#LINKT23"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that point in time the adjudicator in this particular case 
may be sending an individual back to a circumstance that may well 
be a matter of life and death.  There are other countries in the 
world that do not appreciate human rights as much and as well as 
we do in this country.  We are perhaps sentencing this particular 
individual to life or non-life at that point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that there be another appeal process aside from 
the adjudication itself.  That appeal process is there but it is 
only a paper appeal.  When a paper appeal and not a verbal 
appeal is made, it is forwarded to the department and we do not 
know who in the department will be making the final decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My party is suggesting that if we are to go through this process 
we should allow the applicant to make an appeal in person.  We 
never know what types of information or omissions were not given 
initially to the adjudicator.  It is now only one person, not a 
board of three as before.  Let us have the opportunity to make a 
verbal appeal to the department.  It is a simple change that our 
party feels would enhance the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My second point deals with the clause that suggests that if a 
crime is being committed or has been committed and an individual 
who has landed immigrant status is accused and sentenced for that 
crime, it is immediate that the individual must then be deported 
back to the country of origin. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us walk through this closely.  We all know the process of 
immigration in this country.  People from all over the world have 
an opportunity to come to Canada.  Once they have been given 
landed immigrant status they have the opportunity to work, raise 
their families and educate their children.  They contribute to 
the community and to the taxation system of the country.  They 
can do that as a landed immigrant for as many years as they wish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A landed immigrant can make an application to become a Canadian 
citizen after living in Canada for three years.  If I were a 
landed immigrant I would make sure that after three years I would 
make such an application to become a citizen, but others do not. 
They decide for a lot of good reasons to simply retain their 
landed immigrant status.  People could in fact be landed 
immigrants for 20 to 30 years and contribute to our society in 
any number of ways but should they be charged and convicted of a 
crime after 20 years they could be deported because they are not 
Canadian citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our party says that if a crime is committed there have to be 
consequences, but we also believe that after three years as a 
landed immigrant, which is the timeline that it would normally 
take to make an application to become a Canadian citizen, an 
individual should have the opportunity to appeal.  We are simply 
talking about fairness and equality.  People who have been here 
and in fact have been Canadian citizens in everything but name 
only should have the opportunity to appeal their case.  We are 
talking about human beings.  We are talking about people, 
families and children who should have rights when they come to 
our borders and want to become members of our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I speak with some passion to the immigration laws.  I suspect 
most members in the House would be able to point to the fact that 
I would not be here if it were not for the immigration rules of 
this country when my grandfather immigrated here from another 
culture.  If he had not been allowed to come to this country, I 
would not have had the opportunity to stand in the House today as 
a representative in the parliament of this great country.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Fontana (London North Centre, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I appreciate the comments made by some members of the PC caucus. 
The member for Fundy—Royal was an active member of the committee 
and worked very closely with all members of the committee in a 
very co-operative way.  The issue I wish to comment on has to do 
with the appeal rights of landed immigrants who have been in this 
country for a number of years 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If in fact there was a serious criminality charge which caused a 
two year sentence, I want to assure the House that not only did 
we hear representations but the committee discussed this at some 
length.  We did not take the issue lightly at all.  The member 
who just spoke made the point that permanent residents who have 
been in this country for a great number of years may or may not 
choose to become Canadian citizens, that it is their decision. 
They are obviously fully engaged in Canadian society as they pay 
taxes, have families, have homes and so on.  Therefore there is 
an attachment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe there are a number of mechanisms before such a 
permanent resident would be removed from the country because of 
the serious criminality issue and they should be brought to the 
House for consideration.  The committee took the issue very 
seriously, debated it and discussed it to ensure that some of the 
things that have been mentioned would be taken into account.  The 
removal of permanent residents, regardless of whether they have 
been here for 3 years, 20 years or 25 years, and the significance 
and the attachment they have to this country should be taken into 
account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ensure that the House understands that while the 
amendment was worthy of consideration in committee deliberations 
and is worthy of consideration by the House, the decision to 
remove a permanent resident under those circumstances would not 
to be taken lightly.  The bill would ensure that these removal 
orders were issued by an independent adjudicator of the IRB at an 
admissibility hearing.  It would not be made by an immigration 
officer who would immediately move on a permanent resident who 
had been sentenced for more than two years.  There would be a 
hearing of some sort by the IRB where the issue would be dealt 
with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should also indicate that before the referral to the IRB a CIC 
senior official would consider personal circumstances such as 
family ties and attachment to the cultural language of their home 
country.  If people have been here for 15 or 20 years and for 
some reason, based on a serious criminality charge, they may be 
sent back to their home country, that home country may not have 
an attachment to them.  They may have been here as children and 
yet not as Canadian citizens.  Therefore we should take into 
account whether or not there is any cultural language attachment 
to their home country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to look at the immigration status and the length 
of time in Canada, as well as the type and nature of the crime. 
As we know, in the judiciary there is flexibility.  A two year 
sentence may in fact be a little different for some other crime. 
We would look to see if the crime was of a violent nature.  That 
must also be taken into account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The final decision to send the report to the immigration 
division would be taken by a senior official to ensure that all 
factors have been given due consideration.  In other words, it 
would be someone at the senior level.  Once they look at the 
permanent residence, the sentence that they have received, the 
personal attachment and the value that they have to this country 
then the official would take this issue under full consideration.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should mention that the IRB's decision is subject to judicial 
review.  If the judicial review upholds the removal order there 
would still be the opportunity to seek ministerial authorization 
to remain in Canada for humanitarian and compassionate reasons. 
The member for Fundy—Royal wanted to make sure that the IRB 
decision did have judicial review, that its decision would not be 
taken lightly and that it would be done by senior officials of 
CIC.  He also wanted to make sure the minister could ultimately 
review a case under humanitarian and compassionate grounds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment speaks to how we could ensure that permanent 
residents are protected and the value they have given to this 
country would not be taken lightly.  We have built in mechanisms 
that would not allow us to simply remove them from Canada on the 
basis of a charge without looking at their total contribution to 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We sometimes wonder about the value of citizenship.  As has been 
indicated, 80% of people who come to Canada move toward 
citizenship within three years.  Why should people become 
Canadian citizens?  These individuals realize that permanent 
residency does have status but citizenship offers more protection 
under the laws of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone knows that we cannot deport citizens.  Based on the 
bill, we may be able to remove permanent residents who have 
committed serious crimes or who have violated human rights and so 
on.  In the past people did not want to make a decision as to 
whether or not they needed to give up their citizenship in their 
home country when they came to Canada.  In one way this sends a 
message to those people that there is greater value to 
citizenship and that they ought to look at the additional 
protection they have as citizens of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Safeguards have been built into the system by the hard work of 
the minister, the committee and the member for Fundy—Royal. 
There is value to permanent residency.  We cannot just throw 
people out of the country if they run afoul of the law.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to speak to the report stage amendments to Bill C-11 
which have been spoken to previously by other members of our 
Conservative caucus and addressed very thoroughly by our critic 
for immigration, the member for Fundy—Royal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are discussing something that, quite frankly, I am surprised 
we would be discussing in this time, place and century.  I am 
referring to the deportation of Canadian citizens.  I fail to 
understand the logic behind deporting an individual to the 
country they came from who has declined to take out Canadian 
citizenship even though that person has been in Canada for 25, 
30, 40 or even 50 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have many friends and family members who have been permanent 
residents of Canada for 25 or 30 years.  They pay taxes and enjoy 
all the rights and privileges of a Canadian citizen except that 
they cannot hold public office.  That is the only difference. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1315"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT26"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Somehow we will say that an individual, after residing in the 
country 30, 40 or 50 years, does not have the same rights as any 
other Canadian.  Rather than sending them to prison for a 
criminal offence should they commit one, we would deport them to 
a country they may no longer have ties with.  That is not what 
being Canadian is about.  It is certainly not what I have always 
thought being Canadian is about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Amendment and appeal rights would be given to all who have 
maintained permanent resident status for a three year period 
before being the subject of a report under clause 44.  We have 
chosen a three year period to be consistent with the length of 
time one must be a permanent resident before applying for 
Canadian citizenship.  That to me is a straightforward, plain 
speaking, very smart amendment to this piece of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not trying to be flippant or frivolous.  We are not 
saying that one is given permanent resident status one day and 
deported the next.  We are saying that someone who has been here 
for three years has some rights of citizenship even if he or she 
has not applied for citizenship status. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However it takes away from the issue of permanent residents who 
have been here for 20 years.  There are not hundreds of them out 
there; there are thousands.  I would dare say that there are 
hundreds of thousands.  I do not expect that all of them will 
commit criminal offences.  However should that happen, surely in 
this nation and at this period in our history we would not deport 
them to a country to which they no longer have ties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What would Bill C-11 do?  As it is, Bill C-11 would deny an 
appeal to permanent residents who are the subject of a report 
under clause 44, which I just mentioned.   As a result of a 
single criminal sentencing, permanent residents could be deported 
without appeal and without consideration of their circumstances. 
I do not think anyone in this place is trying to justify criminal 
behaviour.  However under the law as we embrace it every Canadian 
has a right to appeal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would further that by saying every permanent resident who has 
been here longer than three years has a right to appeal.  It is a 
fundamental tenet of Canadian justice that if someone is accused 
of a crime or even sentenced for a crime then he or she has a 
right to appeal the judgment.  I am not a lawyer and do not 
pretend to be.  However that is a fundamental tenet of fair play 
and justice.  We should surely be no stranger to that in the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This would include people who have lived here since infancy, 
which may be for 20, 30, 40 or 50 years.  Immigration officers 
would be solely responsible for deciding whether deportation of 
permanent residents is appropriate.  Many permanent residents 
have children who were born in Canada and are Canadian citizens 
even though the parents may not have obtained Canadian 
citizenship because, quite frankly, they do not need to. They can 
enjoy all the fruits and benefits of Canadian society except for 
and precluding the holding of public office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are the rules as we have defined and made them.  To say 
that people can be deported without the right of appeal because 
they have been sentenced to a crime is surely a mistake.  Once 
the decision is made the wheels of enforcement turn and there is 
no review of the officer's discretionary decision.

<A HREF="#LINKT27"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all the talk of the department that the decisions are taken 
seriously and that there will be safeguards to prevent the 
inappropriate deportation of long term residents, the legislation 
does not provide those safeguards.  The legislation speaks of the 
possibility of safeguards but there is no safeguard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am amazed when the department speaks of an adjudicator making 
the tribunal decision and of the subsequent possibility of 
judicial review.  It is only with respect to whether the 
permanent resident's conviction and sentence were proper.   We 
are not appealing it.  We are not taking a second look at it. We 
are asking if it is correct. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no jurisdiction for the tribunal or the federal court 
to look behind the decision to proceed with enforcement.  What 
has been lost by taking away the appeal division's jurisdiction 
is one of the most fundamentally important parts of Bill C-11. 
While it may be necessary to remove individuals who renege on the 
responsibilities that come with having status in Canada, and 
specifically Canadian citizenship, for reasons of fundamental 
justice we need to give them a real opportunity to appeal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That does not take away from the importance of recognizing that 
a country should have the ability to deport residents who are not 
citizens.  However we need to take into account that there is a 
difference between someone who has been here three or four years 
and someone who has been here thirty or forty years.  We need to 
rethink whether we are back in the days of Britain when they sent 
their convicts to Australia.  Is that where we have gone? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will deportation all of a sudden be one of the chief tenets of 
the Canadian justice system?  Can we deport people because they 
have committed crimes?  Let us take a look at what the crime is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Fontana:</B>  A serious crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy:</B>  What is a serious crime?  There is too 
much leeway in the bill.  It gives the final say to review 
officers who may not have the clear credentials to make these 
decisions.  It does this without appeal.  It seems to me, based 
on the tenets of Canadian society as I understand them, that is 
not the Canadian way.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis Mills (Toronto—Danforth, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I want to be on the record on this piece of legislation.  I come 
from a downtown urban riding in Toronto where immigration matters 
represent a large amount of my constituency work.  I like the 
member's amendment.  I too believe that someone who has spent 25 
or 30 years of his or her life in Canada is virtually Canadian 
and should be treated as such. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding I have a lot of people from different communities. 
When these people initially came to Canada their facility with 
the language was such that they were almost apprehensive in 
approaching the department of immigration to put their personal 
files in order.  For the last number of years they have been hard 
working, constructive Canadians in every way, shape or form 
except for that piece of paper.

<A HREF="#LINKT28"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must remember that 40 years ago, when Toronto had a large 
influx of people from every part of the world, it was not an 
uncommon experience.  In those days there was such fear of 
dealing with the Government of Canada that we had mobile 
citizenship vans.  We would send public servants and judges out 
into the community to try to lower the apprehension of Canadians 
so they would come forward and put their personal files in order. 
I am hoping our colleagues on this side of the House can rethink 
that section of the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are in the final days of this session of parliament before we 
go back to work in our constituencies for the summer.  I would 
bring to the attention of not only members of the House but 
officials in the department of immigration, not just in Ottawa 
but in every region of the country and every embassy around the 
world, the important world youth days event which the department 
of immigration will be dealing with next summer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The department will begin preparing for world youth days as we 
take our break this summer.  As of the middle of July the world 
youth days website will be receiving information from registrants 
from every country on the planet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the very special initiatives under the leadership of the 
current minister of immigration was that for the first time ever 
we have had a visa waiver fee for an event like this one.  It was 
a decision of the whole House of Commons to support this 
important initiative.  It will bring a million plus young people 
between the ages of 16 and 30 to Canada, to Toronto, where all 
will celebrate the values of sharing and caring for each other. 
The House of Commons supported the notion that a visa waiver fee 
be put in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that when a bill like this one is on the floor of the 
House officials monitor and read the proceedings.  I would say 
not only to all members but to everyone in the Department of 
Citizenship and Immigration that it is a very special moment for 
Canada when we can reach out to young people from every part of 
the world and welcome them to our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quite often the experience people have when they go into an 
embassy or are interviewed by an immigration officer can set the 
tone for how they feel toward Canada, their place of destiny. 
Many of these young people will be coming abroad for their first 
time to a strange country and it will be very important that our 
officials abroad make them feel they are welcome in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would say to all members of the House that over the last two 
months the support and execution of this project have been very 
special.

the bill in Toronto next July.  I want not only to participate 
in debate on the bill but also to say that we need to review the 
section that deals with retroactivity.  I ask for the indulgence 
of the House to support all immigration officials that will be 
asking for counsel on this special event. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as Citizenship and Immigration Canada goes, it will be 
the largest processing event in the history of the country.  It 
will be five times the size of the Olympics, should we be blessed 
with the Olympics in the middle of July.  They at least have 
seven years to plan it.  We in the House, along with all the 
various departments, have a year.  I appreciate being given the 
opportunity to put these thoughts on the record.

</I></B></P><P align=left>She said: Mr. Speaker, I recognize my colleague's usual 
courtesy. They want me to be the first one to talk. We are now 
discussing the third group of amendments accepted by the Chair 
to improve Bill C-11. I am forced to admit that the government is 
convinced that Bill C-11 is nothing short of perfect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, this is not what we heard when we went to the big 
cities that receive immigrants and refugees. 
Ninety-nine per cent of those involved said that people are very 
concerned about how this act will be applied, even more so 
because there are no regulations associated with the act. 
Regulations will be drafted later on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fortunately, we managed to obtain that the bill would stipulate 
that the regulations will be tabled in the House and referred to 
a committee. It is a start. However, as for the amendment that 
the government should not adopt any regulations before obtaining 
an opinion, it seems that it has not been accepted since the 
governor in council will have the power to give effect to the 
regulations as soon as they are tabled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are three amendments in the last group, since one was not 
accepted. The first amendment, the one I am proposing, is 
designed to put pressure on the Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that it takes a lot of time to deal with refugee cases. 
People have complained about it. Some refugee claimants have to 
wait for months and sometimes for years before they know where 
they stand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the federal government is like most people: a bit of 
pressure helps. If no decision has been made on a claim 90 days 
after it has been filed, my amendment would require the federal 
government to assume the social and medical costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that Quebec is generous. Members need only look at the 
number of people who decide to live in Quebec when they claim 
refugee status. It is clear that the future mirrors the past.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, on the one hand, we hear the minister say that the 
process should be more rapid and, on the other, the measures in 
the bill include, for example, the elimination of the appeal or 
a second refugee claim. We might also need a penalty of some 
kind. When a contractor does not abide by a contract, there are 
penalties. Essentially, that is what we are suggesting, a kind 
of penalty for the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also tend to agree with the second amendment, which has been 
moved by my Progressive Conservative colleague. 
He proposes that part of the bill not apply and that a claim for 
refugee protection “be referred to the Refugee Protection 
Division for a new determination where the relevant 
circumstances of the claimant have changed since a previous 
determination, or specific circumstances prevented part of the 
evidence from being presented during a previous determination”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think it will be hard for me to convince hon. members 
that an individual's circumstances can change very rapidly.  We 
have recently learned of the terrible shooting in Nepal, which 
wiped out the entire royal family.  What is going to happen 
there now?  We do not know, but a week ago things in Nepal were 
relatively quiet, according to our viewpoint from this side of 
the world. 
This is therefore a recognition that, in the real world, 
individuals' circumstances can change dramatically.  The 
amendment by my hon. colleague from the Progressive Conservative 
Party is aimed at acknowledging this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can we believe that the government is going to support this 
amendment?  If it does what it usually does, I think it will say 
no.  That is its specialty, moreover.  If one is convinced that 
what one already has is total perfection, why say yes to any 
changes?  Yet we are told that the purpose of the opposition in 
a debate is to improve bills.  That is all very fine on paper, 
but in reality we have trouble proving it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last amendment I presented is what certain of my Liberal 
colleagues would term a cosmetic amendment.  It is not really 
that, for it states as follows: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(<I>b</I>) is determined to be inadmissible on grounds of serious 
criminality with respect to a conviction in Canada for an 
offence that, if committed in Canada, would constitute an 
offence under an Act of Parliament punishable by a maximum term 
of imprisonment of at least 10 years; 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill speaks of a term of imprisonment of at least ten years, 
but here we are speaking of a maximum term of imprisonment of at 
least ten years.  Hon. members will grasp the difference.  To us 
it is a very important one, as we do not, of course, want to 
keep major criminals in this country, yet we do believe that a 
minimum of justice needs to be applied, and that the terms must 
be clear.  Amendment No. 12 is intended as a clarification to 
clause 112(3)(<I>b</I>). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly, Bill C-12 is going to be passed before the summer recess. 
It is also clear that summer in the House of Commons will begin 
before June 21.  I think it a great shame that this is 
preventing us as parliamentarians and as individuals from taking 
decisions which could make the Immigration Act, which, let us 
remember, is already 25 years old, this being its first 
overhaul, a piece of legislation whose purpose would truly be to 
help hundreds of thousands of people, many thousands of 
families.  Yet the government wants to pass the bill as is.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find this disturbing.  One wonders whether the government 
listened to the various stakeholders who shared their views with 
the committee.  The people who appeared before us are competent 
individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those who testified included the Canadian Bar Association and 
the Canadian Council for Refugees.  We also heard from 
academics, researchers, and community groups, who are daily 
trying to meet the basic needs of people who have applied for 
refugee status, immigrants who are arriving in a new environment 
and who need help in getting properly settled in Canada and in 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is as though the government had decided, from its lofty 
perch, that all these fine people knew nothing, had seen 
nothing, and were incapable of analyzing a situation or showing 
any logic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this bill is any indication, logic which is coupled with a 
sense of humanity must frustrate this government.  We on the 
opposition benches believe strongly in logic, but we believe 
just as strongly in a sense of humanity, generosity and openness 
to the world at large. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not too late.  If, by chance, the government were to pass 
the 11 amendments under consideration today, that would already 
be a step forward.  Right now, I will not be able to take 
such a step.  I must take my seat.

<P><A NAME="LINK48"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Fontana (London North Centre, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I want to apologize.  I think that last week I might have 
referred to the member as being from Laval East or Laval West.  I 
want to make sure that it is Laval Centre and she is in the 
centre politically also. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before she leaves the Chamber I want to give her some good news. 
The government will support her Motion No. 12, her amendment, 
because we believe that the motion introduced by the member is a 
technical amendment to ensure that serious criminality as defined 
in this section of the bill is consistent with serious 
criminality as defined in subclause 36(1).  We believe that this 
amendment does not change the definition of serious criminality 
or substantively alter the amendment made by the standing 
committee to this clause, because again the member will know that 
we have discussed this issue beforehand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We appreciate the fact that the amendment made by the member for 
Laval Centre further clarifies the government's intent.  We are 
prepared to approve it, just as we have seen in committee when 
the member for Fundy—Royal came up with a good amendment and we 
approved it, and the Alliance critic's, so the committee has been 
very open. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make one final comment as it relates to what the 
member for Laval Centre talked about in terms of Canada being 
generous and compassionate.  I want to reiterate what I think all 
the members of the committee heard.  Throughout the country all 
of our witnesses were proud of the country's heritage, of its 
proud culture and proud historical contribution toward Canada's 
generosity in terms of refugee protection around the world.  Ours 
is one of four countries in the world that takes in refugees, is 
compassionate and understanding of their persecution, of their 
plight, sometimes in their countries.  Our country is one of the 
most generous on a per capita basis of the number of refugees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill continues to talk about Canada's historical record, 
about the fact that we believe that Canada has a part to play in 
trying to resettle some refugees who are being persecuted, around 
the world.  The bill will make it easier for refugees to be 
processed through the system.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of changes in Bill C-11 that will allow for 
quicker adjudication and decision making by single panel refugee 
board members, by ensuring that the system works really well, 
especially for those who are in limbo.  We have heard of cases 
where people are still here after eight or nine years but because 
of documentation problems or a number of different situations 
they cannot be permanent residents even though they have been 
given refugee protection.  There have been some very positive 
amendments put forward on Bill C-11 which will make the situation 
a lot better than it is today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to tell the member for Laval Centre that the 
committee has moved on the issue of rehearing a denied refugee 
claim where there are changed circumstances.  Perhaps there was 
violence in the relationship but the woman could not bring it 
forward during an IRB hearing because her spouse was there and 
she was afraid.  We have made it possible, thanks to the good 
work of the committee, to ensure that those facts are reheard by 
the IRB.  While it is not a revolving door or a second kick at 
the can in terms of a second appeal or a second refugee claim, we 
appreciate that sometimes there are circumstances that could not 
be brought up in the first hearing, and under the bill, those 
changed circumstances would be heard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would hope that the member for Laval Centre as well as my 
other colleagues on the committee appreciate that some of their 
hard work is found in the amendments to Bill C-11 that they and 
members of the government have proposed.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise on behalf of the people of 
Surrey Central to participate in the report stage debate, Group 
No. 3, on Bill C-11, an act respecting immigration to Canada and 
the granting of refugee protection.  I will address my remarks 
with respect to the four motions in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 9 in regard to the refugee protection section of the 
bill is a Bloc amendment.  It adds new clause 95.1, which states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister shall assume the social and medical costs of refugee 
claimants as of the ninetieth day after the day of the claim and 
until a decision is made in respect of that claim. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since social and medical costs are under provincial jurisdiction 
and immigration is under federal jurisdiction, and because of the 
federal government's mismanagement of the refugee claims and the 
inefficient refugee claim process, why should the provinces bear 
the cost?  It seems logical, even though the separatist Bloc 
member may have meant to show patriotism toward Quebec, but it is 
not fair to assume that the provinces can afford the entire cost 
of relocation and the medical expenses of refugees who are not 
yet permanent residents, landed immigrants or citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance, through our chief critic for immigration, 
the hon. member for Dauphin—Swan River, moved the amendment that 
the minister shall consult with the municipality with respect to 
resettlement for immigrants and integration programs where 
applicable.  This amendment was not accepted by the Liberal 
government's immigration committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should be encouraging open and accountable 
discussion among CIC, Health Canada, HRDC and DFAIT as well as 
the provinces and the non-government organizations related to 
immigration.  Rather than a co-operative approach, the arrogant, 
weak Liberal government always uses a confrontational approach 
with the provinces and territories.  We should work with the 
provinces for policies on the settlement of immigrants.  The 
Liberals are again are missing that opportunity in the bill.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In regard to Motion No. 10, in the convention refugee and 
persons in need of protection clause, this Tory amendment will 
add, after the end of paragraph 1 of clause 101: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—Subparagraph (1)(b) does not apply— 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a claim for protection by the claimant has been 
rejected by the board. 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—and a claim for refugee protection shall be referred to the 
Refugee Protection Division for a new determination where: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(a) the relevant circumstances of the claimant have changed since 
a previous determination; or 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(b) specific circumstances prevented part of the evidence from 
being presented during a previous determination. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, new evidence should be one of the very few grounds to 
create a new hearing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Motion No. 11 the Tory amendment again deals with procedure 
for appeal to the refugee appeal division.  In subclause 110(3) 
it proposes to delete the following the refugee appeal division 
shall proceed without a hearing, on the basis of the record of 
the proceedings of the refugee protection division, and may 
accept written submissions from the minister, the person.  Then 
the clause continues.  The amendment proposes to replace that 
with the refugee appeal division may proceed with a hearing 
where new evidence may be introduced, the record of the 
proceedings of the refugee protection division is used, and 
submissions may be made by the minister, the person.  Then the 
clause continues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The original clause supports a closed system and hinders the 
accountability and fairness of the act.  This amendment will make 
the procedure allow a hearing to introduce new evidence instead 
of disallowing the hearing based on the record of proceedings of 
the refugee protection division. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill does not respect rule of law.  Many witnesses, even 
including lawyers, told the committee that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 12 is a Bloc amendment that deals with pre-removal 
risk assessment.  Under protection in paragraph 112(3)(b), the 
bill states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(3) Refugee protection may not result from an application for 
protection if the person 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(b) is determined to be inadmissible 
on grounds of serious criminality with respect to a conviction in 
Canada punished by a term of imprisonment of at least two years 
or with respect to a conviction outside Canada that, if committed 
in Canada, would be punishable by a term of imprisonment of at 
least 10 years— 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lines six to eight of that paragraph would be replaced by: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—Canada for an offence that, if committed in Canada, would 
constitute an offence under an Act of Parliament punishable by a 
maximum term of imprisonment of at least 10 years— 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This amendment is a little complicated.  It is an extension and 
it clarifies the original wording.  A part of this amendment is 
just a housekeeping correction and the other deals with the 
length of term of conviction to justify the magnitude of 
criminality outside Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This part is so serious and important, particularly in light of 
the recent reports that more than 200,000 people are staying in 
Canada illegally.  About 15,000 people or more are under 
deportation warrants, according to the Auditor General of Canada. 
They are supposed to be deported, but they are still in Canada 
and they are missing.  Also, I am—

Roger Cyr, long time president of the Hong Kong Veterans' 
Association and a tireless and successful advocate for veterans' 
rights, who passed away on May 26. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Out of one of the most tragic events during World War II comes a 
story of heroism and determination.  After Hong Kong fell to the 
Japanese, roughly 1,200 Canadian soldiers were forced into slave 
labour for almost four years.  Roger Cyr made it his personal 
goal to see that every one of these soldiers was compensated for 
his unjust treatment and eventually the Canadian government did 
just that.  It paid them an average of $22,000 for their forced 
labour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During Remembrance Day ceremonies in 1998, Mr. Cyr had the 
unprecedented honour of standing beside Governor General Roméo 
LeBlanc during the march past of veterans and took the salute. 
He deserved a salute from his comrades then, just as he deserves 
to be recognized and remembered by all Canadians today.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Robert Bertrand (Pontiac—Gatineau—Labelle, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
June 28 will be a big day for the Canadian Armed Forces. 
General Maurice Baril, Chief of Defence Staff, is retiring after 
a 40 year military career which has brought him to the uppermost 
echelons of the Canadian military hierarchy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are so many highlights to his career that I could never 
list them all in my brief statement.  I will limit myself to the 
pinnacle of his career, promotion to the position of Chief of 
Defence Staff, on September 17, 1997. 
That promotion was ample evidence of the value of Maurice Baril. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During my two years as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister 
of National Defence, I had the immense privilege of contact with 
this exceptional man, who became a friend.  I was struck right 
from the start by his sense of organization and leadership, and 
particularly by his great human qualities.  A humble and modest 
man, he inspired confidence in his troops. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>General Baril, all members of this House join with me in

destined for human consumption.  We still do not have a ban on 
food and confectionery products containing beef byproducts from 
countries where BSE has been detected.  There is still no ban on 
the use of potentially infected deer and elk in rendering plants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government seems to be trying to do the absolute minimum

to consult with all the members to make sure we can provide that 
advice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Marshall decision the supreme court ruling clearly said 
there was a right to a commercial fishery.  We are following the

the only industrial country in the world where the national

some $10 billion Canadian per year to public transit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the Minister of Finance now follow the lead in the United

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

tongue today.  He is not responding to questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will ask him again.  Every year the Minister of Finance 
collects some $5 billion on excise taxes and GST from gasoline 
and diesel fuel and yet puts very little of it back into public 
transit in Canada, which reduces smog and is good for the 
environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the Minister of Finance now initiate a tax credit or tax

and are now at a record high. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time I will admit that the real gross domestic 
product in Canada grew at an annualized rate of 2.5%.  That is

</I></B></P><P align=left>The average increase in the cost of living of Canadian seniors 
has skyrocketed.  Fuel costs to heat their homes have gone up. 
Weekly grocery costs have gone up.  Gas prices have gone up.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, if we look at what was done in budget 2000, after a long 
delay brought in by the previous government we reindexed all the 
benefits in the Canadian benefit system.  The prime beneficiaries 
of that are Canadian seniors and those who are on fixed incomes.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise 
to present another petition from people in the Peterborough area 
who would like to see VIA Rail service re-established between 
Peterborough and Toronto. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petition aims at improving the environment by reducing 
greenhouse emissions and accidents on the highways.  It is hoped 
to strengthen Peterborough as a business, educational and tourism 
centre.  It has support all along the route in federal ridings 
like Haliburton—Victoria—Brock, Durham, Whitby—Ajax, 
Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge, Markham, Scarborough—Rouge River, 
Hastings—Frontenac—Lennox and Addington. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to say that the petition has already resulted in a

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have 
another petition from citizens in Peterborough who are concerned 
about the continuation of sanctions in Iraq.  This is an issue of 
great interest in Peterborough.  It has resulted in a weekly 
vigil at my office among people including people who are of Iraqi 
origin, now Canadians, and people who visited Iraq.  They are 
concerned about the condition of poor people in Iraq, 
particularly the children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners call upon parliament to accept the 
recommendation of the foreign affairs committee for the lifting 
of sanctions and the establishment of a diplomatic presence in 
Baghdad.  They call for serious peace negotiations and they urge 
that Canada persuade the UN committee to quickly approve funds 
for the rebuilding of water, electric power and all production 
infrastructure.  They ask that the compensation fund taken from 
the oil for food program be suspended.

in my riding and elsewhere who draw to the attention of the House 
their displeasure with the government for disbanding the coast 
guard dive team which operated out of Richmond, British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The removal of the dive team causes the public to be put at 
risk.  The fact that the coast guard dive team was disbanded may 
have contributed to the death of Paul Sandhu.  The petitioners 
believe that more lives could be lost if the dive team remains 
disbanded.  They call on the government to reinstate the dive 
team.

pursuant to Standing Order 36 I am presenting a petition signed 
by approximately 200 residents of my riding.  They know that 
approximately 3,500 to 4,000 Canadians die each year by suicide 
and they are calling on parliament to pass legislation that would 
create a national suicide prevention strategy.

Speaker, I am pleased to present yet another petition from 
Canadians concerned about the state of our health care system, 
the inaction of the government to stop the trend and the move 
toward two tier health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The citizens who have signed the petition are concerned about 
the shortage of nurses, the backlog in emergency rooms and the 
lack of access to necessary medical treatment.  They call on the 
government to take immediate action to save public health care in 
Canada and to stop two tier American style health care from 
coming to Canada.

following petition to the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners draw the attention of the House to the fact that 
Great Gulf Homes Inc. is in the process of destroying a priceless 
wetland habitat on the Mimico marsh in Brampton, thus endangering 
birds, trees and wetland species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners call upon parliament to lead the provincial and 
municipal governments in the preservation and restoration of the 
wetland site by co-ordinating public and social processes to turn 
over the lands to the public trust.

petitions on behalf of the constituents of 
Battlefords—Lloydminster. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first one calls for a reinstatement of the strychnine levels 
of poisoning that we used to use on our gophers.  It is an 
epidemic this year, with the drought as well.  They are growing

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>IMMIGRATION AND REFUGEE PROTECTION ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK234">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of Bill C-11, an act respecting 
immigration to Canada and the granting of refugee protection to 
persons who are displaced, persecuted or in danger, as reported 
(with amendment) from the committee, and of the motions in Group 
No. 3. 
<P><A NAME="LINK235"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, before question period I was debating the three 
important motions in Group No. 3 at report stage of Bill C-11. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The situation with respect to immigration in Canada is very 
serious.  About 200,000 people, according to different reports, 
are illegally staying in Canada.  According to the auditor 
general, 15,000 people are named in deportation warrants and they 
are missing.  Also, 60% of visitors who apply for refugee status 
in Canada arrive at Canadian ports without any kind of 
documentation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian borders are like sieves.  We do not have exit control. 
CIC cannot track those who are missing or are staying illegally 
in Canada.  The situation is very serious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since this is the last group of motions in amendment at report 
stage of Bill C-11 we are missing the opportunity to debate many 
worthwhile amendments, many of which were put forward by the 
chief critic for the Canadian Alliance, the hon. member for 
Dauphin—Swan River.  The amendments related to consultation by 
CIC with the provinces, municipalities and other NGOs.  They were 
related to family reunification and one dealt with once in a 
lifetime sponsorship by a Canadian citizen of related family 
members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were also amendments related to foreign academic degrees, 
to refugees, the discriminatory head tax, the appeal process and 
various aspects of the refugee process.  The whole appeal process 
is just like the layers of an onion.  We can keep on peeling it. 
We need to streamline the appeal process.  Since the government 
has not been particularly interested in stressing the appeal 
process it could only be done through amendment, and the 
amendments were not accepted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other amendments would have fixed the outdated 40 year old 
health standards in Canada.  The standards are so old and 
incomprehensible that we need to fix them.  Those amendments were 
not accepted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were amendments related to improving communication among 
CIC, CSIS, RCMP, the Department of Foreign Affairs, the 
Department of International Trade and various NGOs involved in 
immigration work. There is no communication.  The minister 
believes that she knows better or more than expert advisers from 
various organizations like CSIS. 
That is probably the reason the Minister of Foreign Affairs and 
the Minister for International Cooperation attended the Tamil 
tiger fundraising.

patronage appointments.  All these amendments—

he has had a generous allotment of time.  I know the Chair has 
been quite lenient.  I am afraid his time has expired. 
<P><A NAME="LINK236"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, this is an important group of amendments at report stage 
of Bill C-11.  They pertain specifically to the parts of the bill 
dealing with refugees and refugee sponsorships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We spent a considerable amount of time on this section in 
committee.  We heard from many Canadians who work directly in the 
field of refugee sponsorship and helping displaced persons.  They 
ensure that Canada, as has been the case in the past, is a place 
of refuge, a place of safety for people confronted with 
political, economic or social persecution and conditions that are 
unacceptable from the point of view of any notion of being a 
civilized society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our main focus in this section was to try to ensure that Canada 
continued to be a place of refuge and respectful of our 
humanitarian and compassionate consideration of such cases around 
the globe.  There was some progress.  The bill took into account 
some of the concerns of organizations involved in refugee 
sponsorship and moved from Bill C-31 to Bill C-11 with some 
significant changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also know that during the course of committee hearings the 
government heard further concerns and made a few changes. However 
there are some significant areas of concern that remain and need 
to be addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments before the House today attempt to do that.  We 
tried to do our part at committee with dozens of amendments 
pertaining to refugee sponsorship and refugee protection that 
were not adopted by the government and regretfully were 
disregarded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our fundamental concern is that Canada should use this 
opportunity to ensure that we are fully in compliance with 
international conventions pertaining to refugees and torture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee heard from numerous groups that are very expert 
and knowledgeable in this field.  They told us that Canada 
through the bill is still not fully compliant with our 
international obligations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a terrible shame that in 2001, at this opportune moment 
when we have a window to overhaul our immigration and refugee 
act, we are not taking advantage of this opportunity. Something 
with which we will have to deal over the next number of years and 
will remain a challenge is how we convince the government of the 
day to actually take these obligations seriously and act on them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was clearly stated to us by numerous organizations that 
Canada is not doing its part.  The chair of the committee rose in 
the House today to speak about Canada's work on the international 
front and our role in terms of refugee protection and suggested 
that Canada was one of four countries that is outstanding in this 
regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I want to say that is not enough.  Second, that account 
of the situation does not fully consider the advice and 
information we received from many groups.  We were told quite 
clearly that we remain negligent in our duties as the Parliament 
of Canada and have not fully acted on the requirements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We made some suggestions that we addressed this morning and 
afternoon such as the right of a refugee to make a second claim 
regardless of whether there were new circumstances or new 
information. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1530"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT54"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT54"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1530

<A HREF="#LINKT53"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite what we have heard today, the amendments we proposed to 
allow second claims were not adopted and the advice was not 
considered.  That continues to constitute a serious burden on 
some refugees and has a disproportionate impact on women in 
particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On that point, we were successful in convincing the government 
to agree with our amendment to conduct a gender analysis of the 
bill within two years of the proclamation of the act.  That 
offers us some consolation and sense of fulfilment to know that 
at some point the government will do what it ought to have done 
leading up to the introduction of this bill, and that is a gender 
analysis.  It is something the government promised would be done 
with respect to every bill introduced in the House.  It promised 
there would always be a gender analysis and that it would always 
take into account the disproportionate impact of any law, program 
or policy on women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear from the advice we received during the hearings that 
the government did not do a thorough gender analysis of Bill 
C-11.  Women continue to face a disproportionate impact as a 
result of many provisions of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of those provisions has to do with the ability to make 
another claim after being turned down, regardless of whether 
there are new circumstances.  Women are often not in a position 
to tell their whole story.  The trauma they have experienced 
cannot necessarily be communicated to their families for risk of 
losing the family.  They often cannot tell their whole story for 
cultural reasons.  They must sometimes live in silence after a 
terrible and traumatic incident, with no recourse and no way of 
getting the attention of officials to ensure that their situation 
and the status of their family is recognized and that they are 
able to find refuge in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was clear to us from the outset that, especially in the case 
of women, there had to be an opportunity to make a second claim. 
There had to be a way for women to tell their stories when it was 
appropriate and when provisions were made for keeping their 
stories as private as possible.  We have not addressed that 
situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government says it has made changes that make it a bit 
better.  Yes, there are a few things that make it a bit better. 
However by and large we have not allowed for a genuine process 
whereby refugees who cannot tell their whole story or who must 
relive an ordeal are able to seek the attention of officials and 
get refugee status in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To help refugees make their stay in Canada a productive one, it 
is clear to us that the government must do more in terms of 
sponsoring and assisting groups that care for and nurture refugee 
families who come to Canada.  There is an enormous number of 
groups here which give all their volunteer time, energies and 
resources to sponsoring refugees and refugee families from all 
over the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my constituency one that comes to mind is the North End 
Sponsorship Team, otherwise known as NEST, a group that has 
devoted the last 15 years to sponsoring some 60 refugees and 
refugee families from four different continents.  This 
organization, made up of the Lutheran and United churches, is 
prepared to take on high risk cases and refugees with large 
families.  It is prepared to do the work that other groups are 
not always prepared to do, and its efforts need to be recognized 
and supported. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a province like Manitoba, were it not for the work of the 
church community, private sponsorships and the provincial nominee 
program of the provincial government, there would be no increase 
in immigrants and refugees coming to our province.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That indicates the failure of federal government policy and this 
legislation to ensure we are able to continually attract 
newcomers to every part of the country and to compete 
internationally in attracting immigrants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we begin by addressing the fundamental issues of refugee 
status, the right to make a second claim, adequate documents and 
compliance with international covenants and agreements on 
refugees and torture, we will have done a great service. 
Unfortunately that is not the case as the bill stands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I plead with members on all sides of the House, but mainly with 
government members who have failed to get the message, to act as 
soon as possible to address these concerns. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK237"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron (Fundy—Royal, PC):</B> Madam Speaker, I would 
like to congratulate my colleague from Winnipeg Centre, who is 
the NDP immigration critic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now it is my turn to give my party's position at report stage of 
Bill C-11, on Group No. 3, which includes Motions Nos. 9, 10 and 
12. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a point of fact that the country is not a big Lethbridge, 
a big Baie-Comeau, a big Hampton, New Brunswick, or even a big 
Winnipeg.  It is a multicultural, pluralistic society that we 
have been able to build together and garner collectively as one 
of the most fabulous places to live.  The country we have been 
able to build reflects values that all Canadians share quite 
dearly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are a country that relies heavily on immigration, values 
human rights and is one of four principal countries that receives 
convention refugees.  The bill does not reflect the objectives or 
values that Canadians share with respect to immigration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard Liberal government members give testimony before 
Canadians across the country about alterations that were required 
with respect to this flawed bill.  However when it came to the 
clause by clause stage we were only able to garner modest 
augmentations to the bill instead of making it a pioneering piece 
of legislation of which we could be proud. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a lawyer I know that the House has probably heard that the 
Canadian Bar Association has difficulty with a number of issues 
with respect to the legislation.  It is not only the Canadian Bar 
Association.  Liberal colleagues, along with all four opposition 
parties, have a problem with the bill as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The party of Pearson, Trudeau and Wilfrid Laurier now seems to 
be the most reticent to protect the rights of refugees and 
immigrants.  I will quote from the immigration committee chair, 
the hon. member for London North Centre, when he stated “It is 
lucky that I do not have to vote”.  Referring to the opposition, 
he said “When they start sounding more Liberal than we do, I get 
concerned”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The chair had a very open approach at the committee level.  He 
was very encouraging with respect to opposition members and we 
were able to earn some improvements.  However it is not a 
pioneering bill.  That is why it is being panned in urban Canada 
in particular, which for the most part has been the great 
reservoir for new Canadians.  That is a fact.  That is what we 
must live with when we pass a bill that is not pioneering.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I will speak to a couple of the amendments before us that would 
augment that aspect.  The Progressive Conservative Party will 
support the Bloc motion de mon cher collègue de Laval Centre 
which reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister shall assume the social and medical costs of refugee 
claimants at the ninetieth day after the day of the claim and 
until a decision is made in respect of that claim. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion says that refugee claimants whose claims have not 
been processed would have social and medical coverage while they 
await a decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Essentially the amendment by the hon. member for Laval Centre 
advocates that we not let these people live in limbo in 
perpetuity.  We must address the issue, particularly when there 
are children and vulnerable populations involved or if someone is 
sick and a potential refugee.  It is a very noble gesture that my 
colleague in the Bloc has put forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will skip to the 12th motion, also put forward by the Bloc. By 
adding the word maximum, the motion would clarify the 
imprisonment threshold for the potential removal of a permanent 
resident.  Some may call this a housekeeping issue but it would 
give us an opportunity to raise the fact that the government is 
stripping the appeal rights of permanent residents which, as I 
said before, is un-Liberal, un-Canadian and draconian.  Other 
individuals have used that terminology before I did as a member 
of the Progressive Conservative Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two other motions in this group to which I will refer, 
in particular Motion No. 10.  I thank my friend and colleague 
from Winnipeg, the NDP critic on immigration.  I also pay tribute 
to the member for Winnipeg South Centre who was the catalyst for 
us to improve the second appeal issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members know as I do that the protection of refugee rights is 
the protection of human rights.  If we get it wrong people could 
die.  If we get it wrong people could be persecuted or face 
injury.  That is why it is imperative that we get it right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Approximately 25% of appeals granted to refugees are approved. 
That is because we do not get it right the first time.  There is 
a massive envelope that we miss the first time around.  Although 
different, it is the same issue.  We want to add an amendment 
which members on both sides of the House supported.  We got 
almost a semi-compromise amendment from the member for Winnipeg 
South Centre who helped the NDP critic, the Bloc critic and 
myself.  I am quite sure the critic for the Canadian Alliance was 
on board for the motion as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not saying that we would have a new claim for all 
refugees on a second appeal.  It would only be if the relevant 
circumstances of the claimant had changed since the previous 
determination or if specific circumstances had prevented part of 
the evidence from being presented during a previous 
determination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the issue.  Let us suppose a person comes to Canada and 
is granted refugee status because his or her country of origin is 
at war.  The person goes home and, a few years later, because of 
the country's volatility, the situation changes.  Under existing 
legislation that person would not have the right to a second 
claim in his or her lifetime.  That is a fact.  That is what is 
wrong and that is what we are trying to fix.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will try to dovetail the remarks of my NDP colleague who had 
the advantage of going before me.  This amendment is very 
anti-woman as well.  In this circumstance it could be possible 
that there would be reasons for women who had been persecuted or 
sexually assaulted not wanting to bring forth that evidence on 
their first appeal.  Only later would that information came to 
fruition.  That is an example where the evidence was not deduced 
at that time.  That person should have the right to a second 
appeal as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-11 could have been a good bill.  It is framework 
legislation that we got wrong.  We are not protecting refugees 
from persecution and possible death and injury.  That is why the 
Progressive Conservative Party will not be supporting it, 
however, I ask all members to support that motion in particular. 
<P><A NAME="LINK238"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurbax Malhi (Bramalea—Gore—Malton—Springdale, 
Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am happy to see the government is 
doing broad based consultations on various immigrant issues.  I 
invite the federal government in the course of these 
consultations to discuss with the provinces the issue of 
expansion of family class to include brothers and sisters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, with regard to the recognition and accreditation of an 
immigrant's professional degree, this issue falls under 
provincial jurisdiction.  This is why I encourage the provinces 
to come together and create a national standard, making the 
degree recognition standard across the country.  Only with a 
national standard on degree accreditation can skilled and 
hardworking immigrants be attracted to Canada and succeed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, in regard to sponsorship relationships that fall apart 
as a result of divorce, there are many cases and circumstances 
when a couple's marriage ends in divorce because of abuse of 
false immigration conditions.  I encourage the government to 
ensure that Bill C-11 has conditions to protect the vulnerable, 
and encourage those individuals who find themselves in this type 
of situation to automatically report the matter to the Department 
of Citizenship and Immigration so that a proper investigation can 
be launched immediately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government eliminated the landing fee on refugees.  I ask 
the government to consider eliminating the landing fee on all new 
immigrants. 
<P><A NAME="LINK239"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
am glad to add our remarks to this set of amendments regarding 
Bill C-11.  I understand that these amendments deal specifically 
with refugee issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am happy to take part in this debate for the simple 
reason that my riding of Winnipeg Centre is the part of Winnipeg 
where most people who are deemed as refugees or most newcomers 
seem to settle.  The core area or downtown area of Winnipeg seems 
to be the place where they can find affordable housing and access 
to reasonable settlement services that help them get their start 
in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud Canada plays an active role around the world in 
providing safe refuge to those who seek sanctuary, whether they 
have to flee religious persecution, political persecution or 
whatever their reason may be.  There is a certain spirit of 
generosity I believe that most Canadians share in reaching out to 
those who need the safe sanctuary of Canada. 
Other speakers have mentioned groups that are playing a 
particularly active role which enables these people to leave 
their troubled homelands and to come to Canada.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly there are church groups within my riding that work day 
and night to try to sponsor refugees and refugee families.  They 
do fundraising, but their activism does not stop in terms of 
financial contributions.  They also do a lot of follow through. 
They actually stay with the refugee or refugee family to help 
them to break into mainstream Canadian culture, to get them over 
the hurdles and barriers which exist when newcomers come to 
Canada, to help them find work and get fully integrated.  Some of 
the church groups in Winnipeg do a wonderful job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make special mention of an organization.  It is the 
Manitoba Interfaith Immigration Council found on Edmonton Street 
in my riding.  I work closely with this organization because it 
is charged with the responsibility of administering the 
settlement services that are offered to refugees in Winnipeg.  I 
cannot say enough about the dedication of these individuals.  The 
people there work in conditions that we would all find very 
taxing.  It is an under-resourced organization.  I believe it 
does an awful lot with very little.  Its budget has been cut back 
in recent years in terms of stable core funding, of which we have 
been very critical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that we are getting incredibly good value for our 
dollar by adequate funding to organizations like this because 
they do so much to alleviate the load from the department 
officials who would otherwise have to deliver and administer 
these settlement services.  I would speak very forcefully of the 
restoration of levels of funding to organizations like the 
Manitoba Interfaith Immigration Council. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They were very vocal and active through Bill C-31 and Bill C-11 
in pointing out some of the shortcomings of those bills or 
putting forth very solid recommendations on how these bills could 
be improved, not just in the refugee area, but also in areas of 
family sponsorship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though I know we are on the subject of refugees right now, 
I want to make a point that I did not get a chance to make under 
earlier motions.  Using the low income cutoff for family 
sponsorship is fundamentally wrong.  It is a flawed way of 
putting a line in the sand.  It does not do the city of Winnipeg 
any service because large cities like it are lumped into the same 
category.  In other words, if people want to sponsor one of their 
family members, they have to be at a certain level of family 
income to undertake that sponsorship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The family income arrived at is the same in Winnipeg as it is in 
Toronto, Vancouver or other major cities.  I could demonstrate 
quite easily that the cost of living is a great deal lower in the 
city of Winnipeg.  The cost of housing is about one-quarter of 
what it is in the city of Toronto.  We should not be held to the 
same standard when it comes to the reunification of families or 
the sponsorship of families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some might think that failed sponsorships put some sort of 
burden on municipalities in terms of social welfare costs.  I can 
provide some figures from the Manitoba Immigration Interfaith 
Council.  Out of 13,700 welfare claimants in the city of 
Winnipeg, only 11 of those were actually the result of failed 
family sponsorships in immigrations.  Eleven out of 13,000 is not 
an undue burden on our city.  Those who think that could come 
about are simply not working with the actual facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another group that has been very active in the advocacy for 
refugees is of course the Canadian Council for Refugees.  They 
came before the committee for Bill C-31 and again for Bill C-11 
with some very thoughtful recommendations on how the bill could 
be more fair in its treatment of the refugee determination and 
admissibility of permanent residents.  I would encourage 
government to revisit the brief from the Canadian Council for 
Refugees. 
I do not think there is a single organization in this country 
that is as authoritative on this issue or has worked as 
diligently to try and develop standards for managing the refugee 
influx into this country.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was one of the council's recommendations that brought in the 
whole subject of gender analysis and how necessary it was that we 
use that screen for any legislation introduced by parliament.  I 
am very glad the member for Winnipeg North Centre managed to 
convince the committee that we needed to undertake a 
comprehensive gender analysis in legislation of this type. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An example which was pointed out was the need to allow women a 
second hearing in terms of being turned down as a refugee. 
Sometimes the circumstances that qualify them as a refugee are 
not easy for them to make public.  In the initial application 
some information may be held back for any number of cultural 
reasons or personal safety reasons.  If this information needs to 
be heard or needs to be introduced, it would have to be 
introduced at a second refugee hearing.  That is being 
contemplated now through the hard work of those of the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to thank the Canadian Council for Refugees for being the 
one to really push that issue and the members of the committee 
for seeing fit to make that one of the priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another gender issue I would like to point out also has to do 
with the family reunification.  As we do this comprehensive 
gender analysis I hope this comes forward.  In terms of 
sponsoring other family members women are disadvantaged in that 
regard as well.  Given that there is this income threshold by 
virtue of which a person is allowed to sponsor or not sponsor 
another family member, given that women earn only 66% of what men 
do on average across the country, women or households led by 
women are less able to sponsor family members than households 
where the male is the bread winner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest this is another amendment that needs to be 
introduced in the interests of fairness.  In the interest of 
people's chartered rights, this issue needs to be addressed.  I 
would hope the gender analysis that is undertaken is sensitive to 
that issue now that we have put it on the record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another organization that has been influential in advocating on 
behalf of refugees is the Maytree Foundation in Toronto.  The 
organization has put forward some of the best prepared material 
on the subject.  It was satisfied that there was some recognition 
of the issues it raised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The foundation advises that that Bill C-11 includes some 
positive, but also some negative measures relating to refugee 
protection in Canada.  It speaks to the issue of identity 
documents.  There are times when personal documentation is 
extremely difficult to access when people flee their homeland 
under persecution, often in the dead of night.  There are places 
in the world that if refugees need the documents we demand they 
have to make application for those documents. Then they become 
flight suspects.  When prospective refugees make application to 
get their marriage licence or birth certificate from the city 
hall or agency, the spotlight shines on them and they may in fact 
not be able to get them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am honoured to raise the names of the organizations of the 
Manitoba Interfaith Immigration Council in Winnipeg, the Maytree 
Foundation, the Canadian Council for Refugees, and the 
contributions they have made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Here comes trouble. 
<P><A NAME="LINK240"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  There is not 
trouble, Madam Speaker, contrary to what the opposition might 
think. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  There is going to be though. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  There might be. One never knows. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to address the issue around refugees, which my hon. 
friend recently talked about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One change to Bill C-11 that is really important from the 
standpoint of refugees is the one year window of opportunity that 
they will have to sponsor family once they have been accepted as 
a convention refugee.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That opportunity has not existed in the past.  This is contrary 
to some of the media articles, notably the one by Diane Francis, 
whom my colleague from Scarborough East greatly admires, in which 
she stated that all the people who come here as refugees cheat 
the system and go on welfare, which is what my friend from 
Winnipeg was saying.  The article creates the image that these 
people are a burden on the taxpayer, whether it be at the 
municipal or federal levels.  I agree that statistics will be 
available to show that is simply not true.  It is an image put 
forward by some of the more extreme right wingers, both in 
political circles and in the media, which is most unfortunate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that the vast majority of people who come here and 
apply for refugee status are people who have some stress in their 
lives.  They are either fleeing persecution, torture or possible 
death.  Many of them come from very unstable countries with a 
military presence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There will of course be people who try to abuse the system and 
that is one of the things we are trying to address with the 
changes in Bill C-11.  However for people to suggest that all 
refugees are in that category is profoundly unfair and it creates 
a stereotype that is not true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have travelled with the immigration minister to our ports 
overseas to visit with immigration staff and to go to refugee 
camps.  Unfortunately the member from the official opposition has 
declined to attend, for whatever reason.  It is an educational 
experience to see the situations in Africa, Moscow and other 
parts of the world where there are terrible economic problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One example that will probably stay with me the rest of my life 
is when I was in Nairobi, Kenya.  I sat in on interviews with 
people who were applying to come to Canada.  Through a 
translator, one woman told a story of how she and her husband 
were dragged out of their bed in the middle of the night to the 
front yard where her husband was shot and killed.  Her teenage 
son ran to help his father and he was also shot and killed.  A 
third boy came out and he was put in the back of a truck.  She 
was thrown into the truck and then put in prison for two months 
where she was gang raped every day by seven guards.  To this day 
she has yet to see the son who was taken away.  She does not know 
if he is alive or dead, being tortured, in a work camp or perhaps 
sold into slavery.  She has no way of finding out what happened 
to him.  While this woman was being tortured and raped in prison 
for two months, her three children, who were under the age of 10, 
were left to fend for themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a reality that many of these people are facing.  As 
Canadians, we need to understand the terrible suffering and 
brutality that is going on in the world.  As Canadians, we need 
to find a way to open our doors to these people so we can help 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This woman was applying for refugee status in Canada.  I will 
never forget the moment when the immigration officer asked the 
woman's 11 year old daughter what she wanted to be when she grew 
up.  Through an interpreter, she said that she wanted to be an 
airline pilot.  The closest these people would be to an airplane 
would be 10,000 feet as it passed over them while they were 
wandering in the desert.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that young 11 year old girl could arrive in Canada, go to 
school and have the opportunity for a life, it is not beyond the 
realm of possibility that she may one day be flying MPs between 
Toronto and Ottawa on a regular basis.  Who knows?  It is not 
beyond the realm of possibility because this is Canada and that 
is what the bill is about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is about opening up our doors to people throughout the 
world who need the compassion, the opportunity, the caring and 
the help that we as Canadians can provide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My old friend, Johnny Barker of the United Steelworkers in Sault 
Ste. Marie, used to say “Don't let your bleeding heart run away 
with your bloody head”.  The point of that is, of course we have 
these terrible problems throughout the world but does that mean 
that we should just let our hearts bleed or should we put in 
place some realistic, achievable goals for trying to help the 
world's refugee population?  If we can once and for all close the 
back door to the illegals who do abuse our system and our 
generosity, then we will be able to open the door to people like 
the lady I met in Nairobi and her daughters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I find particularly troubling is that so much of the focus 
of the debate around Bill C-11, not from the speaker just before 
me but from the critics for the other parties, is why we are 
taking away appeal rights for convicted criminals.  It is 
difficult to understand why we are worried about people who have 
been convicted of a crime that comes with a 10 year sentence and 
who receive at least two years of actual sentence time as a 
result of that conviction.  They have a right to appeal that 
through the criminal justice system, to have that appeal turned 
down, to spend two years in jail and then we have the opportunity 
as a country to deport these people.  There was anguish in 
committee.  Members opposite said that it was awful to treat 
people like that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not talking about refugees.  We are talking about people 
who are landed immigrants in this country, not Canadian citizens, 
who commit a serious crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Madam Speaker, as a lawyer you would know that to get a two year 
sentence in this country one has to do something pretty serious 
in the criminal justice system.  We are not talking about minor 
felons here, we are talking about serious problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why the opposition continues to foster the idea that somehow we 
should provide greater rights and protection for convicted 
criminals or potential terrorists in this country is truly 
mind-boggling.  It has been an enormous exercise in frustration 
to listen to the members opposite put forward that kind of 
argument.  I can only think that they do it because they are 
opposing for the sake of opposing instead of realizing that the 
aims in Bill C-11 and the aims of the minister are to deal 
strongly and forcefully with people who would abuse our system, 
commit crimes and do things against our society.  We can deport 
them and once and for all not allow them to re-offend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would bring integrity to the immigration and refugee 
system in the country.  I hope members opposite will see fit to 
support it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK241"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon Benoit (Lakeland, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to speak today to the group of motions 
which would amend the refugee portion of the new immigration 
bill. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1610"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to say that I agree a lot with what the member from the 
governing party said earlier.  However one thing I have found is 
that what the government says and what is in its legislation is 
often completely different, and that is the case with the 
legislation today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think everyone would agree that what Canada wants to do with 
our immigration and refugee system is to make the immigration 
system work better than it does now for people who we want to 
attract to this country.  Our system has failed miserably in that 
regard and the changes in the legislation will not fix that up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think most Canadians would agree that, when it comes to the 
refugee system, changes need to be made that would not only allow 
genuine refugees to be accepted in this country but that we would 
be able to offer refuge to genuine refugees in other parts of the 
world living in camps, sometimes for years and years, and those 
who are identified by the United Nations as genuine refugees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The system we have now will not do that and the new legislation 
will not fix it.  A very high percentage of people who have been 
accepted as refugees right now are not in fact refugees by the 
United Nations' definition or by this government's own definition 
which is broader than the United Nations' definition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians also want a much faster process in terms of reuniting 
families.  When someone has been accepted to this country as a 
refugee or through the independent immigrant stream and they have 
dependants, a spouse, parents or grandparents, when they want to 
reunite their families our system fails miserably in a number 
of cases.  Every member of parliament knows about that because we 
have cases in our offices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the  case of a family reunification, which one would think 
would take less than a year certainly, sometimes it is three to 
four years later and the accepted refugee is still trying to be 
reunited with family members.  That is not Canadians want. 
I suggest that there are not many 
in the House who would support anything much different. 
I think that is widely supported by members from all political 
parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we are today at report stage of Bill C-11 talking about the 
changes to the refugee system.  What is in the bill now before 
these amendments certainly will make our refugee system work 
better in terms of accepting genuine refugees and keeping out 
those who are not genuine refugees.  The system that is meant to 
work for those who are not genuine refugees is in the other part 
of the bill dealing with immigration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments, quite frankly, will not improve the bill enough 
to make it good legislation, although some would certainly help 
in that regard.  It is pretty sad, after talking about this new 
bill, that it is the government's second or third attempt at it. 
It has been years now since the government brought forth its 
first effort to reform the Immigration Act.  The legislation, 
which I will speak to tomorrow in a more general way, or whenever 
it comes back to the House for third reading, will not fix the 
immigration system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to say as well that the auditor general made 
something very clear in his last report and in the report 10 
years ago when he said that even if the legislation were fixed to 
make it a good act that it would not solve the problems this 
government has in immigration. 
It would not fix it because many of the problems are in 
administration and this act would not change that administration.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the other thing I think Canadians should not forget. 
Even if this were a good piece of legislation that would bring 
forth a brand new act, even if that were the case, which it is 
not for the reasons I have outlined already, it still would not 
fix the problems in our immigration and refugee system because 
administration is a big part of the problem and this would do 
nothing to help improve administration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we are after all these years, about four years since the 
government first brought forth the legislation, and the 
government's own member, the speaker before me, is standing and 
explaining what he wants from the piece of legislation.  He knows 
in his heart that the bill clearly does not give what he wants in 
a new immigration act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we are, all these years later, facing a situation where, if 
this legislation is to pass, which I hope it does not, we will be 
stuck with an immigration act that will not work for Canadians. 
It will not work for genuine refugees.  It will not work for 
people who we desperately need in this country and who come 
through the independent categories.  It will not work for family 
reunification in cases where we are genuinely talking about 
family reunification. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has this four years done?  What good has it brought?  What 
would the new act do to help Canadians?  In certain narrow areas 
it would make things better.  In a broad way it would make things 
worse.  While some of the amendments in this grouping would help 
if they were passed, we know that the government will pass only 
what it wants.  We know that because that is the way things work 
around here.  Should it pass—it has failed before—we will end 
up with a bill, after all of this, that just simply will not do 
what it is intended to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would encourage Canadians to listen to members of the 
governing party when they are talking about what they want from 
an immigration system and to compare that to what the new act 
would deliver should this legislation pass.  They will find the 
two just do not match whatsoever.  What that means is that 
government members themselves know that this piece of legislation 
will not deliver what the government says it should deliver.  It 
certainly will not deliver what the opposition says it should 
deliver. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know my time is almost up so I will just leave my comments at 
that.  I look forward to speaking on third reading whenever that 
may come up.  I would not be at all disappointed if it never 
comes up.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Anita Neville (Winnipeg South Centre, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise to speak very briefly on the 
amendment put forward by the hon. member for Fundy—Royal, Motion 
No. 10.  I first want to thank him for his kind words about my 
role in committee.  I also would like to recognize his tenacity 
in putting forward an amendment that did not pass through 
committee and which he feels very strongly about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think there were any members of the committee who sat 
through the 154 presentations from Canadians across the country 
who were not gripped by the stories of many who have worked and 
fought hard to come to this country and bring their families and 
their relatives to this country.  I do not think there were many 
of us there who were not overwhelmed with admiration for the 
commitment, the nobility, in a sense, and the energy of those 
Canadians who worked on their behalf.  It was admirable.  It was 
what one would hope of one's citizens and one's neighbours as 
active participants in the activities of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to speak to the issue of Motion No. 10 in 
particular. 
The member put forward this motion in committee.  The intent of 
the government's position is simply to prevent abuse of the 
system by persons who use the refugee determination system as a 
means of gaining access to Canada. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1620"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT64"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT64"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1620
<A HREF="#LINKT65"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT63"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we listened to the many who came before the committee, I do 
not think there was a member of the committee who was not touched 
by the stories, particularly of women who, when they appeared 
before their refugee hearings, either misinformed those present 
or held back information about their circumstances and their 
claim for refugee protection because of shame, cultural 
differences, historic issues or concern in terms of what it would 
do within their own families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Accordingly the committee, in its wisdom, put forward a 
recommendation and an attempt to deal with this matter through 
the pre-removal risk assessment, in clause 113 of the bill, 
whereby people in these circumstances can come forward a second 
time to the PRRA to bring forward information that they withheld 
for whatever reason earlier in their refugee hearing, have it 
considered.  It could allow them to gain access as a refugee to 
the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore I think it is important to acknowledge that the issue 
the member is trying to address in Motion No. 10 has been 
addressed.  He would like to bring it forward in a broader way, 
but to do so would simply take us back to the revolving door 
aspect that we dealt with regarding refugees prior to the bill 
coming into effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I resume my seat I would like to acknowledge that the 
member for Winnipeg Centre quite rightly identified his area as 
having large numbers of immigrants and refugees.  My riding of 
Winnipeg South Centre has large numbers as well, perhaps not to 
the same extent as his riding but large numbers nonetheless. In 
his acknowledgement of the activities of associations in 
Manitoba, I did not hear the member acknowledge the activities of 
the Citizenship Council of Manitoba, an organization that has 
historically taken the lead in Manitoba and has expanded its 
services over the years to meet the needs of an evolving 
community.  Without an acknowledgement of that organization, we 
would be shortchanging the many men and women in that community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again on the issue of Motion No. 10, I think the matters that 
the member is trying to address in this motion have in fact been 
addressed in clause 113.  People should not be denied access to 
Canada as refugees because they are afraid to tell their stories. 
<P><A NAME="LINK243"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
it is once again a pleasure to rise on the grouping of three of 
the amendments that have been put forward on Bill C-11.  I would 
like to again congratulate the member for Fundy—Royal, who has 
put his heart and soul into this piece of legislation, Bill C-11, 
and who has in Group No. 3 one of the amendments we are talking 
about today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the member for Mississauga West talked about his particular 
issues on Bill C-11, he did not quite focus on the amendments in 
Group No. 3.  He talked about other benefits of the legislation. 
However, he should have been here when we talked about the first 
and second groupings of the amendments.  He probably could have 
talked more passionately and certainly more knowledgeably to 
those amendments instead of just talking to the bill in general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, on Group No. 3 the member for Fundy—Royal has put 
forward Motion No. 10.  I believe it was the member for 
Mississauga West who tried to get across to members of the House 
the importance and the urgency of being able to deal with the 
status of a refugee who is coming to our shores.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We Canadians too often take for granted what it is that we have 
in this great country of ours.  Sometimes we do not think of the 
challenges this globe presents to the majority of people away 
from our own country.  It was mentioned that in refugee camps all 
around this globe there are people who legitimately have fear and 
concern for their own safety and the safety of their children, 
their spouses and their families.  It is those people we are 
focusing on in this grouping of amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When people make application as refugees in this country, there 
are some who do so illegitimately and there are systems in place 
to ferret out those applications, to certainly not allow in those 
who are not persecuted and do not have fear for their own lives 
and the lives of their families in their country of origin.  In 
some cases mistakes are made and some get through the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the most part, as was mentioned by the member for Winnipeg 
Centre, the people who do come to our shores and apply as 
refugees do so legitimately.  As was mentioned, there are some 
examples, but very few examples, of those who try to circumvent 
the system.  That is what we are talking about here:  legitimate 
refugees coming forward to this country, not only to attempt get 
refugee status, landed status, but ultimately to get citizenship 
status in our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talked earlier about how the majority of the refugees who 
come to our shores and to this country do, through the process, 
become contributing members to this society.  These refugees do 
contribute, not only to our social systems but to our economic 
systems.  In fact, we as a country depend not only on the 
immigration side of this piece of legislation but also on the 
refugee side for the people who come into this country and become 
Canadian citizens and exist thus far. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would read a quote to the House.  It simply says “A truly 
humanitarian country is judged not by how it treats the most 
privileged, but rather on how it protects the disadvantaged. 
Immigrants and refugees are among the most marginalized and the 
least powerful by virtue of their status and the circumstances 
upon which they arrived in this country”.  Truer words could not 
be spoken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are the people for whom we in the House must put together a 
piece of legislation that will protect them.  We must protect not 
only the immigrants who apply but also the refugees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are three amendments in this grouping, two from the Bloc. 
The first one from the Bloc, Motion No. 9, would add new clause 
95.1 after clause 95, which deals with the conferral of refugee 
protection.  This new clause states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister shall assume the social and medical costs of refugee 
claimants as of the ninetieth day after the day of the claim and 
until a decision is made in respect of that claim. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said earlier that there are refugees leaving their country in 
circumstances that unfortunately we as Canadians cannot even 
relate to.  They are being persecuted and their families are 
being persecuted.  It could be a matter of life and death, so 
when they come to our country they do not necessarily have all 
the necessary papers.  They do not necessarily have all the 
identification.  They do not have all the paper trail that 
Canadians would normally take for granted.  They do not have the 
birth certificate, the driver's licence, the medical insurance 
card.  They are coming to our country with nothing except 
themselves and their families, looking for a place that they can 
call home and that they can contribute to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When they come here, as the Bloc has identified, when they do 
not have all of these documents, they sometimes find themselves 
in limbo.  It is hard to be able to find out who they are in this 
big, wonderful world of ours and where they are coming from. 
We have to see whether they have legitimate refugee status. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1630"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT65"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the meantime, the Bloc has suggested that after the 90th day 
the department should be responsible for the social and medical 
needs of a refugee.  That is laudable and certainly can be 
supported by our party.  Given the opportunity to think about 
this logically, it would also mean that the government could say 
that there is now some urgency to work toward a better timeline 
and timeframe to ensure that these applications are dealt with in 
a timely fashion.  Our party will be supporting Motion No. 9. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 12, as I understand it, is a technical motion.  It 
simply adds the word “maximum” to the clause.  We will be 
supporting Motion No. 12. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Group No. 3, the motion that speaks to the bill is Motion No. 
10, which was put forward by the member for Fundy—Royal.  There 
were a couple of issues with respect to Motion No. 10.  The 
amendment would refer a claim to the refugee protection division. 
It would not necessarily be done in all cases but where there was 
a new determination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, there are two caveats:  First, where the relevant 
circumstances of the claimant have changed since a previous 
determination, and that is very important, the claim could then 
be referred to the refugee protection division for a new 
determination; and second, where specific circumstances prevented 
part of the evidence from being presented during a previous 
determination.  We have talked briefly about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us put ourselves in the position of a refugee claimant who 
might experience problems with language, education not quite at 
acceptable levels, or a fear of cultural differences, authority 
and bureaucrats.  I do not believe there is anyone here who does 
not fear bureaucrats but when we put ourselves in the position of 
a refugee claimant this is all very difficult to comprehend. 
There are a number of things that could happen.  There could 
simply be an omission of fact from the claimant because of the 
circumstance itself and how he or she deals with that kind of 
stress and pressure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also the cultural issue, especially when a husband, 
wife and family make an application.  There may be information 
that any one family member may not wish to bring out and put 
forward to an adjudicator for any number of reasons.  It could 
have been a circumstance that happened previously that the wife 
may not want the husband to know about.  These things do happen. 
In those cases it is necessary to allow for a new determination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last issue which the amendment deals and which I find is 
only logical is the fact that right now the law says there can 
only be one refugee claim per lifetime.  If people come to our 
country and are granted refugee status, we believe they should 
have the opportunity to go back to their own country at some 
point in time.  If they do so and find that the circumstances 
have exacerbated the problems, they cannot come back to this 
country and make a second claim.  The amendment would stop that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate the member for Fundy—Royal for all his work on 
this particular file.  I know we will have an opportunity to 
speak to that at third reading. 
<P><A NAME="LINK244"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, it is 
with pleasure that I rise to speak to this group of amendments 
and, in particular, to recognize the contributions, both in 
committee and in the House, made to advancing the support for 
defending the interests of refugees in Canada.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These individuals have escaped great strife, faced personal 
risk, tremendous loss, and in many cases bloodshed and some of 
the worst atrocities imaginable to those of us in our very safe 
environment in Canada.  They seek refuge and the safety of a 
place where they can regroup, protect their families, work to 
develop futures in Canada or potentially at some point to return 
to their homelands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I need not remind anyone in the House that what they return to 
is sometimes devastating.  If we look at the former Yugoslavia, 
over half the homes were destroyed as a result of efforts at 
ethnic cleansing.  Effectively all records such as birth records 
and property deeds, some of which had been held by the same 
families for generations, were gone.  For all intents and 
purposes many of the refugees who come here have no other choice 
because they have been forced out of their homelands.  They 
actually lose every sense of attachment to their heritage, 
birthplace and home country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to consider some of the hardships many of these 
individuals endured prior to coming here when we design 
legislation and to ensure that we are vigilant in defending what 
has been a principle of Canadian immigration policy for some 
time: protection of legitimate refugees, recognition of their 
rights and support for them during such difficult times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what the PC amendment proposed by my colleague from 
Fundy—Royal seeks to do.  I find it wrong headed that a 
government that is so soft on many groups in society, that is so 
soft on crime and criminals, that balks at strengthening or 
proposing more effective approaches to young offenders, that 
refuses to pursue issues of law and order more aggressively, is 
also a government that seems to be disproportionately hard on 
legitimate refugees.  It is inconsistent with the principles that 
have guided Canadian refugee and immigration policies for so 
long. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand why members of the House on all sides, including 
some members on the government's side, have significant 
reservations about the government's direction in this regard.  We 
must avoid public policy reinforcing some of the stereotypes 
which to such a degree impede the progress and security of 
refugees in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very easy in this place when we create two tiers of rights 
for people to feed what would be a self-fulfilling prophecy by 
further hurting people who have been hurt so badly by 
circumstances that they did not bring upon themselves.  Hands 
were dealt to them which have been unimaginatively bad.  With 
some of the circumstances people have had to deal with in their 
home countries, to come to Canada and not have every level of 
protection, security and equality is offensive.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we consider that many of these people are escaping some of 
the most egregious examples of inequality, prejudice, bloodshed 
and ethnic cleansing, it sets a very bad example for the 
government to fail to provide every level of protection, support 
and security in Canada.  We are a country that has been largely 
built by people who have chosen this place as their home.  In 
some cases this was by choice and in other cases it was in 
situations of duress and great struggle for freedom and security 
for themselves and their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope government members will be supportive of some of our 
amendments in this group.  Some of the Bloc amendments also 
deserve consideration in the same regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend the hon. member for Fundy—Royal who because of his 
erudite discourse in the House is frequently confused with me. 
However I commend him once again for bringing a great level of 
commitment to good public policy and of vigilance on behalf of 
the huddled masses, or refugees who seek to become Canadians, to 
ensure that their interests are protected when the government 
fails to do so in the legislation.
