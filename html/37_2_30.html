	Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure this morning  to speak on this very important agenda item that the very capable House leader has put before the House.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, it goes back to March 2001, when the House affairs committee met at the time and considered a number of recommendations in order to address the whole issue of modernization.  It  reported in June 2001 and made a number of recommendations. There was a wide range of recommendations: the ratification of appointments of parliamentary officers by the House;  a new format for emergency debates to take place in committee of the whole; more take note debates; allowing votes to be deferred to 3 p.m., after question period, therefore freeing the House and members to do other important  things.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It also addressed the notions of permitting the Leader of the Opposition to refer two sets of estimates to the committee of the whole for debate for up to five hours each before the May break, as well as a 30 minute debate with the responsible ministers on motions, time allocation and closure. As well, it addressed the notions of tightening the sanction for questions on the order paper that are not answered on  time, increasing advance notice of the text of opposition day motions and permanently equipping a second room for televised committee hearings.  The report also looked at  programming of government bills when referred to standing committees and increasing the use of ministerial statements.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot state how important these issues are, for many reasons.  Many of my colleagues have faced a lot of frustration in the process in the House and in how we have been dealing with issues that come before committee.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House leader has gone to great lengths in order to consult with and  bring on board members of the opposition parties in the House so that we can address this once and for all. It is timely.  Why? Everything is changing around us and our citizens are demanding of us more transparency, more efficiency and value for money.  You will recall  that  in the House not long ago, Mr. Speaker,  we spent up to five days, 24 hours a day, voting in the House of Commons on issues, some of which were valid and others which were not so valid.  I would say that it is high time for us to come together on a non-partisan basis and address those issues. This submission by the House leader does just that.  I  want to commend him on his commitment to the House for many years and his commitment to the renewal process, which began quite some time ago and continues to take place.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of initiatives have been passed so far in 2002.  As a result of the minister responding to members and some of their queries, a change to  royal assent was passed, allowing royal assent to be given to legislation through a written procedure. A new Standing Committee on Government Operations and Estimates has been established. Its members have been identified and it is  already operational.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As well, the House of Commons has done something that I believe is extraordinary, which is to address the bilingual nature of our country and to reflect that in the House of Commons proceedings.  As a result, we have established the Standing Committee on Official Languages.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, the House adopted the procedure committee's report making private members' business votable. As well, the House agreed to require the election of committee chairs by secret ballot, although I am not in favour of that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<A NAME="T1010"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1010"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1015"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1005"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1010)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we stand up to vote in the House, our constituents have a chance to see us voting. I do not understand why they should not also be allowed to see us voting in the committees. Why it has to be secret is beyond me. Nonetheless, it is water under the bridge. It has gone through.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, the modernization committee has taken a number of other initiatives.  The House leader has agreed to propose to the House that there be a second phase of modernization to consider further changes to the rules of the House. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would say that along with what has been done, which have been very positive steps, I believe there are other things the committee could consider.  One is to see what other jurisdictions are doing,  whether it is in the parliamentary system in the United Kingdom or that of Australia or other commonwealth countries, to see whether or not we can share some best practices.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the issues we would need to address, for example, is the whole notion of the handling of question period, such as the timing and how many times it would take place in a week. Perhaps we could look at themes that come from different departments and so on. Also, we should look at what the committee could do in terms of examining bills at report stage and how we can make that system a little more efficient.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are other procedural issues that House leaders have talked about in the past and have brought to a debate in the House. One, for example, is how we handle private members' bills after the prorogation of the House. Speaking of private members' bills, I am one of those guilty people who has approximately 60 private members' bills.  Every time the House prorogues I have to come back to my seat with a pile of private members' bills after they have been reviewed by the legislative counsel.  Quite often I have asked the House for its consent so I can introduce them all at once without debate.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonetheless, as everyone will recall, on a number of occasions some of my colleagues in the House have denied me the opportunity to introduce all 60 at once.  As a result of that, I had to stand up, along with you, Mr. Speaker, 60 times. There has to be some sort of  a mechanism so that we do not have to do that.  While we have tried so far to move forward on bills that come from the government, I would suggest that perhaps it is high time for us to do the same thing when it comes to private members' bills.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again speaking of private members' bills, I think we have a huge opportunity to make a difference in the House by eliminating some of the frustrations that exist in our community, whereby, if for whatever reason one of our colleagues has an idea that is worthwhile considering, the individual MP does not have to wait until his or her name is drawn  and then decide which one of the bills or motions will be introduced to the House.  I think what has taken place is very positive.  In fact each one of us will be given an opportunity to choose legislation that the House will debate and the committee will consider it and report back to the House.  I think that is a very positive thing.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, I think we have other things we can address and deal with, such as the use of modern technologies.  I know that electronic voting is a pretty ticklish issue with some of the members in the House. I do not think it is a good idea for us to continue using the old system, which  is for each member of the  House to stand up individually.  By the time two or three votes take place we have spent approximately an hour to an hour and a half of House time.  Our translators have to be in place, the camera people have to be in place, <i>Hansard</i> people have to be in place, all of the clerks and yourself, Mr. Speaker, as well as many other support staff, have to be in place.</p>


	<A NAME="T1015"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1015"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1020"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1010"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1015)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest that  if we were to eliminate that alone the savings to the House on an annual basis would be tremendous.  Somebody told me, and the House leaders can correct me,   that the cost per hour for  every hour we sit  is over $30,000.  If we multiply that times the number of days  the House sits,  the number of votes that take place and the number of hours, I would suggest there would be a substantial savings as well, not to mention more  efficiency   and   transparency, which would be very important.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the use of technologies by members of Parliament, I am a telecommunications engineer  but frankly I am embarrassed to say that I am not using the modern technology that is available efficiently.  In fact, there was study done which found that only about 58% of MPs have websites.  I do not have a website yet, which  is terrible because I should have one, and I will   undertake to have one.   </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonetheless, if we were to encourage our colleagues to use modern technology, I would suggest that our constituents would be a lot more pleased with us than otherwise, and at the same time we would have an opportunity to access information a lot easier,   save  staff time and improve efficiencies.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of modern technologies, and I am not getting off the subject here, but it is really frustrating for members of Parliament nowadays when we have, on an average daily basis, approximately   100 e-mails coming to us from all over the world.  In some cases we do not  know whether   Sam or Sue   is asking us about an issue involving a constituency matter,   asking us to buy one item or another, or asking us to   pass on propaganda  of one form or another.  It is a challenge for us because our staff time has been extensively overused in this particular area.  I   hope   someone in the field will   figure out a way where we could do some sort of a filtering in order to remove the junk mail that comes through the computer system so we can respond more efficiently to our constituents. Technology is not all good.  Some elements of it   are pretty good and    other elements,   I would say,    need to be changed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other improvements  have taken place.  For example, the member for St. Paul's, who chairs  the Subcommittee on the Status of Persons with Disabilities, is making great use of modern technology.  Therefore,  I think we could work a little   more on that particular element.  We could make our websites more interactive and  use plain language, in a sense.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest and I would hope that when the time comes for phase two that we will work a little more aggressively in order to move forward with some of the issues that the House leader  has been speaking about and consulting with the opposition leaders on.    I also hope that we always keep in mind the interests of our constituents.  To that extent, perhaps  we need to do   things on a non-partisan basis and move forward with them on a non-partisan basis.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had the pleasure of sitting in for a colleague on one of the standing committees. During the   half-hour I was sitting in the committee,    the committee was taken up by one member who spoke about one issue.  In my view, while the comments were exceptionally valid, I felt that the time allotted  to  individual members to speak on one item of legislation needed to be tightened up somewhat so that committees would  not become somewhat inefficient and cumbersome. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of my experience,  I think it would be a good idea to have a standard system for all committees of the House so that,  like the House here,  every member of Parliament would have to play by the same rules.  I would also suggest that we have  standard rules for all committees to follow.  As a result, we would not have one committee dealing with procedures in one way and another committee dealing with procedures differently.</p>


	<A NAME="T1020"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1020"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1025"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1015"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1020)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also have to figure out a mechanism whereby it will be a lot easier for our respective caucuses, as well as the government and the leadership within the parties, from time to time when members of Parliament come up with good ideas to bring them forward.  I do not see why we do not approach the specific cabinet ministers with those ideas to see whether or not the cabinet minister is willing to adopt   the private member's bill, whether from this side of the House or the other side of the House, and make it an initiative of the House of Commons and move with it as such.  We would  remove the element of where the bill is coming from and we would focus mainly on the substance of the bill and what the bill will do:  is it really beneficial for our constituency, is it beneficial to the country as a whole.   We should do that assessment and move forward with it. I would say that would prove to be exceptionally helpful.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another thing is the way committees do their reporting to the House.  I suggest that it is working but it could work a lot better. In some committees, without getting specific, some reports linger around in those committees for close  to eight months and in some cases up to a year.  There is nothing really in the system to ensure that once an item is referred to a specific committee that it has to report within a specific time to the House, in particular when it comes to studies.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public accounts committee is a case in point where we are still sitting on a report that goes back to 2001 as well as early 2002. We are almost moving on to 2003. Something should be in the procedures of committees, such as that the committee has to carry on with the work once priorities are established, that it cannot move out of the priorities and decide along the way that it wants to debate other issues that may or may not have anything to do with the mandate of the committee.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It  is exceptionally important to look at some of the nitty-gritties of procedures, not only when it comes to the House of Commons but also to committees themselves.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I  sometimes sense, and I am not the only person, many of my colleagues have the same feeling, that when the House is in session it seems as though we run through corridors almost like chickens without heads.  We do not seem to be able to control the flow of information that comes from every angle.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the House leaders are proposing   will improve efficiency so that we do not have to take away valuable time from our constituents and from our work as legislators, and to spend that time on useless votes and, in some cases, on fictitious motions and ridiculous amendments to legislation when   the main objective is not to allow legislation to go through and  delay legislation for pure partisan objectives. This does not  improve on the efficiency of how government runs its business.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, Mr. Speaker, I want to commend you for the leadership you have taken because you have done a marvellous job in trying to make Parliament run more smoothly and more efficiently.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member for Peterborough also played a leadership role.   He chaired the same committee, the House affairs committee, where a lot of those changes that came to Parliament actually passed through that specific committee.   With your previous leadership, Mr. Speaker, and the leadership of the member for Peterborough, whose constituents are very fortunate to have him as their MP,  you both have done a marvellous job in bringing forward reports that  respond to the aspirations of members of Parliament,   to the needs of Parliament and   to the overall hopes and aspirations of  Canadians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am  delighted   that the House leaders have moved forward with this wonderful initiative.  I am also delighted   that  discussions between all the House leaders on the very important issues that affect the House and  the operation of the House are continuing to take place. </p>

	Mr. Speaker, I want to ask the member a question on one of the items that he spoke about. I found interest in a number of things that he said. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The item I am talking about is the one about members of Parliament actually choosing the chairs of the committees. If I heard him right, he said that he did not agree with secret ballots for the election of the chairs. I would   remind him that the reason for the secret ballots was simply that instead of   government members having to toe the line, as told by their party whip or the Prime Minister, on who to select as the chair,   they could use their own judgment and choose the person who is best qualified for the position. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There would be nothing wrong with having public votes on this provided  there was no coercion from the parties on their members. This is a way of freeing up the members from that coercion so they can use their own best judgment.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I need the member to explain to me why he is opposed to a secret ballot because it gives him the freedom to use his judgment which must, invariably, on occasion, be better than the judgment of others who would decide for him.</p>


	<A NAME="Int-345082"></A><a HREF="#Int-345085"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-345079"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Mac Harb: </b>

	Mr. Speaker, it is a very interesting question and here is where I am coming from. We have a country that is huge, with different regions, some   remote and some urban. We have representation in the House by males and females who represent their constituents, and this election of chair of a committee is not as straightforward as my colleague would think.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to have a balance, like the balance we have with the selection of members of cabinet,  secretaries of state and  parliamentary secretaries. From time to time the government parties will have to establish a balance. How many women chairs do we want? How many male chairs? What regions do we want to have represented on that specific committee? </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure my colleagues go through the same exercise when they want to select people to sit on committees. It may  not be all the time, but  any member of any party  in the House, including mine,   who chooses a committee   to sit on, does not always end up on that committee.   I have selected committees in the past that I wanted to sit on and I was not given that opportunity.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important point I want to tell my colleague is that we are over the age of 18, most of us in terms of age as well as mental capacity. I am sure the member does not mean to generate insult here insinuating that some of my colleagues are afraid to speak their minds on committees. That is far from it. We already vote on the committees by a raise of hand or by roll call. However  I also want to let him know that if   we do not have a secret ballot in the House  why should we have a secret ballot at the committee level?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I  also want to tell him that when it comes to cabinet proceedings, even though they are confidential and after 30 years are rendered public, is he suggesting that committees should  use the same procedures to release the voting patterns of members? I do not know.  I would say that it is gone, we have voted on it but, nonetheless, I would suggest it was the wrong thing to do.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I agree with my colleague. We are engaged in a very important debate which has to do with thinking about how this place runs. The way we run it, both the standing orders and the customs, have evolved over generations and are very important. We should constantly look at them and change them with care.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He mentioned that he has   many private member's bills tabled and  that he makes a practice of doing that. One of the things we are engaged in very directly at the moment is a change in the way we deal with private member's bills. Part of the objective is to make more of them votable. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I found it very useful to have private member's bills, to use them to publicize issues and I did once have one drawn. I was disappointed that it was not votable but we had a debate about it in the House of Commons. I found that   very useful. I have used that debate since to press different corporations and various groups on the issue that was raised in my private member's bill. Although I would have liked it to have been votable, I found it very useful to have private member's bills, and I have used them to the limit of my capacity.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder if my colleague could give us some idea of why it is that he continually reintroduces and introduces new private member's bills, knowing that   many of them will not become votable? </p>


	<A NAME="Int-345088"></A><a HREF="#Int-345091"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-345085"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Mac Harb: </b>

	Mr. Speaker, it is an excellent point.  Out of the 54 bills I have introduced, I am happy to  report to the House that through the administration of government I was successful in having about seven or eight of them adopted,  nearly all of them dealing with the UN convention on the rights of the child.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Treasury Board, for example, adopted my private member's bills when Mr. Masse was the minister. On the issue of the definition of a child, the justice department adopted my propositions. The former justice minister, who is now the Minister of Industry, adopted two of my private member's bills dealing with certain aspects of the Criminal Code. The industry minister adopted two of my bills, one dealing with whistleblower legislation, as part of the Competitions Act.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introducing private member's bills gives me an opportunity to put them on the record and from there on to approach the specific ministers to see if there is a possibility for my bills to be adopted as part of a government initiative. Whenever a bill from the government is introduced which has something to do with my private member's bill, I approach the ministers to see if I can get their support.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On private members' bills, the government and the Prime Minister have allowed more free votes in Parliament than ever before in the history of Parliament and far more than the opposition has ever allowed on bills as well as on motions. This Prime Minister has allowed more freedom for members of Parliament than any other prime minister ever in the history of  Canada, not only to speak their minds within caucus, but outside of caucus as well as in the House. This Prime Minister has taken more initiative to bring about changes to Parliament than any other prime minister in the history of Canada. This Prime Minister has done more for Canada on the economic front as well as on the political front than any other prime minister in the history of Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a privilege to serve with members of the House with the leadership we have in the Prime Minister, specifically on the notion of free votes, of reform to the parliamentary system and  of leadership, both economically and politically.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, to further follow up on our previous interchange, the member has the audacity to say that what member in the Liberal Party would not go against directions given from the party.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was part of the finance committee when the whip signed herself in to get the correct number of people in committee to implement the Prime Minister's choice.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, I cannot believe that the member thinks that only the Prime Minister can compute who are the best people for the job and whether they are the right gender or  whether they represent the right region. As there will be secret ballot elections in the committee now, those facts will become known and they should then influence the voting decision of the member of Parliament, unless he has a brain the size of an asp.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opposition parties move in droves in voting against government initiatives and government policies, unlike what happens on this side. There is a lot more freedom on this side than there is on the other side, because this side is a  liberal side.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to join in the debate.  I have chaired the senior committee of the House which has particular responsibility for the Standing Orders.  If we read the annotated version of the Standing Orders, each of the subsections of the Standing Orders has a history.  If we read that with care, those histories together are really a history of this place.  The Standing Orders are very special.  Therefore, although I know many of the people watching on television know relatively little about the Standing Orders, this debate is very important.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a member, I believe it is extremely important from time to time to think about the Standing Orders and consider modernizing them.  If we read those annotations since confederation, in fact some of the annotations go back before confederation, it shows that whenever we engage in this exercise we should proceed thoughtfully and with care.  Every Standing Order in this place has evolved over a long period of time and has had the input of many members of Parliament like ourselves. We should respect those opinions, not to the point of doing nothing but of proceeding with care. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to talk a bit about being careful, when we engage in this exercise, of not throwing the baby out with the bathwater.  In other words, we must think very carefully about the place as a whole, not condemn it when we are concerned about one facet or another of these very important Standing Orders. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to share some of my experience with the Ontario legislature at Queen's Park, where I was for three years. Like all the legislatures in Canada,  it is a remarkably open place. However, I stress that in comparison to the openness that we have here, it is still very much a closed place.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to draw back a bit on some of the discussion of private members' business,   the nature of question period, how committees operate and so on.  I will give one example of that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ontario  legislature operates on a calendar which is determined by the premier of the province of Ontario, in other words by the leader of the government party.  The legislature is called at the whim of the premier and is closed and prorogued at the whim of the premier.  People might say so what.  However think of the  fundamental freedom and influence of members of Parliament.  If our Prime Minister could close the House down now or could say that we would not meet for the next six months, or sometimes in the case of Ontario  eight months, that would be control.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure viewers have little idea of this, but we operate on a two year rolling calendar.  The House of Commons functions in 10 months of the year.  On working days, we work for nine or ten hours a day, including meal times.  The House of Commons rolls on, but in a predetermined fashion.  Our Prime Minister, I and my colleagues  know that  next April we will be here on certain days.  We have a reasonable idea of the flow of business.  Throughout the year we know what we will be doing, and our Prime Minister cannot stop that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge members to remember that, in a very real sense, the House of Commons controls its own calendar. Every year the two year rolling calendar is changed, I assume through discussion among the House leaders.  In principle the forum throughout the year is controlled by the House itself. That is a very important power. Whether our legislature can be closed down by the Prime Minister is where members of Parliament have limited power.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to give another example from Queen's Park. We have what we call S.O. 31s.  These are statements by members and we have 60 seconds.  I do not know how it works among the opposition parties but on this side it is  like a lottery. When a member has something he wants to say, perhaps it is about your constituency or about a political point, the statement is submitted and it is drawn out of a hat. Then there are 60 seconds in which the member can say whatever he or she likes.</p>


	<A NAME="T1040"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1040"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1045"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1035"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1040)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sixty seconds may not sound like very much to people watching this.  However, when I was at Queen's Park I was supporting the idea that the Olympic games should be in southern Ontario and not in Greece.  This is a pretty obscure thing.  I am interested in sports and in southern Ontario, so I submitted what we would call an S. O. 31, a private member's statement, about this.   Private members' statements are vetted at Queen's Park.   In my statement was a line which I thought was a joke, and I am sure the House will think it is a joke.  I said that if the people of Greece had really been interested in having the Olympic games, they would not have given them up 2000 years ago.  Because of that sentence, my private member's statement was pulled from the list.  To members opposite, and I do not know how theirs are chosen, that sort of thing does not happen here.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also want to talk about the Standing Orders with respect to this debate.  When we have debates, there is discussion among the House leaders and it is determined how long speeches will be and whether there will be questions and answers, and there usually are questions and answers.  Typically in this case, if I manage to speak for 20 minutes, the Speaker will allow 10 minutes of questions and answers. If I speak for 10 minutes, typically members from all sides are allowed five minutes of questions and answers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On my very first day in the House of Commons, when I was first elected in 1993, I came in and we went through the opening of the House and then we went on immediately to the predetermined calendar.  I was on duty on this side.  I had to be here.  As a new member, I sat in my seat throughout.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was in awe of being in this place.  Gradually the light changed, the sun went down and the stained glass windows changed their hue, and I was impressed.  It was my first day and I was not on the speaking list.  Nor had not tried to be on the speaking list.  However I noticed that when a member stopped speaking other members got up and asked them questions. When I was at Queen's Park that never happened.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After I have finished speaking here,  members can get up and they will have either five or 10 minutes, depending on how long I speak, to ask questions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However later that night, at seven or eight o'clock, I got up and made a comment.  I asked one of the speakers a question just so that I could test the waters.  As a result of that, the following day I received a phone call from a lady in Vancouver, who happened to have seen it, and she had a comment on what I had to say.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those question and answer periods are in our Standing Orders, which they do not have at Queen's Park. People say that this is a whipped and highly controlled House of Commons.  If a member can come in here and he or she has five minutes to get up make a comment and ask a question, how can the whips control that?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know the member for Elk Island takes an extraordinary interest in this debate and in other debates. Let us say that he has come here today and he is seething with some problem  in agriculture or something of that type.  Even though this debate is on modernization, we all know that, if he wishes  he can get up and speak for two or three minutes on the record about agriculture today, whether his whip wants him to or not.  That is the sort of freedom we have in the House.  That is what I mean about not throwing the baby away with the bathwater. We have to think of the strengths of the House of Commons as well as its weaknesses.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mentioned question period.  Question period is different in all the parliaments around the world.  We often have had the Westminster model quoted to us during this debate from the other side of the House.  In the Westminster model the members of parliament give notice of their questions.  They say that they will ask this person or that person a  specific question about health care.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our House of Commons no notice is given.  The Prime Minister and our ministers come in here and the members opposite can ask them anything they like.  Not only that, the official opposition gets a question and then two supplementary questions on the first few rounds. The rules are not in the Standing Orders exactly, but I know the Speaker has developed them.</p>


	<A NAME="T1045"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1045"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1050"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1040"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1045)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to not having any notice, the Prime Minister answers a question and the official opposition can ask him another question on the same topic.  It can probe through the question and two supplementaries. In many other parliaments this does not exist.  That is a  good example of the way the official opposition party, in this case the Canadian Alliance, is protected by our standing orders.  It is given very special privileges in question period which it would not have in other parliaments.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Modernization is very important but we should proceed thoughtfully and carefully.  I  mentioned the official opposition.  I am not demeaning other legislatures because they also have their particular strengths, but in every other parliament around the world which is modeled on Westminster, the standing orders are geared to nurture the official opposition party.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea is that if the official opposition, as members may recall was the case  in New Brunswick recently, is reduced to one or as happened previously is reduced to zero, it has to think of some way of generating opposition at the same time.  Even if the opposition party is reduced to one or two members, those members should be given all the strength possible. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that through the standing orders the official opposition should be nurtured.  It holds the government accountable and it trains future governments.  That brings me to the comments made by the member for Elk Island regarding the  secret ballot.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have  mentioned, I am chair of the procedure committee which  tabled the report on the secret vote.  I function as chair of that committee as well as I can.  I have to say to the hon. member that it  is not the secrecy of the ballot itself or anything of that sort that concerns me, but I believe that change which was cobbled together very quickly  is flawed.  It is flawed  in that it has weakened not only the present official opposition, but future official oppositions.  One of the special roles of the standing orders is not to nurture the government because it does not need any nurturing, but it is to nurture the people in the opposition party.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The official opposition has already lost five vice-chairs of standing committees.  We could conceive of that party  losing all of them.  If I were  debating in a partisan way, I would say good, the Canadian Alliance has lost five vice-chairs.  However as chair of the  committee which is responsible for the standing orders, and as someone who is very conscious, when I am not engaged in partisan debate, of the preservation of the intrinsic strengths of this place, I hope there can be some modification in the future  of the secret ballot so that the  official opposition, not the opposition in general,  but the official opposition and future official oppositions are not weakened by that change.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those are  my general  baby in bath water comments. There are some things I am interested in that do not require changes to the standing orders but which I have promoted for a long time and wish to promote again.  They are simple changes in the way committees operate which could be done by consensus by members here in this chamber.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of these changes is the televising of committees.  I have worked very hard not just as chair of the procedure and House affairs committee, but before that to see to it that committee work is televised whenever possible.  People say that is just vanity and members just want to be on television and there is some truth to that statement.  I believe that when committees are televised, people can see members working and  they know what their members of Parliament are doing.  Televising committees  changes the way members operate.  Members think very seriously and speak differently when they are on television.  </p>


	<A NAME="T1050"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1050"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1055"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1045"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1050)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is   a pilot project in the House whereby any committee can be televised.  It will go  until the end of the year and then the committee will look at it again. There are two official television rooms.  If a commercial television station gives the chair of the committee notice, for example the night before, that it will be putting  a camera in the committee room the following day, the camera can be put there and the event can be televised.  There are some rules associated with that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That exists but it has not been widely used by committees, and committee members could do something about that.  It has not been widely used by the television companies either. I hope they start to use it. I think by that simple change, by more frequently getting committees on television,  individual members of Parliament would be strengthened.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other one is in the same vein. It  is the matter of committee travel.  When committees travel, it empowers the individual members of Parliament on the committees.  They go to different parts of the country and come back here to report on what they heard.  People listen to them more carefully as a result of their travel.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment in theory all the committees can travel. However   it is expensive when  16 or 18 people travel. We might have enough confidence, which is within the standing orders, to  send seven or eight members of a committee  rather than the whole lot.  Again, the committee could decide on that itself and it could have a quorum for receiving witnesses which is in the standing orders. Then it would be easier for the committee to travel.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More significantly, in order  to travel, the committee has to agree that it wants to travel. It  has to submit a budget, which is as it should be. It   has to come to the House to get unanimous consent to travel.  An individual member in here can stop a committee from travelling and it happens.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking here particularly about the two smallest parties which  have 12 or 13 members,  I know it is difficult for them to release one of their members to travel for three days  to the west coast, to Nunavut and to the Maritimes.  I would urge that individual members think seriously before stopping committees from travelling.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Individual members can say  no, and a committee will not travel. A good example is the Standing Committee on Official Languages which has tried to travel numerous times and has never been able to travel to my knowledge, simply because of a voice that was heard in this place.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That would not be a change in the standing orders. It would be  a change in attitude in the House of Commons and among the parties.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will conclude on that point. Like my colleague previously, I compliment you, Mr. Speaker, on allowing us to conduct this very important debate on modernizing the House of Commons.</p>


	<A NAME="Int-345112"></A><a HREF="#Int-345114"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-345096"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, since I was mentioned in the member's speech, I feel privileged  to respond to him. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I  begin by saying that of all of the members I have seen chair committees, that particular member has to be one of the best.  He is fair, very efficient and I have always enjoyed serving on the committees when he has been chairing.  I have not done that too much, but from time to time I have been involved in committees that he is on.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to talk about the  issue of free votes.  He mentioned that we vote as a block more often than the Liberals do.  I do not really think that is true.  I would have to check the actual records to see how many dissenting votes there were  from the Liberals.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member  may have been referring to private members' business and in that case, it is true.  We all have the freedom to vote as we wish on private members' bills and as far as I know that is true for all parties in the House.  On those occasions, yes, because there are some 170 members of the Liberal Party, a greater number of them would be voting on one side or the other.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to government bills and whipped votes, I do not think we would find that to be true at all.  Of course, in our party  not only do we have  the privilege of representing our constituents first and foremost instead of taking our voting orders from the party hierarchy,  but we have an obligation to do so.  I have always been very proud to be part of  a party, formerly the  Reform Party and now the Canadian Alliance, that stands for representing our constituents.  However, I will say unequivocally that I have never once in the House voted in a way that I did not agree, in order words I was persuaded, not forced or coerced, and there is a fantastic difference in that particular measure.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have used quite a bit of time. In deference to other members I will allow the member to respond, but   in the event that no one else rises, I will be up again.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague for his remarks and his compliments.  By the way, this is a good example of what I was saying.  These questions and answers are an opportunity to engage in whatever we wish. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was my colleague who spoke previously who made the remark about it being more common for Liberals to vote against their party than members of any other party.  It was not  I, Mr. Speaker.  On the other hand, my colleague is using the standing orders to make a point and is referring to a previous speaker.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it happens, I can answer his question.  My colleague was absolutely right.  I cannot give the exact reference, but there is a study by Professor Wearing, I think of the University of Toronto. He studied  voting patterns, not in this session but in  previous  sessions.  It is more common for members on this side to vote against their party than it is for members on the other side.  That, by the way, is a statistical fact.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I could go further though, I accept absolutely what the member said about having always voted the way he thought was most appropriate and having voted with his conscience, if that is the right way to put it.  I do accept that. The same is true of members on this side of the House.  </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chief Flanagan had a remarkable sense of duty that was proven throughout his career.  In 1958 he was awarded the Queen's commendation for brave conduct and in 1980 the Governor General's Star of Courage. After retirement Tom continued to give his time freely in the service of Canada as an active member of the Military Police Complaints Commission.  Tom was both a great friend and a devoted public servant, and he is without a doubt a loss to Canada.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This campaign began when a Danish postman, Einar Holboell, looked at the needy children around him and had the idea that a single extra stamp on each Christmas letter would cost each individual so little but  do so much good. Canada's first Christmas Seal Campaign was in 1927.  The money raised supports research and treatment of lung disease, tuberculosis as well as raising funds for sanatoria and community programs.  Although TB is no longer as serious a problem in this country as it was in the earlier part of this century, there are still about 3,000 cases every year, and the occurrence of other lung diseases such as emphysema, chronic bronchitis and asthma has increased enormously.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Christmas I encourage everyone to put a Christmas seal on   their Christmas cards, websites or e-mail greetings.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, the tainted blood scandal is not a closed file.  This week the RCMP charged senior Health Canada bureaucrats with criminal negligence and more charges are possible.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To recap the events is instructive.  HIV and hepatitis C infected many patients who required blood transfusions or blood products.  The HIV patients were all compensated but the hepatitis C patients were compensated only between 1986 and 1990.  The Krever report called for compensation for everyone infected and ill due to the failure of the federal watchdogs.  Quebec and Ontario compensated everyone. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The federal government should also compensate every victim of hepatitis C from tainted blood who is ill. One patient who called me this week has $11 per month left after paying for her rent.  She has to live with her son so that she can survive.  She deserves compassion and not legalistic arguments.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, we already knew how generous federal  public service employees are. Today, we have proof again. Contributions by public servants to the United Way of Ottawa campaign account for over one third of all the money collected. They have contributed more than $7 million of the $20 million collected.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, public servants exceeded their objective for Centraide Outaouais, contributing $2.2 million, or 50% of all the money collected.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reasons for giving so generously are many. The common thread, however, is the desire to help Canadians. In their everyday work, our public servants help people in one way or another. Their contribution to United Way/Centraide is a visible extension of their generosity. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to congratulate all public service employees for their great generosity, and especially the organizers and many volunteers who give their time and energy to help improve the lives of many people in need. Too often we take for granted the professionalism of our public service.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I wish to raise the  awareness of hon. members of this House about a very important humanitarian cause, that of Ingrid Betancourt. Everyone remembers this Colombian woman,  who ran in the presidential election of her country and was abducted by the FARC on February 23.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing that can justify the abduction of civilians. A true peace process cannot develop as long as such practices continue.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must do everything in our power to bring about the release of  Ingrid Betancourt and other civilians held captive by armed groups. A political dialogue must be established as soon as possible to restore the peace the vast majority of Colombians  hope for.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a show of solidarity for the fight that Ingrid Betancourt is leading, I urge everyone to take part in the walk  that will be held tomorrow and on the 23rd of each month. Join supporters in Montreal, at the corner of McGill College and Sainte-Catherine, and in Quebec City, in front of the National Assembly building. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am  proud to see that Laval West has some great talents. Indeed, Claire Varin, who has written three novels, was just awarded the 2002 Prix de la Société des écrivains canadiens for her third novel, <i>Désert désir</i>. She tied with Nicole Brossard for that prize.   </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am taking this opportunity today to congratulate these two authors from Laval for their work and their contribution to Quebec and Canadian literature.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, yesterday I introduced a private member's bill that allows the labour minister to step in when the collective bargaining process at west coast ports bogs down and before costly work disruptions take place.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since August 25, 650 grain handlers have been locked out at the port of Vancouver.  At a time when western farmers are suffering through one of the worst droughts in Canadian history and one of the poorest harvest seasons, they are unable to move what little grain they managed to grow through the port of Vancouver.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the government had passed final offer arbitration when I first presented the bill in 1996, this work stoppage could have been averted.  It is time we had a permanent and fair resolution process that is removed from the whims of government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister stands idly by while the reputation of Canada's largest port and the livelihood of 650 grain handlers hangs in the balance.  Besides all of that, Canada's farmers deserve better.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, today is National Affordable Housing Day.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the government came to power we have seen a steady systematic  dismantling of federally funded social housing programs.  It is now to the point where the government has virtually removed itself from the business of supporting affordable housing.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier this week we heard a lot of talk, with the release of the government's urban strategy, the so-called “Blueprint for Action”, about the need for a national housing program.  I want to point out that the NDP and thousands of Canadians have been calling for such a program for years.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it was only talk because yesterday in the House, during the debate on Bill C-229, an act to amend the Bank Act, members of the government had the opportunity to stand up and be  counted and they did not.  What they did was they stood behind the banks and that is unfortunate  because the U.S. has this legislation and it has increased its affordable housing.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next time one of the Prime Minister's staff calls anyone in the U.S. a moron, maybe that person should consider reflecting on our own policy and direct that comment where it is more justly deserved.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a unique opportunity to reaffirm our values as a distinct society on the North American continent, with a language, a culture, a history and even a joie de vivre that truly reflect  the Quebec nation.

These ships were part of Operation Apollo, Canada's contribution to the U.S.-led campaign against terrorism.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first ships arrived in the north Arabian Sea exactly one year ago this week.  Among their many tasks the ships assisted French and U.S. vessels with maritime interdiction operations in the Arabian Gulf, joined the American Amphibious Ready Group as an escort ship, and conducted replenishment at sea operations  in the Arabian Sea.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the young ladies who proudly play for Canada's National Hockey Team, they are competing for the love of their sport and the pride of representing Canada, not for million dollar contracts. While women's sports are finally starting to get the attention they deserve, we still have a long way to go before we reach parity with men's teams.</p>

Thinking I had missed the same photo of the women's team, I called the paper to purchase the women's team photo.  A male editor of the paper informed me that the paper did not run a similar size photo of the women's team because Canadians did not have the same interest in women's sports.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ensure all athletes who represent Canada that Canadians are equally proud of  them regardless of their gender.</p>

Just during this past week, we have become aware that government intends to close down the cod fishery.  We are not saying whether that is right or wrong. That will be debated.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, at the same time other departments of government are also tightening the screws on the people of Newfoundland.  For example, the Department of Human Resources Development is closing down or cutting back on services in rural areas to save a minuscule $30,000.  It says that  some of the work done in the  rural areas does not fit the regulations precisely. This is a complete and utter embarrassment because the offices, particularly at this time, are so essential.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, the objective of Kyoto is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Since 1990, certain provinces, particularly Quebec, have made a considerable effort to do so.

Joe Clark (Calgary Centre, PC): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, earlier today I gave notice that I would be rising on a question of privilege.   Monday of this week, the government presented its response to written Question No. 10 concerning the cost of security at the two sites of the G-8 Summit, in Calgary and at Kananaskis, as well as the total cost of the Summit. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of departments provided figures: Health, Foreign Affairs, Industry, Justice, National Defence and Public Works, as did Correctional Services and Customs and Revenue Canada.  Yet the Solicitor General and the RCMP maintain they do not yet have a total for their costs.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The response from the Canadian Security Intelligence Service is a matter of huge concern to me, and should be to the rest of the hon. members as well.  CSIS stated: </p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right">

</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find this response, that it is a blanket policy not to disclose information to Parliament, to be troublesome.  I understand fully that some of the information in which CSIS deals must by its nature be treated as confidential.  There are specific cases, perhaps several of them, where national security can be involved. CSIS is stating a quite different principle here.  It claims to be beyond the reach of Parliament on every single issue.  It claims a right to live in a black hole and to operate without any responsibility to the House of Commons. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Department of National Defence does not claim that blanket exemption from responsible government although that department, too, deals in matters which must sometimes be held confidential.  The same is true of the Department of Foreign Affairs.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CSIS is not more important than these two departments.  Its attempt to put itself in a special, secret status above the rules, is a fundamental affront to this Parliament.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to know if this policy was established by the minister or have the director and the agency decided to thumb their noses at Parliament.  Are we supposed to blindly vote the funds for CSIS and never again think about those expenditures?  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have today written the chair of the Security Intelligence Review Committee to request answers to a number of questions, including how this policy was established.  At this time, I want to give notice to the House that I am reserving my right to raise this matter later as a possible contempt of Parliament.</p>

Don Boudria (Minister of State and Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I think the right hon. member is really referring to a point of order.  He is alleging that a Standing Order of this House was not respected by an organization.  It is stretching it to say that there is a question of privilege here.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. member:</b> That is the Speaker's job.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Don Boudria:</b> If the right hon. member can invoke that it is one point, I am equally entitled to invoke that it is something else, particularly when  I believe that the position I have is the correct one, just as he presumably thinks the same about his.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue in question, the right hon. member knows perfectly well, and even alluded to it during his answer, that because of the threshold of security for visits and anything else  of high security involving CSIS, there is a mechanism established by Parliament with a review  to have the threshold of security respected and the civilian overview that goes on top of that to protect Canadians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the estimates of that organization are tabled before the House.  The right hon. member knows that. That process carries through the House.  The votes are then proceeded with in  Parliament and those are all occurring.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The right hon. member says that he can understand why specific security issues involving CSIS should not be revealed.  In fact that is exactly what this is.  It involves probably the highest level of security that one could ever achieve; receiving heads of state of other countries. I will not refer to how that is in the language of the security community, but I think all of us recognize that visits of this nature must represent the highest threshold.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, the amount of resources that are utilized regarding a very high level security incident like this forms part of the information which must be kept by that  security community.  That is why we have the Security Intelligence Review Committee.  Not only that,  we have a committee of Parliament that  reviews its report in addition to that threshold. We all know that those points are not valid.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The right hon. member, having been a former prime minister and having been the minister of foreign affairs, will know of the level of security involved in foreign visits, particularly heads of state and heads of government.  He is well aware of all this, as we all are.  He was a member of cabinet that appointed members to the Security Intelligence Review Committee in the years presumably when he was prime minister, even though he was only there a short while, and when he was minister later on in another cabinet.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I will not take much time on this issue because I know how anxious we are to get back to a very busy government program.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After having listened to both sides of this issue, I would certainly strongly support the position of the right hon. member for Calgary Centre on this issue.  The government has been secretive in setting up new programs where members of Parliament are not given the information they require.  As always, Mr. Speaker, we will accept your ruling fully.</p>

	I note that the right hon. member for Calgary Centre did not ask the Speaker for a ruling.  He indicated at this time that he was giving notice of his intention to raise this question should he not get satisfactory answers from the Security Intelligence Review Committee.</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is, therefore,  a decision that is not before the House at this time.  The right hon. member for Calgary Centre no doubt greatly appreciates the comments by the hon. government House leader.  He will take them into consideration on his return to the House at a later point if necessary.  </p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he has now advance warning of what the arguments against his position will be, then I presume that he will load his arguments accordingly.  Of course, the government House leader also has notice of what is coming and he can prepare his argument in greater detail should it be necessary to do this at a later date.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, I note the Chair is absolved from any responsibility at the moment and will remain out of the fray.  We will wait to see if the right hon. member is satisfied elsewhere or  has to come back to the House.  Accordingly, we will leave the matter there.</p>

The result of the legislation that is proposed today is to increase a tax against a group of Canadians, as a matter of fact thousands of them.</p>

	<A NAME="Int-345443"></A><a HREF="#Int-345459"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-345442"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Réal Ménard: </b>

	Madam Speaker, it always pays to persevere in life.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was saying that every member of the Bloc Quebecois understands the importance of the issue of reproductive technologies. I am aware that this type of bill concerns one couple in five on average, since 20% of people experience reproductive difficulties at some point or other in their life.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we do have some real concerns, concerns that are shared by the Government of Quebec, led by Bernard Landry. Quebec's minister of health sent a letter to his federal counterpart, the federal Minister of Health, outlining some of these concerns.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we would like, is for the federal government to use the valid constitutional power that it has, under section 91.27 of the Constitution Act, 1982, to criminalize certain practices around which there is consensus for ethical reasons and because of our values.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the time I have left,  I will come back to the prohibited practices and the need to criminalize them. Remember that, since 1997, the Bloc Quebecois with its sense of responsibility it has always had, and through the member for Drummond, whom I would like to commend, has introduced a private member's bill three times, to criminalize cloning for reproductive and therapeutic purposes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back then, members will recall that the government had turned a deaf ear to the member for Drummond. If it were not for the member for Drummond, who is part of a too small group of visionary people who really paved the way for the government when it comes to reproductive technologies, I believe this government would never have acted with the diligence that we should expect from the members opposite.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would feel quite comfortable voting in support of a bill that would maintain the 10 prohibited practices in Bill C-13 as it now stands.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot be a party to an attempt to invade a provincial jurisdiction. Let me explain. With Bill C-13, a federal regulatory agency is established, which will administer an annual budget of $10 million and—who would have guessed?—regulate the medical profession. It will determine under which conditions physicians will be authorized by regulation to perform medical procedures related to insemination  or other activities related to reproductive technologies. In Quebec,  in the Act respecting health services and social services, section 112 confers that power to the Quebec health minister. So, let us not mix two debates and two issues that should be kept separate.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a society, we may say that certain activities are immoral, unethical, and as lawmakers, we may not be prepared to condone them; we have no problem with that. We may want to   prevent potential manipulations and such practices in government or private laboratories; we are willing to follow the government in that direction.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All our fellow citizens may not be aware of this, but I can sense the Chair's  contagious interest in this matter. Still, clause 5 of the bill lists 10 activities prohibited under Bill C-13. Once again, we hope this will be enacted in legislation, as was recommended   by the hon. member for Drummond, who is ahead of her  time in this field. Under clause 5, it is prohibited to create a human clone for reproductive or therapeutic purposes. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that each human being is unique, that each has a personality of its own, and therefore we do not want cloning to be made possible. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the government had been logical, had introduced Bill C-13 and had limited its scope to these 10 prohibitions, we would have immediately given our support to this legislation. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, when it comes to health, the federal government wants to engage in nation building, it wants to interfere and get involved in provincial jurisdictions. The Kirby report is indicative of this trend. The national forum on health, which proposed a  national pharmacare program, is also a case in point. On Thursday, we will see what the Romanow report recommends, but we think it is going to be more of the same. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Quebec government, which is one of the best to have presided over the future of Quebeckers, examined all the acts that would be deemed incompatible, totally or partly, with Bill C-13.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will tell you about this, if I may.  Our Civil Code—one of the things that is most distinctive about Quebec, since the rest of Canada has the common law tradition—this most important legal system prohibits such things as payment for the services of surrogate mothers, as well as reimbursement of surrogates or donors for certain expenses.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Civil Code, the legislator and the National Assembly  have taken stands on this issue, stating that donors and surrogates must live with their choices.   Donation must be a purely altruistic act, and that is why under the Civil Code no reimbursement of any kind is allowed. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-13 makes an exception to this principle and acknowledges  that certain expenses might be reimbursed with ministerial authorization.   The bill proposed to us is therefore incompatible with the wishes of the Quebec legislator. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is  also incompatibility with Quebec's Act respecting Health Services and Social Services.  As I have said, section 112 of this legislation empowers the minister of health to determine those facilities which will provide services relating to infertility and reproduction.  Any issues relating to the approaches to be used in this service delivery are determined by the legislation.  </p>


	<A NAME="T1225"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1225"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1230"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1220"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1225)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The regulatory agency would, therefore, be superimposed, adding another condition which is central to health and social services, although these are a provincial area of jurisdiction.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I trust that the government House leader will bow to this logic.  It is not too late to influence the Minister of Health, a lady who must be treated with kid gloves  because she can sometimes be a bit obtuse.  But I am counting on him. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also incompatibility with another piece of Quebec legislation, the Act respecting the Protection of Personal Information in the Private Sector.  If the regulatory agency did come into being, it would be possible, admittedly only with consent of the parties involved, but nevertheless possible, to disclose identifying information.  In Quebec, in such cases, such information cannot be disclosed under any circumstances.   </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore clear why it is important for all references to the assisted human reproduction agency of Canada to be deleted from this bill and for the provinces, which already have legislation on this, to be left to do their work.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The list of legislative measures is a lengthy one. It is a great shame that such a bill has been allowed to see the light of day.  The government is going to pay dearly for its desire to centralize. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, as I said, it is incompatible with the Civil Code, with the Act respecting health services and social services,  the act respecting access to documents held by public bodies and the protection of personal information, and the  act respecting the protection of personal information in the private sector, the act respecting medical laboratories, organ, tissue, gamete and embryo conservation, ambulance services and arrangements for corpses,  and last, but least, it is incompatible with Quebec's Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot mention Quebec's Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms without getting emotional. First, because the charter was one of the first ones in North America. It was adopted in its final version in 1977—the work on it having been started by the Liberals with Jérôme Choquette at the National Assembly—but it was really the Parti Quebecois government, a government that has always been progressive, which was the first  to give the charter its shape, and make it the envy of other parliaments.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course the charter contains provisions regarding the protection of life and the equality of citizens.  However, the charter also contains the right to confidentiality and the right to privacy. Section 10 of the charter also contains provisions on social condition. I have had the opportunity to speak to this on several occasions; there are only three provinces, and the federal government, that do not have provisions regarding social condition in their charters of human rights.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, rest assured that I am here, keeping an eye on the situation. I have sponsored a bill that has been chosen that would allow us to amend the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms to include social condition. While the government has done nothing, the Bloc Quebecois is fulfilling its responsibilities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, the bill is incompatible with Quebec's Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms, with the medical code of ethics, with the guidelines of the Quebec health research fund, better known to people in the field as the FRSQ as well as with the ministerial action plan on ethics and scientific integrity.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So clearly, the Government of Quebec has not waited for the federal government to get to work on the issue of assisted reproduction. The Government of Quebec took action. It has already established practices. Civil law has rules on a number of issues, but despite all that, the federal government once again wants to stick its big nose into areas that are not under its jurisdiction.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had the opportunity to meet physicians such as Doctor Bissonnette, not to mention names. This is a physician who is involved with the firm Procrea. They cannot see why, with the expertise we have in Quebec and what Quebec is doing, and doing well, in the field of reproduction technology, another structure, one which is cumbersome, inefficient and complicated,   would be superimposed on the existing one.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me touch on this briefly. There are at least 15 good reasons to defeat Bill C-13. If passed—thank goodness, this has not happened yet, and we will not let it be passed as it stands—Bill C-13 would block any new initiative by Quebec  to manage assisted reproduction techniques, even if Quebec has made strides in that field in the past decade.   </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The assisted human reproduction agency of Canada would superimpose a cumbersome and expensive structure on a system that has been tested and is already operational in Quebec. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to note that the Quebec government's approach is to empower the stakeholders, an approach which is not always compatible with this desire to make certain procedures illegal, except for the ones listed in clause 5, with whose prohibition we agree.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, the saddest thing about Bill C-13, and we will never tire of pointing it out, is that it infringes on the power vested in Quebec's Minister of Health and Social Services concerning the exclusive delivery of services under section 112 of the Act respecting Health Services and Social Services.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a direct infringement upon a provision of the legislation passed by the National Assembly, under which Quebec took its responsibilities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, criminal sanctions are created for medical procedures that have been enshrined in our civil law. I addressed earlier the whole issue of  paying surrogate mothers. Bill C-13 interferes with provisions of the Civil Code, particularly  with respect to the whole issue of consent to  treatment—the government House leader will recall that this is covered in articles  10 and 11 of the Civil Code—and that of the relationship of parentage as it regards adoption, and articles 538 to 542 of our Civil Code.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seventh, Bill C-13 does not reflect the positions taken by Quebec, particularly as regards adoption when we dealt with civil union. As hon. members know, Bill 84 was unanimously passed. It is rather unusual in our parliamentary system to have a bill that is unanimously passed. That was the case at the National Assembly with Bill 84, which instituted the civil union and which established new parentage rules.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-13 creates  discrimination between children who were born through the use of new reproductive technologies and the others, since there will be a national register in which information will be available. This information will not necessarily be made available to adopted children. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the saddest aspects of the bill is that it interferes with the confidentiality of assisted human reproduction files.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could go on and on, but I am asking hon. members to do something sensible and to allow this bill to be split, so that we can all vote as one. We know how beneficial this is for society. The bill could be quickly passed if it only dealt with prohibited activities. Let us leave it to the provinces, since it is their responsibility, to the extent that it relates to the delivery of health and social services, to adopt the practices relating to these issues, which are covered by clauses 25 to 39 of the bill. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think such a measure would reflect common sense. It would be respectful of our constitutional law and it would allow us to move forward very quickly on issues which, again, are extremely important from an ethical and moral point of view.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since my time is almost up, I am asking the House to unanimously agree to this motion.</p>

	Madam Speaker, I am quite familiar with Bill C-13, as the member knows.  This  issue related to criminalization matters as well as provincial equivalency agreements has been the subject of much debate. Indeed, the matter is still before committee and we do have the opportunity. I think the member has raised some interesting points.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, the Canadian Bar Association, I believe, made a presentation to the health committee specifically with respect to the criminalization of certain acts under the bill. It would be important if the member would like to comment on the following. If the legal community and Canadian law were to agree that the criminalization of certain activities that are prohibited under the bill should not be treated as criminal law, I wonder whether or not that would satisfy the member vis-à-vis what would be the case in Quebec.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, the Bloc Quebecois has been asking for a long time, through the hon. member for Drummond, that some prohibited practices be added to the Criminal Code.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation is as follows. If there were a void, as is the case at the moment—we might think of cloning for instance—and if those doing the cloning were not punishable under the Criminal Code, there would be very little deterrence. If we had a definite scheme and fines were provided for, it is quite possible that a large pharmaceutical company would not be deterred by  the risk of being fined $50,000, compared to the profits to be obtained from research that led it to do cloning.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that some practices must be prohibited under section 91.27 and that penalties must be provided for in the Criminal Code. However, the bill must not go any further. As for the rest, namely the regulatory agency, equivalency agreements and so on, they should not be legislated since provinces are responsible for offering services related to infertility through clinics, hospitals and local community service centres. These are public facilities funded mainly by the provinces.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why we ask that the bill be split. However, we believe that the 10 prohibited activities must be added to the Criminal Code.</p>

	Madam Speaker, the member has raised an interesting subject. I have to admit that I missed the early part of his intervention, so my question may ask him for clarification of something he has already covered.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill does raise some very challenging components. It is a very broad bill, purporting to cover assisted human reproduction but going into a very broad area of scientific research as well, such as issues of cloning and therapeutic cloning. We know that the bill would ban cloning and, at the current time, therapeutic cloning. There is still some discussion about that. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want some clarification.  In the area of regulation, scientists are certainly looking for a lot of openness.  There is a controversy about embryonic stem cells versus adult stem cells and a lot of questions remain to be answered on that front. There are very serious concerns concerning importing and exporting of sperm, of parts and even of embryos in relation to the bill, and even about the provisions regarding anonymity in donations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question is really about the equivalency provisions currently in the bill, which would allow provinces to have their own regulations that they could argue are equivalent to the federal jurisdiction. Does that not satisfy his concern about the provinces? It is still enabling an umbrella that would cover the country but allow provinces to make their own minor variations that they could argue are equivalent.</p>

	Madam Speaker, the hon. member knows that the current regulations already provide for the importation of sperm, an issue that raises many concerns, including possible contamination by infectious agents. We were told at committee about the regulations already in effect.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, prohibitions are the responsibility of the federal Parliament since they come under the Criminal Code. As for the rest, if the procedures are carried out in provincial institutions, then I think it is up to the provinces to determine if donor anonymity is possible or not.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first, in committee, I thought disclosure should be made compulsory. I have changed my mind, because now I understand that those who donate sperm are not doing so, for instance, to be able to raise a family. We fear that compulsory disclosure would allow the child to go to court to get a living allowance, student financial assistance, or similar things that have more to do with family law than with criminal law. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When sperm or ova are donated, it is not to help a family, but to help those who are facing fertility problems.</p>

	Madam Speaker, my colleague is right in mentioning that these issues are up to the provinces. For this reason, the only concern this Parliament should have is related to criminal law and to maintain these prohibited activities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to stem cells, what people  need to know is that what makes these cells special is that there are approximately 150 of them that are available in the first days after conception of an embryo. These cells are extremely malleable and they can be used to regenerate tissue to treat a number of debilitating diseases.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, using these stem cells requires destroying the embryo. This is an ethical and religious issue that is a concern for a great many of our colleagues here. I believe that if a person gives informed consent, if it has been proven to be unavoidable to use the cells, and research cannot be performed with other existing genetic material, then such a use should be authorized because it would  allow us to improve the human condition.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Women who go to fertility clinics and who undergo cycles of ovarian stimulation may produce several embryos. If these embryos are not used, they will be discarded and destroyed. I believe that with informed consent—obviously this cannot be done without the person knowing—this could be a good way to advance research. It is a way to improve the human condition, particularly in cases of cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy and juvenile diabetes.</p>

	Madam Speaker, I certainly appreciate the opportunity to ask a question on this matter. It is a very important issue. I am sure that at the root of my colleague's concern is the impact Bill C-13 would have on some provinces.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that Quebec is very concerned about embryonic stem cell research.  In fact some dialogue has taken place as to whether Quebec will allow embryonic stem cell research to be done there.  I applaud Quebec for that. I think it is a progressive move, one that is ahead of many other areas in the country.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the piece of legislation has an equivalency agreement contained within it.  If it allows embryonic stem cell research, which will take precedence: the provinces or this piece of legislation?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also wonder if my hon. colleague would speak to the reason why he wants this piece of legislation split, the appalling procedure of therapeutic and reproductive cloning?   If his province feels so strongly about embryonic stem cell research, does it also feel the same about cloning?  Is the idea that Quebec will not allow human cloning within the province on its books? </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also a bit confused about this jurisdictional thing, because we are seeing from the provinces intense pressure on Bill C-13 and this area, reproductive cloning.   I am a bit confused because my colleague, his party and his province seem less interested in provincial jurisdiction with regard to the impact of the Kyoto accord, which would have many more repercussions on his province than this bill would have. </p>

	Madam Speaker, as you know, this matter does not fall under my minister's portfolio but it is one in which I have played an active role in by informing myself about Bill C-13 and some of its important provisions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member who has just spoken has moved a motion in the House that would call on the Standing Committee on Health, which is presently studying Bill C-13, an act on reproductive technologies, assisted human reproduction, to have the bill split in two so that it can deal with matters related to the criminalization of practices such as cloning and have that handled in a separate bill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that the motion is relevant.  This is a very, very complex bill.  It is a bill that in fact has its genesis in a royal commission from at least 10 years ago.  The response of the public to it, certainly with regard to certain aspects, for instance cloning, I think was fairly definitive, but the science was evolving with a rapidity that the public was not able to really be fully aware of.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was an attempt in 1997, I believe, to have a bill that responded to the royal commission.  It did not get through the legislative process before the subsequent election.  It was not until this Parliament that a legislative effort actually came forward.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is interesting that after a number of years of having a royal commission, of certainly many people having advocacy positions with regard to reproductive technologies, both with regard to prohibitions and support for other aspects of reproductive technologies, the then minister of health came forward with a draft bill.  That draft bill went through second reading here and to committee, where over 100 witnesses were heard on a variety of aspects.  That is very significant.  Hearing 100 or more witnesses on a bill indicates that it is not an insignificant bill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to credit the committee with having prepared one of the most comprehensive, thoughtful and constructive reports of a standing committee, and on a very tough bill. That report was tabled in the House in December 2001.  The response of the then minister of health was to not address specifically the 34 recommendations of this report on the draft legislation.  In fact, on the last day on which it was possible for the minister to respond, the minister, and  I believe it was on May 9 of this year, tabled Bill C-56 in response to the draft report.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been changes made between the draft bill and this one.  One of the things I noticed was that in many of the clauses there was this standard phrase, for instance, “this is prohibited”, and then “unless otherwise provided for in the regulations”.  If we were to look at this bill we would find that reference to the regulations spread throughout the entire bill, to the extent that  I am not entirely comfortable that I know what the bill stands for in all regards and what I would be voting on if I were to vote for the bill, because I will not see the regulations until after the bill is passed and receives royal assent. This is backwards. I would like to see the regulations before the bill is passed.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the relevance here is that the member has raised an issue with regard to jurisdiction. It is an issue, particularly with regard to   criminalization related to the prohibitions. It is a relevant question and has been argued by others back at the beginning of the debate on Bill C-56, which transformed itself into Bill C-13 after   prorogation. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were calls for the bill to be split between the reproductive technologies part, i.e. cloning, genetic alterations, surrogacy issues, et cetera, and another part which dealt with issues, such as the restrictive use of stem cells from embryos for research purposes, a   very difficult issue for many Canadians because of the ethical implications.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This particular bill, as the mover of the motion laid out, includes provisions whereby if provinces have existing  legislation and regulations  in place that address elements of the proposed bill, Bill C-13, that with consultations and negotiations the provincial legislation or regulations would be the relevant or the operative jurisdiction on those matters where there was an agreement.  Therefore there are these kinds of provisions in there.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is   a rare case where  federal jurisdiction and federal law would be  seconded to a province.   At any point in time we can imagine what would happen if there was a case before the courts and somebody asked what the federal law said on it. The federal would say “This you cannot do, blah, blah, blah”. However it is subject to whether or not there is an equivalency agreement. The fine line of the law being what it is, the interpretation of whether or not there was an offence, criminal or otherwise, could be  very fine.  Therefore a significant effort would have to be made to ensure that should there in fact be any equivalency agreements, that those clearly reflect the legislative intent of the federal legislation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member who moved the motion did not mention it specifically but I thought it was interesting to note that the Quebec minister of, I believe, health and social services announced very quickly after the bill was tabled in the House that the province of Quebec would be banning the utilization of embryos for harvesting stem cells; in fact banning embryonic stem cell research outright. The words he used were “It is forbidden”. I remember reading that in the press article.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While all this is going on, we have a group called the Canadian Institutes of Health Research. It came forward with an interesting set of guidelines. It is the funding agency for publicly funded research in Canada, including things on embryonic stem cell research, and it has laid out the guidelines and the criteria under which they would permit such research.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was quite controversial to this place and certainly to the health committee because those guidelines were developed and it was announced that they would be in place almost immediately at the same time as the committee was in the middle of dealing with Bill C-56, the legislation on precisely that issue. The controversy was that we now had  another jurisdiction. </p>


	<A NAME="T1300"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1300"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1305"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1255"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1300)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This  agency was set up by the Government of Canada.  It  transferred funds to   publicly funded research projects.  I believe it was formerly called the Medical Research Council and is now called the Canadian Institutes of Health Research. It even brings more relevance to the question of whether or not there is a jurisdictional problem here, because it is not just the federal government and provincial governments, it is also funding agencies, et cetera. Our bill right now, I believe, but I do not have my papers with me, seems to take the approach that this is the law but if the law is silent on some aspect then that other aspect still comes into play. I am thinking of the tri-council policy statement that permits research on embryos up to 14 days.  We know that is in there.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I do not believe is fully covered in the bill is the element of education and training and whether or not all of the provisions with regard to the safeguards, controls, consent, et cetera, with regard to donations of gametes  or embryos for education and research purposes, are fully articulated in the current bill.  I think we may want to consider whether there has to be some amendments. That is another jurisdiction.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tri-council policy is basically the recognized leader or association of all researchers that  makes pronouncements and provides guidelines for all research.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, the tri-council policy statement and  the provinces all having the opportunity to establish equivalency agreements and negotiate those with the governments, and then we  maybe have another dimension that enters  into this and that is  the disciplines. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Bar Association, which appeared before the health committee yesterday,    said that it had   a problem with criminalizing prohibitive behaviour.  If a person makes a clone    that  is prohibited by this law should the person be treated as a criminal and   penalized as a criminal?  Bill C-13 says, yes.  The Canadian Bar Association says, no. Other representatives of the medical research community obviously have come to us and said, no.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we have, not necessarily a formal jurisdiction, but certainly an industry, that  being the lawyers, doctors, researchers and whoever else,  having a problem with jurisdiction. I do not know how they will fight their cases if every province will be able to establish their own rules and require respect for their laws, practices and regulations, which will be  incorporated, I guess  by reference, in this legislation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we are getting complicated.  This now is a multidimensional problem. The member therefore has raised  a quite straightforward motion, the implications of which are enormous.  They are enormous because if we open up this matter with regard to the criminalization issue we must necessarily open up the matter with regard to splitting the bill between reproductive technologies and related research.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eighty-five per cent  of the bill is acceptable to Canadians and to the House.  There was such a strong consensus on the bill, which  deals with cloning, genetic alteration, surrogacy for profit, et cetera, all in line with what the health committee report on the draft legislation laid out, that today the legislation would have been passed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it is not passed today and there is one reason and one reason only, and that is because the bill incorporated the whole aspect of related research.</p>


	<A NAME="T1305"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1305"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1310"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1300"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1305)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that research using embryos is an activity and that those embryos have to come from somewhere.  Where they come from and  prescribed to come from under the act is embryos which are surplus or left over after the process of in vitro fertilization, test tube babies.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only linkage to this bill is  the fact that those embryos are surplus to an IVF process.  The IVF process is part of the reproductive technologies bill.    It is a very small linkage.  This whole area of embryo related research, education and training, finding therapies and cures for Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, multiple sclerosis, cancer and  diabetes, is a wonderful science. I know of no one in Canada who is opposed to stem cell research because stem cells occur naturally in the human body.  Every organ in the human body has stem cells.  They also occur in placentas, umbilical cords, umbilical cord blood, aborted fetuses, as well as in embryos.  The only linkage of related research in Bill C-13 is the fact that   embryos   from the IVF process will be used in the research, and the IVF process is linked to reproductive technologies.   </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A perfect argument would be to say that we should split the bill and  take the reproductive technologies as one bill.  Eighty-five per cent of the substance of this bill is acceptable to Canadians and  to the House, party by party.  It could  be passed immediately and put into  law.  We could then ban cloning and    genetic alteration in Canada.  We would be able to deal with surrogacy for profit  in Canada.    We could have done this  a year ago  but the bill included related research.  Now we have a problem.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we look at the volume of the bill, we see   that only about 50% of the pages are on reproductive technologies.  The rest of the bill   sets up an agency.  We are going to set up an agency with a full time chair and representatives from all disciplines and  provinces, part time people, and their responsibility will be to license fertility clinics and researchers.  We are going to set up a bureaucracy. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On top of that, and I will not talk about it in any detail but I will just raise it, when we deal with research we are dealing with commercialization issues, and money gets made.  Things like generic drugs versus brand names,   the patent process and the legal issues of informed consent  really start to come in on the related research.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we look at this, the provisions to establish this agency are enormous.  After the bill gets royal assent, which I expect might be in a year from now, it will take an additional two years to establish this agency and the related regulations.    We are two and a half years away from  having laws on the books to ban cloning.  Shame.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would argue, just as did the member who moved this motion, that we should split this bill and get the related technologies out of it.  If it is going to take that long to come up with regulations to figure out how to deal with this, why not spend the time to look at this carefully, but let us get legislation on the books banning cloning, banning genetic alteration, and dealing with surrogacy for profit.  Let us get those other prohibitions on there and the other controlled activities.  It has nothing to do with embryonic stem cells.  It has to do with the fact that Canada does not today have any legislation whatsoever dealing with matters such as cloning.  We are one of the 128 countries in the world that  does  not even have legislation on these important matters. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We could have that legislation immediately. All  it would take is to split the bill.  I could make that argument just as well as the hon. member from the Bloc who moved this motion to split it.  With regard to jurisdictional issues it is tremendously complex.      </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has taken a long time to deal with the bill.  I suspect it will take a lot longer.  I know that members are very concerned about this issue.  Certainly there are ethical issues  that are involved which are not universal. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians must be heard.  We must respect the due process of the legislative process.  If it means that we have to have a vacuum in our legislation on matters such as cloning, because we have put things in there which perhaps should not have been there to make an efficient disposition of legislation, there is always time for common sense to prevail.</p>

	Madam Speaker, I appreciate the comments of my hon. colleague.  He knows the subject very well.  Some things have been excluded from his dialogue and it is probably because of a time restraint.  I am quite concerned about the issue and the idea of splitting the bill.  He has laid out the argument very well.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other nations have wrestled with the same difficult subject.  The United Kingdom has moved and has a regulatory agency.  It is probably the leader in the world as far as the direction of technology, the regulatory body and in some things it allows in the area of research.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Americans have also been wrestling with this.  Over the last year we have heard them say that there will be no embryonic stem cell research.  They have gone one step farther than that.  An advisory committee for President George Bush has suggested that embryos, the fertilization of an ovum and a sperm, should not be called an embryo but rather a human subject.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are the dialogues and what is happening in the States and has happened in the United Kingdom related to some of what we are wrestling with here?  Could the member shed some light on his feelings on that?</p>


	<A NAME="Int-345498"></A><a HREF="#Int-345505"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-345496"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Paul Szabo: </b>

	Madam Speaker, the member is also very knowledgeable.  He has been on this file since the very beginning.  Maybe Canadians do not know but he knows that the United States already wrestled with this one. With an election of presidents, the position of the U.S. government changed from President Clinton to President Bush.  Individually, they have different views.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current position of the United States of America with regard to the embryonic stem cell research is that there will be no more killing of embryos, no more killing of human beings. However, it did allow researchers to get public funding for the purposes of purchasing pre-existing stem cell lines that had been harvested from embryos prior to it coming to its position.  It identified that there were some 14 cell lines around the world that were available.  Oddly enough, I was very much surprised to find that the cost of a vial of stem cells was only $3,000.   If people can get what they want by purchasing vials of embryonic stem cells to do their research, that  raises some question about why they would  even want to go through the hassle of establishing an agency or the regulatory framework to ensure that there is this control.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member also mentioned the U.K. Last night I  printed off its bill. It actually had its genesis back in 1990, and there have been amendments since.  I looked specifically at schedule 3, an excellent schedule on informed consent.  In fact Dr. Françoise Baylis recommended  that we should have a similar schedule 3 in Bill C-13 to deal with the complicated issues related to what consists of informed consent, when that occurs, et cetera, and the implications.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We definitely have to apprise ourselves of the work that has been done in other jurisdictions.  We do not want to have to reinvent the wheel but we want to make it consistent with the intent of the legislation and compatible with the laws of the land, as they are a combination of federal and provincial laws and regulations.  Respect for the jurisdictional aspect is extremely important.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have asked at committee that a representative of the Government of Quebec, we were hoping either the minister of justice or the minister of health and social services, be invited to come to committee to help us to better understand the Quebec position.  We know that Quebec was very quick to review the matter and to give its preliminary view.  I understand its first step was to ban embryonic stem cell research outright.  Subsequently I understand it is open to following the CIHR guidelines on it, but  I am not sure.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will see some other things happening too.  Dr. Leon Kass is the head of President Bush's advisory council on biomedical research.  Dr. Kass is eminently qualified and highly respected in the field.  He is on record as recognizing that human life begins at conception as an undisputed biological fact.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President has specifically asked Dr. Kass and his advisory committee to pursue as vigorously as possible research related to the storage of ova, women's eggs, so that there would not be any surplus embryos from IVF and this entire debate on the ethical level could be dispelled.</p>

	Madam Speaker, I appreciate the intervention by the hon. member.  I know that he is very knowledgeable on this subject and has done a lot of research, particularly in the area of the stem cell research embryonic versus adult.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a lot of discussion today about which is the right way to go, not only ethically but scientifically.  We know that in our day we had tremendous breakthroughs, unlike the U.S. and Great Britain when they were dealing with this subject earlier. There really was confusion about which would be the right way to go.  It seemed  as though the industry felt it had to have embryonic stem cells.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However we have seen tremendous advantage in the plasticity of adult cells, which can change into different types of cells. Also, as he mentioned, we have tremendous possibilities  if   ova can be used.  Then we would not need to have a bunch of extra embryos created for the reproductive purpose.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Françoise Baylis did some research on  the effect of freezing these embryos and thawing them and on how many would be effective or would need to be destroyed in order to find any useful stem cells.  Could the hon. member comment on that?</p>


	<A NAME="Int-345507"></A><a HREF="#Int-345510"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-345505"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Paul Szabo: </b>

	Madam Speaker, the member will well know that when the whole issue on embryonic stem cell research came up, the assertion was that embryonic stem cells had more potential than adult stem cells, that is non-embryonic stem cells.  The member is quite right.  In fact there have been over 50 research papers since that time showing the plasticity or flexibility of adult stem cells.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably the most significant study comes out of the  University of Minnesota Stem Cell Research Institute, by Dr. Catherine  Verfaillie.  Dr.  Verfaillie has the research evidence now that stem cells taken from the bone marrow of a human being can be morphed or adjusted to become virtually any cell in the human body.  It can do anything an embryonic stem cell can do.  This is very significant because the intent of one of the recommendations, I think it  is recommendation 14, of the report of the health committee on the draft legislation is that embryonic stem cell research be permitted only if necessary and that necessary be defined as there is no other ethical alternative that could achieve the same research objectives.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the bill were to incorporate that definition of necessary, and I am not sure who could be against that definition, then the whole question of whether we want embryonic or adult stem cells used for therapies is moot because there is an ethical alternative.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On top of that, Canadians may not know this, but stem cells out of embryos have a different DNA than the patient in which  they would be used.   As such, if we were to  use those stem cells to treat someone else, there would be an immunosuppressive reaction, that is immune rejection.  It would mean that the patient would require lifelong anti-rejection drugs.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, adult stem cells would come out of the patient's own body.  They would be adjusted to become  the cells necessary to repair damaged cells.  They would be injected into the blood and automatically migrate to the area that had the problem.  All of a sudden, having the same genetic makeup and same DNA, there would be no rejection.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, if there is an ethical alternative and no need for anti-rejection drugs lifelong, why would we ever consider using embryonic stem cells?  That is why we had people like Dr. Ron Worton and Dr. Alan Bernstein advocating for therapeutic cloning, which is a process of taking the nucleus out of embryonic stem cells and re-introducing the patient's own cells, and that would be compatible.  The only problem is it is cloning. If we allow that new nucleus in there to start dividing, all of a sudden we would have a full human clone.  This is banned under the legislation. </p>

Don Boudria (Minister of State and Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.): </b>

	Madam Speaker, I am quite pleased to have the opportunity to speak in this debate on this important issue.  I had initially thought that we would deal with Bill S-2 today, which would have been my preference, as it is an important international treaty.  However that not been possible, we were then going to discuss parliamentary modernization, which I thought would have been our next subject.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a little peculiar because, at the same time we were going to discuss parliamentary modernization, we had the opposition today use a loophole of sorts to cause a vote on a  bill in which it was in favour  for no reason other than to cause an artificial delay.  That does not sound like a very modern thing to do.  Maybe it is because the opposition is not a very modern group.  That is okay.  It has  a right not to be modern. If it does not want to be, I cannot help it.   </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we have another motion brought to us with the alleged purpose of splitting a bill.  Perhaps it is a genuine purpose, I am not sure.  That is a real parliamentary procedure and there is no doubt about it. However I wonder about the application in this case.</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to quote the hon. member for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve.  He will no doubt be pleased that I am quoting what he said in a parliamentary committee.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During a discussion in committee, the hon. member for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve wondered about hearing certain witnesses again.  Being totally satisfied with the good work the committee had done to date, he was opposed to this.  I cannot fault him for that.  He said, “We now have 18 potential witnesses. We can hear them over three days at the most, if we have three meetings. Therefore, let us not get into ideological debates”.   He was speaking to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Public Works. He said, “The member has to sit down with the minister, who has to settle a certain number of issues, but he cannot transfer a debate that should be happening in caucus to the committee, because that does not make any sense. If clarifications are needed, I absolutely agree that this should happen, but I do not want the committee to become a hostage to those who want to wage a pro-life crusade and who want speak to defend ideological considerations”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He then went on to refer to Canadians and Quebeckers.  Quebeckers are, of course, automatically Canadians and proud of their citizenship.  We are proud of belonging to this fine great country.  I did not want to break into the quotation but I did want to cite it factually.  He went on to say, “Canadians, Quebeckers and members of the House expect new legislation as soon as possible”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went on to say “The Canadian Alliance, in its recommendation, asked us to table a bill as quickly as possible. Well then, that is what we must work towards. If we were to work every day next week, say from 10:00 a.m. until 8:00 p.m., we can get a serious amount of work done, but I hope that we can count on all the members around this table not to hijack the committee”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We see what is happening. The committee is still sitting and, today, the measure proposed in the House would have the effect of hijacking the committee. Yet, the hon. member told us that he was opposed to the idea of hijacking the committee. He did not have to say that. No one asked him to do so. He said it, presumably without being forced to. No one had wrestled him to the ground to force him to make that comment during the sitting of the parliamentary committee.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am quoting the proceedings of the parliamentary committee. Without being overly specific, this was said on June 6, 2002, at 10:57 a.m.. He concluded his remarks around 11:25 a.m.. So, as we can see, the hon. member for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve was then opposed to any measure that would have had the effect of delaying the bill presented by the minister. He was primarily opposed to members defending ideological concerns.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, the ideology that he expressed is to the effect that we must destroy everything that is federal and give it to the provinces. This ideology is a pretext to split the bill and delay its passage.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see that the Parliamentary Secretary for the Minister of Health is very concerned about the hon. member's suggestion. Like me, he has a hard time figuring out why the Bloc Quebecois member made such a quick about face. He wanted the bill to be passed quickly, that is until his recent conversion. Since then, for ideological reasons, he has been wanting to delay its adoption by splitting it, even before the parliamentary committee has made a decision and reported to the House. This is hard to believe.</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There a few more points that I think need to be raised before the House.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill was introduced and debated in the House and then voted on. The same member voted in favour of the bill. No motion was brought forward to split the bill at that time.  When the bill was before the  House no reasoned amendment was proposed, or anything like that, suggesting that the bill should not be read a second time and should be redrawn.  That was not done.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am told that the bill is established in a way to deal with provincial concerns, but whether that is or is not the case is surely an issue to be raised before the parliamentary committee on which the hon. member sits.</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to go back to my initial point, namely that the bill is before the committee. It is not before the House.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is with great regret that I see that I will not have enough time. I have so many things to say on this bill. We will have to conclude our remarks. Of course, we can carry on some other day and discuss this bill, even though it is with great regret that I must conclude.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam Speaker, you are indicating that, unfortunately, we are running out of time.</p>

	moved that Bill C-202, an act to amend the Canada Health Act (linguistic duality), be read the second time and referred to a committee.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said: Madam Speaker, I am pleased to rise, and I am doing so eagerly, to speak to Bill C-202, which will be debated in the House today for the first hour at second reading stage. Before going any further, I want to thank my colleague, the member for Beauséjour—Petitcodiac, for supporting this bill at first reading, and the member for Leeds—Grenville for supporting it at second reading.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said eagerly because I have been waiting for this moment for five years, since this initiative started its journey in the House in 1997. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bill would add a sixth principle to the Canada Health Act. This basic principle would ensure that Canada's linguistic duality is respected in the health care system everywhere in Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we put it like that, it sounds cold, legal and perhaps even incomprehensible  to people who have better things to do than to read the Canada Health Act, things like earning a living for instance. However, for those who, like us, look into issues that are of concern to Canadians and are responsible for deciding on the best course of action     for the future of one and all, this is downright scary.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is when people start looking for—and they always find some unfortunately—the kind of arguments that hold us back. The  most common one is that it is too expensive. Believe me, there will always be complaints about  anything having to do with the rights of minorities being too expensive.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That it is not true, however. Quite the contrary. Bill C-202 asks that we take account, and I quote, “of   the human, material and financial resources” of the facilities involved in developing health care access plans or delivering these services. No action shall be taken without looking at the capacity of each facility.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, with new technologies like telemedicine and diagnostic software, health care professionals will be able to provide services to several facilities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Granted, hiring personnel capable of providing health care services in both official languages will entail additional costs. However, given that health  care reform is unavoidable and actually well underway,  we need to train more physicians and nurses anyway. So, why not train enough health professionals capable of  working in both official languages of the country?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current political climate suggests that the Government of Canada  will have to reinvest in health care. So, with a sixth principle, a portion of the additional contributions would be dedicated to steps taken to respect the principle of linguistic duality. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other reaction we get to the addition  of a sixth principle is to say that this is an area that does not fall under the jurisdiction of the federal government. I say that it is not so.    Yes, and everyone agrees on this, health programs and their management are the responsibility of the provinces. But the Canada Health Act and the Canada Health and  Social Transfer are within the federal jurisdiction. In fact, the highest court in this land   has recognized the constitutionality of the Canada Health Act. It is wrong, therefore, to say that the Parliament of Canada cannot set the conditions for the transfer of credits to the provinces. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You do not have to be a rocket scientist to realize that Canada and each of its provinces and territories are having serious problems in the area of health, especially in terms of  ensuring that everyone has equal access to top quality health care and services.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole country is facing significant shortages in terms of doctors and health professionals. There are also too few nurses. We see a shortage of family physicians in big cities, something that, not so long ago, used to occur only in remote areas. Even at that time, it was unacceptable.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not blaming anyone, but we have to realize that governments were unable to find a solution and to stop that shortage from affecting the big cities and now almost everyone.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as if that were not enough, our governments now have to pay more just to maintain the current level of health care. A huge portion of every government's budget goes to health care. We restructure. We merge. We innovate. We introduce new methods. We close beds. We perform more day surgeries. We keep looking frantically  for a solution to this problem, which has reached epidemic proportions. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In its substantial report, the committee chaired by Senator Michael Kirby raises these concerns and proposes solutions. In Canada, the people wants this to be the number one issue.</p>

	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following those words from Mr. Romanow, I remind members that all minority language communities in Canada support the bill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Umbrella organizations, which represent those communities, namely the Fédération des communautés francophones et acadiennes du Canada, or FCFA, and the Quebec Community Groups Network, or QCGN, asked that a sixth principle be added to the Canada Health Act. Those groups made that request to Mr. Romanow during his Canada-wide hearings and they made the same request to the Senate committee chaired by Senator Kirby. Our communities want it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This debate and the subsequent vote will not be an easy task, but hon. members will agree that we are not here to make easy decisions. If everything always went well, we would not even need to be here. We are here because the task is difficult and because people, in each of our ridings, regardless of the political party or the region, expect us to deal with issues that are difficult but important for their future.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I dare say that issues dealing with linguistic minority rights are central to our idea of this part of America, where we chose tolerance and diversity rather than the absolute quest for uniformity. We have chosen difficult tasks because they allow us, collectively and individually, to reach a higher level.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All parties in the House acknowledge the relevancy of Official Languages Act, the rights of Canadians enshrined in the Constitution and the preponderance of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. We all have undeniable rights.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the Canadian Alliance which, as the former Reform Party, did not consider linguistic duality as important, in its policies, now acknowledges the importance of our two official languages, and I quote:</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one will be surprised to hear that the million francophones making up minority communities in Canada have an urgent need for services and health care in their language. A study published by the Fédération des communautés francophones et acadiennes, the FCFA, indicates that at least half of that community has no access to health care in French.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of  Intergovernmental Affairs, the member of Parliament for Saint-Laurent—Cartierville, has recognized the difficulty minority communities experience in accessing proper health care services in their official language.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addressing the Quebec Community Groups Network on October 20, he said:</p>

This is particularly relevant because a greater proportion of the anglophone community is 65 years of age or older...and more likely to use the health care system.... This older population also tends to be far more unilingual: 56% of them do not speak French.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister also said that access is particularly difficult outside the greater Montreal region.</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as I am concerned, we have first and foremost a moral obligation to these communities. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, I would like to underscore to the government and the cabinet that there is a constitutional obligation to add this sixth principle. I realize that, when the Canada Health Act was enacted, it was left out. Our history is full of such omissions, but also corrections that we have made when our mistakes became apparent.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the Official Languages Act of Canada require that the federal government take into consideration linguistic minorities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While this may not have been clear in the past, it is quite clear now. All of the successive judgments from the courts have confirmed this constitutional obligation, particularly judgments handed down by the Supreme Court of Canada on Quebec's secession and in the Beaulac decision, not to mention the unprecedented decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal in the Montfort Hospital case.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I would go so far as to say that if the Government of Canada ignores its responsibilities, how can we expect provincial governments to shoulder theirs?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Official Languages Act, backed by the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, particularly at section 16, requires that all Government of Canada programs take into consideration our linguistic duality. Without a doubt, this includes the cash transfers to the provinces for health care services.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, one only has to read the Canada Health Act to realize that failing to specify the vital nature of services to minorities was an oversight. Take only a few of these principles that are considered sacred by Canadians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take universality. If service delivery is to be universal in a country where there are two official languages, then it goes without saying that we must  serve linguistic minorities the same way we serve the majority.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to accessibility, having equal access to health care services no doubt means access to services in one's own official language.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for portability, let us reflect for a moment on what is included in this principle. It says that we will be treated as we would be treated in our home province, should we need to call upon health care services in a province other than our home province.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some Canadian provinces, residents  enjoy linguistic rights when it comes to health care services. This is the case in New Brunswick, which is the only officially bilingual province.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us ask ourselves this question: can Canadians who have certain language rights with regard to health care in their province of residence transfer those rights to the other provinces, particularly the ones that do not offer these language rights to their own residents?  We have to wonder about that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the principle of transferability, or portability,  in the health care system implies language rights for some Canadians, should we not ensure that these rights are extended to all Canadians, regardless of their province of residence?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite these arguments that I believe to be sound, some will ask whether the existing principles imply respect for linguistic duality. If the act, the charter and the unwritten principles in the Canadian Constitution already require that minorities be protected, why add a principle that may be redundant after all and therefore useless? </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know the answer to that question. We have learned, after nearly a century and a half of history that, unfortunately, keeps repeating itself, that we cannot rely solely on the goodwill, the understanding and the vigilance of our governments with regard to linguistic duality.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why we legislate. This is why we have a Constitution. This is why we have a Charter of Rights and Freedoms. It must be written in black and white in our statutes. And even then, we know that we have to be vigilant.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will ask those who argue that it is not necessary to add a principle to protect our country's linguistic duality with regard to health care a question that is just as valid. If the existing principles imply respect for linguistic duality, why then would anyone be afraid of adding such a principle?</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here again, we know the answer, and it is not pretty. The truth is that, politically, it is not worth it. It creates problems for nothing. In Canada, as we know, linguistic issues have always been explosive.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we are back to square one, caught in a vicious circle of our own creation, immobilized by fear, unable to act, while the rights of the linguistic minorities keep on being ignored.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How many more court decisions will it take before we take action?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may, I will appeal to your sense of history, our history. We are all victims of misinformation when it comes to our history, which includes having us believe that the founders of  our country were not preoccupied by linguistic duality. It is  absolutely not the case.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Fathers of Confederation took the bold step of creating a new country, 135 years ago, they would not have conceived of Canada not respecting the rights of its linguistic minorities. The protection of these minorities was the underlying principle in all their efforts and actions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If ever there were any doubts regarding their intentions, the decision of the Appeal Court of Ontario in the Montfort case erases them all. The judges of this highly respected court wrote, and I quote:</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The court also quotes a reference to the Supreme Court dated 1932, in which Lord Sankey wrote, and I quote:</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is high time we lived up to the promises made by the Fathers of Confederation. It is time to set aside our traditional arguments. It is time to make hard decisions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the law, under our Constitution, in keeping with  our history, and in the name of the legacy we will leave to humanity, in the name of everything good this country represents, in the name of past,  present and future generations, I urge this House to demonstrate a spirit of generosity, the Canadian spirit, when it comes to this bill.</p>


	<A NAME="Int-345534"></A><a HREF="#Int-345539"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-345518"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ): </b>

	Madam Speaker, first, I wish to congratulate the member for Ottawa--Vanier.  I know he has been interested in this issue for years and have no difficulty in acknowledging his sincerity and his staunch convictions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have consulted with my colleague from Repentigny, the Bloc Quebecois official languages critic.  It is true, as the hon. member for Ottawa--Vanier has said, this is not an easy position to determine.  The right to be served in one's own language contributes not only to people's happiness, but is also an inalienable right.    It is unbelievable, in a country that claims to be bilingual, that people in crisis situations requiring them to seek health care should be unable to obtain services  in the language of their choice. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem—and this is where I differ with my colleague from Ottawa--Vanier must accept—is that we do not in fact believe that Canada is a bilingual country, nor do we believe that it can be one.  That is the first point on which we differ with the hon. member for Ottawa--Vanier.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second is that we have never accepted the legitimacy of the Canada Health Act.  My colleague invited us to review history and I believe he was right to do so.  The health act was enacted in late 1984, when the government of Pierre Elliott Trudeau was in its last days.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was such a controversial act that it triggered a doctors' strike in Ontario.  It is not a common occurrence for physicians, even those paid from the public purse, as they are in most provinces—</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. member: </b>We have seen that in Quebec.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Réal Ménard: </b>And not just in Quebec.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. member: </b>We have had that in Quebec recently.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Réal Ménard: </b>But not for the same reasons, sir. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, in 1984, Ontario doctors went out on strike, but not on the language issue.  It was because they said their ability to organize themselves as self-employed workers was threatened.  But all parties were in favour of the Canadian act. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Mulroney had been elected in a byelection and all parties represented in the House in 1984 were in favour of the act, but the bulk of the provinces were not.  The bill was passed, regardless. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They played around with various scenarios of constitutional challenge.   I studied constitutional law with the member for Chapleau and I do not think he can be suspected of having sovereignist leanings.  So the  National Assembly member for Chapleau, Mr. Pelletier,            who is a very good teacher by the way, told us that, strictly speaking, a constitutional challenge would have been possible.  In 1984, the government passed the Canada Health Act not because it had jurisdiction in that area, but by virtue of its overall spending authority.  We must never forget that this is the authority under which this legislation was passed. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I appreciate what the member for Ottawa—Vanier is doing;  once again, I think he is a sincere man and I do not say that every day,  so I really believe his efforts are genuine and that he has been fighting this battle for a long time.  However, should we not state clearly  that this is a provincial jurisdiction and that provinces should be responsible for providing services to minorities in their own mother tongue?  Yes it is important.  It is bad enough to be sick; one does not choose when this will happen, any more than one decides to have bad luck, but if and when we are  sick, it is unconscionable that we should depend for our care on people who do not speak our language, who do not understand us.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that this cannot be a federal area of  responsibility, especially not health care services.  The member for Ottawa—Vanier is asking us to  endorse a very noble value. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier, a member said that there is one officially bilingual province in Canada. But in reality, as we know, there are two, because bilingualism also exists in Quebec. It is such a noble value that, in Quebec, there are public institutions, including the  educational system  from kindergarten to university, which are funded by the state. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the laws in Quebec—and this is true for the health care system where, of course, this is legislated—the Anglophone minority, which is made up of just under one million people, can have access to health care services in its own language. This is entirely desirable. We must evaluate societies and our ability to live together. The test of civilization is the interest we take in our  minorities. There is no doubt about that.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one, and certainly not I, would like to live in a society where, because of the influence and tyranny of the majority, a minority would be deprived of certain services in its own language.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member for Ottawa—Vanier knows as well as I do the sorts of setbacks that francophones living outside of Quebec have suffered in this regard in the past. However, the past must not be allowed to dictate the course of the future. It is not because francophones outside of Quebec have experienced injustices, of which the member for Verchères—Les-Patriotes has reminded us, that we should not envisage the future with much nobler ideas and a desire for equality.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that the battle that the member for Ottawa—Vanier wants to wage should also take place in the provinces. All the provinces, from Newfoundland to British Columbia, must undertake to offer services both in French and in English. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon. members will recall that  at the  in 1977, René Lévesque—whom I am not sure is considered an icon by all members of this House—had proposed a goal somewhat similar to the one pursued by the member for Ottawa—Vanier. Obviously he did not want the federal government calling the shots. He suggested that there be interprovincial agreements. The Bloc Quebecois members would feel much more comfortable with that sort of scenario. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am in total agreement with the hon. member for Ottawa—Vanier that this must not be a money matter. Access to services, especially at a moment in life when people are not at their best,  should not depend on financial means. I cannot go along with the argument that this is implicit in the legislation. The five conditions mentioned by our colleague do not show any bias for or against the delivery of services. She explained which principles should apply.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been the Bloc Quebecois critic for health care since 1997. When public servants appear before the health committee, they state that those five principles are national standards. The legislation does not state that they are, but public servants do. We know that the federal government does not have any expertise in health care, except as concerns the aboriginal people, inmates serving a sentence of more than two years, and research in epidemiology and on immunization.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why we think we should not have a Canada Health Act. I can tell the hon. member for Ottawa—Vanier that if he were to launch a crusade to create a coalition to make sure, through interprovincial agreements, that all provinces provide adequate services to their national and historical minorities, he could count on me. I would wholeheartedly join his campaign, and I am sure most members in the Bloc Quebecois would do the same.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish  the hon. member for Ottawa—Vanier good luck, and I thank him for his initiative. I hope he will nonetheless consider that our argument has at least some historical merit and some basis in law.</p>

	Madam Speaker,  it is with pleasure today that I rise to speak to this important bill, Bill C-202, standing in the name of the member for Ottawa—Vanier. I feel very passionately about this bill. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a member of the Standing Joint Committee on Official Languages, I come across all sorts of things concerning the legislation on bilingualism in Canada. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill proposed by the member for Ottawa—Vanier focuses on the health sector.  It deals, more specifically, with a sixth principle to be added to the Canada Health Act. This is an important issue, which members will have to seriously consider.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am really disappointed that the Canadian Alliance decided not to address this issue, today. But we shall see what happens in the coming hour.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should learn to accept the reality of official languages, not merely respect it. Furthermore, this issue goes beyond official languages. It is  about respecting others.The purpose of the bill is to help people. It is a bill about linguistic duality in the health sector.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The place of French and English, in minority communities, is a current issue. A few days ago, the Commissioner of Official Languages tabled a report asking that the government do more on this issue. The Commissioner's efforts do have some impact. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days ago, in this very room, an hon. member challenged the role of official languages in the public administration. We cannot tolerate such unparliamentary language by members. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We still have a long way to go. We need the change mentalities and behaviours, which is even more difficult. Believe me, we have had a lot more examples of that this week.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, a few minor improvements can easily be accomplished. A bill or a motion could be more helpful than we think. I am glad to see this bill from the member for Ottawa—Vanier being introduced here. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I concur with the idea to introduce an appropriate bill whose purpose is  to help people. However, I can only object to a member bringing  forth a destructive bill or uttering racist comments. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is often assumed, incorrectly, that all the people's rights are protected by the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. This is a wrong assumption.The charter provides a certain amount of protection to francophones and anglophones, but it is not enough. In most of the provinces,  rights recognition did not translate into meaningful action, especially in the health sector.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-202 is quite simple. It is so simple that everyone here can understand it. If we give it some thought, it makes no sense to oppose it. The bill establishes that language will not be an obstacle for people when they seek care, when possible.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is simply common sense. The country has two official languages and still people cannot receive hospital care in the language of their choice.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important thing  in life is one's health.  Ask someone who is sick if he would prefer money or health. If we asked someone who is rich and healthy which he would choose between the two, he will go for the million dollars. But ask someone who is sick which is more important. He will answer health. He would give anything for his health. Imagine then, when it comes time to seek medical attention, if he cannot talk to the doctors or nurses in his own language. He cannot even describe his condition in his own language.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is when Canadians must show open-mindedness. Quebec, New Brunswick, Ontario, Manitoba, British Columbia, all the provinces of Canada must be open to these two communities, the French-speaking and English-speaking communities, so that people can  receive treatment in the language of their choice and understand what they are being told. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. member for Ottawa—Vanier is proposing that a sixth principle be added to the Canada Health Act. Great. Adding a sixth principle to the Canada Health Act makes sense. Canada is a bilingual country. Debates in the House of Commons, as well as federal government documents, must be bilingual. Since     the federal government is giving money to provincial governments for health, it makes sense that  it would enforce its own  bilingualism requirements.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With all due respect to Bloc Quebecois members, including my hon. colleague from Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, I am sure they are going to argue that this is a provincial jurisdiction. I respect their opinion. But at the same time I would expect the opinion of Canadians to also be respected. If the government is going to spend money in an area, it should have a say. In many parts of Quebec, people who speak English are respected. I am sure,  however, that there are places where they are not.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. member:</b> Where?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Yvon Godin: </b>Such as in New Brunswick.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. member: </b>In the Gaspé; in the Eastern Townships.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Yvon Godin:</b> I will not talk about Quebec, I will talk about New Brunswick. We were forced to fight in that province, where bilingualism is officially recognized. We were forced to fight to get services in French in Miramichi, in my province, and I am not proud  of that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, in New Brunswick, in the region of Bathurst, where francophones account for 85% of the population, they decided to make the hospital in Bathurst a bilingual hospital because we believe in our two communities. The government and the residents of that region made that decision while taking provincial jurisdictions into consideration. I salute them. We are talking about human beings, about sick people. How can we not respect that?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the way it is. Some provinces are not prepared to do that. The bill tells the federal government “You should be the watchdog in this regard, since there is a national act on bilingualism in Canada. There are two recognized peoples, the francophones and the anglophones”. Many francophones from northern Ontario may get services in French. But those from southern Ontario or northern Manitoba, from Saskatchewan or from British Columbia must also be able to get services in their language. As human beings we have a responsibility.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are francophones and anglophones in this country who cannot understand those who provide care to them. Is this logical? Is it logical that a patient would get important instructions on his health without understanding them, just because the caregiver cannot speak to him in his language and there is no other option? Is it logical that someone would contact the hospital to get information and not be able to find anyone to speak to him in French or in English? </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Efforts are being made in Canada, but it is time for the federal government to do its share to ensure the delivery of health care in French and in English. As I said earlier, efforts have been made in New Brunswick and in Quebec. But I would not even give carte blanche to these two provinces. There is still a lot of work to be done. But the rest of the provinces should also make the same efforts.  Imagine what they could accomplish if they did. I do not see why the other provinces should not do the same.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To those who are against this bill, especially to the members in this House who argue that the federal policies are racist, I would be very glad to point out that the bill is for both French-speaking and English-speaking Canadians. It deals with the two languages recognized in Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to commend the hon. member for Ottawa Centre for his bill. It is a very important piece of legislation concerning both our official languages. Again, I am sorry that the Canadian Alliance, chose not to take part in this debate.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to find out what they think of Canada's two official languages. It is unfortunate, but it is their decision and I will respect it. But I want Canadians to at least realize that it is as if they do not recognize our official languages. It is important to the people of Prince George, in British Columbia. It is important to the French minorities in Alberta. It is important to the English minority in Rivière-du-Renard and it is important to all Canadians.</p>

	Madam Speaker, I find it rather interesting to be told over and over that my party has chosen not to speak to the bill, since I like to hear debates.  I like to hear people's arguments.  I like to find out what they have to say.  Because I do not have a prepared speech I wanted to hear the points of view of different members before I got up to speak.  It was rather unfair of my colleague to say that the Alliance has chosen not to speak just because I did not get up immediately after the member. I think that was an unfair comment.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to make a few comments.  We have had some experience recently with the medical system.  The issue in the bill before us, as the member who presented it has said, is to make sure that health care is available universally for people in Canada. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My family has had some recent experience with the medical system. I saw my mother suffer for eight hours waiting for health care for a fractured hip.  This happened on the day of my dad's funeral. I know where I would put the money for health care. I would make sure that competent staff is available so that health care is available in a timely manner for someone suffering as my mother did.   It was distressing for us to leave her in the hospital while we went to my dad's funeral waiting to know what was going to happen.  Nobody was able to look after her.  After eight hours the hospital  finally decided to move her by ambulance over Saskatchewan's roads to the Regina hospital.  Very frankly, that caused us more distress than the fact that we were to attend my dad's funeral. I do not think anyone would argue  that a viable health care system is high on everyone's priority list.   I do not think there is an argument there.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to the availability of healthcare  in the provinces, it is very interesting that this member should have this bill.    I had a visit from a constituent, a couple of years ago now, who had the misfortune of having a heart attack when he was visiting his relatives in Montreal.  He was in the middle of a heart attack and needed health care, but before the hospital  would serve him he had to post a bond or give the hospital a cheque. The hospital in Montreal would not accept his Alberta health care card.   It was not an issue of language at all.  He had to write the hospital a cheque  before the hospital would look after him. He came to my office to complain about this. He asked if this was what the Canada Health Act was about and wanted to know what was meant by universality. We checked into it and found that there had been a little glitch in the system.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the member when he says that health care should be available. Maybe I should not be throwing out ideas just off the cuff because someone is liable to say it is Canadian Alliance policy. I want to emphasize that it is not.  It is a question, though, that we should ask.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a massive intrusion by the federal government  into our health care system.  As my colleague from the Bloc said, the government did it originally by the simple brutal application of its spending power.  It was able to tax Canadians. It was able to give money  to the provinces for health care.  The government originally put 50% into health care and there was hardly a province that could say it would not participate, because that is an awful lot of money.  Over time the government has so eroded its health care contributions that some provinces are receiving less than 15%.  Less than 15% of their health care costs, in some cases, is derived from the federal government.     </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I am putting out a little feeler.  Maybe we should seriously start considering changing our Constitution so that we in fact have a national health care system.  Perhaps we should change our Constitution so that the federal government does have a role to play. This would ensure that Canadian citizens, when they go from Alberta to Quebec or from any province to any other province, can present their Canada health care card and receive proper medical service right then and there, no questions asked, instead of having this interprovincial thing.  </p>


	<A NAME="T1410"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1410"><!-- Hour: 2--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1415"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1405"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1410)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also hold the federal government totally responsible for the fact that it has been unable to negotiate between parties, between the provinces, so that there would be a full accession to the universality clause in the Canada Health Act.  It has to be there.  If we are going to have a Canadian health care system that meets the needs of Canadians, then we had better be able to go anywhere in Canada, present our card and say, “I am entitled to this kind of service”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also want to say something with respect to the language part of the bill. In hospitals I have visited, I have observed the need to be able to communicate.  That is absolutely critical.  In one instance I am thinking of right now, there was a person who spoke neither of Canada's official languages. I would like to say, with great respect for the particular hospital involved, that it bent over backwards to find a person who could interpret from the language of the person into, in this case, English, so that the communication between the doctor and nurses to this individual who could not speak either language was facilitated.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw the same thing not long ago at the airport. A person spoke neither English nor French and a member from the Air Canada staff spoke to her in German.  I know just enough  German to be able to understand that it was German she was speaking, notwithstanding that was my first language.  Over the last 40 years, I have lost it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to say it is true that if one wants to retain a language over time one has to take extraordinary measures.  In my family that is very obvious.   Our family came to this country not speaking English. Now all  my cousins, all their children and mine, and all the grandchildren and everyone are fully unilingual English and almost none of them speak German.  We lost that language because we were assimilated into the English language. If one's goal is to maintain the French language, then yes, one must take extraordinary steps to maintain it and that is a whole other debate.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very pleased to participate in debate on the bill.  I found the debate very interesting and certainly it is an issue that we should pay a great deal of attention to,  particularly on delivery of health care services to all Canadians regardless of where they happen to be at the time within our country and irrespective of their ability to pay.</p>

	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will begin my remarks by offering my congratulations and good wishes to my colleague from  Ottawa—Vanier.  I recognize, as do members of the House, that the member has long been a champion of and a contributor to the defence of minority linguistic rights in Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say with some humility on behalf of the Progressive Conservative Party that we too have always respected the linguistic duality of the country and have a record to back up that assertion.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to my colleague's initiative before the House, I want to note some of his commitments and contributions in the past.  As this is a private member's bill, it is clearly the position of our party that in keeping with the best traditions of respecting an issue as important as this, we will be permitting our members to freely vote their conscience and vote freely on behalf of their constituents on this matter. I also want to assure the hon. member that this initiative will be taken very seriously by the Progressive Conservative Party, for the very reasons I have stated.</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Progressive Conservative Party has always taken an interest in issues concerning the official languages. The French fact in Canada is something that has shaped our history, our culture and our future.</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along with the ethnic diversity and our long historic relationship with first nations people, our linguistic duality contributes to the richness of the country and the entire Canadian experience. I would suggest it also contributes to our ability to connect and to associate with the wider world.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specifically with regard to minority linguistic rights, the Conservative Party of Canada has always sought to defend the minority against the natural intrusions that come about as a part of majority rule.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under a Conservative government, the linguistic status of New Brunswick was enshrined in the Constitution.  Our government provided substantial financial assistance to the province of Manitoba when it was required by the court to translate rulings of all its statutes.  There is a history of action on this file.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure  Quebeckers in particular  will recall the attempts we made through the Meech Lake accord to further protect the rights of linguistic minority communities throughout Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also want to note that language is very much a determinant of health, which is the pith and substance behind the hon. member's motion.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, according to recent studies, statistical and anecdotal evidence suggests quite clearly that francophone communities in which  services are available in French tend to be healthier than communities in which services are only available in English, in one language.  That stands to reason for clearly an individual's ability to communicate with the  health care provider in a language in which the individual is comfortable is extremely important. That comprehension, that comfort level is extremely important.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would go further in suggesting   it is important for health care response and also  the preventive elements of health care.  In fact  in keeping with some of the Romanow recommendations that are anticipated, there is a greater need to allow health care service providers to  help Canadians anticipate and cut off some of the actions,  behaviours and  health risks in a proactive pre-emptive way.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It stands to reason that whatever minority language, French or English, if a patient is unable to understand and  communicate effectively on their very treatment, on their very health,  this is something we have to take very seriously and we have to respond to.  This is very much  the spirit of the bill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not want to undermine that sentiment,   I would  like to put on the record a few reservations  I have about the bill itself.  First and foremost, it is fair to say that the atmosphere, the crisis that is facing health care in the country today places it as the number one priority for most Canadians.  For those in government at all levels this is what has been dominating the debate. That is in no way to take away from the thrust of the bill.  However, I suggest reservedly that there are higher priorities on how we bring about  improvements in the health care service.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The federal government  already is not doing its fair share when it comes to health care funding.  The provinces are strapped for cash and it is inconceivable that the government would impose another condition on the provinces without equally appropriate financial assistance.  That is to say given the current state,  figures suggest that as little as 18 cents on every dollar that is spent on health care in most provinces comes from the federal government. The rest is carried and picked up by the provinces.  To put a system in place, as laudable as it is in this case, that would not be accompanied with sufficient and significant cash increases would further impinge upon the provinces' ability to deliver health care.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not want to go off on a partisan jaunt, but we have heard a great deal from the former finance minister about the democratic deficit.  At the same time that particular individual likes to claim ownership over having defeated the deficit.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened is the deficit was transferred.  It was transferred to the provinces and deficits were created in other areas such as health care, the military, and education for students. These are  very telling issues when one looks at priority spending and  at responsibility and accountability for the status of health care today.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The  Progressive Conservative Party has been calling for a sixth principle to be added to the Canada Health Act.  This bill  in essence calls for  the creation of a sixth principle in the Canada Health Act. However,  instead of binding provinces further, our sixth principle would in fact bind the federal government to stable funding for health care.  Then and only then would I suggest we would be able to add the further principle envisioned by the hon. member's bill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the hon. member for Ottawa--Vanier has brought forward a  very worthwhile proposal, but it has to be viewed in the broader context.  It has to be viewed through the lens of the status quo of health care as it exists today.  Without stable funding, all of the other principles are meaningless.  Creating new principles would simply further act as a drain on those who are tasked with the very serious day to day delivery of health care.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When one examines any social issue at this  point in our country's history, that has to be part of the discussion. The current crisis today in health care has to be laid directly at the feet of the federal government because of cuts to transfers.  Cuts to transfers in Canada's health and social spending have devastated the health care system and it has whittled away at the status in every province. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the member at some stage might review  his proposal and  add an explicit commitment that any movement on this front would be accompanied immediately and automatically by increased funding to accomplish this worthwhile initiative.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also note that Canadians are still waiting for action from the government on health care.  We have heard a great deal about the various reports, the Mazankowski report, the Senate report, the upcoming Romanow report.  If we were to speak to any nurse or doctor in any community in this country, they would tell us what is wrong with health care. While a patient has to wait for basic treatment, the government has indulged itself in a dance of all these different studies.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again I strongly urge the member for Ottawa--Vanier to put his issue to the government so that it can consider within the wider context of health reform this very principled, very worthwhile initiative.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that principle, I recommend that we recognize the practical reality of the other circumstances that affect the consideration of his bill.  I am sure the member would agree that a reasonable means test be applied to provinces and communities.</p>

	I am now prepared to rule on the point of order raised earlier today by the hon. government House leader concerning the bill introduced by the hon. member for Calgary Southeast. I would like to thank the government House leader for having raised this matter as well as the hon. member for Calgary Southeast for his comments.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill proposes an amendment to the Income Tax Act that would have the effect of eliminating from the act an existing exemption from taxation for allowances paid to elected provincial or municipal officials for some expenses that are incidental to the discharge of their duties.  The net result of the elimination of these exemptions would be an increase in the level of taxation for affected taxpayers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As stated in a ruling on October 24, 2002 regarding another private member's bill, a bill of this nature can only be brought before this House if it is preceded by the adoption of a motion of ways and means.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As <i>House of Commons Procedure and Practice</i> states at pages 758-9:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right">
</td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>The House must first adopt a Ways and Means motion before a bill which   imposes a tax or other charge on the taxpayer can be introduced.... Before taxation legislation can be read a first time, a notice of a Ways and Means motion must first be tabled in the House by a Minister of the Crown--</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, it goes on at page 898 to state:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right">
</td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>With respect to the raising of revenue, a private Member cannot introduce bills which   impose taxes.  The power to initiate taxation rests solely with the government and any legislation which seeks an increase in taxation must be preceded by a Ways and Means motion.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill sponsored by the hon. member for Calgary Southeast seeks to eliminate an existing tax exemption.  If adopted, the bill would result in an increase of the tax payable by a certain group of taxpayers.  Our practice in these matters is clear.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the bill has not been preceded by the necessary ways and means motion, the proceedings this morning are null and void.  The Chair therefore rules that the order for second reading of the bill be discharged and the bill withdrawn from the Order Paper.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank the hon. government House leader for bringing the matter to the attention of the Chair.</p>

	Madam Speaker, I would like to point out, even though the government  strongly supports the intent and the spirit of Bill C-202, that we have had the health act of Canada since 1984. The government cannot interfere with provincial jurisdictions. This is a responsibility of the provinces. It is so mandated and we cannot interfere. The government, clearly and without question, cannot support the bill.</p>
