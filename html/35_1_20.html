<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, today the Reform Party has put its first 
supply motion on the books. We are talking this morning about 
the Auditor General and the role he plays in the governing of the 
country and the watchdog of our finances.
<P>
	It is only fitting that the Reform Party use this first supply day 
to talk about the Auditor General because during the election we 
placed such a high importance on the management of the funds 
of the government, that the taxpayers' dollars be spent wisely. 
The Auditor General is the watchdog on our behalf to oversee 
and ensure that these things are followed through.
<P>
	The office was created in 1878. For about 115 years now we 
have had an office of the Auditor General to look over and watch 
on behalf of Parliament how the taxpayers' money has been 
spent. It has done a tremendous job and has saved the taxpayer 
millions of dollars over these years.
<P>
	Before I was elected to the House I had an accounting 
business. I remember I used to tell my clients that as long as we 
have money to spend and taxes to pay we will always have 
accountants and auditors. We are going to see the Auditors 
General around for a long time because we are going to have 
taxes to pay and money to count.
<P>
	If I may change the wording of an old phrase, while old 
soldiers may fade away, Auditors General will be here for as 
long as we have taxes to pay and money to count.
<P>
	Back in 1977 the House felt there was a need to widen the role 
of the Auditor General. Prior to that time he had only counted 
the money and made sure that the taxpayers' money had been 
accounted for. We saw at that time there would be a wider role 
for the Auditor General and this House expanded his authority, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1222"> 1222 </A></B>
<P>
not just to attest that the money had been spent and had been 
spent legitimately, but that we had given him authority to do 
compliance auditing.
<P>
	In the words of the Auditor General, that means whether the 
government collected or spent the authorized amount of money 
for the purposes attended by Parliament. That has become a very 
major part of the Auditor General's report and job, to ensure that 
the intent of the House is carried through.
<P>
	We may authorize money to the government to go ahead and 
spend and after we make that authorization what real 
supervision do we have to ensure that the money we have 
allocated to a particular fund meets the criteria that we have set 
down? That is why we have given the authority to the Auditor 
General for compliance, to ensure that the money and the civil 
service go ahead and the government spends that money as we 
had intended.
<P>
	One of the other areas that we have given to the Auditor 
General is called value for money auditing. Again, in the words 
of the Auditor General, this is whether the programs were run 
economically and efficiently and whether the government has 
the means to measure the effectiveness of the programs that 
have been authorized.
<P>
	This is a very real role for the Auditor General because we 
spend $165 billion in the country that is authorized by the 
House. We would surely want to know that after that money has 
been spent we did have value for our money, that the programs 
we have authorized are doing their job, that the money is being 
spent effectively and usefully and that what we had intended is 
being done.
<P>
	To recap, in 1977 we expanded the role of the Auditor General 
to ensure that the money is spent in accordance with the law and 
legitimately as any auditor would do. He also has compliance 
auditing to ensure that the money is spent in accordance with the 
wishes of the House and that the money is spent effectively to 
ensure that the programs are managed on our behalf, on behalf of 
this House, to provide the benefits that we envisage for 
Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1010 ) </B>
<P>
	The Auditor General is a servant of Parliament. He is not a 
minister; he is not a department. He is our servant. He is our 
watchdog. He is our hands, our eyes and our ears out there to 
ensure that the money we allocate and appropriate every year is 
followed through and he reports back to us. On January 19 this 
year his report was tabled in the House.
<P>
	He works through the public accounts committee and that is 
how the House ensures and follows through to examine the areas 
he has brought to our attention that perhaps require 
investigation by the House. That is how yesterday when we had 
our first meeting we elected a chairman who is a member of the 
opposition. We have government members on the committee 
and we have five members of the opposition as well. That is how 
the House monitors the expenditures as approved by the House.
<P>
	As servants of the House we should always do what we can to 
encourage and assist the Auditor General in performing his role. 
We have seen in the past that there have been some 
recommendations by the public accounts committee to make 
changes to the Auditor General Act. There is currently a private 
member's bill on the floor introduced by the hon. member for 
Ottawa-Vanier that would allow the Auditor General to report 
more than once a year.
<P>
	We have constrained him to make only one report which is a 
huge report. Perhaps the House may want to consider supporting 
the legislation that would allow the Auditor General to report to 
the House as he feels appropriate.
<P>
	Therefore I can only recommend at any time and at any 
opportunity I have the importance of supporting our servants of 
whom the Auditor General is one.
<P>
	I would be remiss if I did not mention at this time that we 
recognize the civil service, the tens of thousands of people 
across the country who provide a valuable service to this land by 
performing their jobs efficiently, doing the will of the House and 
providing the programs that Canadians want and deserve. There 
are tens of thousands we do not hear about who go on working 
anonymously. I would like to pay tribute this morning to the 
contributions they have made to our society.
<P>
	There are one or two things that the Auditor General would 
like to bring to our attention that are included in his report. 
When we look at the Auditor General's report we should 
remember that our style of government is not only a 
representative government but an accountable government. 
That is why we call the ministers and the government to question 
on matters raised by our servant, the Auditor General, and that is 
why we are having this debate this morning.
<P>
	I understand this is the third time in Canada's history that we 
have had a formal and realistic debate in the House regarding the 
Auditor General and his report. I can give notice to hon. 
members on the other side that they will not have to wait so long 
before we have a fourth debate because the Auditor General has 
to be given the responsibility and the recognition for what he can 
do to resolve the problems that we have in ensuring that our 
money and funds are managed properly.
<P>
	We will be talking throughout the day on various aspects of 
the Auditor General's report. I would like to look at one 
particular chapter concerning travel by government ministers on 
government aircraft. The horrendous cost of one trip in many 
cases is more than the annual salary of a taxpayer.
<P>
	The Auditor General has questioned the costs of such items 
and we have been able to have the government take notice of the 
costs of these things and change the policy regarding the use of 
government aircraft, that they are not just there for jetting off 
here and there at any time. The role of the Auditor General has to 
be reinforced. That is a perfect example of how Canadian 
taxpayers'  money has been saved through the highlighting of 
the actual costs of these trips. Now that we have brought that to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1223"> 1223 </A></B>
<P>
the attention of the government it has decided that perhaps 
commercial travel would be more appropriate in many cases.
<P>
<B>(1015) </B>
<P>
	I mentioned also that the Auditor General has a role regarding 
compliance auditing. Does the money spent by the government 
fit the authority given by the House? There was $587 million 
spent on the northern cod adjustment and recovery program that 
the Auditor General said was spent without clear legislative 
authority.
<P>
	I do not dispute that the people in Newfoundland need some 
money and that we authorized a program to try to help them, but 
the government should remember that it does not have clear 
legislative authority to conduct that program, according to the 
Auditor General, and it should be coming back to the House to 
get that matter clarified before it continues any further. That is 
also the role of the Auditor General, to tell us in the House that 
we are the supreme body that approves these funds. When $587 
million of taxpayers' money has been spent without the 
authorization of the House then perhaps the government should 
think clearly about coming back here and determining the will of 
the House in order that it may continue to provide that program.
<P>
	What about CIDA, the Canadian International Development 
Agency? The Auditor General had some fairly harsh words 
about CIDA. That is a program that spends our money in 
developing nations where we recognize that we have a role 
around the world as one of the developed nations to help our 
fellow man. CIDA spends well over a billion dollars in this area 
to help those in need but unfortunately in many cases, as the 
Auditor General points out, we are turning some developed 
nations into another welfare program where we continue to pay 
money but we are not helping them to get up and at it. We are not 
helping them to improve their situation. We are just paying 
money to keep them in the style of destitution that they currently 
have.
<P>
	We have to look at many areas of CIDA and the House has to 
ensure that it fulfils the mandate that we have given to CIDA.
<P>
	I would like to quote one item of the Auditor General's report 
in chapter 12.57 which states: ``Until recently CIDA did not 
fully acknowledge its accountability to Parliament for 
managing''. It did not fully acknowledge its responsibility to 
Parliament.
<P>
	The House has to recognize that we are the supreme body that 
approves the money in this country. Every agency, every 
department and everyone in government has to recognize that 
we in the House authorize the funds and that CIDA is 
accountable to the House. That is why the Auditor General 
fulfils a tremendous role in ensuring that we are aware of what is 
happening in these departments. CIDA may get carried away 
with what it feels is the appropriate direction to go. The Auditor  
General points that out to us. We should say to these 
departments: ``Wait a minute, we call the shots around here. You 
listen to what we say and you recognize that the House has the 
final and full authority to say what goes on''.
<P>
	What about the resource allowance income tax provisions? 
There was $636 million of unintended tax refunds to the 
resource sector and another $538 million was given out as 
potential refunds of income tax while the department tried to 
prove a particular point. The government could have changed 
this tax loophole several years ago but it thought there was a 
point that it had to prove. It has cost the Canadian taxpayers 
$538 million to prove that particular point. I would hope that the 
Minister of Finance can justify to us that there must have been a 
very major point that the Department of Finance was trying to 
prove to cost the Canadian taxpayer that kind of money.
<P>
	Canadian aboriginal development program strategy; $900 
million spent by three departments over five years. The Auditor 
General said that after we had spent $900 million, three 
departments could not demonstrate that the program was 
meeting its objectives. We spent $900 million, almost $1 
billion, and we are not even sure that we have accomplished 
what we set out to do.
<P>
<B>(1020) </B>
<P>
	That is the type of thing that the Auditor General should and 
does bring to our attention. That is the type of thing that the 
public accounts committee would want to know from the 
Department of Indian and Northern Affairs. How on earth can 
we spend $1 billion without knowing which road we are even 
trying to go down?
<P>
	I hope in future years that various ministers will be able to 
come back to us and point out that corrective measures have 
been taken and that from now on Canadian taxpayers will be 
getting real value for their money, that programs that are 
approved are working before we spend $900 million.
<P>
	On the Canada pension plan and old age security, $120 million 
to $220 million is lost every year through overpayments due to 
inadequate control. That is a lot of inadequate control to cost us 
$120 million to $220 million. I would suggest the government 
take a serious look at that and answer to the Canadian taxpayer 
where this money is going. Why are we losing this kind of 
money? That $220 million would go a long way to doing 
something about the budget deficit.
<P>
	I know we have a budget deficit of around $45 billion. Harold 
Hunt, the Texas billionaire, once said that a billion dollars ain't 
what it used to be, but we have to start somewhere. If we can 
identify an area where we can save through proper controls on 
$220 million, that would be an excellent start.
<P>
	One of the great chapters in the Auditor General's report is 
chapter 5 which deals with the debt and the deficit. I know that 
the Auditor General does not have the authority to say exactly 
what he feels about the  deficit. He feels that he has a role to play 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1224"> 1224 </A></B>
<P>
and he has pointed out quite specifically in chapter 5 that the 
House has a responsibility to communicate to Canadians how 
serious the matter is and how corrective action should be taken 
and taken soon. I would encourage everyone in the House to read 
chapter 5. He is saying we should communicate simply and 
effectively to Canadians how seriously we are in debt and how 
difficult it is going to be for us to get out of that debt.
<P>
	I ask the Minister of Finance to take note of that. There is no 
reason, when he brings his budget down in the next couple or 
three weeks, why he cannot tell Canadians, as the Auditor 
General has so clearly pointed out, that it is time we 
communicated simply and clearly to Canadians what the 
problem is, how big it is and how seriously it has to be 
addressed.
<P>
	In conclusion, we have put this motion forward, which is a 
serious motion, for debate today asking that the government 
respond to the Auditor General's report in six months. This is 
the type of amendment to legislation I think the House will want 
to consider, giving the Auditor General the authority to require 
the government to respond to the Auditor General's report. That 
is why during the course of this debate I would like to see the 
government take a serious approach to what is contained in the 
Auditor General's report, that we treat it seriously and look at it 
as a mechanism to come back, address and recognize the 
importance of handling our money well for the benefit of all 
Canadians.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Robert Gauthier (Ottawa-Vanier):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to congratulate the hon. member for St. 
Albert on this motion, because first of all, it contains some items 
that are of particular interest to me, since I chaired the Public 
Accounts Committee for three years during the last Parliament. 
I would like to start by informing the hon. member that during 
the 35th Parliament, the Public Accounts Committee tabled 14 
reports in this House, and these reports concerned the same 
recommendations the hon. member has included in his motion 
today.
<P>
<B>(1025) </B>
<P>
	None of the reports were concurred in by the House. I may add 
that the problem is not the Public Accounts Committee or the 
government but this House, this particular forum. We will have 
to start paying attention to what is being done in committee and 
follow up on the recommendations made by members in 
committee.
<P>
	Perhaps I seem a bit frustrated about this lack of action by the 
House. I do not blame the government of the time. I simply 
blame my colleagues and myself for not finding the time to 
examine the recommendations made by the Public Accounts 
Committee during this 35th Parliament.
<P>
	Today, a few weeks after we started our new session, I see this 
motion as a very positive initiative to increase transparency in 
Parliament. Again, I want to congratulate the hon. member for 
moving this motion.
<P>
	Last year, there was a recommendation for setting aside a 
certain number of days in the House every year, to examine the 
reports of the Public Accounts Committee. I would like to ask 
the hon. member whether he and his party are prepared to set 
aside or allot, as is the case today, certain days to examine the 
reports of the Public Accounts Committee, so that Canadians 
will have a better idea of how we deal with the government's 
problems, and also to ensure that the system works effectively. I 
think that is the point the hon. member wanted to make. He 
mentioned effectiveness and that the Auditor General of Canada 
should, in addition to preparing special reports, examine the 
ability of departments and the government to be effective in the 
way they spend funds. We could pass Bill C-207, which I tabled 
in this House, and whose purpose is in fact-and if I understood 
the hon. member correctly, he supports this 
recommendation-to allow the Auditor General of Canada to 
table more than one report annually.
<P>
	Would the hon. member also agree that when there is a report 
from the Public Accounts Committee on a subject as important 
as public spending, we should set aside a day for consideration 
of the report and decide, as members, on the follow-up to this 
serious work done by the Committee?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Mr. Speaker, my hon. colleague has made 
tremendous recommendations.
<P>
	I started my speech by saying that this is only the third time in 
the history of the House that we have had a serious debate on the 
Auditor General's report. I would certainly encourage and 
support any action that can be taken by the government that the 
debate of the Auditor General's report be given much more 
serious attention and become a standard part of the calendar of 
the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fred Mifflin (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I want to say a few things very briefly.
<P>
	First, I want to congratulate the hon. member for St. Albert on 
his excellent presentation. I will be somewhat less warm in my 
congratulatory note in a few moments but I certainly welcome 
this.
<P>
	As a member of Parliament, I believe the Canadian public is 
quite happy to see this kind of debate go on in the House. I for 
one am very interested and enthusiastic to take part in it.
<P>
	I want to pay respect to my hon. colleague from 
Ottawa-Vanier who for a few years did an outstanding job in 
chairing the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1225"> 1225 </A></B>
<P>
public accounts committee. I had the fortune to sit in on some of 
the meetings that he chaired on issues that were pertinent to my 
riding, particularly unemployment insurance and training 
programs.
<P>
	I have to congratulate him for his enthusiasm and 
determination in pursuing the kind of issues that we see today. I 
think the House should be grateful for the kind of activity that he 
and his committee were responsible for.
<P>
<B>(1030 ) </B>
<P>
	I want to clarify a point. I note the member for St. Albert 
spoke about the necessity to clarify legislation in support of the 
northern cod adjustment and recovery program. I do not have 
any argument with that. We do need to have the proper 
legislation and as a parliamentarian I would not argue with it. 
However I want to make it clear that this in no way should 
impede the discussions now taking place on a follow on 
recovery program for those people in dire need because of the 
total extinction of their cod stocks.
<P>
	There are numerous committees in my riding. These people 
are not just sitting back expecting money to be given to them. 
There are 40 ``Improving your Odds'' committees in my riding. 
Anywhere from 20 to 40 fisherpersons and plant workers are 
studying among other things what can be done to improve their 
communities. Some will be on NCARP and others will not.
<P>
	I want to make it clear that apart from the need for legislation 
there will be a necessity to accept that the discussion for a follow 
on program beyond May 15 should not in any way be impeded by 
the need for the House to clarify the legislation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Mr. Speaker, I confirm to my hon. colleague 
again we recognize there is a problem and it has to be dealt with 
as far as the dearth or extinction of the fish in the Atlantic and 
the Grand Banks and the need for Canadians to help the 
fishermen there is concerned.
<P>
	I just want to point out there has to be clarity in the role. the 
House has set forth a specific direction within the legislation 
that perhaps was not clear. The Auditor General has picked that 
up. As our servant he is telling the House that we should revisit 
that and ensure our instructions to the government are crystal 
clear and the government can then follow through.
<P>
	I do not in any way whatsoever dispute the need to help the 
fishermen in Newfoundland and other areas which have been 
hard hit by the extinction of the fish stocks.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Unfortunately the time has expired. Is 
there unanimous consent to continue with questions and 
comments?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I would like, first of all, to congratulate my 
colleague, the hon. member for St. Albert, for the motion he put 
forward to the House. It will certainly generate a good debate. It 
is quite appropriate to review government spending as a whole. 
Everyone will agree with that. Year after year, the Auditor 
General tables reports that raise disturbing matters about public 
spending.
<P>
	This motion is pretty much in line with what we discussed 
yesterday during debate on the motion of the Official 
Opposition. Several of my colleagues in the Official Opposition 
asked for a House committee to be established in order to review 
all government spending, item by item. We were told, in 
particular by our colleagues on the government side, that such a 
committee already existed, the Public Accounts Committee, and 
was responsible for such reviews of government spending. I 
believe the comment by the hon. member for Ottawa-Vanier 
shows the need for a committee mandated by the House of 
Commons. I hope this would make the House more responsive to 
its recommendations and more likely to follow up on them.
<P>
	I will conclude this comment by referring to the speech of the 
hon. member for St. Albert-I had to go out for a few seconds 
and I may have missed a short part-because I did not hear him 
talk about the duplications mentioned in the motion. This 
aspect, and I will conclude on that, Mr. Speaker, is a great 
concern for Quebec in particular, but also for the whole of 
Canada, because the costs are estimated to be in the billions of 
dollars. I would like to have the opinion of the hon. member for 
St. Albert, as well as other Reform members, on this issue of 
duplication of services.
<P>
<B>(1035) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think we actually talked that 
motion to death yesterday. Therefore we should pertain to other 
matters contained in the Auditor General's report.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Serré (Timiskaming-French River):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I too would like to congratulate the hon. member for St. 
Albert and go back to a particular point that he raised in his 
comments about CIDA.
<P>
	First of all, I would like to point out that I agree with the 
foreign aid policies of the Canadian government. I think that it is 
the tradition in Canada to assist those countries which are less 
fortunate.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	However I agree with the member for St. Albert that there are 
better ways of using foreign aid. We are sending hundreds of 
millions of dollars to foreign countries with no accountability 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1226"> 1226 </A></B>
<P>
whatsoever. There is no follow up. We do not know where this 
money is going. Often I believe it  is going to buy a limousine for 
some local politician. I have an idea of how we can better use 
that money. I would like the advice of the member for St. Albert 
on it to see if he agrees with me.
<P>
	We are spending hundreds of millions of dollars helping 
agriculture in Russia and the east bloc countries. Many of 
Canada's institutions are not being used. In 
Timiskaming-French River there is the New Liskeard College 
of Agricultural Technology. The provincial government is 
closing it in May. We have state of the art facilities there. We 
have the academics and the infrastructure.
<P>
	Instead of sending millions of dollars to foreign countries 
why not use some of that foreign aid money to bring people to 
Canada and make use of our facilities by teaching them new 
skills. They could then return to their countries with new skills 
and technology.
<P>
	We would accomplish two things. We would pursue the aims 
and objectives of helping those nations feed themselves and it 
would improve our exports because we could sell new 
technologies and skills to those countries.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> I appreciate the comments made by the hon. 
member. These types of things can be brought out in a debate 
such as we are having today on the Auditor General's report.
<P>
	There are many ways to skin a cat and the member has put 
forth a positive and sincere suggestion. If the debate continues 
this way for the rest of the day we will come away from here with 
some serious proposals and suggestions to ensure that our 
taxpayers' dollars are spent wisely and effectively and that we 
get the best bang for our buck. That is what we want to ensure 
every time, at all times.
<P>
	On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the Reform 
Party I would like to advise the House that pursuant to Standing 
Order 43(2) from now on our speakers on this motion will be 
dividing their time.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (President of the Treasury Board 
and Minister responsible for Infrastructure):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
rise for a second day to speak to the report of the Auditor 
General and the initiatives the government is taking to deal with 
many of the concerns he raises.
<P>
	I must say there is a lot of community of thought on this, both 
in the remarks made yesterday by the hon. members of the Bloc 
Quebecois and in the remarks made today by the hon. member 
for St. Albert on behalf of the Reform Party. We all want to 
address these issues of how the taxpayers' money can be spent 
most efficiently and effectively and how we can cut down on the 
problems that the Auditor General raises so that in future years 
we will have a lot less of what are known as horror stories and a 
lot more success stories. There is a lot of common ground on 
what we want to try and achieve. There may be some 
differences, both yesterday and again today, on just how we go 
about achieving it.
<P>
	Certainly I came to Ottawa with an understanding and 
appreciation of the role of an auditor. I spent 22 years in 
municipal government and worked with an auditor to ensure the 
frugality, efficiency and effectiveness, cutting overlap and 
duplication and all of these necessities.
<P>
<B>(1040) </B>
<P>
	One of the first things I wanted to do when I came here was to 
meet with the Auditor General. I have done that on a couple of 
occasions. I have discussed his report. I intend to meet with him 
regularly because his work is important to us. His many 
recommendations are ones I very substantially agree with and 
the government would like to have them implemented.
<P>
	The hon. member for St. Albert raises many specific issues 
today in his motion and various speakers will follow me 
addressing each one of those points. I want to get back to what I 
said yesterday for a moment. I suggest the vehicle for dealing 
with the concerns raised yesterday and again today is the public 
accounts committee.
<P>
	I understand the public accounts committee is up and 
operating. The hon. member for La Prairie who was here a few 
moments ago but unfortunately has departed has become the 
chairman.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Order, please. Perhaps the hon. 
member will take his seat. The hon. member may not realize but 
we do not comment on the absence of a member from the House. 
That is strictly unparliamentary.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Eggleton:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am sorry. I was attempting to 
make a complimentary remark. I will certainly bear that rule in 
mind.
<P>
	The public accounts committee is the committee to deal with 
these issues. To suggest a motion such as is put forward which 
provides for a very tight timeframe for the committee to be able 
to do its work could be unproductive for what the members want 
to accomplish.
<P>
	The public accounts committee can start dealing with each 
one of these issues contained in the motion or any other aspect of 
the Auditor General's report. I do not know whether it will 
accomplish all that by the first week of June. I can say the 
government has already dealt with some of these issues and will 
continue to deal with them. It is not going to wait until the first 
week of June to deal with them or even to report on what it is 
doing with respect to many of them.
<P>
	The public accounts committee has every opportunity to bring 
ministers before it and to have a full hearing on each one of those 
matters. That is within its control. I hope it will be within the 
control of members of Parliament. After all we said we wanted 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1227"> 1227 </A></B>
<P>
more involvement by members of Parliament in such processes 
as the Auditor General's report.
<P>
	That is the approach to be taken. That is where the follow up 
can take place, in the public accounts committee. The 
government is going to follow up. Of course the Auditor General 
in his annual report has a section on follow up and deals with 
what the government has done in respect of his previous 
recommendations.
<P>
	I am suggesting the hon. member's motion is already covered 
by process and procedure that is quite extensive in getting to the 
issues and dealing with and rectifying the problems. That is the 
appropriate route to go as opposed to this additional suggestion 
the member makes today.
<P>
	It is important to reiterate that the Auditor General in his 
report has talked about the need for strengthening internal audit, 
program evaluation and strengthening controllership. Those are 
very important to the government.
<P>
	The red book has talked about the need to understand the 
consequences or the outcomes of our programs and the need to 
understand what value we are getting for the taxpayers' dollar. 
That can be achieved better than it has been through 
strengthening the internal audit and through strengthening 
program evaluation functions.
<P>
	I reported yesterday in my remarks that we had already moved 
in a number of areas to address the issues the Auditor General 
has raised. We have streamlined the cabinet making it smaller. 
We have cut cabinet expenses. The cutting of some of the 
expenses of Parliament has been dealt with. We should open up 
the budget process, open up debate on different issues before the 
government takes a position. We have stopped the deal of the 
previous government with respect to Pearson airport. The 
question of selling the airbus was one of the issues raised by the 
hon. member for St. Albert today concerning government 
aircraft. The rules have been tightened in the use of government 
aircraft. It is the last resort. The first resort is to take commercial 
aircraft. Where a government aircraft is to be used it must be 
fully justified to the satisfaction of the Minister of National 
Defence. It must be with complete cost accounting and complete 
reporting. These are tightening up of procedures that both the 
Minister of National Defence and the President of the Treasury 
Board have instituted to respond to the kind of concerns raised. 
This matter will be addressed further by another spokesman on 
behalf of the government.
<P>
<B>(1045) </B>
<P>
	The government is also strengthening controllership. The 
Auditor General expressed a concern that the previous 
government had put the office of the Comptroller General under 
Treasury Board so that the Secretary of the Treasury Board is 
now in effect carrying on those functions previously carried on 
by the comptroller. It is a function to which he is deeply 
committed, as am I.
<P>
	We recently sponsored a government conference on the 
question of controllership with many participants from the 
financial and audit communities, as well as government 
employees, to focus on the kind of skills and energies that we 
wanted to direct into the area of better controllership, internal 
auditing and evaluation programs for the very reasons that he 
outlines. There is that firm commitment and will to strengthen 
the controllership function of government.
<P>
	Improvements are being made in the regulatory process of 
government. It is something that we have to be most cognizant 
of because of the kind of impact that regulations can have on 
business and on the economy in general, as well as the quality of 
life of all Canadians. Indeed regulatory reform is a very 
important part of the government's endeavours.
<P>
	Yesterday I reported on the business impact test which the 
Canadian Manufacturers Association and the Treasury Board 
helped to launch as a means of understanding the impact we 
have on businesses with the different regulations that we put in 
place. In this way we can minimize the detrimental impact, 
whenever it is, to their operations which in turn makes it 
detrimental to the growth in the economy of the country.
<P>
	I mentioned the follow up chapter, a key part of the Auditor 
General's annual report, and one that I expect will show next 
year a substantial amount of progress on many of the issues that 
we have talked about today.
<P>
	In closing, I would like to note that the government is 
committed to demonstrating improved management through the 
public accounts committee, through the Auditor General follow 
up, through our own follow up in Treasury Board and the various 
other government departments. We are committed to delivering 
quality, efficient and effective services to the people. In that 
respect, we have a lot in common with people on both sides of 
the House.
<P>
	The procedures are in place to be able to deal with this. If 
further procedures are needed then let the public accounts 
committee come forward with suggestions that might be helpful 
for the House to deal with the business of the Auditor General's 
report.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert):</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate 
the comments by my hon. colleague in recognizing that the 
Auditor General's report is working and that action has been 
taken on these particular reports. He also acknowledged that the 
report now in front of us has caused a change in policy in the use 
of government aircraft. While he said many things and defended 
the current system of government response to the Auditor 
General's report one of his colleagues, the member for 
Ottawa-Vanier, proposed earlier that perhaps the Auditor 
General's 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1228"> 1228 </A></B>
<P>
report should be tabled and discussed in the House on an annual 
basis, or perhaps certain days should be set aside.
<P>
<B>(1050) </B>
<P>
	Does the President of the Treasury Board agree with his 
colleague from Ottawa-Vanier it would be a good idea that 
specific days be set aside to debate the Auditor General's report 
on an annual basis?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Eggleton:</B> Mr. Speaker, I very much respect the opinions 
presented by the hon. member for Ottawa-Vanier who, as has 
been pointed out, has a long and distinguished career in this 
House and also a quite distinguished career in serving as chair of 
the public accounts committee.
<P>
	Certainly I value his counsel and will be seeking it with 
respect to this and many other issues that are relevant to the 
committee and relevant to dealing with the Auditor General's 
report.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Eugène Bellemare (Carleton-Gloucester):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to congratulate the President of the 
Treasury Board for the list he just gave us of projects the Liberal 
government has launched since last October 26. What he told the 
Reform Party member for St. Albert is that the government of 
the present Prime Minister is setting the pace, that we will be 
doing things the correct and honest way.
<P>
	The accountability of the Liberal government will soon be 
recognized as an example showing that our government knows 
how to make fair and reasonable cuts and knows also how to 
govern in a honest and proper fashion. The minister set the tone, 
gave us examples like the Toronto airport and the helicopter 
project which represented considerable waste.
<P>
	While I am on that subject, let me say that I was a member of 
the public accounts committee for five years under the Tory 
government and I think our chairman, the member for 
Ottawa-Vanier, is perfectly right in asking that the reports and 
recommendations of the accounts committee be debated here in 
the House. The Auditor General does a fantastic job in 
protecting our tax money, expenditures and projects, yes 
projects; the Reform Party would like to implement only cuts 
and no projects, not even reasonable ones, but the objective is 
also to develop projects.
<P>
	The Canadian government is there to initiate projects 
designed to improve the quality of life for everybody. The 
government does not exist only to cut, cut, cut; it should cut in 
areas where there is waste. The Auditor General presents annual 
reports. The member for Ottawa-Vanier is right. When I was on 
the public accounts committee, we recommended that the 
Auditor General report his findings not every year but maybe 
every month. When the report is published annually, it has the 
effect of a bombshell; the media jump on it and report on the 
main points without digging into it. That is only a show and we 
should stop making a show of things and start doing some 
management. We should bring the reports of the Auditor 
General here to the House, through public accounts committee 
recommendations so  that we may discuss them and improve 
government operations.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Eggleton:</B> Mr. Speaker, I could not agree more with my 
colleague.
<P>
	The government is also concerned with debt and deficit and 
out of that comes the need for some further cutting. As we have 
said time and time again, there must be a balanced approach. 
There must be an endeavour to get Canadians back to work.
<P>
<B>(1055 ) </B>
<P>
	In the program we put forward during the election campaign 
we made it very clear we had to act in a responsible fashion. We 
showed where we were going to make additional investments to 
get Canadians back to work and where we would have to make 
additional cuts. We said were going to cut what we felt were 
lower priorities and the kinds of wasteful spending that is 
pointed out in the Auditor General's report. Therefore, we are 
taking action and have taken action as my hon. colleague and I 
have pointed out to implement those measures that are going to 
cut down on waste, on overlapping. That will show we are 
spending the taxpayers' dollars in an efficient and effective 
manner.
<P>
	I welcome the public accounts committee to be part and parcel 
of that process. It should take a greater role in the process of 
ensuring that in future Auditor General's reports we will have 
far more successes to talk about than failures.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish to 
inform you that, pursuant to Standing Order 43(2), speeches 
from the Official Opposition will be limited to ten minutes.
<P>
	I have the pleasure to rise today to speak to the motion 
presented by my colleague, the hon. member for St-Albert, 
which comprises eight different points, and gives us a lot to talk 
about. I will limit my comments to the Auditor General's role.
<P>
	His role is painfully obvious, once a year, when he presents 
his annual report. Instead of focusing on one annual report, Bill 
C-207, presented by the member for Ottawa-Vanier, offers a 
very different approach which could be a good starting point for 
discussions on allowing the Auditor General to present, on a 
regular basis, periodic reports that would enable the House to 
regain control of the budget.
<P>
	Historically, the role of the House of Commons has been 
mainly to control government expenditures. Take for example 
the case of the aircraft carrier <I>Bonaventure</I>; a few years ago, it 
was one of the first of a long list of white elephants uncovered by 
the Auditor General every year. Year after year, we have 
watched this horror show presented by the Auditor General of 
Canada. From one annual report to the next, time goes by and 
<P>

<B><A NAME="1229"> 1229 </A></B>
<P>
very little is  done to remedy the deficiencies revealed by the 
Auditor General.
<P>
	I wonder if this famous red book we have heard so much about 
for so long suggests specific ideas to improve the image of 
parliamentarians, by presenting such reports for example. We 
will have the opportunity to see what the government's position 
is in this respect. I was rather surprised when the minister did 
not squarely state his position regarding Bill C-207.
<P>
	I wonder whether the government is ready to go as far as 
amending the Auditor General Act to allow presentation of 
progress reports. This would make less alarming the problems 
the Auditor General of Canada could bring to the attention of the 
House for review, not once a year, but from time to time. It 
seems to me that such an approach would open up the process. In 
view of the $28 billion Quebec contributes every year to the 
federal purse, the Official Opposition, the Bloc Quebecois, 
would be well advised to take part in this exercise which, far 
from being futile, is a fundamental aspect of the parliamentary 
system, even more so if we were able to study more in-depth-
<P>

the hon. member, but he will have to continue his presentation

Canadian athletes who will represent us there.
<P>
	Over the next two weeks these men and women will bring 
great pleasure to our citizens who will watch them on television

<P>

best in their performances.
<P>
	However, the entire team did not go to Lillehammer. The real 
team reaches back in time to the volunteer coaches, referees and 
judges who launched these young athletes years ago and taught 
them to love sport and to compete fairly. It includes their parents 
and those athletes who over the years provided the competition 
against which they tested their skills and grew in competence.

of business people in my riding. The project is important to 
farmers, both from a financial and an ecological standpoint.
<P>
<B>(1105) </B>
<P>
	The project calls for the construction in our region of an 
ethanol fuel plant with a production capacity of 150 million

<P>
	Ethanol is a clean, ecologically safe fuel and a plant with this 
capacity would use roughly 385,000 tonnes of corn every year, 
or 20 per cent of current production.
<P>
	The arrival on the scene of this industry in the riding would 
create 225 direct and indirect jobs, 325 jobs associated with the 
raw material itself and 600 construction-related jobs.
<P>
	In order for ethanol to become an economical fuel alternative, 
the tax on ethanol fuel must be removed. Mr. Speaker, I ask the 
Minister of Finance to look into this matter and to consider this 
course of action in order to promote similar projects across 
Canada.

against a devastating form of cancer in Texas.
<P>
	A foundation under his name has been set up in order to pay 
for the costs of his treatment and to help other people who are in 
the same dreadful situation.
<P>
	The people responsible for the foundation had asked for its 
incorporation and later issued in good faith receipts for income 
tax purposes, until they learned that the foundation did not have 
the necessary accreditation.
<P>
	Without the financial support of the foundation, Mr. Tremblay 
would be forced to give up his treatment, which was having good 
results and contributing to his cure.
<P>
	The accreditation request for income tax purposes of the

constituents are calling and writing concerning the capital gains 
tax exemption of $100,000 for individuals and $500,000 for 
farmers and small business entrepreneurs. Overwhelmingly 
they are saying do not cut the capital gains tax exemption.
<P>
	Canadians from coast to coast dedicate enormous amounts of 
time and effort planning for their retirement years. For many of 
them a crucial link in their strategy is their personal $100,000 
lifetime capital gains exemption.
<P>
<B>(1110 ) </B>
<P>
	While many upper income Canadians may have already 
claimed their maximum lifetime exemption, it is the middle and 
lower income Canadians who will use the exemption to 
supplement their retirement income. The elimination or 
reduction of the exemption would penalize middle and lower 
income Canadians. The capital gains tax exemption was 
introduced to encourage investment in business. It is achieving 
this purpose.

	In this year, the year of the family, violence in the home is

offenders are penalized.

Back whose new film <I>Le fleuve aux grandes eaux</I> has been 
selected for the Oscars in the short animated category.
<P>
	It is the fourth nomination for this Quebec film-maker who 
already won two Oscars for <I>Crack</I>, in 1982, and <I>The Man Who 
Planted Trees,</I> in 1988.
<P>
	This new film by Mr. Back, which has been described as a love 
song to the St. Lawrence River, was already awarded the Grand 
prix of the Annecy animated film festival in June 1993 and the 
prize for the best animated film of 1993 awarded in January by 
the movie critics of Los Angeles.
<P>
	We wish to point out that this film was produced thanks to the 
Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, which shows once more 
the need to maintain the budget of the CBC.
<P>
	Good luck, Mr. Back.

Speaker, many farmers in the great constituency of

the capital gains exemption for farmers.
<P>
	Of particular concern to me and my constituents is that 
farmers are jumping the gun and incorporating their farm 
operations now before the budget is tabled. This is costing them 
between $5,000 and $10,000 for the incorporation plus 
additional accounting fees of as high as $2,000 per year. Worse 
yet, the decision to incorporate is virtually irreversible. This 
certainly cannot go on. Farmers need their capital gains 
exemption. It is the equivalent of a pension.
<P>
	I call on the government to keep this exemption and to state so 
at the earliest opportunity.

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, in an 
interview with <I>La Presse</I> yesterday, the Prime Minister followed 
the lead of his health minister in announcing the end of the plan 
to lower cigarette taxes for next year, barely 48 hours after 
making his action plan public.
<P>
	My question for the Deputy Prime Minister is this: How can 
she explain the Prime Minister's doing such an about-face 48 
hours after he announced his plan? Does she not believe that it is 
sending the wrong signal to the smuggling rings?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have read the Prime 
Minister's interview, and what he said is that within a year, he 
expects the lost revenue, which now totals almost $1 billion, to 
be recovered because the government will control the cigarette 
smuggling problem. That is what he said. It was also reflected in 
the health minister's comments. Of course, the Prime Minister's 
remarks are part of our strategy to end the revenue loss caused 
by cigarette smuggling.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, can the 
Deputy Prime Minister say whether the Prime Minister did such 
an about-face to appease the anti-smoking lobby or to preserve 
the already-damaged credibility of his health minister?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment):</B> Mr. Speaker, he did not do an about-face. 
What he said is that with the four-part anti-smoking program 
announced by this government, we will solve the revenue loss 
problem within a year. We already know that within a few days 
the Minister of Finance will be faced with a budget where the 
federal government is already losing up to $1 billion because of 
smuggling.
<P>
	What the Prime Minister said here in the House, and it was 
reinforced in the interview, was that with our four-part program, 
we will solve the smuggling problem and at the same time bring 
back revenue to the national treasury to pay for health programs, 
which cost Canadians quite a lot.
<P>
<B>(1120) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Can the Deputy Prime 
Minister explain to us how she believes that the RCMP will be 
able to dismantle the smuggling rings, when the Prime Minister 
of Canada himself is sending the smugglers a signal that they 
will just have a year off and then business will resume next year?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would remind my hon. 
colleague that the smoking problem was not created during this 
government's mandate. We have been here for barely 100 days 
and it took us barely 100 days to work out a solution. The policy 
of the opposition leader should be challenged: for a year and a 
half, he was in the former Prime Minister's Cabinet and he did 
absolutely nothing.
<P>
	We must say that when we were the opposition in the House, 
we raised the problem of smoking four years ago, but when the 
leader of the opposition was in Mr. Mulroney's Cabinet, he did 
nothing.
<P>
	Obviously, a problem which has been dragging on for four 
years will take more than a year to solve. Yes, we took 100 days 
to launch our four-part program, which we hope will bring a 
solution within a year. I hope that is what you want, too.

	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is for 
the Deputy Prime Minister.
<P>
	In an interview yesterday before the Commons committee on 
the GST, the Minister of Revenue announced that the 
government wants to implement a single consumption tax 
system in every province, including Quebec.
<P>
	Does the Vice Prime-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Laurin:</B> Does the Deputy Prime Minister- I apologize, 
Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I was about to say ``hear, hear'' instead of 
``order!''
<P>
	<B>Mr. Laurin:</B> Is this her way of asking Quebec to give up its 
own sales tax?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment): </B>First of all, Mr. Speaker, I must admit 
that I have several vices but being Vice Prime Minister is not one 
of them.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Copps:</B> Having said that, I think that the Prime Minister 
of Canada and his counterparts from every province, including 
Quebec, are very aware of the problem of overlap in the tax 
system. This problem was raised on many occasions by the 
Leader of the Opposition and by the finance departments, and 
we want to deal with it, mostly with the support of the provinces 
who also want a more efficient tax system doing away with 
overlap. That is the basis for the new tax system.
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette):</B> Mr. Speaker, does the Deputy 
Prime Minister not agree that, instead of initiating major 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1234"> 1234 </A></B>
<P>
projects and implementing a single tax system, she should first 
try to simplify the GST and to eliminate the management and 
administration problems  it creates for all businesses, especially 
small and medium-sized businesses?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment): </B>Of course, Mr. Speaker, we want to do 
both. A few weeks ago, the Official Opposition asked the 
Auditor General to examine all cases of duplication in fiscal and 
other programs. We in the government want to do our job and 
eliminate this duplication, and I hope that we will have the 
support of the Opposition in creating a more equitable a tax 
system for taxpayers who are paying a heavy price at the federal, 
provincial and municipal level.

question is for the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	Wednesday in the finance committee the minister indicated 
that the deficit for this year may now not go below $40 billion. 
This sounds like a return to a familiar pattern.
<P>
<B>(1125) </B>
<P>
	In the upcoming budget is it the government's intention at 
least to comply with the spending limits set out in the last budget 
and under the current spending control act for the fiscal year 
1994-95 and subsequent years?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development 
-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am sure the House will understand 
that with the imminence of the budget it is really not incumbent 
upon me to make any comment really on what is going to be 
included in it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
hope that we could make comment on the general budgetary 
framework and policy of the government without looking at 
budgetary specifics.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The minister continues to claim that he will reach his goal of 
reducing the deficit to 3 per cent of GNP by the 1997 fiscal year. 
We remember the actions of the former Progressive 
Conservative government, which pushed its deficit targets 
further back every year.
<P>
	Can the minister assure us that he will publish his minimum 
deficit reduction targets for each year until 1997 in his next 
budget and will he make a commitment to resign if he fails to 
reach his minimum targets?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec): </B>Mr. Speaker, I have just started! The 
Opposition is certainly entitled to make comments, but you must 
understand that the finance minister has to restrict his given the 
imminence of the budget. I can assure the hon. member that the 3 
per cent objective remains a target of the Liberal government.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have an 
additional supplementary question.
<P>
	The minister is fond of referring to the 3 per cent GDP deficit 
target of the European Community. He will know that the 
European Community combines this with a maximum debt 
target of 60 per cent of GDP. The federal government is already 
at 70 per cent of GDP. What is the minister's target for the 
maximum debt GDP ratio in the upcoming period, the period of 
this Parliament?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development 
-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am really not in a position to respond 
on the details of the budget until such time as I have presented 
the budget.
<P>
	You have told us on numerous occasions that we should 
answer through you and I am prepared to do that. But my 
question to you, Mr. Speaker, is are you passing the answers on 
to them?

	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the Quebec Food Retailers Association has 
explained to the Minister of Finance that the government's plan 
to fully refund retailers with an inventory exceeding 5,000 
cartons of cigarettes the amount they have overpaid in taxes was 
unfair to small retailers, as they will be the only ones to incur 
losses, losses which are estimated at between $5 and $10 
million.
<P>
	In the absence of the Minister of National Revenue, I direct 
my question to the Deputy Prime Minister. How can she justify 
measures that will penalize only small retailers while large 
retailers will be getting a full refund?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, I met in person with the 
president of the Retailers Association when he was here with the 
Conseil du patronat. The solution we are proposing is the most 
equitable 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1235"> 1235 </A></B>
<P>
and practical, given the difficulty and complexity of the 
situation. It should be pointed out that the solution for small 
retailers may be to negotiate with the wholesalers or 
manufacturers.
<P>
<B>(1130) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead):</B> 
I have a supplementary question for the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	Since the Government of Quebec will be reimbursing the full 
amount overpaid in taxes on cigarettes, would it not be possible 
for the minister to make arrangements with the Quebec 
government to harmonize the refund verification procedure, 
thus sparing governments and retailers alike unnecessary 
administration costs?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
</B><B>responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec): </B>Mr. Speaker, we understand very well 
the problem facing small retailers and sympathize with them. 
Certainly, we would be prepared to discuss this matter with them 
as well as with the Government of Quebec.
<P>
	The difference between the two levels of government is that 
we imposed a cut in flat-rate taxes and variable-rate taxes, 
while Quebec, as you know, had a flat tax, which is causing 
problems not only in Quebec but throughout Canada. That is 
why our situation is different. But, as I said, we are prepared to 
talk about the problem. There is no easy solution.

certainly has elevated the level of questions we have been 
receiving.
<P>
	I want to say to the hon. member and through him and you, Mr. 
Speaker, to the questioner that the Minister of Finance and I 
share the goals to bring down the deficit and to bring down 
unemployment. We all know that one is related to the other. We 
need to have fiscal stability to have good economic growth. 
However, we also must have good investment in people in order 
to have fiscal stability.
<P>
	The government has embarked on a major effort to find ways 
in which it can reorganize programs like unemployment 
insurance, the Canada assistance plan and student aid so it can 
really invest in people. The best way of bringing down our 
deficit and the unemployment rate is to put more Canadians to 
work.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hugh Hanrahan (Edmonton-Strathcona):</B> Mr.

Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Health.
<P>
	Last Tuesday the Prime Minister announced a comprehensive 
four point plan to deal with the illegal smuggling of tobacco into 
Canada. To date most of the attention around the issue has 
focused on the tax reduction part of the plan, particularly in New

<P>
Brunswick where I come from because that province has joined 
with the Government of Canada to use that particular measure.
<P>
	In the face of that attention it is important for Canadians to be 
reminded of this government's determination to discourage 
smoking particularly among young Canadians. I ask the 
Minister of Health to elaborate on what those plans are.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
message has been straight and honest. Smuggling is a severe 
problem that is undermining health policy in this country. Part 
of the package announced by the Prime Minister on Tuesday 
contains some of the toughest anti-smoking measures ever 
introduced in this country.
<P>
	I fought hard for this package and I believe in it. The package 
includes things like the banning of kiddie packs. It includes the 
$185 million we are going to receive by taxing the excess profits 
of tobacco manufacturers. It includes an export tax. It includes 
bringing forward embossed cigarettes. It includes looking at 
plain packaging. It includes looking at how to control-

Mr. Speaker, in the absence of the Minister of Justice my 
question is for the Deputy Prime Minister.
<P>
	In January 1992 Wayne Sullivan of Prince George, British 
Columbia, shot and killed his wife. In December 1993 Mr. 
Sullivan was acquitted on all charges because he was drunk and 
did not know what he was doing.
<P>
	Is the government prepared to comment on this occasion 
about its willingness to change the law so that substance abuse 
does not constitute an excuse for murder?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment):</B> Mr. Speaker, in the absence of the 
Minister of Justice I would certainly like to take the question 
under consideration. It is a very serious one. Obviously 
substance abuse is a very serious problem. We will report back 
to the member as soon as possible.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the Deputy Prime Minister for her 
assurance that something will be done to address this. If she 
needs help in coming up with some way to resolve this we would 
be pleased to offer our help.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Russell MacLellan (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to address that question by saying this is a 
very serious situation which needs a great deal of study.
<P>
	As the hon. member can appreciate, it is not the role of 
government to interfere in decisions of the court but we learn 
from the decisions of the courts. That gives us the information 
needed to formulate the policy we want to bring forward to 
Canadians to honour the commitments made in the red book.
<P>
	I assure the hon. member that this subject is being studied 
very carefully. Hopefully it will be reflected in policy by the 
government in the not too distant future.

contracted for training programs from the Department of Human

operation of the companies, the department felt there was an 
overpayment of some of the funds.
<P>
<B>(1145 ) </B>
<P>
	There were no irregularities. The hon. member is misusing the 
word. He should be careful with the language he uses. The fact is 
the repayment schedule has been arranged under the normal 
procedures of the department. It is a routine procedure that 
happens all the time.

<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources

be paid back. An acceptable arrangement will be made by the

	We have said clearly that an arrangement has been made for 
the moneys to be repaid on a regular basis according to the

	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Canadian heritage minister or whoever would 
like to answer in his absence. Possibly the Minister of Human 
Resources Development would be interested in this because it 
deals with jobs.
<P>
	Since 1978, Sunshine Village Corporation, a world class ski 
facility in Banff had continuous environmental assessment for 
Goat's Eye Ski Run and other developments, and final approval 
in 1992. This development means hundreds of long term 
construction jobs and meets the red book objectives.
<P>
	Why did the minister order a FEARO panel review costing at 
least a million dollars to do again what has been done for the last 
15 years?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment):</B> Mr. Speaker, the FEARO panel review 
will not cost a million dollars. It will cost substantially less than 
that, hundreds of thousands of dollars less.
<P>
	The government believes that projects of the nature of 
Sunshine, which will substantially alter the geographic face of 
the mountain, deserve and should have an environmental 
assessment review panel visit the decisions.
<P>
	We think the cost of not doing an environmental assessment is 
far greater than the cost of doing an environmental assessment 
for our children and for their children.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose):</B> Mr. Speaker, this has 
been going on for 15 years. It costs nearly a million dollars when 
one counts the amount of money the entrepreneur and other 
business people will have to put toward this panel.
<P>
	In the <I>Globe and Mail</I> it was noticed that the minister was too 
busy planning Olympic travel arrangements and posh hotel 
accommodations to discuss issues at a scheduled meeting with 
amateur athletic representatives.
<P>
	My question for the minister is: How can unemployed 
Albertans depending on this environmentally approved 
development not believe this issue was treated carelessly by the 
minister?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment):</B> Mr. Speaker, the decision to strike a panel 
was not taken carelessly believe me. It was taken after much 
consideration, in particular because of the nature of the 
mountain.
<P>
	We have cultural heritage and we also have natural heritage. 
We want to approve development that is in the best interest of 
the business people, yes, but what about our children, our 
grandchildren and their grandchildren?
<P>
	We have a responsibility to respect the environment. The 
striking of an environmental assessment review panel meets the 
objectives of government to ensure that any development, 
particularly in an area as sensitive as our national mountains 
should be done in an environmentally sensitive way. That only 
makes good sense for our kids' future.

	<B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of the Environment and Deputy

chlorine related substances in the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence 
River.
<P>
	Does the government intend to regulate chlorine discharges 
into the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence River and, if so, will the 
government urge the United States government to do the same?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member because of 
his vast environmental background will know that when you are 
talking about chlorine you are talking about a number of 
chlorinated compounds. We are looking at the sunsetting of 
various chlorinated compounds and in that context we would 
certainly be happy to have his input as the chair of the standing 
committee on the environment.
<P>

	We consider it a very serious question. We also recognize that 
chlorine comes in many forms and that in the past the substance 
has been used to avoid cholera outbreaks and other very 
contagious diseases.

	<B>Mr. Philippe Paré (Louis-Hébert):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Transport. Yesterday, I received 
copy of a letter addressed by the minister on February 10 to the 
Official Opposition critic for transport. This document concerns 
the relocation of the air control unit at the Quebec City airport.
<P>
	Is the minister aware that the new radar facility of Bernières, 
which is the link between the Quebec City airport and the 
regional control centre, does not work between the 241st and the 
247th degree, although all of the air traffic between Quebec City 
and Montreal uses that corridor?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member knows that the decision made a while ago to 
change the air control system, not only in Quebec City, but also 
in Halifax and in several other cities across Canada, is aimed at 
ensuring the safety of those who rely on theses navigation 
systems.
<P>
	There is no doubt in my mind that the transfer of the air 
control unit from Quebec City to Montreal will not jeopardize 
safety.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philippe Paré (Louis-Hébert):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a 
supplementary, even though the minister's answer is absolutely 
unsatisfactory. How can the minister claim that his civil 
servants' decision is based on a recommendation of the U.S. 
federal air administration, when in fact the Sypher-Mueller 
report prepared by American experts for his department 
recommends not only that the Quebec City and North Bay 
facilities remain open, but that they be expanded?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I have indicated to my colleague on a number of occasions when 
this question has been raised that it is the intention of the 
department to ensure that the same criteria applies based on the 
same levels of aircraft movement and all the security aspects 
that are essential to safe air navigation in this country.
<P>
	The situation in Quebec City with respect to the control 
terminal is being assessed in exactly the same light as what took 
place at Halifax when air control was moved to Moncton, the 
closing of North Bay, and the reassessment of all of those units 
across the country.
<P>
	The one thing I want to emphasize to my colleague is that we 
will deal with all of these decisions in a fair, equitable way and 
everyone will be treated in exactly the same way which is I am 
sure what my colleague would expect.

	The accounting firm of Ernst &amp; Young has been hired by the 
finance department to study the department's longer term deficit 
forecasts. They are to examine why the department's forecasts 
over the years have been so inaccurate and what can be done 
about this. Could the Minister of Finance tell the House why he 
has chosen an outside accounting firm as opposed to having the 
office of the Auditor General study the problems of the 
Department of Finance, and could he tell the House how much 
the study will cost?
<P>
<B>(1155) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development 
-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, together with the officials of the 
Department of Finance we commissioned this study which was 
awarded in open competition by a steering committee that 
included the Auditor General as a member. We recognized that 
the effects of disinflation, the disconnection between growth 
and job creation and therefore government revenues, had 
created a new situation, a new set of parameters, which 
economists across the country were having a great deal of 
difficulty dealing with.
<P>
	As a result we commissioned the study. We think it is really 
going to be a landmark in economic forecasting within this 
country. The details of the costs of that will be made available in 
due course.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert):</B> Mr. Speaker, in order to 
save taxpayers' money, would the minister be willing to support 
an amendment to the Auditor General Act that would empower 
his office to conduct the review of the revenue estimates?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development

<P>
	Research and development support programs are in a real

according to some people, it is impossible for businesses, and 
especially small and medium-sized businesses, to make sense 
of these programs without the help of experts in that field. The 
fact that we have lapsed votes every year just goes to prove my 
point.
<P>
	Will the minister undertake to act immediately and to make 
considerable efforts in order to improve the accessibility and 
efficiency of these research support programs and to help small 
businesses to make full use of them?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry): </B>Mr. Speaker, I 
want to thank the hon. member for his Friday question.
<P>
	Encouraging small and medium-sized businesses to be more 
active in the research and development area is one very 
important element of our Canadian economy strategy.
<P>
	As the hon. member knows, only 0.4 per cent of all Canadian 
businesses are involved in research and development, and very 
few of those are small and medium-sized businesses. The key 
element of our strategy is to find ways to help small businesses

answered, Mr. Speaker, you rose to say that the opposition 
should choose the wording of its questions carefully. I will tell 
you very frankly that I do not understand the meaning of this 
statement for the  following reasons: First, the official 
opposition is very aware of its responsibilities, we know that 
questions should use the right words and be respectful of the 
persons involved.
<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
	The hon. member for Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies had 
chosen his words particularly well to avoid implicating a person 
who, from what we know, is not, at this stage, accused of any 
criminal act or other wrongdoing.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I would like to point out to you that my colleague 
only talked of using public funds for purposes other that the ones 
originally stated. My colleague never used words like fraud, 
theft, embezzlement or anything like that. He simply asked what 
was happening to publics funds used in a way not originally 
intended. If it had not been so, clearly the hon. member would 
not have to repay. So we must conclude that the wording of the 
question was quite proper.
<P>
	I would not want, Mr. Speaker, translation problems or things 
like that to lead you to believe that the opposition is using 
unparliamentary language or improper terms. I believe our rules 
protect the questions as well as the answers. The choice of words

very responsible in our choice of words. This is what I wanted to 
point out to you, Mr. Speaker.

Minister of Canadian Heritage):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point 
of order. The hon. member for Wild Rose, in his effort to malign 
the Minister of Canadian Heritage, referred to a <I>Globe and Mail</I> 
article which is acknowledged by all parties involved to have 
been ill researched and largely inaccurate. I would hope the hon. 
member would certainly retract his comments.
<P>
<B>(1210 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I am confident that the hon. member would not 
impute a motive to any other member to malign anyone on any 
question. I hope that when we choose our words to put a question 
that we will always keep in mind that what we are trying to do is 
to get the truth of whatever the matter is, to have questions 
properly presented and indeed where possible to have their 
questions aired.
<P>
	I know that in the spirit of what has transpired in the last 
month or so that terms such as those that try to malign might be 
taken out of our vocabulary if it is at all possible. I take note of 
what the member has said. I do not know if it is a point of order, 
but I do take note.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Guarnieri:</B> Mr. Speaker, perhaps I could replace the 
words in question with misleading and inflammatory and ill 
conceived words on the part of the hon. member for Wild Rose.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I am sure that we do not want to get into that or 
get into that as little as we can. The point is taken and I thank the 
hon. member.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Riis:</B> I had a point of order, but it has been answered. 
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Did I answer it?

<P>

<P>
	At the present time the Criminal Code says that an identifiable

concerned about the Young Offenders Act.
<P>
	This petition is not only from my own riding of Kent but from 
Essex-Kent, Windsor West and Windsor-St. Clair, Lambton 
and Sarnia. It states that crimes committed on society by young 
offenders are on a serious uprise and the young offenders go 
virtually unpunished due to protection under the Young 
Offenders Act, whereas they lack respect for the law and fellow 
citizens, whereas there is no remorse or shame on the part of the 
young offender.
<P>
	Wherefore, the undersigned, the petitioners, humbly pray and 
call upon Parliament to review and revise its laws concerning 
young offenders by empowering the courts to prosecute and 
punish the young law breakers who are terrorizing our society by 
releasing their names and lowering the age limit to allow 
prosecution to meet the severity of the crime.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Bellechasse had 
five minutes remaining for his speech.
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank 
you, and I wish to remind you that, pursuant to Standing Order 
43(2), the Official Opposition will be splitting its time into 
ten-minute periods.
<P>
	As the time for statements by members and oral question 
period was beginning, I was about to bring up the provisions of 
Bill C-207 introduced by one of my hon. colleagues as a private 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1244"> 1244 </A></B>
<P>
member's bill. The purpose of the bill is to allow the Auditor 
General to present interim reports throughout the year, a move 
which would give parliamentarians a greater role to play in the 
affairs of government.
<P>
	I think that the government should take Bill C-207 introduced 
by the hon. member for Ottawa-Vanier and reintroduce it, 
either as is or in some other form, as a government bill to which 
improvements could be made in committee.
<P>
	As I noted earlier, the Reform Party motion tabled in this 
House by the hon. member for St. Albert contains eight separate 
items. It is difficult to examine even one item thoroughly, much 
less the entire motion.
<P>
	For example, item (e) calls upon the Minister of Indian and 
Northern Affairs to address problems relating to the rights of 
aboriginal peoples. This is one area on which the Auditor 
General has focussed.
<P>
	I think that this is a very interesting proposal. The federal 
Indian Act made native peoples second-class citizens by 
confining them to reserves and treating them as wards of the 
state, without giving any thought to the fact that they had the 
legitimate right to govern themselves as they saw fit, under the 
broad terms of the Canadian Constitution.
<P>
	In the early 1980s, Quebec worked hard to prove to the other 
Canadian provinces and to the federal government that it was 
possible, working within the framework of the current 
Constitution and with the openings afforded by section 35 of the 
1982 Constitution, to give native peoples a greater opportunity 
to find their own way, one which would be defined as openly as 
possible, and, after so many years of federal trusteeship, to 
recognize their right to native self-government.
<P>
	This was just wishful thinking, of course. We have long been 
advocating an end to overlap and duplication of services 
between the federal and provincial governments. We are pleased 
to a certain degree to hear the hon. member for St. Albert and his 
party call for this kind of action, since we have studied this issue 
at considerable length. The Bélanger-Campeau Commission in 
Quebec very aptly recommended an end to overlap.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois' mission is to bring an end to overlap 
once and for all. This will come about when sections 91 and 92 
of the British North America Act of 1867 are repealed. In the 
meantime, we will do everything we can to limit the damage 
inflicted on us by the Constitution Act of 1867.
<P>
<B>(1225) </B>
<P>
	But, as long as we are Canadian taxpayers, we in Quebec will 
continue to keep a close watch on things to ensure that the 
situation we inherit-and we will inherit our share of both assets 
and liabilities-is the best it can be. It is with this objective in 
mind that we will continue to work in the House to improve or 
stabilize the situation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu):</B> Mr. Speaker, first, I 
would like to congratulate my colleague on his well-prepared 
speech. I would also like to congratulate the hon. member of the 
Reform party who put forward this motion which calls for many 
things. It is an appeal to the government to act in the interests of 
taxpayers.
<P>
	There is a certain resemblance-and I am certain that my hon. 
colleague will agree with me on this-between the motion 
before us today and the one presented yesterday by the Official 
Opposition as part of the two allotted opposition days this week. 
Both motions reflect a will to cut government expenditures. 
Yesterday, we proposed the striking of a special committee 
which would review departmental spending item by item. 
Savings would be realized simply because expenses would be 
disclosed. The motion put forward today is similar, but refers 
specifically to certain sectors.
<P>
	The government's pat answer is that we have the public 
accounts committee to look into spending matters.
<P>
	This morning, the hon. member for Ottawa-Vanier, who 
used to chair the public accounts committee, told us that the 
latter had passed resolutions similar to the motion put forward 
by the Reform party. The committee wanted to do exactly what 
the Official Opposition is advocating now, but the government 
was never willing to go along.
<P>
	All day yesterday, and again today, the government 
stubbornly maintains that the public accounts committee can do 
its job. Of course it can, but then the government must take its 
recommendations into account.
<P>
	If a special committee representing all parties in this House, 
including independent members, could review, item by item, all 
departmental spending, it seems to me that its influence would 
be greater, more far-reaching. It would exert even greater moral 
pressure on the government and would have the support of all 
parties to carry out these spending cuts.
<P>
	This is why I would like my hon. colleague to tell me whether 
or not my remarks tie in with what he was saying shortly before 
oral question period.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Langlois:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
Richelieu for his comments and question.
<P>
	I believe the hon. member was referring to the first part of my 
speech to which he listened closely, since after an interruption 
of more than one and a half hours, he was able to focus in on the 
point I was making. Before statements from members, I was 
saying how odd it was that Bill C-207 dated February was 
sponsored by the former chairman of the public accounts 
committee under the late lamented Conservative government. 
The bill calls for interim, sequential reports to be issued 
throughout the year so that reviewing public finances becomes a 
routine matter and members are finally able to fulfil their real 
mandates as parliamentarians.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1245"> 1245 </A></B>
<P>
	The hon. member for Ottawa-Vanier also mentioned that a 
period of time should be allotted to consider reports from the 
public accounts committee and I think that is what the hon. 
member for Richelieu was alluding to. It is not enough simply to 
table a report. I agree with what others before me have said, 
namely that time should be allotted for the serious consideration 
of reports of this nature.
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
	As for the last question raised by the hon. member for 
Richelieu, namely whether a committee should be struck to 
review spending item by item, of course I think this would be the 
best approach, certainly preferable to a motion such as the one 
put forward today by the hon. member for St. Albert which 
touches on certain aspects, but overlooks others. I think the 
motion we presented yesterday was much broader and, as the 
hon. member for Richelieu said, it would provide a much better 
overview of Canada's public finances.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, first of all, I would like to thank the hon. member for 
St. Albert as well as the Reform Party for having tabled this 
motion in the House today because, on the whole, this motion 
goes along the line of what the Bloc Quebecois is requesting.
<P>
	We agree in principle with the motion of course, as it 
recommends a complete follow-up on this famous Report of the 
Auditor General of Canada, a report that every one should have 
read and that I recommend to the public. People can get a copy 
for free.
<P>
	However, we believe that this motion does not go far enough. 
Only a tiny part of government expenditures are audited by the 
Auditor General and appear in this book, a book which 
unfortunately more often than not gathers dust on a shelf.
<P>
	The Auditor General of Canada himself says, and I quote: 
``Most of the time, Parliament does not get adequate 
information on what government departments and agencies have 
accomplished with the billions of dollars from taxpayers''.
<P>
	We are all aware of the terrible state of government finances. 
We are aware of the burden of the debt on Canadians and 
Quebecers, a burden that sadly our children may inherit. We are 
aware of the unemployment rate, which is not coming down, of 
the bankruptcies and of the hardship they bring about.
<P>
	I must remind you by the way that the suicide rate among 
young people is higher in Quebec today than in any other 
industrialized country in the world. Such an incidence is a clear 
indication of how much young Canadians have lost hope in the 
future.
<P>
	Through all this, Quebec is a little poorer than other provinces 
and ends up receiving, through federal tax transfers, quite a bit 
of assistance. But I think it would be a good idea to look at why 
Quebec finds itself in that situation.
<P>
	We must understand that Quebec gives $28 billion to Canada. 
That is nearly 25 per cent of federal revenue and if we check the 
federal government expenditure items, we will see that in most 
cases we lose out.
<P>
	Let me give you a few short examples, as this is not the main 
thrust of my speech. In research and development, between 1979 
and 1989, federal departments invested about 18.5 per cent of 
their R and D funds in Quebec, while we provided 25 per cent of 
Canada's revenue. There definitely is a shortfall, not only in the 
money not being reinvested in Quebec but also in terms of the 
beneficial effect of such investments on job creation because it 
is well known that research and development is one of the 
factors stimulating job creation.
<P>
	With respect to federal investments in Quebec, while we have 
provided approximately 25 per cent of federal revenue in 
Canada from 1973 to 1993, we have been getting back 18 per 
cent on average. There is a 6 or 7 per cent shortfall there. And I 
will remind you that these investments amount to billions of 
dollars. This means that billions of dollars are not being pumped 
back into Quebec's economy to create jobs, but are being 
provided in a different way, through tax transfers for social 
benefits.
<P>
<B>(1235) </B>
<P>
	I am pointing out these two items but, if we look at the whole 
picture, we can see that, in the last 20 to 25 years, Quebec's 
economy is, for lack of a better word, gradually transferring to 
Ontario precisely because of federal investments causing our 
economy to disintegrate. The Auto Pact, for example, 
encouraged all car manufacturers to locate in Ontario. None of 
them came to Quebec. The digging of the St. Lawrence Seaway, 
which was, of course, a very beneficial project in general for 
Canada, had long-term negative effects for the port of Montreal 
because, with shipping going through to the Great Lakes, there 
were successive lay-offs over the years at the port of Montreal. 
The Borden line, which we will be discussing at length, I am 
sure, in the coming months, encouraged petrochemical plants to 
move from Montreal's east end where my constituency is to 
central Ontario, to Sarnia.
<P>
	That move resulted in thousands and thousands of jobs lost in 
Quebec, in a sector I know well as I worked for oil companies 
putting floating covers on oil tanks across Canada, in the United 
States, in Texas; it is a sector I know well. As a result, people 
who were making very good salaries lost their jobs; today these 
people are on unemployment or on welfare. We lost thousands of 
jobs because of a federal policy and now these people are 
collecting welfare benefits.
<P>
	We can also look at airports. As you may recall, a few years 
ago, Mr. Trudeau decided to build another airport because of 
congestion at the Dorval airport. So Mirabel was built at a cost 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1246"> 1246 </A></B>
<P>
of millions of dollars and thousands of people were moved to 
make way for the airport. As soon as that was done, international 
flights, which did not have  that right back then, were allowed to 
land directly in Toronto.
<P>
	So what happened? Well, airport activity was merely 
transferred from Montreal to Toronto, as it is obviously not in 
carriers' interest to make two stops. They land directly in 
Toronto. As a result, Mirabel is now a big white elephant that has 
cost hundreds of millions of dollars. At the same time, Toronto 
airport is being expanded because there are too many flights 
landing there.
<P>
	We can see in these examples a rational explanation for what 
is happening in Quebec, whose economic infrastructure is 
disappearing along with thousands of jobs. It is a debate in 
which we will be taking an active part in the coming weeks and 
months, I am sure, when we start speaking seriously in this 
House about the advantages and disadvantages of Quebec's 
sovereignty.
<P>
	What we also learned is not only that the economy is going 
very badly but in recent years, especially in the election 
campaign which just ended, but how much people have really 
lost confidence in politicians now. I think that the results of the 
October 25 election are eloquent testimony of this. Here we are, 
then, at the point where the government-at least we think so 
and we will see in the budget to be tabled very soon-we think 
that the government will really attack social benefits or fiscal 
transfers to the provinces in the coming weeks.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, that is my point: I think that the people are aware 
of the very difficult situation we are in now and are also aware 
that they do not like the way politicians do business. If we want 
to clean a staircase, we should start at the top. That is how you 
clean a staircase, from the top down. That is why we not only 
agree with the motion presented here but we ask for much more. 
In conclusion, we want a parliamentary committee to examine 
all government spending item by item, right here in this House, 
in front of everyone. We want the books to be opened to the 
public for all tax expenditures.
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to 
congratulate the hon. member for Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies. 
He explained the problem very well and provided concrete 
examples of jobs which were eliminated in Quebec and 
transferred to other regions, following administrative decisions 
made without consultation.
<P>
	As for the motion tabled by the Reform Party, I am pleased 
that my colleague agrees with it, although he would like to give 
it greater scope regarding government spending in general.
<P>
	I wonder-and maybe my colleague could comment on 
that-if we should not only look at government spending but 
also at some institutions or programs which have always been in 
place and are very costly. As an example, I can mention the other 
place.
<P>
	We are told that the Upper House costs $43 million. An article 
was recently published in either <I>La Presse</I> or <I>Le Devoir</I>, I forget, 
which referred to some incredible costs. For example, there are 
11 cabinet makers, as well as a gymnasium which only one 
member of the other place has been using regularly in the last 
four years.
<P>
	Consequently, we have to take a look at this patronage haven, 
which is somewhat of a remnant of colonialism. Would it not be 
possible to make a cut, along with others, and thereby save a 
minimum of $43 million?
<P>
	As you know, in the minds of the Fathers of Confederation, 
the Upper House was meant to be a watchdog controlling the 
zeal of elected members, often to protect the interests of the rich 
but also of the general public. However, the situation changed 
progressively in the sense that interest groups have now come 
into existence all over the country and have direct access to the 
government.Consequently, the other place is no longer the 
repository of the public's claims.
<P>
	Unfortunately, the Upper House has now become the place 
where an outgoing Prime Minister rewards political friends.
<P>
	I am not saying that all the members of the other place got 
there like that, and I do not want to take anything away from 
their personal and professional qualifications. However, the fact 
is that the perception is, at least in Quebec, that the Upper House 
is useless and can even, on occasion, prevent the democratically 
elected members of Parliament from quickly implementing 
their decisions. The other place can sometime delay bills. This, 
added to the fact that it sat for only 43 days last year, makes it a 
very expensive proposition.
<P>
	So, when we talk about spending cuts, should we not consider 
what the Official Opposition was suggesting yesterday, during 
another allotted day, and widen the terms of reference, as the 
Reform Party is suggesting today in its motion? Should we not 
widen the terms of reference to include not only government 
spending, but also to examine the raison d'être of some 
institutions, including the other place.
<P>
	In a sense, I am a bit surprised that the Reform Party, which is 
advocating spending cuts, would rise in this House and wish that 
the members of the other place be elected. That would only 
further increase the expenditures and slow down the 
decision-making process. We do not need the other place 
anymore, because the regions are now very well represented, 
first in the House of Commons and also by special interest 
groups which 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1247"> 1247 </A></B>
<P>
have expanded throughout Canada. The regions can speak for 
themselves and do not need the protection the other place 
traditionally provided them.
<P>
	Given the fact that my colleague has had time to consider the 
proposal put forward by the Reform Party and has requested a 
widening of the terms of reference, just like the Official 
Opposition yesterday, is he also ready to add to these terms of 
reference to include consideration of our institutions and of 
some of our traditions?
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pomerleau:</B> Mr. Speaker, first of all, I thank the hon. 
member for his question. It is something we occasionally 
discussed together outside the House.
<P>
	Indeed, the mandate could be widened to include the other 
place, an institution of a more traditional type which may not 
have all the required effectiveness in the legislative process.
<P>
	It is clear that in Quebec we have been talking for a long time 
about abolishing the other place in order to reduce spending and 
to send the population a clear message saying that those who 
work here do so with full public knowledge and in an effective 
manner, and that the same cannot be said for the other place. 
This does not reflect in any way I am sure-and my colleague 
was right to make that very clear-on the quality of the people 
who sit in that chamber. I know, I spoke to a few of them on 
occasions.
<P>
	I also talked occasionally with members of the Reform party, 
during conventions, and I was surprised to find out how much, 
on the whole, they believe in the need for cuts-deep cuts-in 
public spending. I believe that the way they speak in the House, 
even if it is a bit unusual at the present time, shows that have a 
deep desire to be real representatives of their constituents.
<P>
	I am sure that Westerners, like other people, would be in 
favour of seriously studying the possibility of doing away with 
an institution which, at the present time, has only traditional 
duties.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
could say to my colleague that we agree on several points. We 
agree in particular when you say that we should try to save 
taxpayers money.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I would like to continue the debate on the motion on the 
Auditor General's report by reading two sentences to give it a bit 
of continuity.
<P>
	On page 597 of the Auditor General's report it states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We recommend that the department provide complete and accurate 
information to Parliament on the full cost of using government aircraft to 
transport users such as the Prime Minister, ministers, and other VIPs.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It goes on to say further:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-the Department, in co-operation with other appropriate departments, should 
conduct a review of the economy, efficiency and effectiveness of providing 
government aircraft to transport such users.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I would like to continue the discussion of this proposal on the 
part of the Auditor General in a pragmatic vein. This is brought 
forward not just because of the news media talking about the 
Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs spending $173,000 to 
make two speaking tours. I would like to go further into the 
background and say that this situation has been going on for 
years and years. The press always picks it up. It is as if it is a 
scandal to be flying around in jet aircraft.
<P>
	Let us go back even further to my own experience in the city 
of Ottawa in another department, specifically national defence, 
some 15 or more years ago. I recall at the time feeling very upset 
when the government of the day offloaded part of its problems 
on to the Department of National Defence and said: ``You 
fellows take over the running of these jet aircraft. You can take it 
out of your budget and you can run it and take the flack''. I 
thought at the time it was dirty pool and I still think so today.
<P>
<B>(1250) </B>
<P>
	What this underlines is that far too often its own politics 
override common sense. Politics seems to have the effect of 
saying: ``We don't care how much it costs or who carries the 
load; it will go on''.
<P>
	The whole issue of the use of government jet aircraft, whether 
it is housed in the Department of National Defence or wherever, 
illustrates what is bad about government and politics. It also 
illustrates precisely why the people in our ridings are angry, why 
they have displayed their anger over the last couple of years and 
why they say this has to stop.
<P>
	DND now runs 16 Challenger jets. Why were they purchased 
in the first place? It is not because 16 jets are needed to run 
ministers and the Prime Minister around the country and to 
foreign lands. It is done as a political gesture, let us say, to 
Canadair, to Quebec, saying it is just money so let us give them a 
contract and buy these nice Canadian products. We cannot 
afford to do that given the state of our deficit spending and the 
state of the total debt.
<P>
	I am really talking about the attitude of government, not the 
current government, but all governments one after the other. The 
attitude seems to be, why not buy a few more jet aircraft, it just 
costs a few more millions of dollars. That is not good enough.
<P>
	The Department of National Defence today is absorbing more 
cuts. It is being cut to the extent that it no longer has the 
resources required to continue the peacekeeping operations that 
Canadians and this government continue to expect of it around 
the world.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1248"> 1248 </A></B>
<P>
	I am going to do a bit of very simple arithmetic. If three 
soldiers for one year cost, let us say $100,000, how many 
soldiers could we get to reinforce the Department of National 
Defence where it needs reinforcing, in the front lines with 
private soldiers and not with general officers, by making a few 
cuts here or there? The Auditor General's report states that the 
maintenance of the 16 Challenger aircraft cost the government 
$54 million a year. I am willing to concede and I think most 
members are that the government needs several jet aircraft to 
carry around the Prime Minister, a few VIPs and royalty. Let us 
accept that.
<P>
	But let us cut down on the number of these jets. If we could 
bring down the maintenance costs of this jet fleet to around $14 
million we would save $40 million a year. That $40 million a 
year could be used for hiring soldiers at three per $100,000, to 
give us 1,200 extra soldiers. Let that sink in a bit. We could have 
1,200 extra soldiers for the cost of eliminating the maintenance 
and overhead of some of this fleet of jet aircraft.
<P>
<B>(1255 ) </B>
<P>
	I take another view of this and say: ``If I were in business, how 
would I look at it?'' My answer would be: ``I need several 
aircraft to do the things we have just discussed, such as squiring 
the Prime Minister around. That is legitimate''. What are my 
resources for doing this? I would say: ``As a businessman my 
resources are 16 aircraft, plus in an associated company, the 
Department of Transport, 101 aircraft''.
<P>
	That triggers me to say that if we have 16 aircraft, all of which 
we do not need, and 101 others of what sort I do not know in 
another department, there are probably all sorts of them to 
spread around. As a businessman I would rationalize all this, 
look at the inventory and cut down the numbers. We should keep 
in service only those that are absolutely needed.
<P>
	The other factor I would consider, if I were a businessman or 
even if I were the government running this operation, would be 
the bad press. Every time a flight is taken-some are quite 
legitimate-one gets bad press. There is no sense in keeping up 
this nonsense. Get rid of them. Get rid of the bad press and get 
the people off our backs. The media caters to the people and tells 
all the nonsense. If I were a businessman or if I were the 
government of the day, I would look very seriously at this 
matter.
<P>
	In conclusion, I recommend that the government look at this 
seriously, not just the Auditor General's report but the whole 
situation. It should pragmatically rationalize all of the aircraft 
being used by the government, sell some to get the cash the 
government needs for necessary programs, reduce the overhead 
of government and finally-and this is most important-change 
the attitude of the government, the members and the 
bureaucracy toward the use of public funds.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morris Bodnar (Saskatoon-Dundurn):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
reference has been made by the hon. member to the saving of 
money and the efficiencies that are required. I do not believe 
that anyone in government disagrees with the hon. member.
<P>
	If the Minister of Finance finds places where money can be 
saved, finds inefficiency, fills loopholes that are in our taxation 
system and thus accumulates more moneys into the treasury, 
would the hon. member consider that an efficient measure on the 
part of government or would he consider it a tax grab?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ringma:</B> Mr. Speaker, that is a pretty clever question. If 
the hon. member is expecting me to fully endorse the red book at 
this point, I am afraid I cannot. I do have some reservations.
<P>
	To the extent the government of the day is moving to fill tax 
loopholes and bringing more revenue from sources now 
untapped, I totally agree. Let us have more of it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mac Harb (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for 
International Trade):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was very interested in the 
member's representation. He will acknowledge that many 
excellent measures have been taken by the government on issues 
that relate to government efficiencies and operations. I am 
surprised that in his comments he did not acknowledge the good 
things this government has done.
<P>
<B>(1300 ) </B>
<P>
	I want to ask the member a question. Would he be willing, at 
the next Reform caucus meeting, to stand and encourage his 
colleagues to vote, as they have said in the past, according to 
what their constituents have to say? Would the hon. member tell 
me how many times so far the members on the Reform side have 
voted against the will of their leader?
<P>
	What I am trying to say here is that charity always begins at 
home. I want to ask the hon. member to list for me the number of 
times that people on the Reform side have voted individually.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The hon. member for 
Ottawa Centre asks a very large question. I want to remind 
members that five-minute questions and comments can be 
rather brief. Keeping that in mind, the hon. member for 
Nanaimo-Cowichan.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ringma:</B> Mr. Speaker, I fail to understand the relevance 
of the question to my presentation on the saving of funds 
specifically related to the Auditor General's report. However, to 
try and answer the member's question in a general vein, he 
would almost ask me to raise the curtain on the Reform caucus 
and tell him what is going on there.
<P>
	Let me assure the hon. member that our leader has just as 
much say, no more and no less, than the rest of us. When he 
speaking to us it is with a totally equal voice.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1249"> 1249 </A></B>
<P>
	As to representing our constituents, that is precisely what we 
are all about. We do not have any more than any other political 
party the specific means of doing that yet. That is something we 
must work toward and I will personally work toward 
representing the people directly. We have to keep working on it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise in the 
House today to discuss the Auditor General's report, 
specifically chapter 11 of the report because of my 
responsibilities within my caucus and within the House of 
Commons. I will be speaking on chapter 11 which deals with the 
Canadian aboriginal economic development strategy, but more 
generally with the Auditor General's report dealing with the 
Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development its and 
programs.
<P>
	If one is to examine past reports of the Auditor General 
dealing with northern affairs and aboriginal affairs, going back 
some 20 years beyond the last government to include the Liberal 
government before that, the same criticisms come up repeatedly.
<P>
	These criticisms are that the Department of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development cannot assure the people of Canada that 
the examined program have a clear implementation strategy that 
is followed in the disbursement of funds or that funds dispersed 
actually go to the programs intended, that desired results of the 
programs are achieved and that Canadian tax dollars are spent 
with due regard for economy, efficiency and effectiveness.
<P>
	Many of these criticisms are to arise from a confusion in the 
mandate of the department, it would appear. The dilemma 
appears to be one of reconciling accountability to Parliament 
with the transfer of responsibilities of managing funding to 
aboriginal programs to aboriginal bands through a number of 
funding arrangements.
<P>
	As far back as 1986 the Auditor General expressed concern 
whether the department was accountable for ensuring social and 
economic gains to aboriginal people or was simply responsible 
for ensuring the equitable distribution of financial support as 
native groups pursued their own objectives.
<P>
	This confusion is still evident today in the implementation of 
the Canadian aboriginal economic development strategy. This 
one program was initiated by the Government of Canada in 1989 
to address the economic disparities between aboriginal peoples 
and other Canadians. The overall objective of the strategy is to 
help the aboriginal peoples to attain economic self-reliance.
<P>
	The strategy from 1989 to 1993 spent at least $900 million of 
an appropriated budget of $1 billion. According to the Auditor 
General the three departments responsible for implementing the 
program are unable to demonstrate that they are meeting the 
strategy's objectives.
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
	The auditors were unable to find any co-ordinated 
implementation strategy and instances were observed in which 
funds were disbursed for projects before the required business 
plan documentation was received. There was consistently no 
evaluation of the projects to see if objectives were being met.
<P>
	The Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development 
disbursed funding on a per capita basis regardless of the level of 
economic development within the bands, again demonstrating 
the conflict between the department's accountability and the 
devolution of responsibility to Indian bands.
<P>
	The department could also not demonstrate any follow up 
assessment of the success of the projects funded with taxpayers' 
dollars. Upon examination of the projects by the Auditor 
General the projects examined had a success rate of 50 per cent 
or less in meeting their objectives and one has to ask if this is 
good value for the dollars invested.
<P>
	With this particular program as with many other programs 
administered by the Department of Indian Affairs, if the 
Canadian taxpayers are to continue to fund it a number of very 
important questions need to be clearly answered.
<P>
	These questions could regard the actual benefit that has 
resulted from these policy initiatives and whether these 
activities achieved value for money. Did these policy initiatives 
take into account aboriginal priorities or could these funds have 
been used differently to generate greater benefit per dollar 
spent? Is there a more cost effective way to achieve the same 
results? What is the definition or criteria to judge when a 
program is a success or failure?
<P>
	It is clear we need a thorough review of the mandate and the 
responsibilities of the Department of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development. This is particularly pertinent in view of 
the commitment by the Liberal government in its red book to 
implement native self-government beginning within six months 
despite the fact that Canadians and most aboriginal people do 
not agree specifically with what that term means.
<P>
	I support, as does my party, the move toward aboriginal 
control of aboriginal affairs and the eventual dismantling of the 
Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development. 
However, I will not accept that Canadian taxpayers, through a 
misappropriate sense of guilt, continue to throw huge amounts 
of money into aboriginal programs without accountability or 
assessment of the success of these programs.
<P>
	While aboriginal leaders need only be responsible to 
aboriginal people for moneys and programs received through 
economic development established within the bands, these 
aboriginal leaders or the department or both must be totally 
accountable for 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1250"> 1250 </A></B>
<P>
every taxpayer dollar spent, particularly in this time of scarce 
resources and enormous deficits and debt.
<P>
	Neither my grandfather nor my father nor I am responsible for 
the atrocities endured by the aboriginal peoples perpetrated by 
the governments and churches of England or the governments of 
Sir John A. Macdonald and Mackenzie King. I believe that 
present day Canadians and their governments are demonstrating 
a real willingness to address the problems within the aboriginal 
community and will continue to do so.
<P>
	However, at a time when working Canadians are giving well 
over half their income earnings to governments in taxes while at 
the same time the very fabric of our social safety net programs 
are being threatened by high cost and enormous debt, we have 
every right to demand full accountability and value for every 
dollar governments spend.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernie Collins (Souris-Moose Mountain):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I commend the hon. member from the other side on his 
observation on what was in the Auditor General's report.
<P>
	As part of what has transpired over the years, around 1970 if 
one were to find out how many students of native ancestry 
completed a university degree, the number was somewhere in 
the neighbourhood of 12. We now have over 6,000 people of 
native ancestry who are proud to have completed university 
degrees.
<P>
	The reason they did that was they wanted to move forward in 
this opportunity for self-government.
<P>
<B>(1310 ) </B>
<P>
	I had an opportunity to meet with some of the bands recently 
and I can assure the House that the bands in my riding do know 
what aboriginal self-government means. They are headed in the 
right direction.
<P>
	I have some concerns, as the hon. member has mentioned, 
about the Auditor General's report. It is one thing to write out in 
a report what the concerns are and another thing to see what is 
actually happening and then put those into practice.
<P>
	On behalf of the Government of Canada, with Mr. Ron Irwin 
as our new minister in charge of Indian Affairs we are going to 
see the direction change very drastically.
<P>
	I would ask the member on behalf of the constituents I 
represent if he feels that the budgetary process that we have 
needs to be overhauled? What recommendations is he prepared 
to make that he would see put in place through his members on 
the standing committee that is going to be reviewing those 
budgets?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chatters:</B> Mr. Speaker, there were a number of questions 
within the hon. member's response and I will try to remember 
them and answer them as I go.
<P>
	Certainly there has been great progress made within 
aboriginal communities in the directions he points out. I applaud 
those gains that we have made. The point I was trying to make in 
my presentation was that with each and every one of these 
programs we have to be able to assure Canadians that the best 
value was gained for the dollar spent. Certainly while each 
program makes some progress toward its goal, was enough 
progress made to make the dollar spent worth while?
<P>
	Some suggestions we might make to improve the 
accountability of those dollars are very much the same as what 
was pointed out in this particular chapter of the Auditor 
General's report, that the evaluation procedures the Auditor 
General spoke of be put in place to evaluate the success of the 
programs that have been implemented. In this way the minister, 
or the department through the minister, might come back and be 
able to assure this Parliament and all Canadians that they are 
getting value for the dollars spent and that we are achieving the 
results we are trying to achieve.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robert D. Nault (Kenora-Rainy River):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I find the member's statement somewhat interesting about 
aboriginal affairs and self-government. I wanted to ask him if he 
could clarify two details for me.
<P>
	The first issue is the one in our red book that deals with the 
inherent right to self-government, which means we recognize as 
non-natives that there were treaties signed and those treaties 
suggested that these were self-governing people before 
Europeans came. I would like to know whether the Reform Party 
agreed with that.
<P>
	My second point is if it agrees or disagrees, that not really 
being the issue, would he also be prepared to tell me, given a 
system that at present does not work for aboriginal people and 
for non-natives, and it has been agreed by both sides that that is 
the case, why he would not want to see a concept of 
self-government put in place? This is not easily defined because 
in each community and each region it represents different things 
to different people.
<P>
	Would he also not agree that aboriginal people are not 
homogeneous people, that they are of different cultures and they 
have different traditions and because of that self-government 
cannot be that little catch phrase that he seems to be looking for?
<P>
	I would be interested if he could give me his opinion on those 
particular issues because my sense of it is he is suggesting that 
because he does not have a definition of self-government across 
Canada, we should do nothing.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chatters:</B> Mr. Speaker, certainly the member might have 
interpreted my presentation that because we cannot get one little 
definition of self-government we should do nothing. Our party 
and I have asked the minister and his government to define for us 
what in their opinion inherent right means. To this point at least 
we have not received an answer to that question. If we did then 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1251"> 1251 </A></B>
<P>
we could make a better judgment on whether we  support the 
concept of aboriginal inherent right to self-government.
<P>
<B>(1315) </B>
<P>
	I personally support and I think my party supports the 
devolution of responsibility for aboriginal affairs to the 
aboriginal people themselves. I am saying that we should not 
throw huge sums of money at the problem and have no 
accountability for those dollars and then say we are solving the 
problem and devolving that responsibility. When we spend 
taxpayers' dollars we have to account to the taxpayer for those 
dollars, whether it be the government or the aboriginals who are 
administering that program. That is what we and all Canadians 
are demanding, not that the devolution of power and 
responsibility does not take place.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and </B><B>Minister 
of the Environment):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join in the 
debate today in particular because the motion put by the member 
for St. Albert does deal with specific initiatives of the Ministry 
of the Environment. Also, what we are seeing as a result of the 
analysis of this motion is that the Reform Party members are 
starting to understand after the first 100 days in Parliament that 
governing a country as diverse and as multilayered as Canada is 
not as easy as it looks from the outside.
<P>
	I refer in particular to the motion which of course calls upon 
all ministries to justify the issue of overexpenditures and 
duplication. Indeed, with regard to the Auditor General's report 
to the Ministry of the Environment on pulp and paper 
regulations, we were not only cognizant of his criticism but we 
had already responded very specifically by working on 
harmonization agreements with various provinces.
<P>
	One thing I learned very quickly. I spent a lot of years in 
opposition and not too many days in government, but I think the 
Canadian public wants to know that politicians are doing their 
level best keep costs down and to deliver a service that is going 
to make sense to all Canadians.
<P>
	If we look at environment, there was no such thing as 
environment when the original Constitution was written back in 
1867. We took it for granted. In fact public attention and 
carriage of and concern for the environment has really been a 
phenomenon of the last two decades.
<P>
	Ironically, later on today I am going to be meeting with a 
person from this particular Chamber who was at the forefront of 
environmental concerns. He is now the Canadian ambassador on 
sustainable development. As the Speaker of this place he 
introduced a list of measures for the House of Commons which 
made the House of Commons assess and analyse our 
environmental behaviour.
<P>
	Mr. Fraser, the former member for Vancouver South, started 
before it was particularly fashionable to analyse how it is that 
our own behaviour is affecting our environment. He took 
styrofoam cups out of the House  of Commons and replaced 
them with recyclable china. He made us look at how we were 
separating waste in this place. It is the wish of the Ministry of 
the Environment to take the signal that was put out by Mr. Fraser 
in this place, the House of Commons, and make it serve as a 
model for government.
<P>
	The House of Commons is a very complex labyrinth which not 
only includes services to members but employs about 4,000 
people. In the overall work of the government it is one small 
player. In fact, from my department I know that there are people 
across the country who are driving vehicles that are not 
environmentally friendly. If we are saying to the private sector 
``We want you to go green'', then clearly the impetus and the 
direction for that has to start from within.
<P>
	A legitimate question can be asked. Why is it that on the issue 
of pulp and paper we have more than one government dealing 
with regulations? In the evolution of business, federal and 
provincial governments have each taken responsibility in a 
number of areas. Water quality is not just a federal issue. In fact 
I think the member would be raising objections, one could say 
raising Cain, if we as a national government decided that there 
was no more role for provincial governments to play in terms of 
the purity of our waters.
<P>
<B>(1320) </B>
<P>
	Not only do we have a provincial role to play but we have an 
international role. Only two days ago I was speaking with the 
administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency of the 
United States on exactly what we were going to do in terms of 
bilateral decisions to clean up areas like the Great Lakes, to look 
at the whole question of what is dumped into the St. Lawrence 
River, and to examine the question of transborder movement of 
waste.
<P>
	We have local initiatives, provincial initiatives, national 
initiatives and international initiatives. That is why to the 
taxpayer it may look like we are sometimes running around 
doing each other's jobs but I think everyone would recognize 
that no one government can bear the total responsibility for the 
environment.
<P>
	Look at the question of air. Probably one of the most poignant 
moments that I have experienced as a member of Parliament was 
a trip I took several years ago to Broughton Island which is part 
of the vast Arctic. On that trip I had an opportunity to meet with 
aboriginal women who had been advised at that time by the 
federal department of health that tests had shown that their 
breast milk was tainted with PCBs. Members cannot imagine, 
flying into a more pristine virgin untouched area of the world 
and on arriving there have a meeting with town council to deal 
with the issue that the mothers' milk in that part of the country 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1252"> 1252 </A></B>
<P>
was tainted with PCBs. You had to ask yourself the question: 
Was that a local issue?
<P>
	Obviously it was not a local issue. The PCBs were being 
carried by air currents, not only from Canada but from parts of 
industrialized North America and because of wind vortexes with 
which I am not familiar they found themselves in a particular 
concentration in the Arctic. There were situations where in some 
cases these women were actually feeding their children 
Coffee-mate because the cost of milk at that time was $8 a litre. 
They did not have the money to buy a litre of milk and they were 
afraid to feed their babies with their own breast milk. That is 
why when one talks about environment issues it is not so easy to 
compartmentalize them as maybe one would like to think.
<P>
	The world is a very complex place today. I think we have a 
responsibility as a national government to work internationally, 
provincially and locally to try to develop the cleanest 
environment possible.
<P>
	A member of the Reform Party asked a question earlier today 
on the issue of the environmental assessment of a particular 
project on a ski hill. He asked about the business interests. That 
is a legitimate question. Obviously when we are talking about a 
virgin part of the country for which there is going to be 
significant development we have the interests of the business 
people who have invested in the project as well as the interests 
of the local residents who obviously have to balance the land use 
questions with larger questions of the whole question of 
biodiversity.
<P>
	We have the provincial questions about how a province can 
maintain the integrity of the environment, deal with the issue of 
endangered species and provide significant terrain for wildlife. 
We also have the national and international issues.
<P>
	If from time to time we trip over each other, as we will do, I 
think the message of the Auditor General has to be that it is not 
with malice or forethought and that we should be working as 
hard as we can to streamline the process to make it work for the 
taxpayer and also to underline our role as the guardian of the 
land, the sea and the air for future generations.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We are working very hard on this aspect, and based on 
negotiations that are taking place with my Quebec counterpart, 
Mr. Paradis, I expect we will soon be able to sign a one-stop 
agreement which could apply to pulp and paper regulations. 
This is very important, because I realize companies do not want 
two inspection teams on the same river at the same time. 
However, I think we should also realize that with our overriding 
responsibility to keep this earth for future generations, there 
will be differences of opinion from time to time.
<P>
<B>(1325) </B>
<P>
	Are megawatts better than negawatts? Are international 
issues involved?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Only a few days ago the premier of British Columbia was in 
Europe looking at our environmental record from the 
perspective of the European Community. There are international 
market forces which want to analyse whether we are doing our 
job in land use management. Do we have proper mechanisms for 
clear cutting? Are we in fact respecting the question of effluent 
discharge in pulp and paper mills? Do we have laws that are 
stringent enough and are we respecting those laws?
<P>
	That is what politics are all about. It is the coming together of 
divergent views and the balance between the immediate needs of 
economic gain with the long-term needs of sustainable 
development. One of the great initiatives of the 1990s is going to 
be a recognition that environment and economy are not 
opposites, they are not enemies. In fact, they are inextricably 
linked.
<P>
	Premier Harcourt is in Europe now, not because he is 
necessarily a great defender of the environment but because 
world forces are coming together to analyse the green record of 
every country. Premier Harcourt wants to make sure that the 
Europeans are apprised of all the facts before they make 
decisions which could have significant repercussions for the 
Canadian economy.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I think the same thing is happening in the case of the Quebec 
government's involvement in the Hydro-Québec contract with 
New York. It is not enough to work hard to have a clean 
environment. The international issues are there as well. Are we 
prepared to meet the immense challenges of the twenty-first 
century with sound and sustainable environmental 
technologies?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	There is an economic consideration. In fact, as we speak we 
are following the advice of the Auditor General to meet, to 
consult, to get our act together and to ensure that business is not 
overburdened with overregulation but at the same time we meet 
our bottom line of being the stewards of the environment for 
future generations.
<P>
	When I got into this job in my department I had no idea how 
on any given project, on any given decision, there is not only the 
question of seeking interdepartmental information but also the 
responsibility to ensure that you are not treading on somebody 
else's constitutional toes.
<P>
	I think the members of the Reform Party and I know, having 
had the opportunity to meet and to dialogue with some of them 
in terms of our shared environmental objectives and hopefully 
being exposed to reality, that governing a country as vast as 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1253"> 1253 </A></B>
<P>
Canada is not as simple as one would like to pretend. There are 
no hard and fast solutions. We will make mistakes. That is why 
we ask the  Auditor General every year to review our record and 
to make recommendations.
<P>
	The opposition motion by the member for St. Albert which 
calls upon the government to demonstrate its commitment to 
accountability is a process that is built into what we call the 
estimates. Every year in this Parliament every member of 
Parliament has the right to call the ministers of this government 
before their committees to call them into account on 
expenditures.
<P>
	That is the function of the committee on estimates and that has 
to be done before June. That is part of the law of the land. Sure 
we screw up. Sure we make mistakes. I dare say I have made a 
few of them in my time and I will probably make a few more 
from time to time.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, no.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Copps:</B> I think Canadians want to know that we are doing 
our level best to acquit ourselves of our responsibilities and at 
the same time meet the test the taxpayer is putting us through. 
An awful lot is said about public servants, that public servants 
waste money and do this and do that.
<P>
<B>(1330 ) </B>
<P>
	In my department I have had nothing but absolute 
co-operation from the people who are there to discharge the 
government's mandate. Public servants are not the people who 
create the policy. They are there to implement it. They work 
nights and weekends. They do not close the door at 4.30 p.m. 
because the public phone lines are not open. They are there 
working on everyone's behalf to try and move the process 
forward.
<P>
	I spent a couple of days in Saskatoon at my very first meeting 
of Canadian ministers of the environment in November. I spent 
about an hour on the phone yesterday with the chairman of the 
CCME, Jane Barry, the new Minister of the Environment from 
New Brunswick, who is getting ready for the next meeting. I 
expect I will be meeting with my provincial counterparts in 
March to pave the way for further harmonization and further 
consultation on the process of making our regulatory system 
work.
<P>
	While we are in this House there are bureaucrats who are 
dealing with air issues. There are public servants who are 
dealing with the very complicated issues of who controls the 
waterways. It seems very simple. One goes to Saguenay.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Look at the Saguenay, which is definitely part of the province 
of Quebec. I would like to digress at this stage and say I would 
have liked to see the environment critic here, because yesterday, 
Mr. Chrétien referred to the Irving Oil case, and said that if that 
had happened in Hamilton, the matter would have been settled. I 
can tell him it will be settled, and just because it was not settled 
before does not mean they were right.
<P>
	If I throw something into the Bay in Hamilton, it goes through 
Lake Ontario and into the St. Lawrence, and then into the 
Atlantic and international waters. If we look at the cod shortage, 
we may have a good conservation program. We even went so far 
as to prohibit all cod fishing in Canada. But if the French, the 
Spanish and the Portuguese catch our cod, what is the use? So, 
although it would be very easy to say that the Saguenay is in 
Quebec and that is final, if we do not harmonize regulations at 
the federal, provincial and international levels, part of the river 
may be clean as a whistle, but toxic waste can still get in from 
other areas.
<P>
	That is one of the reasons why I believe the environment 
unites us as a people.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Whatever language we speak, when it comes to the 
environment we are inextricably linked. What I throw into the 
water of Hamilton harbour ends up in the drinking water of the 
lower St. Lawrence. What happens to the belugas? It is not just a 
function of how they are dealt with at that particular point of the 
river, but it is a function of the cumulative effect of toxins which 
could start all the way up in Lake Superior and find their way 
through the system.
<P>
	On the one hand it is very simple to say: ``Get out of my 
jurisdiction. It is my ball of wax. You should not be in there''. 
On the other hand when it comes to the environment, when it 
comes to the air we breathe, when it comes to the water we swim 
in and when it comes to the land we live on, we are our 
neighbour's keeper. As much as we try, we will continue to have 
irritants and areas of discussion and disagreement.
<P>
	To follow the advice of the Auditor General, our objective 
must be to be as efficient and effective as possible, bearing in 
mind that in a world as complex as the one in which we live there 
really are no easy solutions. For every point there is a 
counterpoint.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Every position has its opposite, and it is up to the government 
to try to find a reasonable solution that is fair to everyone. I 
think that so far, even if there have been problems, we have done 
a pretty good job. We want to go on doing that, but I think all 
members of this House must realize that living in a country like 
Canada is not always easy.
<P>
<B>(1335 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We live in a country that is very large and diffuse.

<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1254"> 1254 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Ms. Copps: </B>It is not easy, but it is worth it.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Copps: </B>It is not easy, but it is worth it, and do you know 
why it is worth it? Because when I see my brother living in 
French, in Montreal, with his wife and their daughter, who 
speaks French, the daughter of a man born in Hamilton, I think 
to myself our country works.
<P>
	It is worth it because for someone like myself, who never 
heard a word of French before the age of 13, to be able to come 
here and voice the wishes of the Saguenay people, is fantastic. 
Likewise for my colleague opposite, the leader of the New 
Democratic Party. When we get to know each other, as we are in 
this House, then we realize how great this country is. It is really 
worth it.
<P>
	We do have a problem though, and that is that our country is so 
big that people do not know each other. But should you come to 
Hamilton, I can guarantee that you will be greeted by friendly 
and welcoming people.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It is the same thing for people from the west. One of the 
biggest problems in understanding government and in 
understanding Canada is that we do not know each other. Maybe 
one of the benefits of this rather unusual configuration in the 
House of Commons is going to be that as Canadians we will start 
to understand the things that bring us together.
<P>
	I can say that the people who work in the steel mill in 
Hamilton who are concerned about their jobs, who are 
concerned about their children's future share the same hopes and 
dreams and the same concerns about a balanced economic and 
environmental approach as the people in the riding of the 
Minister of Finance or those in the riding of Lévis.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
They are waiting for jobs at MIL Davie.
<P>
	We share the same wishes, the same hopes, but at the same 
time we recognize that governing a country is not an easy job. I 
think that all we can do is our very best to try and harmonize our 
efforts, when we can, and when we cannot, to try to be honest 
with each other. That is all people are expecting of us. I think 
that the Auditor General's report leads us in the right direction.
<P>
	It is good that you are here to keep us on the right track.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
congratulations to the minister for some fine words. It is very 
obvious her heart is with Canada. I would like the minister to 
know that is where my heart is also. I am sure we could agree all 
day on that.
<P>
	I heard her mention something about the economic factors and 
the environmental factors, how they tie together and how they 
are so important. I could not agree more.
<P>
	Having lived in the Rocky Mountains all my life I love the 
Rocky Mountains probably more than most. Looking at a 
development such as was talked about earlier today in question 
period and thinking about the financial difficulties the country is 
in, I realize the Liberal government of the 1970s and early 1980s 
struck a FEARO panel and arrived at a decision. The 
Conservative Party came along and struck another FEARO 
panel. It did a very thorough study and came to the same 
agreement that the project was good. The provincial government 
intervened and did its thing. The municipal government 
intervened and did its thing. All this went on for a very long 
period of time. I see the importance of working together for this 
kind of project and really appreciate it.
<P>
	Having been a member for only 100 days and getting word 
that there is going to be another FEARO panel struck, my 
immediate reaction is that we are wasting dollars on something 
which has already been accomplished. I have heard over and 
over again how it is so necessary to work together to arrive at 
these decisions.
<P>
<B>(1340 ) </B>
<P>
	For the last two weeks I have sought meetings with the 
Minister of Canadian Heritage to no avail. I have sought 
meetings with the Minister of the Environment in her office to 
no avail. I am wondering how we are going to be able to work 
together if as a member representing my riding of Wild Rose I 
cannot get a hearing with the ministers responsible for these 
things.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Copps:</B> Mr. Speaker, maybe I was not at the same 
meeting but I did have a meeting with the member in the 
anteroom which is as good a meeting room as any. In that 
particular room I said the panel was struck.
<P>
	The fact is that if the EARP guidelines had been met in the 
past there is no forum to strike a second panel. A proper panel 
was not struck in the past and it has not been subject to 
environmental review. The review panel has now been struck. In 
very short order the membership will be published and the 
hearings will begin.
<P>
	I think the member for Wild Rose will also admit that in 
talking about the issue in question which is a major ski 
development, the developer not being able to receive proper 
environmental approvals for the whole project, basically cut the 
project in half and tried to get approval for the parking lot 
separate from the lifts. We think it has to be looked upon as an 
integrated package.
<P>
	We have called for a panel to be struck and the panel will have 
to do its job. Obviously it has to be done in the context of the 
environmental implications. We would be remiss if we basically 
said that this particular person has invested a significant amount 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1255"> 1255 </A></B>
<P>
of money and therefore it has to go ahead without any 
consideration of the environmental implications.
<P>
	The hon. member will recognize that if the environmental 
concerns had been met obviously we would have no authority to 
strike an EARP panel. The fact one is being struck is because 
there has not been a proper environmental assessment.
<P>
	We are doing what we have done in the past. We did it most 
recently with the federal-Saskatchewan panel on uranium 
mining. We are doing it with BAPE wherever possible. We are 
trying to facilitate the process where federal and provincial 
interests intersect. We are trying to run joint panels to make sure 
we do not put the developer and interested parties through the 
same process twice.
<P>
	That has certainly been the practice I have established and 
want to continue. From that perspective we only want one stop 
shopping for environmental hearings. We do not want to put a 
project through a provincial hearing and then a federal hearing 
and have a number of hearings.
<P>
	That being said we certainly are not about to give up our right 
to require an environmental assessment on an issue as 
significant as a major ski development in our national Rockies. 
The member points out that this is on the parking lot but the 
parking lot is going to be there for something. If the parking lot 
is being built to park cars, obviously there has to be a ski hill to 
go along with it.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu):</B> Mr. Speaker, first of all, 
Madam Minister, let me congratulate you on the lovely clothes 
you are wearing today. We were used to seeing you always in 
scarlet red and today you are wearing blue, which suits you very 
well. For the members around you, we hope that next week you 
will not change your red book for a blue book.
<P>
	Outside of the debate on the resolution related to your 
observations, you said that it was difficult to live in this country. 
We applauded and you added, ``It is worth it''. We in the Bloc 
have rather concluded that there were two countries in this 
country and that it was worth building the one which does not yet 
exist as a separate country.
<P>
	The fact remains that these are two points of view which we 
do not share, but they are basically honestly held on either side 
of the House.
<P>
	You said that it was not easy and you also referred to 
consultations, but with reference to the resolution, you even 
spoke of possible agreements to reduce overlap, and I 
congratulate you if such agreements can come about-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order! I would simply 
remind the hon. member for Richelieu and the House to address 
your remarks to the Chair and not directly to the person to whom 
a question is put.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Plamondon:</B> For a young Acting Speaker like you to 
warn an old member like me, Mr. Speaker, I see that you have 
already learned your job well and I will make a point of 
complying with your directives.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, the minister spoke about a possible agreement 
with the pulp and paper industry and I commend her for that, 
because we denounce this continual duplication and overlap, we 
denounced it during the election campaign and we still denounce 
it continually here in the House. Our resolution for the 
opposition day yesterday talked about precisely that. Today, I 
think the Reform Party's resolution may be more specific and 
less broad but it also talks about eliminating this wasteful 
spending due to overlap.
<P>
<B>(1345) </B>
<P>
	In my riding, I saw overlap during the big debate about the 
closure of Dioxide Canada. The provincial government had 
environmental standards, the federal government had 
environmental standards, one said something was white, the 
other that it was black, so much so that the company did not 
know just what to do. Furthermore, Fisheries and Oceans 
Canada also came on the scene, with the result that the company 
that had planned to close in Tracy and open in Bécancour 
decided to suspend the work in Bécancour, temporarily, I hope. 
This is a fine example of wasted energy, time and money, to the 
detriment of the 400 Dioxide workers.
<P>
	I would like to conclude, Mr. Speaker. The minister did not 
mention it in her speech this morning and we were surprised by a 
statement from the member for Ottawa-Vanier, former 
chairman of the public accounts committee. All day yesterday, 
the Liberal members said, ``Why do you call for a special 
committee of all members of the House to study the spending of 
every department item by item?'' They told us, ``No, the public 
accounts committee will look after that. That is its role''. This 
morning, the member for Ottawa-Vanier, a former opposition 
member who chaired the public accounts committee for three 
years, as my colleague reminds me, and I conclude with that, 
Mr. Speaker, told us, ``We made a report, but the House never 
acted on it in three years''. So the public accounts committee has 
become something of a habit-it tables a report and no one acts 
on it. That is why we are demanding-and I think it is along the 
lines of the Reformers' resolution-a special committee of 
members from the government and all parties, including 
independents, to carry out an exhaustive item-by-item study of 
all spending by the departments. I think that the government's 
commitment would be greater, out of respect for the conclusions 
this committee would have reached. It would elicit a greater 
commitment than the usual annual report of the public accounts 
committee, which was denounced this morning by the man who 
chaired it for three years, the member for Ottawa-Vanier.
<P>
	I would like to have the minister's comments.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1256"> 1256 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Ms. Copps:</B> Mr. Speaker, without commenting on what the 
gentlemen opposite are wearing, I would like to point out that 
the hon. member was himself a Tory and that, since Tory blue 
has gone out of style in this House, I now feel more comfortable 
wearing blue.
<P>
	That being said, if the government he was a member of did not 
take good care of public accounts, why did he not do something 
about it when he was a government member? When we are 
preparing estimates-not just public accounts, because there is 
a process that includes public accounts-of course, the 
opposition can chair the Public Accounts Committee, but there 
is also the budgetary process where you can call any minister on 
any expenditure on any committee. I for one have just signed our 
estimates for the year to come and we must be held publicly 
accountable for these expenditures. So, there are not only public 
accounts but also estimates and I am sure that in this new era of 
liberalism in government much closer attention will be paid to 
constructive criticism from the opposition regarding 
government spending.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to repeat the supply motion of the Reform Party:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House call on the government to demonstrate its commitment to 
accountability and to the efficient and effective use of public funds by reporting 
to the House, no later than the first week of June each year, what measures have 
been taken by the government to address unresolved problems identified by the 
Auditor General in his report such as-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I go to our subclause (f):
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>that the Minister of the Environment address the duplication of regulations between 
the federal government and the provincial governments regarding the pulp and 
paper industry-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I believe many observers of the House of Commons agree that 
Reform Party members have brought a constructive approach to 
all matters before the House. We have led the way in the 
establishment of a very direct formula. We look at the good and 
compliment; we review areas of concern and define them; and 
finally we work to create a positive response with an attitude to 
making the process work.
<P>
<B>(1350) </B>
<P>
	First let me commend the Minister of the Environment for her 
exhibition of an attitude of co-operation and her expression of a 
desire that all members of the House of Commons have access to 
relevant information and the ability to dialogue with officials in 
her department.
<P>
	I also wish to compliment the deputy minister and the 
assistant deputy minister on their recent interview with the 
Standing Committee on Environment and Sustainable 
Development. As one of the two Reform MPs on the standing 
committee I was very impressed with their very forthright and 
business-like attitude and look forward to working with both the 
minister and her officials.
<P>
	As the member for Kootenay East I am acutely aware of the 
environment. I have in my constituency Glacier National Park, 
Yoho National Park and Kootenay National Park. My home on 
Wasa Lake is only five miles from Crestbrook Forest Industries 
pulp mill at Skookumchuk and as a consequence I have a great 
sensitivity to sharing a pristine wilderness with a large 
industrial production facility.
<P>
	I am pleased to report that in total Crestbrook Forest 
Industries has exhibited a very responsible attitude toward its 
potential liability to the environment. In fact it has just 
completed a $200 million project which responds directly to 
concerns about pollution.
<P>
	Crestbrook, along with other members of the pulp and paper 
industry, come under regulations put forward by both the federal 
and provincial governments. I know from casual conversations 
with various people in the industry that the duplication of 
regulations between the two levels of government regarding the 
pulp and paper industry has been frustrating at times. I refer 
specifically to the Auditor General's report on the duplication of 
regulations.
<P>
	We are concerned about attracting international investment 
and creating a climate of confidence for the domestic investor. 
There is nothing that scares capital more than the unknown. 
Investors must have the security of knowing what the rules of 
the game are going to be.
<P>
	Learning from history I note in paragraph 26.37 of the Auditor 
General's report that:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The January 1993 report of the Sub-committee on Regulations and 
Competitiveness of the House of Commons Standing Committee on Finance 
criticized the Department for not assessing the benefits of regulations.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It continues:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-a commitment of $4.1 billion in resources, with no apparent sense of the 
magnitude of the benefits, was not reasonable.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is a commitment of $4.1 billion in resources being 
thrown into the unknown.
<P>
	The Auditor General continues:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The data to assess the effectiveness of the regulations, including long-term 
impacts, are expected to come eventually from the Environmental Effects 
Monitoring Program.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I ask that members to note the words: ``are expected to come 
eventually''. In the next paragraph the Auditor General states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Environmental Effects Monitoring guidelines and program continued to be 
developed after the regulations were passed.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I draw to the attention of members the words: ``continued to 
be developed''. He continues:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1257"> 1257 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In early 1993, the industry expressed concern that the program was still evolving 
and that its final scope and costs to all were not yet fully defined.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I note there again the word evolving. From this instructive 
lesson we can see why the investor in Canadian business has 
some serious concerns about the application and impact our 
laws and regulations bring to our desired direction.
<P>
	The Reform Party believes there must be a balance in which 
environmental considerations carry equal weight, that they do 
not overpower economic, social and technical considerations in 
the development of any project. We believe that without any 
economic development and the income generated therefrom the 
environment will not be protected nor enjoyed.
<P>
	Overlap of enforcement is an additional problem. For 
example, I am aware of two recent cases in British Columbia, 
one involving Weyerhaeuser's Pulp Mill at Kamloops and the 
other at Howe Sound Pulp and Paper on the coast. As a result of 
effluent spills, both federal and provincial agencies felt obliged 
to take legal samples. A couple of days after the provincial 
government regulators turned up, the Department of Fisheries 
and Oceans felt obliged to use a search warrant to obtain 
information and repeated the process already completed by the 
provincial government.
<P>
<B>(1355) </B>
<P>
	There are also redundant regulations. As an example, at the 
federal level there are two regulations under the Canadian 
Environmental Protection Act affecting the pulp industry which 
deal with the use of defoaming agents and pentachlorophenol 
contaminated wood chips. Both these regulations were 
introduced to control potential sources of dioxins and furans in 
the pulping process. Pentachlorophenol is no longer used by the 
sawmilling industry and therefore this regulation is redundant. 
The petrochemical agency has cleaned up the oil based 
defoaming agents, making the second regulation also redundant.
<P>
	New initiatives under federal fishery regulations require pulp 
mills to do environmental effects monitoring at a cost of 
$150,000 to $200,000 a year per mill and there is little or no 
confidence that the results will be scientifically meaningful. It 
is a case of collecting information for the sake of having the 
information, with no apparent value but at very high cost to the 
industry.
<P>
	In the spirit of co-operation, I know the environment minister 
is aware there are federal-provincial environmental agreements 
that have been drafted and reviewed by senior level bureaucrats 
at the federal level in co-operation with the provincial 
ministries of environment in B.C. and Quebec. I understand 
early drafts have also been developed for Ontario and Nova 
Scotia. They are very close to conclusion.
<P>
	In light of the government's much quoted red book position on 
the elimination of duplication and overlap of federal-provincial 
services, I ask the minister to push the various buttons required 
to get the agreements completed. The minister today 
acknowledged these agreements are pending. I am asking for 
priority to expedite completion.
<P>
	I will be sending a copy of this speech to the chairman of the 
Standing Committee on Environment and Sustainable 
Development to indicate that I will be raising this issue with a 
view to having the committee encourage the early completion of 
these agreements. This is a no cost way of enhancing 
efficiencies in the application and enforcement of regulations, 
thereby reducing the cost to industry.
<P>
	In addition, I will be circulating copies of my speech to all 
interested parties in a spirit of co-operation to assist in the 
creation of a positive working relationship with an attitude of 
making the process work. I invite constructive criticism and 
input, especially from industry, to the suggestions I have made 
today.
<P>
	As stated, Reform Party members are striving to bring a 
constructive approach to all matters before the House. However, 
as indicated in our supply motion, it is imperative that the 
Minister of the Environment, not later than the first week of 
June each year, deliver to the House a report outlining what 
measures have been taken to address the unresolved problems 
identified by the Auditor General. As he chose to focus on the 
issue of pulp and paper regulations, identifying specific 
deficiencies, we anticipate that the minister will respond 
positively to this most reasonable position put forward by the 
Reform Party.
<P>
	That kind of response will clearly demonstrate the 
government's commitment to accountability to the House and, 
through it, to the people of Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harold Culbert (Carleton-Charlotte):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened with interest to the hon. member's presentation.
<P>
	Just a very quick question. I wonder if the hon. member 
considers his party and himself the only members in the House 
interested in the well-being of people, both financially and 
otherwise, right across this country. I am sure that was not his 
intention but that was certainly the impression he gave.
<P>
	I have had conversations with members from all regions of 
this great nation of ours, as well as from all political parties 
represented here. First and foremost their interest is in their 
ridings, their constituents and certainly in the welfare of this 
great nation of ours.
<P>
<B>(1400) </B>
<P>
	I want to point out to the hon. member that we on the 
government side will be asking those very same questions of our 
ministers and will continue to. We want to assure members of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1258"> 1258 </A></B>
<P>
the Reform Party and the citizens of this great nation that 
government members are responsible  and interested in every 
government department and will continue to be.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the comments of my 
colleague on the other side of the House. I in no way intended to 
imply there was anything less just because they unfortunately 
happen to be Liberals as opposed to Reformers.
<P>
	What I am really trying to say is there is a creeping agenda, 
not necessarily within the Liberal Party or the Bloc Quebecois or 
any other party, but there seems to be a creeping agenda in 
Canada. I cite as an example the one my colleague from Wild 
Rose has raised where an ongoing process keeps on being 
stymied by environmental concerns. It is as though a group of 
people simply will not take yes for an answer.
<P>
	The difficulty I am having in understanding this is that we can 
keep on using environmental considerations as a road block 
rather than an effective way to control all of the areas of concern 
that we have. Environmental considerations are frequently put 
up as road blocks to be able to proceed with responsible and 
reasonable industrial objectives.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robert D. Nault (Kenora-Rainy River):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I am quite intrigued by the flow of the Reform Party so far in this 
particular issue. I would like to follow this up with the member.
<P>
	The hon. member can correct me if I am wrong because I am 
trying to read into what he has said so far. He is suggesting the 
regulations we have in place are not working. He also has the 
interesting suggestion that all the regulations we have in place 
are there for some motive not considered acceptable to the 
Reform Party and that is to do nothing but delay and stop 
economic development or business.
<P>
	Even though there are times when he personally disagrees 
with the decision made on behalf of the environment, would the 
hon. member overlook his own particular interests? In the case 
of his colleague from Wild Rose for example, would he agree 
there are times and situations where the overall good of the 
environment takes precedence over his own individual interests 
as a politician and maybe those of his constituents?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Mr. Speaker, again in no way did I intend to 
imply that all regulations are bad. Of course there have to be 
regulations. What I was suggesting in my response a minute ago 
is the fact that very frequently people who are opposed to an 
approved project will find some other way of thwarting it by 
using regulations.
<P>
	With respect I ask members of the House is it responsible, is it 
rational, is it reasonable? I quote the Auditor General when he 
says there were $4.1 billion invested by industry in regulations 
that were duplications, in regulations that were changing and 
regulations that were suspect.
<P>
	I cite as an example, not necessarily federal regulations 
although they relate to provincial regulations, in the province of 
British Columbia some bright light decided we were going to be 
having zero as the level we had to achieve on a particular 
contaminant that was coming out of the pulping process. This 
figure was arrived at from the blue sky as it were.
<P>
	Industry has invested countless hundreds of millions of 
dollars trying to achieve this and we now discover it is not 
necessary to achieve it. Should we now be paying back the 
industry? We do not have the resources to do that.
<P>
<B>(1405 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the Auditor General noted last year that CIDA, the Canadian 
International Development Agency, spent about $3 billion. It 
has spent similar amounts during the last 25 years of its 
mandate. Bangladesh alone has received over $2 billion over the 
last 25 years. The Auditor General notes that the people of 
Canada are asking whether this money has been spent wisely and 
whether they are getting a good return on their taxes.
<P>
	I have a weak spot in my heart for CIDA. In 1978 I lectured 
and did research at the University of Nairobi in Kenya. My 
salary and my family's moving expenses were paid by CIDA 
through the University of Alberta which administered the 
program of technical assistance under a contract from CIDA. 
My housing expenses in Nairobi were met by the Government of 
Kenya.
<P>
	My personal experience illustrates some of the difficulties 
which the Auditor General found to exist with CIDA programs 
more generally.
<P>
	CIDA had a very tight control over the design and delivery of 
the technical aid program or what might be called the input. The 
University of Alberta had worked closely with the University of 
Nairobi and the Government of Kenya in the determination of 
the role which Canadian professors would play in the teaching 
program and development of an effective business curriculum. 
There was also much care taken in establishing my suitability 
for the task in preparing me for the problems I was likely to 
encounter.
<P>
	As many critics, in particular the Nielsen task force report of 
government spending programs, have noted, input control and 
accountability are the easy parts. The difficult part is showing 
that spending has achieved specified goals and that the 
investment has yielded the expected rate of return. Let me 
illustrate the problem, again by reference to my own experience.
<P>
	I look proudly back on the services I delivered in Nairobi. 
There were the large courses I taught, the research papers I 
wrote and published, the students and faculty I induced to go on 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1259"> 1259 </A></B>
<P>
to graduate work at my university and the influence I have had 
on the public discussion of the government's economic policies, 
including an invited lecture at the School for Kenyan Civil 
Servants.
<P>
	What I do not know and what has plagued me ever since my 
experience is whether the positive things I accomplished were 
worth the money Canadian taxpayers invested in the project. I 
do not know that I or anyone else could make such a calculation, 
even with large resources and the best of will. Nielsen noted that 
the inability to do so is exactly at the heart of the problems 
which many Canadians have with their government.
<P>
	However, as Nielsen and the Auditor General noted, not all 
government programs have non-measurable outputs. Roads, 
water works, factories and other tangible projects fall into this 
category. It is with these that the Auditor General has found 
particular problems. The most important of these, repeated a 
number of times in the chapter, is that some have been 
undertaken at great cost and have failed to deliver the expected 
benefits because the host government did not have the resources 
to continue its operation or even maintain the physical structure. 
I personally have seen roads built with foreign aid deteriorating 
at alarming rates and some ending in the middle of a desert.
<P>
	Reform supports the Auditor General's request that CIDA 
engage in a systematic assessment of the availability of local 
support funds before it commits Canadian resources to any 
project. In addition CIDA should be required to report to 
Parliament the results of its efforts in this direction and in 
following up the use to which the projects have been put.
<P>
	Reform also hopes that the government will follow up on the 
Auditor General's most basic recommendation: that the minister 
in question is accountable for measuring and reporting on the 
results of CIDA's programs. Reform would push for this 
recommendation further and urge that Parliament have greater 
involvement through consultation and debate over CIDA's 
budget.
<P>
<B>(1410 ) </B>
<P>
	The Auditor General's report identifies a large number of 
issues which are of a fundamental nature and that lend 
themselves to such a debate without interfering with the 
agency's efficiency in its day to day operations.
<P>
	I recommend to hon. members a reading of this chapter. One 
of the issues raised by the Auditor General concerns the fact that 
historically CIDA has given aid to many countries. He and his 
consultants have agreed that this approach should be changed 
and that spending should concentrate instead on a limited 
number of specific countries. Parliament can make valuable 
contributions to the solution of these matters.
<P>
	Another important issue identified by the Auditor General is 
the conflicting nature of some of the most important mandates 
of the agency. Thus it is required to help the poor directly but 
also increase the productive capacity of the poor. These two 
objectives involve an irreconcilable conflict. Food aid keeps 
down the prices of agricultural products and discourages local 
production. It creates dependence.
<P>
	It is ironic that the exact same problems face domestic 
Canadian spending on social programs and the interprovincial 
equalization program extended through Bill C-3. I discussed 
these problems and offered possible solutions the first two times 
I spoke in this House.
<P>
	The proposals of the Minister of Human Resources 
Development for the redesign of domestic social programs will 
be discussed by Parliament. So should the CIDA programs and 
mandates. In this context there would undoubtedly be an 
evaluation of the Auditor General's view that programs in some 
countries lack coherence, that they use an inadequate knowledge 
base and may have failed to review development effort in the 
light of recent changes in the understanding of the nature of the 
basic development process.
<P>
	In the evaluation of the CIDA spending in Bangladesh the 
Auditor General noted that the country's structural weaknesses 
make self-reliant development very difficult. I wonder whether 
this assessment is a code for one of the ideas advanced by some 
students of development aid, namely, that aid should be made 
conditional upon the receiving country making structural 
changes that support the development process such as freeing of 
markets and prices, the protection of property rights and the 
introduction of democracy. Certainly this topic would be one on 
which many members of Parliament would want to have an 
input.
<P>
	One of the criticisms of the Auditor General is that CIDA is 
overregulated and suffers from the widespread bureaucratic 
disease which makes staff more concerned about following a 
risk minimizing process for spending money than in getting 
good results. These are almost the verbatim words of the 
Auditor General. He believes this state of affairs should be 
changed by making the management staff and process simpler 
and more transparent and focused on goals identified in 
co-operation with recipient countries.
<P>
	In addition, CIDA should adopt a learning culture and devote 
more effort to the identification of problems that develop while 
projects are under way. The Auditor General believes that such a 
change will be forced on CIDA by making its staff, management 
and ministers explicitly and directly accountable to Parliament 
and through it to the general public whose taxes finance its 
operation.
<P>
	Reform agrees with this assessment made by the Auditor 
General. It urges the government to force CIDA into becoming 
more responsive to Parliament, not only in its day to day 
operations but in setting goals and processes for the selection 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1260"> 1260 </A></B>
<P>
and evaluation of its programs. The people of Canada deserve no 
less.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened carefully to the comments made by the hon. 
member opposite. I want to congratulate him on his speech. 
Nevertheless, we should not, either inadvertently or 
intentionally, tarnish all CIDA projects.
<P>
	I am one of those who had the privilege, during my many 
years as a member of Parliament, to visit a number of projects in 
developing countries.
<P>
<B>(1415) </B>
<P>
	I remember a project in Niger, Africa, where I went to see that 
a $1,500 grant from the Canadian government made it possible 
to lay a pipe bringing water to a vegetable garden tended 
exclusively by village women.
<P>
	Some 75 families were using that garden and, given Niger's 
climate, they could have fresh vegetables almost year round 
thanks to a small investment by this country.
<P>
	It is all right to talk about all the audits needed to meet 
requirements, but it would not make much sense to spend $3,000 
on audits to review something that cost $1,500.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I remember visiting a well in Niger. This well had cost $5,000 
and was providing water for a complete village. This was made 
by Canadian contributions exclusively. When our delegation 
entered that village everyone was waving little Canadian flags 
to greet us.
<P>
	It made me proud to be a Canadian because of what we were 
doing for those people. Let us not lose sight of that.
<P>
	It is easy for all of us to think of a CIDA grant, as what I once 
heard on television, as buying ham slicers for Muslims. There is 
no such thing as a ham slicer, it is a meat slicer. There is nothing 
that says on it that you can only slice one kind of product. In any 
case, it had been put that way because it was the sexy way, I 
guess, of appealing to the constituency you wanted to appeal to.
<P>
	I say to our colleagues across the way and to everyone who 
cares to listen that it is important for us to keep all of these 
things in perspective.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	All those of us who have worked in the area of international 
development know that the theories explained by some hon. 
members-theoretical audits, bills and so on-do not always 
work like they are supposed to in the field, across the globe, 
where there is no electricity, no computers, etc., and where 
someone can be hired off the street to dig a hole. Let us keep that 
in mind.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grubel:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is obvious that I would never say 
that all of the programs of CIDA are failures, having been 
involved as deeply as I was in the CIDA project. It would be 
condemning what I have done. I may be foolish, but not that 
foolish.
<P>
	I am also glad to hear that the hon. member had such a great 
feeling of being a proud Canadian when he walked by a project 
financed by us. The question that is being raised by my 
constituents, by people around the country and that the 
Auditor's report reflects is in this period of financial difficulty 
can we afford to pay money so that this gentleman can feel good 
about walking past a garden that was financed by our money? 
That is the question.
<P>
	I also would like the hon. member to notice that I was very 
statesman-like in this report of mine. I did not do what the 
media loves to do and pick on individual bad projects. That is 
cheap. I did not do that. We ought to approach this in an 
objective way. It was approached by the Auditor General in an 
objective way. He did a tremendous amount of research to 
evaluate these projects.
<P>
	The fact is that we spent $3 billion and he is getting again and 
again from those people who ask objective questions that they 
do not believe they are getting their money's worth, that there is 
too much bureaucracy and making sure that bureaucrats do not 
get caught doing anything wrong rather than looking to see if 
they are achieving the right thing.
<P>
<B>(1420 ) </B>
<P>
	I did not say all are doing it. The auditor said that this is 
characteristic of the program. I believe and go along with the 
auditor, as the Reform Party does, that one way to improve the 
quality of what CIDA does, one way to raise the quality, which is 
undoubtedly quite high, is for the people running CIDA from the 
minister downward to be more responsive to this House.
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
first of all I would like to say I welcome this opportunity to 
respond to several of the concerns that have been raised in 
today's opposition day motion, particularly with respect to the 
aboriginal economic development program.
<P>
	Although the motion refers this question to the Minister of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development the aboriginal 
economic development program is administered by Industry 
Canada, formerly Industry, Science and Technology Canada.
<P>
	In his report to the House of Commons, the Auditor General's 
comments on the aboriginal economic development strategy 
served to focus attention on this issue at a time when there is 
renewed interest by aboriginal Canadians in their tradition of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1261"> 1261 </A></B>
<P>
commerce and there is increasing recognition by the 
non-aboriginal private sector in doing business with First 
Nations.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	As Minister of Industry, I am responsible for a large number 
of programs and services designed to increase Canadian 
businesses' competitiveness. And the businesses managed by 
aboriginal people play a strategic role in this effort. In fact, 
these businesses will have an increasingly more important role 
in our economy, which is about to enter a new millennium.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The government's aboriginal business programs are quite 
deliberately located in the industry department which is able to 
offer programs to all aboriginal Canadians, including status and 
non-status Indians, Métis and Inuit peoples.
<P>
	This role continues a tradition going back over 20 years as the 
department and its predecessors help to build a critical mass of 
aboriginal business owners and managers.
<P>
	Moreover, with its specialists in business issues and 
intelligence, Industry Canada is best positioned to serve the 
business needs of aboriginal clients, the role it plays in the 
Canadian aboriginal economic development strategy.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In carrying out my duties, I can count on the precious advice 
and dedication of the native economic development boards in 
the private sectors, which have played a major role in the 
evolution of the government's business development programs 
over the years. The boards, which are mainly made up of 
aboriginal businesses and chiefs of communities from all over 
the country, develop policies and make recommendations to 
Industry Canada on initiatives which deserve support.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We are partnered in the Canadian aboriginal economic 
development strategy with the Department of Indian and 
Northern Affairs, which focuses on community economic 
development, and with the Department of Human Resources 
Development which promotes training and workforce 
participation.
<P>
	Our other partners are the aboriginal women and men who 
have worked with the program over the last four and a half years 
to realize their business dreams.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The Auditor General took a look at a number of businesses 
and he made recommendations on monitoring the progress of 
our clients. He wants us to follow up and obtain information 
allowing us to see if public funds are invested shrewdly.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I have to say that I agree with the Auditor General on this 
point and while procedures were not fully developed at the time 
last year when he conducted the review, I am assured that our 
department is currently making improvements in our tracking 
systems and will be much better able to monitor the performance 
of our client companies in the future.
<P>
	I will continue to watch this program and all programs for 
which I am responsible to make sure that the money being spent, 
every dime of it, is being used effectively and carefully. We are 
and want to be accountable to all of the taxpayers of Canada.
<P>
<B>(1425) </B>
<P>
	I am sure members would be interested to know, however, that 
there are many successes being achieved by aboriginal 
businesses in Canada. Most Canadians do not know that there is 
high tech equipment manufactured by a Canadian aboriginal 
firm, ACR Systems Inc. of Surrey, British Columbia, which has 
its products on the Canadarm in outer space and on formula one 
race cars very much on the ground.
<P>
	ACR's temperature data loggers meet the highest quality 
standards and serve a variety of uses, including measuring 
building environments for energy savings and maintaining the 
careful temperature controls of blood products while in transit.
<P>
	We all take pride in the achievements of Canadian aboriginal 
entrepreneurs and film producers as well as entertainers who are 
increasingly making their mark on national and international 
stages.
<P>
	Canadian aboriginal tourism products and destinations are 
now being sought by visitors to Canada, particularly from 
Europe, for the unique experiences created and the genuine 
hospitality offered by aboriginal hosts. The aboriginal tourism 
sector is already an important contributor to the country's 
performance in this important area of our economy.
<P>
	There are many examples of success from the small 
community based grocery store to the investment bankers on 
Bay Street. Winnie Giesbrecht has created a thriving business 
operation in downtown Winnipeg so that she could fill a need for 
a care home and employ aboriginal women.
<P>
	D'Arcy Moses and Dorothy Grant have unveiled Canadian 
aboriginal high fashion to the world at the Canadian Embassy in 
Paris.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	So, even if we learn some tough lessons from previous 
initiatives, the things which we do well must be pointed out.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1262"> 1262 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Under our current aboriginal economic programs, we have 
supported some 3,000 client firms. The $230 million that went 
toward these business ventures of every size levered other 
investments and an injection of half a billion dollars in total 
resulted for the aboriginal private sector.
<P>
	From a study commissioned last year looking at firms the 
program supported over their first two years we learned the 
following facts: 90 per cent of all businesses the department 
capitalized were still operating after two years; 60 per cent of 
these firms were operating with a profit or a small loss. These 
results compared favourably with the Canadian average for 
small business performance.
<P>
[Translation] 
<P>
	Important jobs are created by aboriginal businesses. The 
study encompassed some 300 companies which either created or 
preserved more than 2,000 jobs.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The cost to the government in helping to create these jobs 
turned out to be much lower when compared with past efforts. 
These firms proved to be effective providers of jobs for 
non-aboriginal Canadians as well, especially in some of the 
more remote areas of the country.
<P>
	I am committed to building on the momentum that I have 
described. There is a critical mass of entrepreneurship, of 
skilled and talented aboriginal people who are working very 
hard right now to turn things around for themselves and for their 
communities.
<P>
	As a government we will continue to do what we can to 
improve the climate for this business growth and support the 
leadership and the initiative and the desire for self-reliance 
being shown by aboriginal Canadians in all parts of the country.
<P>
	As Minister of Industry I would like to respond to some of the 
issues raised by the Auditor General in his report on the failure 
of the former Department of Industry, Science and Technology 
to follow the government's accounting policies. I am sure, Mr. 
Speaker, you will find this especially fascinating and I hope that 
you can contain your excitement as I talk about accounting 
policies.
<P>
	The policy, entitled ``Payables At Year End'', requires 
departments to charge expenditures to the period in which they 
were incurred rather than that in which they were paid. The net 
result was that in the Auditor General's opinion the department 
under-recorded its liabilities at year end by some $42 million.
<P>
<B>(1430) </B>
<P>
	I am told the discussion between the office of the Auditor 
General, my department and the Treasury Board Secretariat, 
formerly the Office of the Comptroller General, has revolved 
around the difficulty of managing multi-year contribution 
agreements. This is complex and  the rules for accounting are 
based on long standing and generally accepted principles of 
recognizing liabilities when they occur.
<P>
	However, in the case under discussion, there has been a 
legitimate difference of opinion as to which accounting policy 
should apply and which fiscal year the liabilities should appear 
in the public accounts. The office of the Auditor General is not 
disputing the legality of the payments, only the accounting 
treatment.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The department's interpretation of the accounting policy has 
always been approved by the former Office of the Comptroller 
General, which is now part of the Treasury Board Secretariat. In 
fact, according to this office, the department maintains a high 
degree of control.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Also, it is generally agreed that departments do not always 
have control over the timing of costs incurred in multi-year 
contractual arrangements. This can result in variances from 
planned spending levels on a year to year basis even though 
parliamentary authorities are adhered to on a multi-year 
timeframe.
<P>
	The department has had extensive discussions with the 
Treasury Board Secretariat which drafted the policy and that the 
Auditor General, in his report with respect to this item, is 
interpreting. This resulted in the deputy comptroller general 
agreeing with the department's accounting treatment of all 
items under discussion with the office of the Auditor General 
save for one item for $7.3 million.
<P>
	This item was recorded in the 1992-93 fiscal year by the 
department and we accept the Treasury Board Secretariat as the 
final arbitrator in all accounting matters. The Auditor General's 
figure of $42 million was not adjusted to reflect the 
department's action in recording the $7.3 million item due to 
printing deadlines for the annual report. The amount actually 
under discussion is therefore roughly $35 million. This is 
comprised of one amount of $31 million which the Auditor 
General felt should have been recorded in fiscal year 1992-93. 
The disagreement, especially in the case of this amount, rose to 
the extremely complex nature of the contribution agreement in 
question. In situations of such complexity, often professional 
accountants will arrive at different conclusions based on their 
interpretations of the same set of facts.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Moreover, there are two adjusting entries representing a total 
of $4.5 million. However, as was already mentioned, the 
Treasury Board Secretariat supports our accounting procedure 
regarding those items.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1263"> 1263 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In summary, the issue of unrecorded liabilities is part of a 
fairly long standing dialogue between the Department of 
Industry Canada and its predecessor, the Department of 
Industry, Science and Technology, and the office of the Auditor 
General due to the complex technical accounting issues 
surrounding the management of multi-year contribution 
agreements within the current accounting framework.
<P>
	The Treasury Board Secretariat, author of the government's 
accounting policy, fully supports the manner in which the 
department has treated its liabilities and reported them in its 
annual report. The department has, for its part, been in full 
compliance with the accounting policies of Treasury Board.
<P>
	We do, however, undertake to continue to work closely with 
the Auditor General in endeavouring to ensure that in future, 
agreement is reached between the department, the Treasury 
Board Secretariat and the Auditor General prior to publication 
of the Auditor General's report.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to preface my question with a broad statement so that we can set 
the agenda.
<P>
	It seems that whenever a Reform Party member asks a 
question about aboriginal issues that Reform Party member 
must be racist according to certain people within this House. 
That is exceptionally unfortunate. This is not question period 
and not widely shown on television but I would like to enter into 
a very honest, candid and searching dialogue with the minister. I 
thank him for being in the House.
<P>
<B>(1435 ) </B>
<P>
	One of the concerns expressed about the aboriginal economic 
program, and I suggest not just in ridings that have members 
from the Reform Party but perhaps in some of the other ridings 
as well, is the issue of competitiveness.
<P>
	This is a very sincere question. It is not a trick question. I 
would like the minister to assure the people in my constituency 
and perhaps many other Canadians. We are attempting to correct 
what has gone on previously, particularly with the aboriginal 
community, by investing $230 million, to use the minister's 
figures, into a business program. That program has the potential 
of pitting those businesses against non-aboriginal businesses. 
The non-aboriginal businesses are under very severe taxation. 
Some are actually at the point of failure because of severe 
taxation. There seems to be some hostility and some concern 
that $230 million of these businessmen's tax money is being put 
into something which is based on a situation because of race, 
and that those people then have a $230 million advantage.
<P>
	I wonder if the minister could help me and perhaps help 
Canadians get around the feeling that this is not setting the 
non-aboriginal community at a disadvantage.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manley:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the question. The best 
way to explain my view of this is to say that I do not see the 
contribution to aboriginal businesses under this program as 
putting the non-aboriginal community at a $230 million 
disadvantage. I would suggest to the hon. member that the 
amount we are able to invest in aboriginal businesses falls far 
short of enabling the aboriginal community to reach an 
equilibrium with the non-aboriginal community.
<P>
	Let me explain a little more what I mean. First, as we know, 
throughout Canada access to capital for small and medium sized 
business is difficult. It is doubly difficult for members of the 
aboriginal community, particularly those living in parts of the 
country where the existing economic infrastructure is not well 
developed.
<P>
	Second, with respect to this program, we are endeavouring not 
to right the wrongs of past generations, but to assist a group of 
people to build on a base of self-reliance.
<P>
	If we are going to do that, we have to not only provide capital, 
we must have programs that assist in helping the members of the 
aboriginal business community expand their businesses in a 
meaningful way, to have the kind of interest shown 
post-advancement of capital, as the business grows and 
develops, that ensures its success.
<P>
	We are dealing with financial assistance which is rather small 
when compared to assistance given to other segments of 
government, some federal, some provincial, to many 
non-aboriginal businesses. We are endeavouring, with some 
success, as I think statistics will show, to create within the 
aboriginal community a successful spirit of entrepreneurship, 
culture of entrepreneurship if you like, leading to self-reliance 
and offering people the opportunity not just to get handouts and 
not even to get jobs of their own but to create jobs for themselves 
and for others in their community.
<P>
	This is a very important contribution, which is why I agreed 
with the Auditor General, provided the strategy is clear and 
developed, and that is what we are endeavouring to do, and also 
providing that this ability to work with the entrepreneurs is 
there. This is why the program is set up with a very thorough 
review process largely directed by experienced members of the 
aboriginal community who provide their input as to what 
businesses should receive financial assistance. It is a 
multi-faceted approach.
<P>
<B>(1440) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the Reform Party for giving us this opportunity 
today 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1264"> 1264 </A></B>
<P>
and I notice, as the debate wears on, that there is a basic 
distinction between what the Reform Party is suggesting and the 
proposal put forward by the  Bloc Quebecois. I would like to 
emphasize this difference based on the minister's speech.
<P>
	Every time we have brought up the subject of government 
finance, we have said that it was imperative, capital that a 
committee composed of representatives of all the official parties 
in this House be set up to review all expenditure items that make 
up the government's financial commitments. While the motion 
that the Reform Party has put before us is interesting, I think that 
it would not give us a broad enough view, a comprehensive view 
of where cutbacks should be made.
<P>
	I wanted to draw a parallel with the department that the 
Minister of Industry runs, as his committee met for the second 
time this week. I attended the meeting because I take a keen 
interest in the issue. I was surprised to learn for one thing that 
the total budget for his department was nine times smaller than 
that of National Defence, in spite of the fact that the 
manufacturing sector is known to create jobs and that 
commitments need to be made in that area. I would like to 
submit to you that with respect to cuts, the problem with what 
the Reform Party is saying is that we get the impression that 
there should be cuts everywhere, across the board. On the other 
hand, a parliamentary committee like the one we are suggesting 
could give us a much more balanced picture. There are indeed 
areas where cuts can be made, but there are others where 
additional resources are required.
<P>
	At that committee meeting where all the deputy ministers had 
come to tell us about their financing activities, every one was 
amazed to hear for instance that as little as $15 million was 
earmarked in the department's budget for the very important 
sector of tourism, a sector that is expected to gain more and 
more importance toward the year 2000. So, both the government 
members and the opposition members present were surprised at 
how meagre their resources were, considering how much needs 
to be done in Canada in that area.
<P>
	Just think that the Quebec Ministry of Tourism alone has 
about the same budget. I picked that particular example because 
it is in the magnificent riding of Hochelaga-Maisonneuve 
-where the hon. minister is always welcome- that you find the 
Olympic Stadium, the Botanical Garden and the Biodome.
<P>
	This is a case where, if a parliamentary committee carried out 
a qualitative study of each budget item related to governmental 
activity, as the Bloc Quebecois is proposing, we could make a 
quantitative determination and realize, for one thing, that there 
should be more resources allocated to the Department of 
Industry, particularly for tourism, and we would be able to make 
nuances. I do not know whether the hon. minister agrees with me 
on this, but I think that this is a basic distinction between what 
the Reform Party and the Bloc Quebec are proposing.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manley:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would love to visit the riding of 
the Bloc Quebecois member. Perhaps shortly.
<P>
	As to his proposal, I agree that we cannot cut 
indiscriminately. We need to have a strategy, and I believe 
strongly in a real strategy of economic development. After all, 
this is going to cost a bit of money.
<P>
	I agree with a system whereby members would have more say 
in budget affairs, even those of government departments. 
Historically speaking that is the real reason for the existence of 
Parliament. The legislative process is only secondary to it. The 
first thing is to provide the government with money, and that is 
what Parliament was created for.
<P>
<B>(1445) </B>
<P>
	I would welcome the opinions of members on the expenditure 
of public funds. Whether we need a committee like the one 
proposed by the Bloc Quebecois, I am not so sure, because 
government spending is extremely complex. Let us take the 
example of my department. A member of the committee-not 
my committee, but the committee of the House- would have to 
look not only at the expenditures under my authority, not only at 
all the programs of Industry Canada which total about $6 billion, 
but also at the spending of the National Research Council, the 
Canadian Space Agency, Statistics Canada and others. There is a 
lot to cover, and I was just talking about the Committee on 
Industry.
<P>
	I believe that any given committee has a lot of work if it wants 
to review the expenditures of all departments. If one committee 
should review all government expenditures, it is really the 
Public Accounts Committee which answers reports like the one 
presented by the Auditor General.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Eugène Bellemare (Carleton-Gloucester):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to congratulate the Minister of Industry for 
his presentation on the development of aboriginal businesses. I 
think he explained well enough that the program is worthwhile 
and that we should maintain and even expand it.
<P>
	I would like to comment on the motion of the Reform Party. I 
will read the French version if the members of that party will 
allow me. It says that the government should study the report of 
the Auditor General, make recommendations and report, I 
quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-no later than the first week of June each year, what measures have been 
taken by the government to address unresolved problems identified by the 
Auditor General in his report-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I have been a member of the committee for the last five years 
and I can say it is totally impossible to implement the proposal 
of the Reform Party. The report was just presented in January 
and I know the members of the steering committee of the Public 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1265"> 1265 </A></B>
<P>
Accounts Committee must meet in order to determine the 
agenda for the study sessions they will hold. The report of the  
Auditor General is not final; the committee must do its work and 
make recommendations.
<P>
	Many recommendations have been made during the last five 
years. The Reform Party and the rest of Parliament should focus 
on the recommendations of the Public Accounts Committee, 
they should make representations and have debates here in the 
House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> Just a short 
question, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	Yesterday I touched on this whole issue of program 
management and I would like to ask the industry minister for his 
opinion on program management and strategy. The Auditor 
General's report-and his colleague, the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, who was a senior official himself, 
will probably agree on what was suggested-seems to point to a 
28 per cent reduction in funds earmarked for program evaluation 
over two fiscal years. I think this is fundamental in the whole 
question of programs when in 1991-1992, for example, $124.5 
billion was invested in 16 programs, only two of which were 
thoroughly evaluated.
<P>
	So I am asking you this: What do you think of the lack of an 
assessment mechanism allowing us to see if the money injected 
has achieved the goals that were set, if program management 
and processes on which so much money is spent have had some 
success.
<P>
<B>(1450) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manley: </B>Mr. Speaker, I think it is necessary, after all, to 
have review systems. It is not necessarily required to review 
every program under a formal system every year because it 
would be too difficult, but each program should be effective. My 
department must have a system of accountability to the minister. 
After all, it is the minister who bears the burden of 
accountability to Parliament.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to take this opportunity today to remind the House of 
some of the factors that contribute to the problems of Canada's 
public administration.
<P>
	My comments are largely based on the positions taken by the 
Bloc Quebecois in this House during the pre-budget debate. We 
think it is important to repeat these discussions on public 
administration and the wasting of public funds, because we see 
the latter as one of the causes of the failure of Canadian 
federalism.
<P>
	The rising federal deficit has increased our foreign debt and, 
as you know, this trend towards relying on foreign loans to 
finance the deficit has mortgaged the future of generations of 
Quebecers and Canadians.
<P>
	Our children will pay for the debt, for what I would call the 
Trudeaumania of the 1970s, when credit cards became the 
Canadian government's main economic instrument.
<P>
	From 1960 to 1994, the debt as a percentage of GDP rose from 
34.6 per cent to 71.8 per cent-a typical example of public 
finances out of control. This means that since 1960, the debt has 
increased faster than the revenue that would be used to pay it off. 
If the debt/GDP ratio indicates the extent of the problem 
inherited from the past, it is easy to see, if we look at how the 
deficit evolved as a percentage of GDP, where this explosion of 
the federal debt started. It started when the Liberal Party of 
Canada was in power.
<P>
	The Liberals are responsible for this public debt explosion.
<P>
	Today, during this sluggish economic recovery, taxpayers 
have the impression that the federal government is not doing its 
share to improve its management methods and eliminate waste. 
In the Auditor General's last report we read, and I quote: 
``Today, it is clearer than ever, to both public servants and 
parliamentarians, that Canadians expect them to demonstrate 
sound and prudent management rather than finding new ways to 
spend borrowed money''.
<P>
	In order to eliminate waste, unnecessary spending and poor 
management in our public administration, I reiterate the request 
by the Bloc Quebecois for a parliamentary committee that would 
analyse and review public expenditures, item by item.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Plamondon:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> Mr. Speaker, it would be 
appropriate to create such a committee, because the Auditor 
General's report, as I said before, shows that Quebecers and 
Canadians are right when they believe that the government is 
wasting part of public funds. I suggest we look at a few examples 
of waste, unnecessary spending and poor management to 
support this view.
<P>
	For instance, at National Revenue, because of a loophole in 
the resource deduction, the government lost $1.2 billion in 
revenue.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Plamondon:</B> That is unacceptable.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> If the government had a 
mechanism for quickly adjusting tax credit programs where 
there was a problem, as recommended by the Public Accounts 
Committee, it could have avoided much of this loss.
<P>
	Investment Canada spent $132,000 on a new office, kitchen 
and bathroom for its new president, although her predecessor's 
office was located in the same building and had the same 
amenities.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Plamondon:</B> That's a big waste.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1266"> 1266 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1455) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe): </B>Another example of waste 
is the $54 million cost related to the use of the Challenger 
aircraft. Travelling done by ministers accounted for more than 
half of this amount, as the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
is well aware. According to the Auditor General, this figure 
translates into an hourly cost of $19,650. Is this the best way to 
finance the travelling of ministers and other officials? This is 
the question asked by the Auditor General, who does not have 
access to the information which would reveal whether or not this 
travelling was justified.
<P>
	Another example of mismanagement is the Northern Cod 
Adjustment and Recovery Program, through which the 
Department of Fisheries and Oceans spent $587 million. The 
Auditor General estimates that, of that amount, close to $15 
million were wasted because the program was poorly managed.
<P>
	Another example is the Canadian Aboriginal Economic 
Development Strategy which we just mentioned. The strategy 
provided for an investment of one billion dollars over a 
five-year period. Three departments were directly involved: 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Industry, as well as 
Employment and Immigration. The stated goal was to reduce the 
gap between aboriginal people and other Canadians.
<P>
	We do not question the objectives of those programs. As the 
hon. member said earlier, we are not asking for cuts to those 
programs, but we want some tools to be able to evaluate their 
implementation. In 1993, $900 million were spent to reduce that 
gap. The Auditor General deplored the lack of co-ordination 
between the three departments. It is not clear who must assume 
leadership for the implementation of the strategy. The 
departments concerned should have a co-ordination plan as well 
as a system to evaluate that strategy.
<P>
	In short, we do not know what concrete benefits resulted from 
this strategy. We do not know if the funds were spent according 
to aboriginal people's priorities. We do not know if there is a 
more profitable way of attaining the same results. As I said 
earlier, between 1989 and 1992, the budget to conduct 
evaluations was reduced by 28 per cent, and out of 16 programs 
representing a total of close to $125 billion, only two were 
evaluated.
<P>
	I want to draw your attention on the duplication of programs 
and the overlapping of jurisdiction, which are also responsible 
for the waste of public funds. In a 1991 study done by the 
Treasury Board of Canada, not the Bloc Quebecois or any other 
group, the Treasury Board concluded that, for at least half of the 
provinces, there is apparent duplication between provincial and 
federal programs, this in 60 per cent of cases. The vague 
division of responsibilities, the incursion of the federal 
government in provincial fields of jurisdiction, as well as the 
federal spending power are the main causes of this duplication 
and overlapping.
<P>
	According to the Bélanger-Campeau Commission on the 
Constitutional Future of Quebec, set up by the Quebec Liberal 
government, the best way to put public finances in order is for 
Quebec to become sovereign. Indeed, the Secretariat of the 
Bélanger-Campeau Commission reached a basic conclusion: 
since Quebec is not recording any significant net gain under the 
current system, we will soon have a negative balance. It now has 
been established that federal transfers to Quebec will continue 
to decrease, relatively speaking, as shown by the announcement 
made by the federal government concerning established 
programs financing.
<P>
	As for the equalization program, its very foundation is 
eroding. The role of the government as the main provider can 
only decrease. The consensus reached by the 
Bélanger-Campeau Commission is also the opinion of all 
Quebec decision makers, including the unions, the professional 
associations as well as the business and financial communities. 
They all agree on one thing: to eliminate the federal 
government's debt, the current political system needs to 
undergo major changes. The Canadian federal system has failed 
us and cannot be reformed, as all Quebecers have proved with 
Charlottetown. And that political situation is at the root of our 
public finance crisis.
<P>
	The dynamics and the gigantic proportions of the Canadian 
civil service are further examples of significant waste and loss 
of energy. In management training, we learn that civil servants 
and other managers often look forward to increase their 
influence by hiring too many people or requesting a bigger 
operating budget than they need. In so doing, they cannot 
properly streamline expenditures. Employees do not always 
have reasons or the desire to confront government machinery.
<P>
<B>(1500) </B>
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois, with the best interests of Quebecers in 
mind, asks that a standing committee on government spending 
be struck right now with members accountable to the people.
<P>
	We believe that the people's representatives should make sure 
that the objectives of the various programs are met and that the 
government is managing the public purse with equity, efficiency 
and care. Besides, the Auditor General brought that up when he 
wrote, and I quote: ``Most of the time Parliament is not provided 
with adequate information on the results that departments and 
Crown corporations have achieved with billions of dollars of 
taxpayers' money''.
<P>
	A parliamentary committee on government spending could 
ensure that Parliament and thus the Canadian people are better 
informed on the government financial situation.
<P>
	That is why we support the Auditor General's proposal to 
require departments, and I quote: ``to submit, through the 
committee on government spending, clear and comprehensive 
reports to Parliament on the exact state of their stewardshipand to provide, when  significant expenditures are incurred, 
information based on results''. The point here is for the
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1267"> 1267 </A></B>
<P>
government to achieve political justification rather than trying 
desperately to stay in power thanks to unjustified grants.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East):</B> Mr. Speaker, with all 
kindness intended before I ask a question I must express to the 
House the tremendous amount of difficulty I have sitting here 
day after day listening to the reference to Quebecers and 
Canadians. Until such time as that situation should change, I 
suggest it might be helpful certainly for me, but I say that I am a 
Canadian from British Columbia, and probably the majority of 
members in this House would refer to themselves in a like 
manner. The exception seems to be with some of my friends to 
my right and I am having some difficulty with that.
<P>
	That having been said I am interested in the position of 
members of the Bloc Quebecois. On one side of the coin they, 
like ourselves, would not support tax increases. On the other 
side of the coin when we talk about targeting there seems to be 
some misunderstanding by Bloc members where they believe 
that the Reform Party is calling for cuts evenly distributed 
across the board.
<P>
	We talk about targeting to make sure that people who require 
the support of social programs will be protected and that the 
funding for those social programs for those who are in the most 
need will be there. That is why we are talking about targeting the 
support of social programs thereby creating decreases in the 
amount going out.
<P>
	I wonder if the member could help us understand. I believe the 
member is talking about eliminating waste in government 
programs. We could shut down all of the federal apparatus, fire 
every single solitary person in the federal civil service, close 
down this institution and indeed stop paying rent on all of the 
buildings. Does the hon. member realize that even in doing that 
we would still have a deficit and still be adding to the problem of 
an increasing amount of debt?
<P>
	If over 50 per cent of the current expenditures by the federal 
government are in the form of transfers to individuals either 
through the provinces or in direct payments in social assistance 
and his party is unwilling to touch that, but cannot possibly 
balance the budget without touching it, how would his party 
propose to balance the budget? I do not understand that kind of 
thinking.
<P>
<B>(1505 ) </B>
<P>
	Yes there is waste and yes waste must be eliminated. I agree 
with the comments of some of the Liberal Party members who 
have said that they too want to cut down on that waste. However, 
that is not where it is going to come from.
<P>
	If the member cannot possibly balance the budget without 
cutting into or directing the payments to individuals under 
social programs, how would he propose we balance the budget?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to 
thank the hon. member for his comment and questions. First of 
all, the hon. member must understand that all members of the 
Bloc Quebecois were elected in a democratic fashion by the 
people of Quebec. It is with a great deal of pride that all my 
colleagues from Quebec come to sit in Ottawa with a culture 
recognized in Quebec through the French language, with 
English-speaking friends who are true Quebecers, and all across 
Canada with people we want as our friends, with their great 
English Canadian culture.
<P>
	So it is with pride that we often refer to Quebec and to the 
mandate we have been given to defend the interests of 
Quebecers because of the $28 billion we contribute to the 
federal coffers.
<P>
	Having said that, I think it is-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I must remind the hon. 
member that the five-minute question and comment period is 
not very long. Could he please keep his comments short so that 
debate can resume with his colleague from Verchères. The hon. 
member for Richmond-Wolfe has the floor.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> Mr. Speaker, in short, our 
goal-and I think, judging from their speeches, that it is a goal 
shared by members from all parties-is to start by looking at 
every expenditure item in every department. It is a very simple 
exercise before starting from scratch to set targets and deciding 
which programs should be maintained. You have recognized that 
there is a lot of waste and the Auditor General recognizes it also.
<P>
	Second, we must look at ways to revive the economy and go 
from budget cuts to investments in order to create jobs and 
kick-start the economy. We are quite willing to take such 
actions as soon as possible after all public accounts have been 
audited.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères):</B> Mr. Speaker, I believe 
I will have an opportunity during my speech to answer some of 
the questions asked by my colleague from Kootenay East. I have 
the feeling that he does not understand very well the point we 
have been trying to make in this House for the past few days. I 
will try to answer his comments and questions.
<P>
	First, I would like to thank my colleague from St. Albert, who 
sits behind me, for putting this motion to the House. I would say 
at the outset that the motion he presented today pursues a very 
laudable objective that we wholly support, and that is putting 
public finances on a sound footing.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1268"> 1268 </A></B>
<P>
	However, I believe the motion is too specific and therefore too 
restrictive. What I mean by that is that the motion presented by 
my colleague from St. Albert focuses on a few 
recommendations, a few items in the last report of the Auditor 
General. But, as we know, the Auditor General does not have the 
resources or the mandate to review all aspects of federal 
government activities.
<P>
	Consequently, the Auditor General selects for review, every 
year, a limited number of government activities. The motion of 
the hon. member for St. Albert does not refer to the previous 
report of the Auditor General, and I will come back to that later, 
even though its recommendations might still not have been 
implemented.
<P>
	The motion of the hon. member for St. Albert does not 
mention either any area of government activity not yet reviewed 
in detail by the Auditor General. What I am trying to say is that 
the points raised by my colleague are rather restrictive, and this 
is why the Bloc Quebecois has some reservations.
<P>
<B>(1510) </B>
<P>
	In our opinion, there are three main categories of causes 
which account for the present financial problems of the federal 
government. First, there are extraneous causes, by that I mean 
the difficult situation we are in, everywhere. That difficult 
situation results in a lowering of tax revenues and an increase in 
social spending for the government. What can we do on that 
front? I believe that we should promote job creation in order to 
revitalize the economy.
<P>
	The second category of causes for the financial problems of 
the federal government are of a more structural nature. We 
mentioned several times in our speeches the very nature of the 
Canadian federal system. The sprinkling of federal money from 
coast to coast in order not to offend sensitivities in the various 
regions is very inefficient and very costly for the federal 
government.
<P>
	There is also the costly and paralysing duplication-in terms 
of money and economic development-we have mentioned 
frequently in this House. It is inherent to the present federal 
system. There is very little we can do in that area until the 
constitutional make-up of the country is amended.
<P>
	There is a third category of causes that I would call functional, 
and they involve the waste and mismanagement of public funds. 
This is what we are talking about at the present time. Now we 
have to clean up the government's finances, and that is what has 
been holding the parliamentarians' attention since the beginning 
of this session.
<P>
	We know there are not many recipes for cleaning up 
government finances. There are basically two recipes, one of 
which is to increase government revenues. But we know that the 
middle class, which is already carrying a very heavy tax burden, 
cannot carry more. So, what we are proposing on this side is to 
target the tax loopholes  that allow our more fortunate fellow 
citizens to avoid making the contribution that they should to 
give their fair share.
<P>
	The other major recipe is to reduce spending. It is that point, I 
think, that our friends from the Reform Party have trouble with 
and are getting bogged down because when we talk about 
reducing spending, we cannot cut everywhere in an anarchic, 
disorganized way. We must be able to target. Target what? The 
waste of money, the expensive duplications, the extravagant and 
superfluous spending. That is where we should be targeting.
<P>
	I now refer to the comments that were made earlier by my 
colleague from Kootenay-East. He was saying: Indeed, that is 
what we are suggesting we cut. But the proposal is to target 
specific areas, and that is what I was saying earlier. What we are 
proposing, as my colleague from Kootenay East was saying, is 
to identify first the tax and budgetary expenditures that should 
perhaps be cut. We have to identify them first. As a means of 
doing that, we propose that a special committee of the House be 
struck, with a mandate to examine all the tax and budgetary 
expenditures of the federal government, item by item.
<P>
	This proposal should not surprise the hon. member for 
Kootenay East since two of his colleagues from the Reform 
Party, namely the hon. member for Calgary North in response to 
a question I put to him on January 21 and the hon. member for 
Lethbridge in response to a question put to him by my colleague 
from Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot on February 1, made it known 
that they would totally agree with the creation of such a 
committee. I think that we have to go ahead with this proposal 
and strike a committee that would examine all the tax and 
budgetary expenditures of the federal government, otherwise we 
may see, in the next budget and in subsequent budgets, the same 
mistakes that caused the problems that Canada is facing right 
now. We must not make the same mistakes. We must target and 
root out all lavish and excessive public spending as well as 
costly duplication and waste.
<P>
<B>(1515) </B>
<P>
	At the beginning of my presentation, I referred to previous 
reports from the Auditor General which raised interesting 
points, although no follow-up action has yet been taken. I note 
the presence in this House of the Secretary of State responsible 
for International Financial Institutions, which brings me to the 
1992 report of the Auditor General. Chapter 12 dealt with 
Canada's participation in the Bretton Woods Institutions and in 
the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
<P>
	Of all countries, Canada has one of the highest per capita 
contribution levels when it comes to funding projects of 
institutions such as the IMF and the World Bank. Canada's 
subscription or quota at the IMF is $4.6 billion, while financial 
commitments in the World Bank Group and the European Bank 
for Reconstruction and  Development are $5.6 billion. One 
troubling fact, as the Auditor General recalled in last year's 
report, is that these sums of money are not subject to any 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1269"> 1269 </A></B>
<P>
controls or cost-effectiveness or impact studies by the House of 
Commons.
<P>
	Lamenting this sad state of affairs, the Auditor General 
recommends that the government undertake a periodic review 
and assessment of the objectives, extent, costs and results of 
Canada's participation in these institutions. To date, no 
follow-up action to speak of has been taken as far as this 
recommendation is concerned. And this is what we are talking 
about.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois is determined to see to it that the 
relevance, efficiency and effectiveness of all federal 
government spending is evaluated. It is imperative that such an 
evaluation be conducted in all areas identified by the Auditor 
General and for all government spending items.
<P>
	Of course, Canada must continue to make substantial 
contributions to international financial institutions. The Bloc 
Quebecois has no quarrel with this. However, Canada's 
international development assistance objectives need to be 
clearly stated.
<P>
	The sizeable amounts of money that Canada contributes to 
international development assistance should also be closely 
evaluated to ensure that the contribution process is as 
cost-effective as possible. This is the thrust of the 
recommendation that we have been making for several weeks 
and months now, namely that a committee be struck. A response 
on the part of the government is urgently needed.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
thank the member for his speech.
<P>
	One thing that I was rather puzzled about was when he started 
off by saying in his speech that the way in which we had written 
the motion was far too restrictive and then he finished up his 
speech by saying that we should focus on one particular area. It 
seems rather a conundrum to me.
<P>
	In the last few weeks we have been listening to what is 
becoming a bit of a broken record. The Bloc Quebecois seems to 
say that there is a panacea in the duplication of federal and 
provincial spending. I heard one member talking about Gaspé 
where he thought if we eliminated federal and provincial 
duplication there would be more fish in the Gulf of the St. 
Lawrence.
<P>
	I heard another member suggest that if we eliminated the 
duplication there would be sufficient money available for the 
job creation program. Another member said that if we 
eliminated the duplication there would be sufficient money to 
create all kinds of positions for day care.
<P>
	They are now still on about the same situation they talked 
about yesterday that if we happen to create another committee 
this will be the panacea that will solve all of the problems that 
we have and things will go on from here and everything will be 
bright and beautiful.
<P>
	My question to the member, which is basically a repeat of the 
question by the member from Kootenay, is how does the Bloc 
Quebecois believe that the answer lies in duplication of 
federal-provincial spending? Spending by the federal 
government happens in the province of Quebec, British 
Columbia and in my home province of Alberta.
<P>
<B>(1520 ) </B>
<P>
	How does it think that this panacea of elimination of 
duplication is going to provide all kinds of money to solve all 
the problems when it is just using that as an agenda to try and 
build some kind of defence or justification for its own political 
platform which has no basis whatsoever?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bergeron:</B> Mr. Speaker, I hope that you will give me time 
to answer this long question.
<P>
	First, I think that, like his colleague from Kootenay East, the 
hon. member for St. Albert did not catch the drift of what I said. 
I focused on international financial institutions just to show how 
pointless it was to make the motion as specific, as restrictive as 
they did, because the Auditor General included in his report last 
year measures relating to international financial institutions that 
have had practically no effect thus far. This is to say that 
focusing on certain areas of the very partial report of the Auditor 
General is not conducive to a global solution.
<P>
	The other point my hon. colleague made was: how do we, of 
the Bloc, think that our marvellous committee is going to solve 
all the problems of this country? It is no panacea. In itself, 
creating a committee does not solve the problems, but this 
committee would identify the areas were costly duplication 
exists, not only costly duplication but also squandering and 
extravagant expenditures. After having identified all this, we 
would be able to take action on the various unnecessary, 
superfluous expenditures.
<P>
	The last question my colleague asked me was: why insist so 
much on eliminating duplication? Are there reasons to believe 
that everything will work out for the best in our beautiful 
Canada just because duplication will have been eliminated? Of 
course not, but the fact remains that-based on figures from 
serious sources, not the Bloc Quebecois but a serious economist 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1270"> 1270 </A></B>
<P>
like Mr. Fortin, as well as the Bélanger-Campeau 
Commission-duplication between Quebec and Canada alone 
costs from $2 to $3 billion a year. Perhaps savings could be 
made in that area by cutting unnecessary government 
expenditures, would you not say?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions)):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have the 
opportunity to participate in this debate. Today I will be 
addressing a technical issue relating to the income tax law which 
was mentioned by one of the earlier speakers.
<P>
	This government is committed to the efficient and effective 
use of public funds. Our commitment extends to the timely 
clarification of the income tax law in situations in which the 
wording of a provision may not have given effect to the 
government's intent, thereby resulting in some revenue 
exposure.
<P>
	Such a situation was recently described by the Auditor 
General with respect to tax allowances provided to resource 
companies. In order to appreciate the concerns expressed by the 
Auditor General's report it is important to understand a certain 
amount of background information. I would commend you, Mr. 
Speaker, on your ability to hold your joyous response to the 
Minister of Industry's speech. This one will require even more 
indulgence on your part.
<P>
	For this reason I would like to take a moment to set out a few 
of the relevant facts. In 1974 the government of the day stopped 
resource companies from deducting provincial crown royalties. 
Instead, alternative tax relief was provided for such companies 
depending on the amount of their resource profits.
<P>
	Since 1976 this alternative tax relief has been in the form of a 
resource allowance. Resource allowances are not a tax 
preference. They were introduced in order to compensate 
companies for the non-deductibility of provincial resource 
royalties. The resource allowance provision permits a deduction 
equal to 25 per cent of resource profits.
<P>
	In 1979-80 Revenue Canada reassessed a resource 
corporation after it took the position that it was not required to 
deduct certain scientific research expenditures and capital cost 
allowances in computing its resource profits. The company's 
approach increased the amount of profits eligible for tax relief.
<P>
	The resource corporation challenged the reassessment in the 
courts. Litigation proceeded and finally culminated in July 1992 
when the Supreme Court of Canada denied the government leave 
to appeal a decision by the Federal Court of Appeal which had 
ruled in favour of the corporation.
<P>
<B>(1525 ) </B>
<P>
	That is the background of the Auditor General's comments 
regarding resource allowances.
<P>
	In his report, the Auditor General expressed the view that the 
Department of Finance should have acted more quickly to 
clarify the policy intent of the resource allowance provisions. 
The government did not act while the issue was before the courts 
because it was advised that doing so would have prejudiced the 
ongoing litigation.
<P>
	Moreover, until the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal on 
this matter in January, 1992, most of the resource industry had 
been filing its income tax returns in a manner consistent with the 
government's view of the law's intent.
<P>
	In the same month of the Supreme Court of Canada ruling, the 
previous government issued a press release clarifying the policy 
intent of the resource allowance provisions. This press release 
included draft regulations which were effective immediately. 
The draft regulations of July, 1992 are currently being reviewed 
and finalized as expeditiously as possible. They will be included 
with regulations under Bill C-92 dealing with the abuse of the 
resource allowance through the use of partnerships. Bill C-92 
was passed in June, 1993.
<P>
	The period for reviewing, finalizing and processing these 
draft regulations is not excessive. It permits concerns regarding 
the text of the draft regulations to be fully considered before 
their enactment.
<P>
	The amendments in question deal with a complex area of tax 
law. The law is complex because it deals with corporations 
which carry on many different types of business activities in the 
resource sector. Over the years it has been subject to many 
changes which addressed court decisions and closed various 
loopholes.
<P>
	Following a review by the Department of Finance, the 
Department of Justice and Revenue Canada, the draft 
regulations will be sent to the appropriate cabinet committee for 
approval as quickly as possible.
<P>
	Regardless of the time of their enactment, the amendments in 
the draft regulations relating to the calculation of resource 
profits will be effective from July, 1992.
<P>
	With that very long preamble, I would also like to note that the 
revenue exposure estimates contained in the Auditor General's 
report require some clarification. The report estimates the 
amount of revenue lost, and the hon. member before mentioned 
it as well, at about $1.2 billion. However, nearly one-half of that 
amount relates to issues that were not covered in the court case.
<P>
	Of the remainder at least 50 per cent represents interest on 
funds, and the government had use of those funds.
<P>
	In conclusion, I would like to stress once again this 
government's commitment to timely introduction of income tax
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1271"> 1271 </A></B>
<P>
legislation and regulations. At the same time,  it is vital that the 
quality, effectiveness and fairness of such legislation or 
regulations not be compromised.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order. I would seek to 
indicate to the Chair that it was our intention that the time of the 
hon. minister who has just spoken be shared with the member for 
Scarborough West.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Godfrey (Don Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, poverty 
alleviation, protecting human rights, building democracy and 
ensuring environmental stability are the challenges facing the 
Canadian International Development Agency.
<P>
	The Auditor General states that few Canadian organizations, 
private or public, attempt the complex and high risk taking tasks 
that CIDA undertakes. Our aid effort ensures that Canadian 
values help to shape the world of the 21st century, a world we 
hope will be peaceful and prosperous, fair and free.
<P>
	Canada's aid program helps define Canada's place in the 
world. It is beneficial in a number of ways. For example, a good 
part of the aid budget is directed to fulfilling basic human needs. 
It supports the humanitarian concerns of Canadians. It supports 
the respect of human rights, gender equality and popular 
participation, all values important to Canadians. It helps 
developing countries achieve environmental sustainability. 
What kind of work does our aid budget actually support?
<P>
<B>(1530) </B>
<P>
	In West Africa CIDA has been helping the people of Senegal 
fight against the spreading desert by planting trees. The Panaftel 
project, one of Canada's major initiatives in Africa, gives 
several countries a good basic communication link.
<P>
	In Zimbabwe the University of Ottawa's human rights centre 
and Zimbabwe's legal resources foundation, a 
non-governmental organization, are bringing legal services and 
rights to the rural poor.
<P>
	Part of the program has involved the training of paralegal 
workers who operate in different parts of the country, educating 
people about their legal rights and helping them deal with 
problems that range from finding missing relatives to damage 
claims after bus accidents, a big concern in Zimbabwe.
<P>
	In Honduras there is a problem of rapid destruction of the 
hardwood forests which stretch along the Caribbean coast. Each 
year over 2 per cent is cut and burned for shifting agriculture.
<P>
	CIDA's hardwood forest project is addressing the problem on 
two fronts, improving forest management and sustainable land 
use in buffer zones next to the forest. The project is expected to 
reduce deforestation and reduce the pressure to convert forests 
to farms.
<P>
	A rural development project in northern Pakistan supported 
by the Aga Khan Foundation and CIDA is widely regarded as 
one of the world's best.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The Auditor General recognizes in his chapter on CIDA that 
most Canadians support international aid efforts, but they want 
assurance that their taxes are really being used to develop the 
potential of the poor and of the developing world in general.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The Auditor General and CIDA have agreed to a follow-up on 
the action taken by CIDA to implement the recommendations of 
the 1993 chapter. The Auditor General will be reporting on 
CIDA's progress in implementing changes at all levels of 
management in his 1995 report to Parliament.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We believe that a sustained partnership with 
non-governmental organizations and business people doing 
outstanding work abroad can strengthen this support from 
taxpayers for the Canadian aid program.
<P>
	International development is very important, considering the 
present world situation. It promotes global security, respect for 
human rights and democracy.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We need to work together to deal with the problems of our 
planet and the aid budget is a contribution Canada makes as a 
good citizen of the world community.
<P>
	The aid program brings significant benefits to Canada. The 
aid program sustains over 40,000 jobs in this country with 2,000 
businesses, 45 universities, 80 colleges and dozens of provincial 
departments and agencies benefiting from aid-related contracts.
<P>
	Canada's food aid represents the output of some 3,000 
Canadian farms.
<P>
	Canada's aid program alone cannot change the world. It has 
made a difference. CIDA has a reputation in the field for 
integrity and co-operation.
<P>
	The Auditor General said many things about CIDA but he did 
not say that aid is a poor investment for Canada. He did not say 
that aid is wasted.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	As the Auditor General mentioned in his report, CIDA is 
recognized throughout the world for its integrity and 
co-operation. Nevertheless, we are aware that improvements 
must be made and CIDA is committed to renewing its 
management.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	CIDA has committed itself to management renewal and to 
demonstrating results for investments. CIDA has launched a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1272"> 1272 </A></B>
<P>
process to streamline and modernize its management practices. 
Some early steps such as simplifying its organizational structure 
and improving management systems are already completed. 
Others are under way.
<P>
	We have a lot of resources, technical expertise, and 
experience gained in our own development. Our role in 
development has won Canada a lot of good will and credibility 
virtually everywhere in the developing world.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Sometimes, the images the media give us lead us to believe 
that the history of developing countries is just one of failure and 
despair. The figures tell another story. Despite the problems, we 
must admit that international aid has helped improve the 
situation in developing countries.
<P>
<B>(1535 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	My government is proud of the success achieved in 
international development.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Within a generation, the average real income in developing 
countries has more than doubled. Infant mortality rates have 
been halved since 1960.
<P>
	The adult literacy rate has risen 20 per cent in recent years.
<P>
	Over 70 per cent of the people in developing countries have 
access to health services.
<P>
	Smallpox has been eliminated, at a cost of $250 million. This 
involves a saving of $1 billion a year on vaccine and treatment, 
in addition to the relief of the suffering formerly associated with 
the disease.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	CIDA's program in South Africa continues to play a 
constructive role in the transition toward political pluralism.
<P>
	Let me say, Mr. Speaker, that just this week there was a letter 
published in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> that discusses the positive side 
to CIDA which press reports often do not cover. The letter 
states: ``On a visit to El Salvador I witnessed some absolutely 
incredible success stories such as an industrial co-operation 
made possible through CIDA. I was never so proud to be a 
Canadian''.
<P>
	With respect to more business-like and accountable modes of 
operation CIDA like other government departments is 
responding to public demands to demonstrate better 
accountability. Clearly this will require the support of our 
government and the support of development partners in Canada 
and overseas.
<P>
	However, let me assure you, Mr. Speaker, that CIDA through 
its annual report to Parliament and its appearance before the 
public accounts committee in the House of Commons makes 
every effort to ensure that parliamentarians are properly 
informed. There is already an evaluation and audit process in 
place at CIDA as well as a comprehensive consultation process 
between CIDA and its partners.
<P>
	The Auditor General did say that CIDA, like all other 
organizations, must adapt to new conditions. It needs to do 
better with less. CIDA must be more systematic in measuring 
the impact of development programs. CIDA's partners including 
multilateral organizations, other governments, Canadian 
companies and non-governmental organizations must 
participate in this change. CIDA needs to be more transparent to 
Parliament and the public. CIDA agrees with the thrust of the 
recommendations aimed at improving the agency's 
accountability and strengthening its management effectiveness.
<P>
	By addressing issues at the level of program management 
CIDA will achieve a more results oriented and business-like 
style of management and will also address project management 
concerns.
<P>
	Clearly there can be no question of the importance of the aid 
programs to the developing world and to Canadians. The 
government is committed to renewal in the public service, 
improved effectiveness, openness and transparency. This 
applies to CIDA as well as other departments. There is no doubt 
that CIDA will meet this challenge.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, it is also important to note that the foreign policy 
review will answer some of the questions raised in the Auditor 
General's report.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This foreign policy review involving a broad consultation 
with Canadians and partners is the process the government has 
chosen to help us define our priorities in foreign policy. Once 
the review has been completed the government will establish its 
new priorities, thus tackling what the Auditor General describes 
as making CIDA's task so difficult, that of trying to meet so 
many contradictory priorities.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philippe Paré (Louis-Hébert):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was 
happy to hear the previous speaker defend CIDA programs. I 
think that, despite what Canada is already doing, we should not 
make cuts in that sector. There may be a need for reorganization, 
but Canada is not one of the most generous countries. I simply 
want to remind the House that Canada only spends four tenths of 
1 per cent of GDP on aid, compared with 1.10 or 1.16 per cent in 
Sweden. There may be a need for reorganization, but we should 
be extremely careful on this issue.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1273"> 1273 </A></B>
<P>
	I think that when we address this issue, we should also look at 
our options regarding CIDA. I sometimes feel that we may be 
investing too much in international trade and not enough in 
people's development.
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
	I think that the main objective of CIDA development 
assistance should always be to help developing countries and 
populations take hold of their own chart destiny and put out their 
own development. So much the better if Canada can benefit in a 
number of ways. I often think that we insist too much on linking 
development projects to the requirement for assisted countries 
to trade with Canada. I think that, in doing this, we may be a 
little greedy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Godfrey (Don Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the hon. member for Louis-Hébert for his comments. I fully 
agree that, at the present time, Canada's objective is 0.7 per 
cent, but it is very difficult with the upcoming budget later this 
month.
<P>
	As regards government priorities, indeed we have to make 
choices. I think that when we review our foreign policy we will 
have to ask ourselves: What worked in the past? Where were we 
successful and where did we fail?
<P>
	We must also acknowledge the fact that we are part of an 
international setting. In my opinion, we will always have two 
objectives: the centrality of the individual's development, as 
well as the basic needs which underlie any development. 
However, we must remember that developing countries need 
high technology just like us.
<P>
	I think we can do two things at the same time: Improve the 
plight of the poorest in the world and try to make them benefit 
from our technological advances.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fred Mifflin (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we have the perspective of the comment made by my 
colleague from Louis-Hébert and that of my colleague from 
Don Valley West.
<P>
	I speak from a national defence perspective. We have to 
recognize more clearly today that national security means more 
than the traditional sense of defence of a physical perimeter. It 
means a lot of things. Among those things it means 
co-operation. The concept of security today, particularly in the 
post cold war period, goes far beyond the question of what was 
traditionally known as the military balance.
<P>
	It is about politics, it is about economics and it is about human 
rights and the environment. Those thoughts are sometimes slow 
to be inflicted on the thoughts of National Defence. I am no 
avant-garde but I think it is important that we think of CIDA in 
that perspective.
<P>
	It is clear that the individual welfare of ordinary Canadians is 
now affected by global factors, particularly since we are very 
much a trading nation made up of multinational facets from 
other countries and that the individual Canadian is affected by 
global factors that are far beyond any single nation.
<P>
	Our contribution to CIDA, while it may not look particularly 
helpful to any individual in an election, in the overall 
perspective of national security and the well-being of Canada 
could be a very significant and effective tool. Could the member 
comment on that?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Godfrey:</B> Mr. Speaker, the point is well made that 
security is being redefined as we speak after the cold war. It is 
also being redefined in the countries we are trying to help. I 
remember in my own time during the Ethiopian famine when the 
geopolitical concerns of Somalia versus Ethiopia and their 
protectors, the superpowers, was of overriding consideration.
<P>
	Now we face a world in which we potentially have a peace 
dividend in this country, but there is also potentially a peace 
dividend in the developing countries. We are in a position where 
we can force a greater degree of conditionality by saying that if 
the priorities in such and such a country are to rearm rather than 
to help the poorest of the poor we may share those priorities with 
them and not give them a hand.
<P>
	Therefore we have the foreign policy debate, the security 
debate and the environmental debate. All these debates come 
together in a most complex pattern and it is an ideal time to be 
reviewing our foreign and development policies.
<P>
<B>(1545 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is an honour to participate in the debate on the motion 
put forward by my party. Hopefully it will bring the unresolved 
issues of the Auditor General's report to light.
<P>
	I would like to start by quoting from the report: ``Today it is 
clear to both public servants and parliamentarians that 
Canadians expect them to demonstrate sound and prudent 
management rather than finding new ways to spend borrowed 
money''. I believe the Auditor General is saying that Canadian 
taxpayers are demanding greater accountability.
<P>
	It seems odd that eight corporations are exempt from the 
Auditor General's scrutiny. Under section 85(1) of the Financial 
Administration Act, the Bank of Canada, the Canada Council, 
the Canadian Film Development Corporation, the Canadian 
Institute for International Peace and Security, the Canadian 
Wheat Board, the International Development Research Centre 
and the National Arts Centre have been exempted from the 
sections of the Financial Administration Act that provide for 
good management and accountability. The CBC is also exempt 
although it has since incorporated provisions of the Financial 
Administration Act in its own legislation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1274"> 1274 </A></B>
<P>
	The Auditor General has raised this issue several times over 
the past five years and it still remains unresolved.
<P>
	Let us examine why these corporations are exempt from the 
Financial Administration Act. Apparently they need to be at 
arm's length from government. Then we must pose the question, 
who is the government? The easy answer is, they are the 
members opposite in the House. If you go deeper than that, the 
answer is the people of this country. It is saying these eight 
crown corporations have to be an arm's length from the people 
of Canada, the people who pay the bills for these corporations.
<P>
	What does it all mean? According to the Auditor General their 
exempt status means there are not explicit requirements for 
these corporations to table corporate plan summaries in 
Parliament to inform Parliament of their objectives. They are 
not required to fulfill certain management responsibilities. They 
are not required to give assurances that the assets of these crown 
corporations are safeguarded. They are not required to 
undertake an internal audit or even establish audit committees 
on their own board of directors. There are no explicit 
requirements for them to be subject to an explicit legislative 
requirement to undergo special examinations of value for money 
audits by the Auditor General, which are an important part of the 
annual audit and accountability provisions of the Financial 
Administration Act.
<P>
	This is not to say these crown corporations are not fulfilling 
these requirements. Rather the problem is they are not required 
to submit to this process of accountability as all other crown 
corporations are required.
<P>
	I commend some of these crown corporations which have 
undergone value for money audits. Even if they do undergo these 
audits they do not have to make them public. They are at arm's 
length. They do not have to be accountable to the people of 
Canada. The Auditor General, millions of Canadians and I are 
concerned that this lack of mandatory accountability leads to 
three specific problems.
<P>
	First, Parliament may not not have sufficient information to 
fill its role in scrutinizing and authorizing the use of public 
funds.
<P>
	Second, the crown corporation's management has the 
responsibility for economic, effective and efficient use of 
resources but this is not clearly defined.
<P>
	Third, these corporations are not subject to an audit regime 
that is sufficiently broad to address all issues of concern to the 
members of the House.
<P>
	What is most important about the Auditor General's 
comments is that we as parliamentarians are not able to gain 
enough information about how the taxpayers' money is being 
used by these exempt corporations. It affects our abilities to 
make good and responsible decisions. This is especially 
important since Parliament appropriates hundreds of millions of 
dollars each year for these corporations.
<P>
<B>(1550 ) </B>
<P>
	I would like to give this House one specific example that I 
think captures the need for these crown corporations to be more 
accountable.
<P>
	Late last month the Auditor General undertook a special 
examination of the National Arts Centre Corporation and found 
that serious deficiencies exist in the way the National Arts 
Centre Corporation handles its finances. The NAC operates on a 
budget of $40 million a year and has a staff of about 300. Since 
the NAC is exempt from special examination by the Auditor 
General it was a very tedious and long process for Canadian 
taxpayers to discover how their money was being spent.
<P>
	Let us look at the process. It dates back to 1990 when the 
standing committee of this House on communications and 
culture recommended that the Auditor General do an 
examination of the NAC. Its board members had to approve that 
request and they did. The Auditor General then started his 
investigation which covered the period between September 
1991 and March 1992.
<P>
	The report was not presented to the NAC board until May of 
1993 partly because of a dispute between the Auditor General 
and the NAC over the public release of this information. Finally 
in January 1994, almost four years after the initial 
recommendation was made, the report was made public.
<P>
	In its response to the Auditor General's report the NAC board 
recognized that improvements were needed in its financial 
management. Quoted in the <I>Ottawa Citizen</I>, the National Arts 
Centre Corporation also made what I consider to be a very 
revealing comment: ``Given the limited resources which the 
centre's management had at its disposal, tackling the 
institutional mentality rooted in two decades of lack of 
accountability has been a monumental task''.
<P>
	This raises two questions. For how long have Canadian 
taxpayers' dollars been spent inefficiently while the National 
Arts Centre Corporation developed an institutional mentality 
rooted in the lack of accountability? Why did it take almost four 
years for the Auditor General's report to reveal this situation to 
the Canadian public?
<P>
	As the Auditor General has stated and as the House committee 
on communications and culture stated in 1991, these exempt 
crown corporations must be moved into part X of the Financial 
Administration Act so that the Auditor General can undertake 
special investigations of these corporations. The Minister of 
Finance said this week that he does not agree with these 
recommendations. However, I think the NAC example shows 
the necessity for these changes.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="1275"> 1275 </A></B>
<P>
	Canadian taxpayers are now demanding that governments 
spend their tax dollars efficiently and effectively. I do not 
believe that we or the Canadian taxpayers have the luxury of 
exempting crown corporations from these special examinations. 
Everyone must be held to a standard of financial accountability.
<P>
	The cynicism people have about government can be partly 
attributed to the waste and mismanagement that can be found in 
government. We should take every step possible to address this 
issue and promote the effective use of tax dollars.
<P>
	I urge all members of this House to support this motion. I urge 
the government to introduce legislation to act upon these 
recommendations of the Auditor General and to make these 
crown corporations more accountable for their financial 
practices by moving them into part X of the Financial 
Administration Act.
<P>
	Members of this House not only campaigned on 
accountability, but each and every day we all use those words. 
We must be accountable. If we are going to talk the talk, we must 
walk the walk. This is an opportunity to show the Canadian 
public that this government will be truly different from previous 
governments.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Beryl Gaffney (Nepean):</B> Mr. Speaker, I compliment 
the member from Okanagan on his speech. My ears picked up 
when I heard him talk about the National Arts Centre. I am not 
going to disagree with what the member had to say. In fact, I 
agree there has been a siege mentality at the National Arts 
Centre that must be overcome.
<P>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
	However, I think that one of the main stumbling blocks is 
gone. The director general of the National Arts Centre was 
released from his position just a few weeks ago by the board of 
the National Arts Centre. I think the number one siege mentality 
was there.
<P>
	I think we have to go one step further. I believe that the 
National Arts Centre must be responsible to this Parliament. 
Presently it is responsible to Treasury Board. The chairman of 
the board was appointed by an Order in Council and he was 
reappointed for another five-year term just prior to the previous 
government leaving office. I think that has to be corrected 
before we can get an active input into how the National Arts 
Centre is maintained.
<P>
	The National Arts Centre is a Canadian institution. It is the 
arts centre of all Canadians and it is something that we should all 
be proud of. I cannot remember the dollar figure but a few 
dollars from every Canadian went to build that project and it is 
something that we should all be proud of. It is not Ottawa's. It is 
not ours just because we live in the nation's capital.
<P>
	We have to move beyond what has been happening there and 
look forward to the future and develop our arts and develop our 
orchestra so that we can all be proud of it right across this 
country.
<P>
	I am agreeing with the member. I am not disagreeing. I want 
us to move forward and make the centre responsible to this 
Parliament so that he and I as parliamentarians can have some 
input and some say into how it is being operated.
<P>
	I do not have a question. I am just agreeing with the hon. 
member for Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Well it is Friday and in 
that spirit of agreement, would the hon. member for 
Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt wish to comment?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hart:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the hon. member 
for her comments. Each and every day that I sit in this 
Parliament as something new in my career, I find it very 
enjoyable that we can find common ground among many of the 
players in this House. I would like to thank the member for her 
comment. The Canadian people do require accountability and I 
think it is incumbent upon us to supply it for them.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I certainly did not want us to run out of speakers 
towards at the end, and since I saw no one else who wished to 
speak, I thought I would take this opportunity to put to my 
colleague some questions about the motion before us today.
<P>
	We talked about a lot of things, I mean all kinds of things, but 
it doest not change the fact that we have before us a motion of 
about 1,000 words that just calls on the government, and I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>- to demonstrate its commitment to accountability and to the efficient and 
effective use of public funds by reporting to the House, no later than the first 
week of June each year, what measures have been taken-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	to review the deficiencies in various departments.
<P>
	Does our colleague know that, according to current 
parliamentary procedure, we do have a framework within which 
we are able to undertake every year a complete review of the 
budget estimates of every department, particularly as, pursuant 
to Standing Order 108(2), any parliamentary committee can 
undertake a detailed study on any matter, without asking 
anyone's permission, as long as the committee does not travel 
outside the national capital region?
<P>
	Third, if expenditures are incurred, the public accounts 
committee is enpowered to examine all previous expenditures, 
including the report of the Auditor General.
<P>
	I did not want to miss this opportunity to raise the following 
question: Are the members opposite trying to do what the 
members from the Bloc did yesterday, that is, create even more 
duplication and overlap, contrary to what they are supposedly 
advocating?
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="1276"> 1276 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hart:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member. I do not 
believe we are trying to mirror the image of the Bloc 
whatsoever. We are suggesting that there has to be more 
accountability, more improving upon the system that we already 
have in place, making it better.
<P>
	I am not suggesting at all and I do not think any members of 
the Reform Party are at all suggesting that we should create 
another department. As a matter of fact, we would be totally 
opposed to such an argument. I do feel that the illustration that I 
presented in this House this afternoon is an example that, yes, 
while our committees can suggest special investigations and 
special audits and do this, the length of time is totally 
unsatisfactory to me, many other members of this House, and to 
the Canadian people.
<P>
	If their money is being spent and if there is an indication that 
there could be something wrong, the Canadian taxpayer has the 
right to know, as does this House, as soon as possible. Four years 
is unacceptable.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> In the final 60 seconds 
remaining before we adjourn I will recognize the member for St. 
Albert, being the mover of this motion on behalf of his party, if 
he would like to make one final comment in this last minute 
before we adjourn.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert):</B> Mr. Speaker, you caught me 
unaware but certainly I have enjoyed the tone of this House 
today. We have been constructive in our debates. We have 
recognized that the Auditor General has a real role to play as our 
servant to ensure that the taxpayers' money is spent wisely and 
well.
<P>
	As I mentioned earlier this morning, this is only the third time 
since the position of Auditor General was created in 1878, I 
think it was, that we have debated his report in this House. I gave 
notice that we will be back debating this again and I would hope 
that we can enter into some kind of arrangement with the 
government to ensure that this becomes an annual debate.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> It being 4 p.m. it is my 
duty to inform the House that pursuant to Standing Order 81(17) 
proceedings on the motion have expired.
<P>
	This House stands adjourned until Monday next at 11 a.m., 
pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 4 p.m.)
