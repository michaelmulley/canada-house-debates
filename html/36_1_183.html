</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Sue Barnes (London West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, on 
Monday decades of dreams became a reality for the people of 
Nunavut when they held elections for the first government of 
Canada's newest territory. In this historic vote, they elected 19 
MLAs who will govern this territory being created from the 
eastern part of Canada's Northwest Territories.  This starts on 
April 1. Throughout Nunavut people gathered to watch the election 
results as the polls closed in each of the three distinct time 
zones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new legislative assembly is the achievement of Inuit and 
non-Inuit people working together.  It will help Inuit become 
full partners within Confederation and to take charge of their 
own destiny.  This government, which is representative of the 
northern population as a whole, will be accountable to the people 
of Nunavut. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of Canadians, especially those in London West, my 
constituency in southern Canada, I extend congratulations to the 
newly elected MLAs, to those who stood as worthy candidates in 
the election and to the people of Nunavut. Well done.  Welcome.

Speaker, there will be a big party this weekend.  Some Tories 
from Ontario will be there and the leader of the Tory party, the

in the right direction on medicare. 
<P><A NAME="LINK44"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
can tell you that the Premier of Ontario does not favour seeing 
$5 billion a year leave Canada and go to the United States for 
health care every year.  That is what is happening under this 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They cannot get health care because this Prime Minister is the 
prime minister who put the hell into health care.  This Prime 
Minister is the prime minister who cut $20 billion out of health 
care and is proposing to put half of it back and expects people 
to be grateful.  Thank you very little. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is that the record the Prime Minister is proud of? 
<P><A NAME="LINK45"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I think the people of Canada are very happy that we have 
the finances of the nation in good shape.  They are very happy 
that after we have managed to reduce the deficit from $42 billion 
to zero, the first big investment we made responded to the wishes 
of Canadians.  We have invested $2 billion for each of the next 
two years into the health care.  They are quite happy with that.

feared, unemployed workers, who have had their benefits slashed 
and are being harassed in employment centres, are footing the 
bill for the measures announced yesterday by the Minister of 
Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the minister be proud of this budget when he knows full 
well that the government's gains come at the expense of 
unemployed workers? 
<P><A NAME="LINK47"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, since 1986 the Auditor General 
of Canada has asked us to include the EI account in the 
government's consolidated revenue fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During all the years this fund was in the red, did the members 
opposite criticize Canadians for contributing to it? Now, there 
is a surplus.  I know surpluses are something the members 
opposite cannot understand, cannot even imagine.

this fund, which is serving them very well.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> The Minister of

who has an unfortunate habit of dipping into the pockets of 
unemployed workers.  It is a disgrace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday, as I left my office, which is not far from the 
Minister of Finance's office on the 5th floor of the Centre 
Block, friends of the Minister of Finance were partying and 
toasting his budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the minister aware that, while he and his friends were 
celebrating, unemployed workers were facing the prospect of

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Minister of Finance decided to unilaterally change the rules for 
distributing the Canada social transfer, so that Quebec will 
receive less than 10% of the health care money given to the 
provinces, while Ontario will get 46%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since, in the name of equity, the health care transfer to Quebec 
will now correspond to its demographic weight, will the Minister 
of Finance promise to use the same criteria for purchases of 
goods and services and for regional development, where Quebec 
faces an annual shortfall of nearly $3 billion a year. 
<P><A NAME="LINK51"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, when 
we look at transfers to the provinces, we look first at the 
Canadian transfer for health care and equalization payments.

<P><A NAME="LINK52"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Minister of Finance should say it is thanks to the unemployed 
and Bernard Landry that he does not just have no deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> It is true.  It is true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> Instead of trying to knock everyone flat with

in the end— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> Order, please.  We will hear the question from the 
member for Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> Mr. Speaker, instead of trying to knock 
everyone flat with his empty figures, will the Minister of 
Finance acknowledge that in the end the effect of his budget 
yesterday is $33 billion in cumulative cuts to social and health 
programs and that the amounts announced represent only a 
fraction, a small fraction, of the cuts established in his 1995 
budget? 
<P><A NAME="LINK53"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
empty figures?  One point four billion in the next four weeks 
represents empty figures?  Six billion dollars of new money over 
five years represents empty figures?  That counts for nothing? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The math of the Bloc Quebecois is clear now.  They understand 
nothing at all.  This is money that will go to create jobs. 
This is money that will improve health.  This is money that will

Quebecois, but Canada works.

$40,000 a year got $115, barely enough to buy his bus passes, and 
Marika who is homeless got absolutely nothing.

they deserve so little.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, Canadians 
wanted a fair budget.  They were disappointed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Florence Sallenav of Montreal expresses this disappointment 
well, and I quote: “Had the minister lowered the GST, it would 
have been much more to the point, and everyone, without 
exception, would have benefited”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance preferred to help the rich.  Why did he

<P><A NAME="LINK57"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
like the idea of quoting Canadians.  I might quote the B.C. 
minister of health, Penny Priddy, who said “I would give the 
Minister of Finance a seven, perhaps higher, for the budget”. 
For her part, B.C. finance minister Joy MacPhail said “It is a 
good budget”. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is welcome news for us.  We can now join together and 
address the problems of the health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only question is:  Why does the NDP in Saskatchewan and the 
NDP in British Columbia understand what a good budget it is but 
the NDP here does not. 
<P><A NAME="LINK58"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, last 
year Canadians paid the highest taxes in the G-7.  Do you know 
what?  After this year's budget they will still pay the highest 
taxes in the G-7.  Canadians have a negative— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Order, please.  The hon. member for 
Kings—Hants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the truth hurts, 
obviously.  Members opposite know that Canadians will continue to 
pay the highest tax in the G-7 because their government continues 
to refuse to provide the type of meaningful tax relief that 
Canadians need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians need this tax relief now, not tomorrow.  Due to high 
payroll taxes and bracket creep Canadians will actually pay more 
after this budget than they did before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the minister practising give and take economics: giving 
Canadians some tax breaks through the front door but taking them 
due to bracket creep through the back door? 
<P><A NAME="LINK59"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, bracket creep arises out of the lack of indexation, 
which arises out of measures introduced by the Tory government 
some time ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things I would like to point out to the hon. member 
is that as a result of the reductions in taxes in yesterday's 
budget in fact bracket creep will be more than covered for all 
Canadians for the next three years. 
<P><A NAME="LINK60"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
glad the minister mentioned the origins of deindexing tax 
brackets.  That was a deficit reduction measure similar to the 
GST, similar to free trade.  The minister is not backing away 
from those— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Order, please.  The hon. member for

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  Now that the minister is saying he has 
eliminated the 3% surtax, another deficit reduction measure, why 
does he not reindex tax brackets now to ensure that Canadians can 
actually get a tax break when he forgets to give one? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that this minister has used the GST, has used free 
trade and has used the 3% surtax to do what they were intended to 
do, to pay down the deficit, but the deficit is paid off.  Now 
will the minister give Canadians the real tax— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Order, please.  Colleagues, I appeal to your 
sense of fairness.  We must be able to hear the questions and I 
am hopeful we can hear the answers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to single out any members of parliament, but 
surely we deserve to be able to hear the questions and the 
answers.  I ask you again, please let the members have a chance 
to ask their questions and give their answers. 
<P><A NAME="LINK61"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the only way we could be fair is if we did not hear the 
questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I understand it, the deindexation was introduced as an 
anti-deficit matter.  The deficit at that time was $24 billion. 
After they introduced it, it went to $42 billion.  God knows if 
they had introduced others what would happen. 
<P><A NAME="LINK62"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, when 
Liberals cut health care by billions of dollars they did it by 
saying “we had an emergency, the deficit”.  They chose to take 
a money emergency and turn it into a medical emergency.  The 
result is the Manitoba farmer who just had to go to the Mayo 
Clinic because he could not find a surgeon in his province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the Prime Minister prepared to guarantee, now that he has 
done this fabulous business of putting money back into medicare, 
that farmer will not have to go to the U.S. any more? 
<P><A NAME="LINK63"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Elinor Caplan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the $3.5 billion that was 
announced in yesterday's budget is available to the provinces 
immediately to help them resolve the issues as they wish within 
their provinces.  We want to ensure that people have access to 
the care and services they need when they need them and where 
they need them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The increase in the base of the CHST to $15 billion by the end 
of year three will help ensure the sustainability of health 
services in this country into the next millennium. 
<P><A NAME="LINK64"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, this would 
all be understandable if we really had a medical emergency.  When 
we started we did not, but the taxman took $2,000 per taxpayer 
out on one hand and the health care budget dropped by $1,500 per 
taxpayer on the other hand.  That does not equate for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question again is for the Prime Minister who sat in his chair 
and allowed this to happen.  Will that farmer from Manitoba not 
have to go to the U.S. again for his care?  That is my question. 
Yes or no. 
<P><A NAME="LINK65"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Elinor Caplan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister and the 
minister of health said very clearly—and yesterday the finance 
minister said it clearly—that health care is a priority for this 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The $11.5 billion allocated yesterday is the single largest

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the minister 
also announced the establishment of a $25 million fund 
supposedly designed to remedy the nurses' situation. But the 
Fédération des infirmières du Québec recently issued a statement 
to the effect that the fund was far from being an answer to all 
their problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the Minister of Finance not consider that the $25 million 
would be better spent on emergency services than on paperwork? 
<P><A NAME="LINK69"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council for 
Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if the member wants to quote sources from Quebec, we 
will go along with that. One third of all funding for biomedical 
research from the Medical Research Council of Canada goes to 
Quebec. I do not think that yesterday's budget will come as bad 
news to researchers in Quebec, quite the contrary.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
today 200,000 Canadians are still on waiting lines in hospitals. 
But if they are wealthy or desperate they could jump the queue 
and fly down to the United States for treatment.  They could pay 
cash for health care.  If that is not two tier, if that is not 
American style health care, I do not know what is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like ask the father of two tier health care how will 
this budget guarantee that Canadians will not have to fly south 
for health care. 
<P><A NAME="LINK71"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Elinor Caplan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member knows full well that 
the priorities and the principles of the Canada Health Act ensure 
a contract with Canadians that says that when they need health 
care services it is up to the provinces to deliver those 
services.   The federal government is a partner in funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday we lived up to our commitment by giving the provinces 
$3.5 billion immediately and $11.5 billion over the next five 
years.  We have helped to ensure that the principles of the 
Canada Health Act will be ensured and secure for the next 
millennium. 
<P><A NAME="LINK72"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the member talks about the Canada Health Act.  Is she telling 
Canadians right now that they have equal access to a waiting 
line?  I do not think Canadians would be too impressed about 
hearing this member rattle on about the Canada Health Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government has stripped billions and billions of dollars 
out of health care and put a little back in yesterday.  The 
wealthy and the desperate still fly to Minnesota to the Mayo 
Clinic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me repeat that we are seeing an American health care system. 
We are seeing a two tier health care system in this country. That 
goes against the Canada Health Act.  That is Liberal health care.

<P><A NAME="LINK73"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Elinor Caplan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of

Canada Health Act.  That party would scrap the Canada Health Act 
and lead us down the path to American style medicare. Frankly, it 
cannot accept good news. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The good news is that the budget yesterday has secured Canadian 
health care for the future.  As a partner with the provinces we 
have given them the resources they said they need.  We gave

since this Liberal government has come into power it has slashed 
$7.8 billion from the defence budget itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before yesterday's budget, the defence minister said that he 
needed $700 million to make ends meet.  He got only $325 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that is the best this defence minister can do, maybe it is 
time he stood aside.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as usual, he has it all wrong.  The $325 
million is one year but the $700 million is over a number of 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened yesterday is good news for our troops.  It was the 
first increase the Canadian forces have had in their budget in 
over a decade.  It also ensures that we can implement the quality

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton—Strathcona, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the Canadian Federation of Independent Business called 
yesterday's budget a disappointment and a missed opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Small businesses have never worked harder to keep what little 
they earn after this finance minister is done with them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This year he increased CPP taxes 73%, he changed the rules to 
keep $5 billion in EI funds and has increased user fees to

for Canadians? 
<P><A NAME="LINK89"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, what the government did along with the provinces, 
despite all the objections of the Reform Party, was to save the 
Canada pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, what we brought in in the budget was not only no 
tax hikes but $16.5 billion worth of tax reductions over the 
course of the next three years.  These are tax reductions which 
are primarily directed at the middle class, basically the spine 
of small business in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are very proud of this budget.  We are very proud of the tax 
reductions it has in it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK90"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton—Strathcona, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the finance minister would not have tax relief in his 
vocabulary if not for the official opposition.  It is because of 
us working that word over the last few years that the minister 
has adopted it in his own vocabulary.  He takes a lot more time 
to talk about it, as we saw yesterday.  We would actually deliver 
on it.

community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, $50 million has gone in to the federal bank 
for the purpose of supporting small businesses exporting in the

responsibility for design, management, administration and 
delivery of health care services in their provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government, as guardians of the Canada Health Act, 
can ensure that the five principles of medicare are in place: 
universal access, reasonable access, portability,

<P><A NAME="LINK98"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Bachand (Richmond—Arthabaska, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, a few 
weeks ago, the social union agreement was signed, along with a 
document saying that any additional funding for health would be 
provided in accordance with the current legislation. Yesterday, 
when the budget speech was delivered, we found out that a third 
administrative body, a trust, will be set up to manage an amount 
of $3.5 billion taken from the current budget to be distributed 
to the provinces over a three-year period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is for the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs. 
Was the establishment of that third administrative body 
discussed with the provinces during the negotiations on social 
union, yes or no? 
<P><A NAME="LINK99"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council for 
Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I can tell the hon. member that the unexpected good 
news about the amount of the transfers, including equalization, 
came as a surprise to everyone and all Canadians should be 
pleased about this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the trust itself, it will give the provinces greater 
independence and, so far, all the premiers have reacted very 
positively to this initiative. Let me say that, for my province 
in particular, the increase in transfers was totally unexpected. 
Quebec will be getting one third of the federal transfers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This may come as a surprise, but it is definitely a very good 
one. 
<P><A NAME="LINK100"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Bachand (Richmond—Arthabaska, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
government is once again throwing a monkey wrench into 
federal-provincial relations. The minister did not answer the 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A third administrative body will be created, while the 
provinces, including Brian's Newfoundland and Lucien's Quebec, 
will receive less money in the next budget than they currently 
do. This is the reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am asking the minister whether or not the trust reflects the 
social union philosophy, and whether or not this government is 
throwing a monkey wrench into federal-provincial relations. 
<P><A NAME="LINK101"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
cannot resist answering. In fact, the provinces themselves asked 
us that the money be made available— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien:</B> One should recognize that even the 
premier of Quebec signed the agreement on health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien:</B> Yes, he did sign the letter that led 
to the agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provinces asked me to make sure that those which could use 
the money be able to do so as quickly as possible. This is why 
we chose to hold the money in trust.  The provinces will then be 
free to use that money as they see fit and as needed over a 
three-year period.

once we clear past all the smoke and mirrors accounting and spin

The taxes of Canadians are actually going up and not down as a 
result of yesterday's budget.  That is because of the minister's 
annual payroll tax grab and bracket creep. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a very simple question.  After all the bafflegab is taken

Mr. Speaker, I rise on a question of privilege to invoke your 
judgment and that of those in the House on a matter that I 
believe infringed on my privilege as a member of parliament and 
impeded me in dutifully carrying out and fulfilling my 
obligations as an elected representative of this parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, February 17, 1999, members of the Public Service Alliance 
of Canada set up picket lines at strategic locations of entry to 
the region of Parliament Hill and at entrances to specific 
buildings within the Parliament Hill precincts, including and not 
limited to the Langevin Block, the West Block road entrance, the 
East Block entrance, and the pedestrian and road access entrances 
to the Wellington Building. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These pickets, I hereby submit, did impede my responsibility as 
a member of parliament and my ability to carry out my obligations 
as a member of parliament in a timely and prescribed fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The particular picket line that impeded my ability to carry out 
the said function and which contravened my privilege as a member 
of parliament was located at the west gates of the West Block 
where the shuttle buses that carry parliamentarians had to be 
rerouted to other access entrances far out of the normal routing 
on Parliament Hill.  Not only this, but in my individual case no 
bus was prepared to run the gauntlet.  Thus I had to make my way 
to conduct my affairs as a parliamentarian by other means. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I submit this is a violation of my privileges and a 
contravention of the centuries old precedent and parliamentary 
order and function. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I further submit that other parliamentarians were denied access 
to the entrance of their parliamentary office buildings in the 
early hours of this picketing, thus contravening in direct 
personal fashion the conduct of their affairs and the affairs of 
their staff. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is direct and compelling reference to my question of 
privilege in both Erskine May and Beauchesne's.  I hereby submit, 
Mr. Speaker, these references for your learned judgment and 
decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Beauchesne's fifth edition states that by definition: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliamentary privilege is the sum of the peculiar rights enjoyed 
by each House collectively as a constituent part of the High 
Court of Parliament, and by Members of each House individually, 
without which they could not discharge their functions and which 
exceed those possessed by other bodies and individuals. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Beauchesne's states at citation 16: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The privileges of Parliament are rights which are “absolutely 
necessary for the due execution of its powers”.  They are 
enjoyed by individual Members, because the House cannot perform 
its functions without unimpeded use of the services of its 
Members; and by each House for the protection of its members and 
the vindication of its own authority and dignity. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I submit the events of the pickets in question were in direct 
violation of this right and privilege, exhibited a contempt for 
the functions of parliamentarians, and were a direct attack on

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also submit my capacity as a member elected to serve my 
constituents was diminished by these pickets similar to the 
references as expressed in citation 18 of Beauchesne's. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Erskine May has reference to the access of parliamentarians to 
carry out their functions and what would contravene and violate 
this privilege.  I submit the following reference.  Under 
“Access to the Houses of Parliament” Erskine May states that to 
facilitate the attendance of members without interruption, both 
Houses, at the beginning of each session, give directions in the 
sessional orders that during the session of parliament the 
streets leading to the Houses of Parliament be free and open, and 
that no obstruction shall be permitted to hinder the passage 
thereto of the lords or members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I again submit that the pickets denying my ease of access to 
parliament are an affront to the centuries old parliamentary 
privilege as defined by Erskine May. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The president of the Public Service Alliance of Canada, Mr. 
Daryl Bean, in full knowledge of these pickets did with contempt 
violate my privileges and the privileges of others as members of 
parliament and did with full knowledge contravene the rules of 
this Chamber and the dignity of this institution.  I submit that 
through the leadership of this union Mr. Bean be held in contempt 
of this parliament and in contempt of the privileges of 
individual members and be hereby censured for these actions 
carried out by his membership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, if you find I have a question of privilege, I would 
be prepared to move the appropriate motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Before I hear the hon. House leader for the 
government, may I ask the hon. member for Saskatoon—Humboldt if 
his question of privilege is the same as that of the member who 
just spoke. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Pankiw:</B>  Yes, it is, Mr. Speaker, so my comments 
would be very brief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I will hear you.  I now direct myself to the 
hon. member for Souris—Moose Mountain.  Is your question of 
privilege the same as that of the hon. member for West 
Vancouver—Sunshine Coast? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would admit that it is 
similar but there are some differences in my case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Why I am asking you is that I am going to 
invite you to speak successively.  Does the question of privilege 
of the hon. member for Yorkton—Melville coincide with this one? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz:</B>  Mr. Speaker, yes.  I just wanted to 
give a personal illustration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Here is what we will do.  I will hear the 
three members I have just questioned and then I will hear the 
government House leader. 
<P><A NAME="LINK117"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon—Humboldt, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
this morning a mob of hooligans used physical violence and 
intimidation to stop me from gaining access to my office.  While 
I do not believe the thugs who assaulted me today are indicative 
of all members in that union, it is imperative for you to act 
accordingly to ensure that this type of cowardly behaviour does 
not occur again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, should you find this to be a prima facie question 
of privilege, I am prepared to move the appropriate motion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK118"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I join briefly with my colleagues on this particular 
point.  I arrived at my office around 7 o'clock this morning and 
was told I would not be able to enter the office.  I went and had 
a coffee and then came back and explained to them.  At that time 
I was allowed with a security guard to go to the office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the function of carrying out my duties, this is the first 
time in my life I have ever been inhibited or shamed in trying to 
get to my place of work.  My office was four hours without 
contact with my constituency.  I could not carry out my duties 
because my staff was not allowed to be in my office.  As the hon. 
member mentioned, that is a violation of the rules and precedents 
of the House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK119"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to end this with a brief quotation from 
Joseph Maingot.  I cannot serve my constituents without my staff 
and restricting my staff interferes with my work as an MP.  My 
staff are an extension of me. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1515"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT15"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My constituents and the media tried to contact me for 
approximately four hours this morning.  They could not get 
through.  It was one of the busiest days we have had in our 
office today, right after the budget as members can imagine.  The 
picketers would not allow my staff to enter.  I tried personally 
to get them.  I explained to them what this was all about and how 
it was important to me.  I could not get my staff through.  I 
would be shocked if on one of the busiest days, Mr. Speaker, you 
did not feel that this was an infringement of my privileges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to read a quotation from Joseph Maingot's 
</I>Parliamentary Privilege in Canada<I>, second edition, chapter 
2, page 13: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If someone improperly interferes with the parliamentary work of a 
member of parliament—i.e. any of the member's activities that 
have a connection with a proceeding in parliament—in such a case 
that is a matter involving parliamentary privilege.  An offence 
against the authority of the House constitutes contempt. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This would clearly include restricting staff to do its work 
for a member of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, I was unable to go about my work because my staff was 
denied access to my office.  Not allowing my staff to accompany 
me is a very serious infringement on my privileges. 
<P><A NAME="LINK120"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, first let me say how I think 
these conditions are unfortunate and even unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I became aware of the picket around 6.45 a.m. At that time I 
alerted the House authorities of what I believed was a condition 
that could cause difficulties and possible questions of privilege 
from members of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think there is any doubt that if a member of parliament 
was assaulted that is unacceptable and is a breach of our 
privileges, not only the member in question but every one of us. 
That is the first proposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second is on the issue of the picket itself.  The picket, 
provided it is not on the grounds of Parliament Hill and provided 
it is done for information purposes and it respects the law, I 
think is legal.  It has to respect the law in order to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The allegations we have heard from many hon. members is that it 
was not done in a proper way.  That is unacceptable as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third proposition brought to us by another hon. member is 
that the president of the union maybe in contempt of parliament. 
I do not know if the Chair would want to rule immediately on that 
third proposition.  I think it should be investigated before the 
Chair rules on it.  I do not know whether the chair of the union 
personally not only authorized the picket in question but 
authorized it to be conducted in a manner which may have been 
illegal.  That proposition is a little different from the others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I can get back to the original proposition, that members of 
parliament were assaulted, the 1751 Mason issue outlined in 
Erskine May makes it very clear that it is unacceptable even for 
a police officer to stop someone from attending to his duties in 
parliament.  If it is not appropriate for someone who is a police 
officer to stop us from coming here, it is equally unacceptable 
for anyone else to try to do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I invite the Chair when examining the situation, because it is 
equally germane to this issue although slightly different, to 
determine whether the privileges that extend to members of 
parliament in our attendance here also extend either to the staff 
of members of parliament or even to the staff of Mr. Speaker.  I 
was also approached earlier this day by a staff member of Mr. 
Speaker, someone who works for the Commons but not for a member 
of parliament, who informed me he had considerable difficulty in 
reaching his place of work to do a very essential task for us in 
this Chamber. 
So the Chair, no doubt, would want to look at that as well.

<A HREF="#LINKT16"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For these reasons, I would ask that the Chair not rule 
immediately and investigate all the points I have raised, and the 
come back to the House in order to see whether there is a prima 
facie case of privilege on all these points.  But I am already 
convinced there is at least such a prima facie case in some of 
the points that have been raised, in particular the one involving 
molestation of a member. 
<P><A NAME="LINK121"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I too want to report to you what happened to me this 
morning.  I have an office in the Wellington Building as well. 
When I arrived this morning there was of course a picket line 
outside the door.  I spoke to the picket captain and he said that 
if I want I can go into the building, they were not inhibiting 
members of parliament whatsoever in terms of going into the 
building. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I declined of course to cross the picket line and chatted some 
more with them.  He once again repeated the offer that I could 
proceed into the building if I wished and once again I declined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A similar thing happened to many other colleagues of mine, 
including my colleague from Beauséjour—Petitcodiac.  Once again 
she was made the offer to enter the building if she wanted to in 
a very polite way.  We had no problems whatsoever with the people 
who were picketing.  They were very polite to us and offered 
access to the building if we wanted to as members of parliament. 
I think Mr. Speaker should know that while deliberating on the 
issue. 
<P><A NAME="LINK122"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Labour, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would also like to lend my 
voice because I too entered the press club today to do a taping. 
I spoke to each and every person.  They were CBC strikers. 
However, I had the same experience of no trouble at all.  I spoke 
to them.  I in no way mean to say that the Reform members' 
stories are not how they found them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But I do think it is fair to say that I did not have any trouble 
at all.  I walked past the Wellington Building.  I spoke to all 
the picketers.  In fact, I got in the line and followed them, 
sort of.  I then went in and said goodbye. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am the parliamentary secretary to labour, so maybe that was 
okay, I do not know. But I did not have any trouble. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  What the hon. member has brought up is very 
serious for us in the House.  I am going to make one ruling now 
and reserve on the other three. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Saskatoon—Humboldt has said in this House 
that he was assaulted or touched or pushed.  I do not want to put 
words in the hon. member's mouth, but if that is precise, I would 
like the hon. member to indicate that to me now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Pankiw:</B>  Yes, Mr. Speaker, all three of those are 
correct.  The hon. member for Wetaskiwin witnessed it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK123"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I find a prima facie case of contempt 
and I will refer that to the appropriate committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will take the advice of the government House leader because I 
want to look into what the member for West Vancouver—Sunshine 
Coast has said.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to consider what the member for Yorkton—Melville 
has said because he is expanding this notion.  I also want to 
consider what has been said by the member for Brandon—Souris. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You have the gist of what I want to do.  I will reserve on three 
of the allegations that were brought forth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I now invite the hon. member for Saskatoon—Humboldt to move his 
motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Pankiw:</B>  Mr. Speaker I would move that the matter of 
denying members of parliament and their staff access to 
Parliament Hill and the parliamentary buildings by the public 
service union on Wednesday, February 17, 1999 be referred to the 
Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs, and for the 
purposes of dealing with similar action by PSAC demonstrators in 
the immediate future, the Speaker instruct security personnel to 
take the appropriate action necessary to ensure that members of 
parliament and their staff have unimpeded access to parliamentary 
offices at all times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I wonder if the hon. member would limit his 
statement to what he said before.  His motion is much broader 
than the one I ruled on.  I would like him to consider including 
in his motion that he was indeed assaulted in trying to get into 
the building where he was to perform his duties.  If he will 
limit it to that at this point until I can consider the other 
points that have been brought up I would accept that as a motion. 
Would he consider doing that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Pankiw:</B>  Yes, Mr. Speaker.  Is it sufficient to 
say so moved? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Yes, it is.  That is the easy way to do 
business around here.  In my judgment it is a prima facie case 
and this will be referred to the appropriate committee and the 
other three will be held in abeyance until I can get more 
information.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>FINANCIAL STATEMENT OF MINISTER OF FINANCE 
</H4><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK144">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from February 16 consideration of the motion 
that this House approves in general the budgetary policy of the 
government. 
<P><A NAME="LINK145"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I rise to begin the debate on the 1999 federal budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague, the hon. member for Medicine Hat, as well as other 
opposition members will focus on various particulars of the 
budget, in particular the defects for which the government needs 
to be held accountable of which there are many. We will also be 
constructive.  The opposition will be presenting constructive 
alternatives in the areas where we feel the budget is deficient, 
particularly with respect to tax policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my intent at the beginning to focus on the big picture, 
that is the financial performance and the service record of the 
government not just for the last year but since it came to 
office, and what that record and what this particular budget mean 
to Canadians in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members know, this is the sixth budget that has been 
presented by the current finance minister.  If asked to summarize 
the net effect of these budgets, not just this one but the 
cumulative effect of the six budgets, in one sentence it would be 
this: that under this government, Canadians are paying more and 
getting less.  Canadians are paying more and getting less and 
despite all the rhetoric, despite all the spin doctors, despite 
all the public relations that accompanied the budget yesterday, 
the total tax bill paid by Canadians has increased yet again 
while health care services and other services have been cut. 
Under this government Canadians pay more for less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to paying more, Canadians hear all the glowing 
references in the budget speech and the public relations that 
accompany it with respect to the performance of the economy, 
phrases like “unprecedented progress”, “we have strengthened 
the sinews of our innovative and productive economy”, “we have 
equipped Canadians to succeed”. Most of these phrases and words 
have been tested by public opinion firms.  They test the words, 
find out which words resonate best with the public and those 
words find their way into budgets.  This is not something 
surprising. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the rank and file of Canadians will be asking at the end of 
the day: if everything is so rosy, why do I not have more money 
in my pocket at the end of the month and why do I not have more 
money in my bank account?  The answer to that question in one 
word is taxes.  Under this government Canadians are paying more 
taxes than they have ever paid before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take a few minutes therefore to elaborate on 
this one simple phrase “paying more” and to demonstrate from 
the figures that were tabled by the government yesterday how 
Canadians are, at the end of the day, paying more.  Let me start 
with personal income tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of 1993-94 when this government took office, 
Canadians were paying $51.4 billion in personal income tax for 
the year. At the end of 1999-2000, they will be paying $75 
billion for the year, an increase of $24 billion or 46%, an 
increase of $650 for every Canadian.  The bottom line is that 
Canadians will pay more income tax than they ever have before, 
46% more in total than when the government took office. Canadians 
are now paying the highest personal income tax rates in the 
The government taxes its citizens more heavily with respect to 
personal income tax than any other government of the G-7.  That 
has not changed as a result of this budget.  The Liberal legacy 
is Canadians pay more.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, this government is not content just to tax you when 
you earn.  The whole idea is to get you when you are coming and 
going so the government also taxes people when they spend.  We 
have the figures on the GST consumption tax, a tax the government 
solemnly promised to remove before it became the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of 1993-94 when this government replaced the Tories, 
Canadians were paying $15.7 billion in GST per year.  At the end 
of 1999-2000 Canadians will be paying $21.6 billion in GST, an 
increase of $5.9 billion or 38%.  That is an increase of $156 per 
Canadian. The bottom line is that Canadians are paying more GST 
under a government that promised to abolish it than they have 
ever paid before, 38% more in total than when the government took 
office.  When it comes to consumption taxes, Canadians pay more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government plays a shell game with taxes to try to make 
taxpayers feel better off.  It announces with great fanfare 
certain tax reductions, such as the modest reductions in the 
employment insurance premiums, and then it says nothing about or 
even hides increases in other taxes such as the CPP increases 
that are inexorably taking more dollars from Canadians each year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two ways to cut through the shell game.  One is to 
elaborate on how the shell game is played with respect to 
particular taxes and particular expenditures.  I hope some day 
the auditor general spends a whole day explaining that kind of 
shell game to the House. But the simplest way to cut through the 
shell game is to look at the total federal taxes collected from 
individuals and total tax revenues.  Here the story is the same. 
Canadians pay more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at total federal taxes paid by persons, and this 
includes personal income tax, employment insurance, GST and 
Canada pension plan, at the end of 1993-94 the total of all 
federal taxes paid by persons for the year was $94.3 billion.  At 
the end of 1999-2000 the total of all federal taxes paid by 
persons will be $131 billion, an increase of $36.8 billion or 
39%. The bottom line again, and notice the inexorable conclusion 
that we come to by working through the numbers, is Canadians 
paying more in total federal personal taxes than they have ever 
paid before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  More Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning:</B>  The hon. member says to be Canadian 
is to pay taxes.  That is the Liberal definition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, if we put all this together and look at the total tax 
revenue of the federal government, as expected, we get the same 
story.  Canadians paying more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of 1993-94 when this government took office, total 
federal revenue was $107.3 billion. At the end of 1999-2000 the 
total of federal revenues collected will be $149.4 billion, an 
increase of $42 billion or 39%.  In other words, there is an 
increase in federal revenues collected per taxpayer, and this is 
the budget that was going to alleviate the taxpayers from the 
great burden of federal taxation, of $2,020 or 24%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government has become the richest government in Canada's 
history.  The economy can grow by 3%, which ought to be good news 
for Canadians.  But when the federal government's revenues grow 
by 8% what that tells us is that when there is economic growth, a 
disproportionate amount of that growth is not going to the people 
who produce it, not to the companies that produce it, not to the 
individuals who produce it, but to the ever present government 
and its taxation department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The great record of Liberalism is going to be this for the 20th 
century: a well to do finance minister and a well to do prime 
minister running the richest government in the history of Canada, 
one that is collecting $409 million per day from the taxpayers of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think I have made the case.  I could go on, but the case is 
that Canadians pay more.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Canadians were paying more but getting more in terms of 
better government or better services, perhaps the government 
would have a leg to stand on or at least be able to explain or 
defend its record.  But the other half of the equation, the other 
part of the bottom line, is that under this government Canadians 
are not only paying more but are getting less.  In particular, 
Canadians are getting less in the one area they care about most 
these days, health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Time does not permit me to deal with all areas of government 
activity in which Canadians are getting less value for their 
money, the areas in which the productivity of the federal 
government itself is declining.  No one should have any illusions 
that part of the productivity problem in this country is the 
declining productivity of government itself, getting less for the 
taxes that are paid and the cost of government being tacked on to 
everything we produce and sell in the world market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will touch on five areas in which Canadians are getting less. 
The first is employment insurance, a big bill.  According to the 
chief auditor for this program, the government has been 
overtaxing Canadians for employment insurance on average by 37% 
for at least five years and it continues to do so.  Yet during 
the same time benefits have decreased and the government has 
proposed to return only a fraction of the accumulated surpluses 
to the employers and the employees who put it up in the first 
place.  In other words, with regard to employment insurance 
people are paying more and getting less.  They are getting less 
employment insurance.  They are not getting the premium refunds 
they should be getting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second area is the Canada pension plan.  Under the 
government's proposals for this plan, a huge area of expenditure 
and investment, CPP premiums will increase by 41% over the next 
four years.  Notice there is not a word about the CPP in the 
budget.  Yet at the end of the day the most Canadians can expect 
from this plan even after these increases is a measly $9,000 a 
year pension which is less than half the pension a young worker 
would get if those same funds were placed in an RRSP.  With 
regard to CPP under this government people will pay 41% more and 
they will get less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third is military spending.  Since 1993-94 the government has 
cut national defence spending.  This is the department Liberals 
love to hate.  The defence department is the one they do not mind 
cutting.  They have cut it by over $2.4 billion per year in 
absolute terms but the cumulative effect of the cuts is about 
$7.8 billion.  This has set in motion the downsizing of Canada's 
military and a deterioration in morale which has significantly 
reduced our military capability.  Now the government is preparing 
to put about $175 million per year for three years back into the 
military but it is not implementing the other reforms necessary 
to render Canada's military more effective. With respect to 
defence spending Canadians will still pay more but they will get 
less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fourth area is Indian affairs.  According to this budget the 
government is putting half a billion dollars into Indian affairs 
but the government has done nothing to ensure that much of the 
$4.4 billion it is already putting in is not siphoned off by 
lawyers, bureaucrats, politicians and consultants in activities 
that benefit everybody else except the rank and file aboriginal, 
particularly on reserve. While Canadians pay more we would argue 
that the rank and file aboriginal on reserve sees less and less 
of these funds. Canadians pay more but the ones who really need 
the help get less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to getting less, let us take a look at the area of 
health care.  This is an area in which Canadians are most 
conscious of getting less while paying more.  This is an area 
where there has been more spin doctoring, shell gaming and 
rhetoric than any other, but that cannot hide the ugly truth. 
When this government took office transfers to other levels of 
government, the CHST, the Canada assistance plan, the EPF and 
equalization, amounted to $27 billion per year.  In 1997-98 under 
this government transfers had decreased to a cumulative total of 
$21 billion, a decrease of $6 billion per year or 22%.  The 
negative effects of this cut in health care transfers are well 
known to all members of the House.  They include the hospital 
closures, the thousands of doctors, nurses and health care 
workers leaving the country, the 200,000 Canadians on waiting 
lists and all the pain, anxiety and anger these figures 
represent.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians were beginning to refer to the Minister of Finance, 
the Minister of Health and the Prime Minister as the Dr. 
Kevorkians of Canadian medicare.  The government finally felt 
impelled to do something.  So it decided to put $2 billion to 
$2.5 billion per year back into health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the spin doctors said that was not a very big number, 
$2 billion to $2.5 billion.  They said you will not get a 
headline for a health care budget if you are talking about $2 
billion to $2.5 billion per year.  So they asked if it could be 
made bigger.  Everyone knows what the spin doctors do when they 
get into something like this, they multiply it by something.  So 
somebody said multiply it by three.  Then some genius said no, 
multiply it by five.  When we multiply it by five we would get a 
big number, up to $11.5 billion.  This is the kind of math that 
goes on behind the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lo and behold we have an announcement by the finance minister 
that the government is going to put $11.5 billion back into 
health care.  They say over five years very quickly so it does 
not get divided by five. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If you are to use cumulative numbers for spending increases on 
health care, you had better use cumulative numbers for the 
spending cuts on health care and social services to let people 
know what you are doing.  Those numbers do not appear in the 
budget at all.  I am sure the minister had them on a piece of 
paper and it fell out of the envelope on the way into the 
department.  I am sure he was going to tell us all about them but 
they were not there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So we have to do the math.  We found that the government's 
cumulative cuts in the transfers for health and social programs 
are $21.4 billion by the end of 1999.  Even if we put $11.5 
billion back in there is a spending deficit.  Canadians pay more 
and get less in health care, about $1,500 less per taxpayer than 
was spent in 1993-94. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some hon. members are shaking their heads.  They are looking 
around and talking to each other, saying this is confusing.  Let 
me follow their train of thought.  I can read their minds.  The 
hon. members are saying that sometimes we are talking about the 
Canada health and social transfers and sometimes we are talking 
about the health transfers.  If we say there is confusion, we say 
who is to blame for that.  The government cynically and 
deliberately created confusion on that point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the government was cutting health care transfers it wanted 
to lump them in with the other social transfers so the health 
care cuts would be less visible to the public and the government 
would not get the blame.  So when it cuts it mixes it in with 
something else.  All of a sudden, now that it wants to increase 
it, it wants to make it explicit and visible again so the federal 
government can get the credit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general is not going to be fooled by this kind of 
shell game and neither are Canadians.  As I said earlier, I hope 
he devotes an entire volume in his next report to the shell game 
reporting that goes on with respect to the federal budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bottom line of all of this, the unadulterated bottom line, 
the government's financial management since 1993-94, is Canadians 
pay $42 billion more taxes since the government took office, or 
$2,020 per taxpayers, and Canadians will get less, in particular 
$1,500 less per taxpayer, for health and other services.  Pay 
more, get less is the legacy of the Liberal government in the 
dying days of the 20th century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I got into this yesterday but the minister had spoken for an 
hour and 20 minutes and I could not get into this in any great 
detail to close off the debate.  I want to elaborate on the point 
that Canada is becoming like old England.  When the real king, King 
Richard the Lionhearted, was away on a crusade, a relative, 
Prince John, was put in charge.  We quoted the little rhyme, “He 
wanted to be known as John the First but he ended up being known 
as John the Worst”.  Why?  Because with the aid of his henchman, 
the sheriff of Nottingham, he taxed his people to death.  Under 
his regency the government got richer and richer—this is 
historically accurate—and the people got poorer services and 
poorer, period.  In other words, it was a prototype of the Liberal 
government.  Pay more and you get less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They paid more and got less until a green clad reformer named 
Robin Hood assembled a group together, sort of a united 
alternative of Sherwood Forest, and Prince John's evil ways were 
restrained.  However, that is another story I will save for 
another day.

<A HREF="#LINKT23"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps a little more seriously, it is worth noting that a 
little later Prince John actually did become king and the major 
landowners, taxpayers and business leaders, the barons and 
so-called magnates of the realm, staged a taxpayers revolt and 
made King John, the king of taxers, sign a humiliating document 
called the Magna Carta in which he promised not to overtax and 
abuse his subjects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finance ministers should take note of what can happen when 
taxpayers are pushed too far. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This weekend a group of Canadians will be meeting in this city to 
explore new ways and means of uniting Canadians to reduce the 
flood of Liberal taxation and the deterioration of health care 
under this administration.  My hope is that convention will 
eventually result in a Magna Carta for Canadians that will free 
Canada from the pay more, get less policies of the Liberal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To complement that effort, my colleagues in the House will also 
use this budget debate to propose remedies to the current 
situation.  They will propose ways and means of ending the shell 
game by making the government's financial accounting more 
accountable and more believable and transparent.  They will 
propose reforms in health care financing and federal-provincial 
relations because the two are connected.  They were not connected 
in the budget.  They should be connected.   The proposed reforms 
would put health and social service finances on a firmer 
foundation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They will propose broad based tax relief greater in scope than 
anything this government has ever conceived so that in the end 
Canadians will pay less and get more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I move: 
<A NAME="LINK146">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the motion be amended by replacing all the words after the 
word “that” with the following: 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This House rejects the budget statement of the government 
because it is a continuation of the government's pay more get 
less policy which has savaged health care and burdened Canadians 
with high taxes thus undermining the productivity of the Canadian 
economy; and because this ever increasing high tax policy has 
significantly reduced the standard of living of Canadians and 
left the health care system in tatters.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
sixth budget of the Minister of Finance of Canada is not only 
disappointing, it is very disappointing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning's </I>Globe and Mail<I> was not shy about telling the 
Minister of Finance that he lacked imagination, that he lacked 
vision for a minister of finance and that he should make way for 
someone else with more vision and more compassion who is better 
able to manage the surpluses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They also wanted a new minister of finance with greater 
transparency. 
In this regard, the Minister of Finance obviously lacked 
transparency from his first budget to his sixth in terms of 
releasing the real figures for public finances, for the deficit 
and for the surpluses. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1600"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT24"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One would have expected, and this is my first criticism, that 
those who helped put the federal fiscal house in order, those 
who contributed to first eliminating the deficit and then 
accumulating major surpluses in the Minister of Finance's 
coffers would be rewarded for their efforts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given a $12 billion surplus for the fiscal year ending on March 
31, and given an anticipated surplus of $20 billion for next 
year—not the surpluses as they appear in the budget documents 
where, once again, the finance minister's figures are zero and 
zero, but the real figures which the Bloc Quebecois makes a 
habit of providing and which are accurate to within 5%, which is 
normal, unlike the finance minister's figures, which are off by 
150%—one would have expected middle income families to enjoy 
meaningful tax reductions. After all, these are the people who 
have had to pay most of the $19 billion in new taxes imposed by 
the Minister of Finance since 1994, not to mention the GST 
increase, which brought in $5 billion in revenues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This year, these middle income families, that is those earning 
between $30,000 and $70,000, will get a ridiculous tax reduction 
of somewhere between $150 and $300. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By contrast, the friends of the Liberal Party, the wealthy, 
those who have been enjoying preferential treatment from this 
government since 1993, will get a significant tax reduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If one's individual or family income is $250,000, one will be 
entitled to a $3,800 tax reduction this year, compared to 
between $150 and $300 if one earns between $30,000 and $70,000. 
Who is this budget for? Who benefits from it? It is the well to 
do, even though middle income families are the ones that helped 
the Minister of Finance generate the absolutely huge surpluses 
that he is hiding shamelessly from Quebeckers and Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would have expected some consideration would be given the 
unemployed of this country, because the largest part of the 
contribution to the improvement of public finances comes from 
them.  The Minister of Finance together with the Minister of 
Human Resources Development have used the employment insurance 
fund surplus of $6 billion annually for the past three years to 
improve public finances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With there being significant surpluses, we might have thought 
some consideration would be given the unemployed.  Nothing. 
Zero.  On with the government policy of blithely dipping into 
the surplus in the employment insurance fund, harassing the 
unemployed and denying them their right to contest the decisions 
made at HRDC employment centres across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So they harass them, after they have already been hit with the 
scourge of unemployment, in order to create a significant 
surplus at the end of it all.  We might have thought they would 
review the employment insurance plan so that not just 36% of the 
unemployed would be covered by it, which means that this plan no 
longer makes any sense.  But there is nothing in this budget to 
help the country's unemployed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We might wonder where the Minister of Human Resources 
Development was, because the Minister of Health and member from 
Ontario got funding for his department.  The Minister of 
Industry, another member from Ontario, got some of the spending 
provided in the Minister of Finance's budget.  The Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, who is also from Ontario, got money as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where was the Minister of Human Resources Development, a Quebec 
minister and a Liberal?  Where did he make his representations? 
What weight does he carry?  He seems to be a featherweight, if 
the budget results are any indication. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Ontario ministers got all sorts of things for their 
respective departments.  Although Quebec and the rest of Canada 
agree that the EI fund heist, or surplus as it is called, 
designed to give the rich a tax break, should be stopped, and 
although there are country-wide demonstrations, and the Quebec 
coalition paid us a visit recently, the Minister of Human 
Resources Development does not have enough heft to ask the 
Minister of Finance to include humanitarian considerations and 
compassion in his budget.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to health care, it is clear from this budget that 
something amazing happened between the time the Prime Minister 
met with the premiers and the time the budget was drawn up. The 
Minister of Finance and the government of the member for 
Saint-Maurice decided unilaterally to amend the federal transfer 
payment formula for health, post-secondary education—which is 
often forgotten—and social assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unilaterally, they decided that this year they were changing the 
rules of the game. Now, all of a sudden, federal health transfer 
payments would be based on population, rather than on the 
traditional shares. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where were the Liberal ministers from Quebec?  The unilateral 
change to the funding formula for health, post-secondary 
education and social assistance, but especially health, has put 
Quebec at a literal disadvantage.  The government has just 
ensured that federal transfer payments to Quebec for health, 
post-secondary education and social assistance will decline over 
the next five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, while government members from Quebec were 
asleep at the switch, government members from Ontario lobbied 
for and obtained transfer payments for Ontario; as a result, 
starting this year, of the $2 billion increase in transfer 
payments for health, almost $1 billion will go to Ontario, the 
richest province in Canada. Furthermore, if we look at the 
regional breakdown, $400 million will go to British Columbia and 
$300 million to Alberta. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear today why the premiers of these three provinces have 
been staunch supporters of the social union. 
And when I say staunch, I mean super staunch. Just last night, 
Mike Harris, the premier of Ontario, signed again, before us, 
some sort of card—they would rather sign a cheque to charity, 
since that is how they do things—but Harris preferred to sign 
the social union agreement again because, as he said, “Ontario 
stands to gain”. It takes some doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every time the finance minister does a good deed, it is to show 
himself off to advantage, as a minister and a potential 
candidate for the leadership of the Liberal Party of Canada, but 
we are used to that. That is what he did in the maritimes, when 
he negotiated an agreement to harmonize the GST and the 
provincial taxes. As a reward for playing his game and making 
him look good, he gave the three provinces involved nearly 
$1 billion in compensation. 
In Quebec, we are still waiting for our $2 billion in 
compensation, because we had harmonized the Quebec sales tax 
with the GST several years earlier.  We are still waiting for 
the $2 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He has got us used to that.  He gives out what amounts to bribes 
to compensate ministers or provinces that come on side and 
promote the government's overly centralizing ideas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We understand better now why the social union was so strongly 
supported by the premiers of these provinces.  Today they get 
compensation in the budget.  The compensation is $1 billion for 
Ontario in Canada social transfer, $400 million for B.C. and 
$300 million for Alberta. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where were the government members from Quebec? 
I am thinking in particular of the Minister of Finance, who is 
also the member for LaSalle—Émard, the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, the Minister of Human Resources 
Development and the Minister of Immigration.  That counts for 
something, but they are all featherweights, because, when it 
comes to Quebec's interests, they have shown with this budget 
that they have done nothing, that they have been asleep at the 
switch, to use a popular Quebec expression.

equalization: “Hooray for equalization.  There is $1 billion in

</I></B></P><P align=left>That is so sad.  It is like saying that we in Quebec are 
destined to get the short end of the stick.  That we should be 
happy with the social assistance they give us.  But Ontario will 
get everything that promotes economic growth, job creation and 
wealth. 
But Quebec should be happy with band-aid solutions.  Ontario will 
get economic growth and job creation.  That is the message we 
have just been given. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And they applaud.  The Liberal ministers from Quebec and the 
private members as well, all members of the Liberal Party of 
Canada, have just applauded equalization.  What does that mean? 
It means they have just applauded the fact that there are 
additional equalization payments, when Ontario is enjoying 
wonderful prosperity, at all levels.  We will come to that 
shortly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It means that they are applauding the fact that Ontario's 
economic performance is stronger than Quebec's.  That is what it 
means.  It means that they are applauding the increase in 
Ontario's GDP and the drop in Quebec's.  Honestly! 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where were these federal Liberal ministers and members from 
Quebec when it came time to draw up the budget?  Why were they 
not telling the Minister of Finance that it was perhaps time to 
right the balance with respect to federal spending on goods and 
services in Quebec? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Statistics Canada figures in the Public Accounts of Canada show 
that Quebec loses out on $2 billion annually.  This has long 
been the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where were the federal Liberal party ministers and members from 
Quebec when it came to defending the fact that at least our 
demographic weight could have been taken into account when 
deciding on federal transfer payments for the procurement of 
goods and services in Quebec? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same goes for research and development. 
And regional development, as well, where we have lost close to 
$600 million a year for the last eight years.  Where were these 
defenders of Quebec?  They were asleep at the switch.  That is 
where they were.  They are supposed to be defending Quebec's 
interests.  They have just applauded equalization payments, but 
have done nothing to restore equity in the procurement of goods 
and services, in regional development and in R & D spending in 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what would pave the way for job creation. 
In Quebec, if the per capita criterion—they are good at 
selecting the per capita basis—was applied to federal 
expenditures on goods and services, and investments in research 
and development as well as regional development, if 24% of these 
transfers went to Quebec, instead of the current 13% to 19% 
depending on the item, starting tomorrow, we in Quebec would no 
longer be receiving equalization payments, we would be paying 
for the other provinces. That is what would happen if there were 
any justice in this country. That is the reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And caution must be exercised when talking about the $1 billion 
in equalization. Everything is relative in life. This amount was 
paid to Quebec because it was owed to Quebec. Because, in the 
past three years, a number of parameters in the equalization 
formula had been underestimated. 
A strict, politically unbiased and non partisan application of 
the formula actually sees Quebec receiving an extra $1 billion 
in equalization payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since everything is relative, we are getting $1 billion, but $6 
billion have been cut over the past five years. Over five years, 
the finance minister has taken $6 billion away from us. Now he 
is giving $1 billion back, And we are expected to applaud, 
especially since these are equalization payments? Give me a 
break. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is like having our apartment broken into and $6,000 stolen. 
We catch the thief, who then gives $1,000 back. Should he get a 
hug and thanks? How about a bit of common sense, here? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The final point is the social union. This budget contains a 
number of new initiatives that constitute a direct encroachment 
on a provincial jurisdiction, namely health. 
They are describing these intrusions in terms of the social 
union, the agreement that was signed by all the provinces in 
Canada, except Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his budget speech yesterday, the Minister of Finance 
mentioned that, under the social union, they would create health 
police, a supervisory body to monitor hospital emergencies, 
provincial performance, the number of doctors, general 
practitioners and specialists required.

<A HREF="#LINKT27"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also an incommensurable number of new initiatives that 
are total duplication of what the Government of Quebec is doing. 
We did not agree to the social union, but, as the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs said, we have just had it stuffed down 
our throat.  The government has started the disaster, one of the 
dreaded catastrophes related to the social union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is $1.4 billion in new initiatives.  We did the 
calculations. 
At least $400 million of this is pure loss, as it represents 
administrative costs.  This is $400 million they might as well 
have dumped in the garbage, because it will not help relieve the 
pressure in emergency rooms or help people who are sick and 
waiting for an operation or something else or improve the system 
and the health care networks across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do you know what this $400 million means?  It means we could 
have done extraordinary things for the sick.  Recently, with 
only $20 million, the Quebec minister of health, Ms. Marois, 
managed to set aside $3.2 million in incentives for hospitals to 
manage emergencies more efficiently. 
With this same $20 million, she was able to open 830 additional 
beds, for one month, for those on hospital waiting lists.  And, 
still with this same $20 million, she hired 900 people for one 
month to provide direct health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do you know what Quebec could have done with the $400 million in 
administration costs that is simply being written off, Mr. 
Speaker?  If our share had been based on our population, that 
is, one quarter, if we had been given an additional $100 million 
for health care, do you know what we could have done with it, 
Mr. Speaker, given what Ms. Marois had already accomplished with 
$20 million?  We could have put $12 million into measures to 
reduce crowding in emergency rooms.  We could have opened an 
additional 3,320 beds to help the sick, not federal bureaucrats. 
We could have hired 3,600 health care providers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Minister of Finance had not juggled the surplus figures, 
he could have delivered everything the leader of the Bloc 
Quebecois, myself as party critic and all members of our party 
called for during the Quebec tour and during the finance 
committee's Canada-wide tour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, there could have been substantial tax cuts for middle 
income earners, the very folks who have helped clean up the 
nation's finances.  Second, the provinces could have been given 
the full amount of the cuts, $6 billion, to their transfers for 
health, post-secondary education and social assistance.  There 
could also have been a full review of EI accessibility and 
benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All that could have been done if we had been given the true 
picture. 
But since we were not, everyone remains under the impression 
that we could not afford it. Actually, we could and still can in 
the coming year. It is a matter of political will and a matter 
of transparency as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, I move the following amendment to the amendment: 
<A NAME="LINK148">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That 
the amendment be amended by striking out all the words after the 
words “Budget statement of the government” and by substituting 
the following: 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>“because it does not significantly lower income taxes for middle-class 
persons; maintains the cuts to the Canada Social Transfer 
announced in the 1995 budget; imposes on Quebec the Social Union 
Agreement; penalizes Quebec by unilaterally imposing a new 
transfer formula for health care; makes new encroachments into 
the health care field; and uses money confiscated from unemployed 
persons in order to lower income taxes for more prosperous 
persons.” 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are going to fight this budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> The hon. member for 
Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot had moved an amendment to the amendment. The 
Chair will take it under advisement and get back to the House 
shortly with a ruling. 
<P><A NAME="LINK149"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was somewhat 
surprised to hear the hon. member make unfounded allegations 
which are very far from the truth. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1620"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the benefit of the House and of Quebeckers, I would like to 
point out a few things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, equalization, which was expressly designed to eliminate 
regional disparities, will greatly benefit Quebec. For example, 
over the next five years, Quebec will receive a $1.4 billion 
cheque, which it did not even anticipate. This $1.4 billion 
given by the federal government to Quebec is almost equal to the 
province's annual deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, over the next five years, Quebec will receive 78% or 
$566 million of the $722 million in new funding that comes from 
technical improvements to the program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, when it comes to total transfers, including the Canada 
health and social transfer and the equalization program, the 
figures are impressive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the next 13 months, Quebec will receive $2 billion, that is 
48% of the $4.2 billion allocated to the provinces. It will also 
receive $5.9 billion, or 30% of the $19.6 billion. Finally, 
Quebec will get 29% of all transfers, even though it only 
accounts for 24% of Canada's population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member should congratulate the Liberal members from 
Quebec for their work, along with their colleague, the Minister 
of Finance, and the Government of Canada. He should applaud them 
for their good work and for meeting Quebeckers' needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> Mr. Speaker, if I were a member from Ontario, 
I would applaud.  My colleague is from Ontario, and it is the 
sure winner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But if Quebec costs Canada so much, why are you doing everything 
possible to keep it in this federation?  If it costs too much, 
you could be saving hundreds of millions, maybe billions, from 
what you say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would remind my colleague—we will be more serious—of his 
remarks.  He mentioned 29%. All right, let us say 29% with 
equalization payments, but he is mixing apples and oranges. 
That makes for a real slop.  They do not understand anymore 
either, and that is why they keep running the same tape each 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But let us look at the 29%.  Does the member know how much of 
the cuts the Quebec finance minister has had to cope with in 
five years?  He would not know that.  Ontario is the winner.  It 
is obsessed with the extraordinary gains it has made with this 
budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, however, we have taken 39% of the cuts.  That is not 
bad, when they talk about 29% in equalization payments. Yet we 
always got hit, when the time came to cut, with 39% of the cut. 
However, when it is time to distribute, the percentage drops. 
So, the truth has to come out too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Promoting jobs and economic growth for Ontario is fine. All the 
Ontario members are in favour.  In Quebec, it would be promoted 
too if we did not have doormat members asleep at the switch 
whenever it comes to making a budget that promotes Quebec.  I 
think things would go a little better for Quebeckers and 
especially for Quebec's unemployed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK150"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Angela Vautour (Beauséjour—Petitcodiac, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have a question for my colleague from the Bloc Quebecois, whose 
riding is very close to New Brunswick. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does he agree with me that, in the budget, there is absolutely 
nothing for the unemployed—the finance minister confirmed he 
had used the surplus accumulated on the backs of the unemployed 
to reduce the debt and hand out goodies—nothing for the fishing 
industry, which is in a critical situation, nothing at all for 
small and medium size businesses and zilch for rural 
development? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In regions where unemployment is sky high, like my riding, some 
people stopped receiving EI cheques two weeks ago. The work will 
not resume before June and they have nothing to live on till 
then. People in Albert County collected employment insurance 
benefits for 18 weeks. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1625"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT30"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT30"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1625

<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is all they got. They did not get 19 weeks or 22 weeks, 
just 18, because the Minister of Human Resources Development 
still considers them to be from the Moncton area, in spite of 
the fact that they are an hour away from Moncton by car. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, with this budget, a hockey player earning $1 
million a year will save $8,000 in tax this year. By comparison, 
people who earn $10,000—and there are many in my region who 
earn as little as $10,000 a year—will save $51. And we are 
supposed to be kissing the finance minister's feet for that 
today? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did I miss something in the budget or can my colleague 
corroborate what I just said? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
Beauséjour—Petitcodiac for her question. I also take this 
opportunity to congratulate her for hard work in looking after 
the interests of her constituents, particularly the unemployed 
in her riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member did not miss anything in this budget. This is 
indeed what is happening. There is nothing in it for the 
unemployed, in spite of the fact that only 36% of them qualify 
for EI benefits even though 100% of them contributed to the 
fund. There is nothing for the unemployed in this budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government did not think about seasonal workers. It did not 
think about the so-called spring gap, which is coming soon. It 
did not think about resource regions. Worse still—and I do not 
know if the member noticed it in the budget—the government 
dared to cut $100 million from regional development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This country no longer makes any sense. 
Canadians will have to mobilize against the employment insurance 
program—it does not make sense anymore—against puppet 
ministers who no longer have any powers in this cabinet, to get 
them to listen to reason and to get them to fight for the real 
interests of Quebeckers and Canadians, the real interests of the 
unemployed. I invite my dear colleague to join us. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK151"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
during the member's comments he addressed the issue of the CHST 
adjustments with regard to British Columbia, Alberta and Ontario 
relieving the ceiling on the per capita payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the member whether he has a problem with 
transfers being made to each province on a per capita basis so 
that each and every Canadian gets their fair share.  Is the 
member telling Canadians that equal shares for all is not fair? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a problem with a lot of 
things in this budget.  I have a problem with the fact that the 
employment insurance fund is being used to give the richest 
members of society tax breaks instead of providing relief for 
the unemployed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those earning $250,000 get a $3,800 tax break, while the poorest 
members of our society, middle income earners in particular, who 
are helping the nation put its finances in order, get next to no 
tax relief.  I have a problem with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also have a problem with the fact that the provinces have 
isolated Quebec. 
I have a big problem with the fact that they sold out, Ontario, 
British Columbia and Alberta in particular, and signed the 
social union framework, kowtowing to the Prime Minister and 
agreeing to all sorts of interference in areas of jurisdiction 
recognized as provincial in the Constitution of Canada.  I have 
a big problem with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nor am I too happy about the fact that the Liberal Party members 
and ministers from Quebec did nothing to restore equity in 
transfer payments to Quebec and federal procurement of goods and 
services, or regional development policies, where Quebec has 
come out the loser in the last eight years.  Every year, there 
is a $600 million shortfall, $2 billion in goods and services. 
And it is even worse with respect to research and development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am disgusted with the Liberal members from Quebec for not 
fighting to get Quebec compensated for harmonizing the GST with 
the QST.  We are talking about $2 billion.  They compensated the 
maritimes, with more patronage appointments, as they did 
elsewhere.  Quebec is entitled to $2 billion in compensation for 
harmonizing the GST and the QST several years earlier.  I have a 
problem with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also have a problem with the fact that, just days after a 
first ministers meeting where it was agreed to increase health 
transfers only and to use the time-honoured formula, yesterday 
the funding formula was unilaterally changed to Quebec's 
disadvantage.  I have a problem with that as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does that answer the member's question?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure for me to have the opportunity today to participate in 
the debate on the 1999 budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the government repeated over and over again in the weeks 
leading up to this budget, this was to be the health budget. This 
was to be the health budget.  It was supposed to be the moment 
when the government would provide us with the remedy to the 
health system in crisis, a crisis caused by its policies. But 
perhaps even more important, this was the moment that the 
government was to rise and set out a vision for the future of 
health care in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The best that can be said about the so-called health budget is 
that at least the federal Liberal government finally acknowledged 
that it was its policies that were causing the crisis across this 
country in our health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  It took a while. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough:</B>  It took a while, that is for sure, 
and it took a lot of Canadians suffering and bringing their pain 
to the attention of this government to finally get the Liberals 
to admit that their policies had put our health care system on 
the critical list. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was not always the case.  Four years ago when this 
government began to hack and slash away at health care funding, 
the Prime Minister and the finance minister were busy telling 
Canadians that even with an aging population, even with the 
rapidly changing medical technology, even with the escalation in 
the cost of prescription drugs, somehow we could spend less on 
health care without any real consequences. Regrettably every 
Canadian knows today that there were consequences.  There were 
severe consequences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we have to start repairing the damage done by that hacking 
and slashing by a government with no vision whatsoever for the 
future of our health care system and no regard for the damage 
that it was doing to the health care system of today and 
tomorrow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Liberal government took over $20 billion out of the money 
that it was transferring to the provinces, emergency wards were 
growing more and more crowded.  As the federal share of health 
care funding fell to just 11%, and let us remember that the 
federal share of health care spending was once 50%, and as the 
government dragged it down to 11%, the waiting lists grew longer 
and longer.  More sick patients were sent home from hospital 
before they were ready and without a home care program there to 
look after their needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals began to blame the provinces.  Again this afternoon 
in question period we saw the Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Health blame the provinces for the inadequacy of home 
care. Then of course some of premiers, like Mike Harris, blamed 
the hospitals.  For all I know some of the harried hospital 
administrators in this country tried to blame the patients for 
being sick.  Blame everybody, blame anybody, but do not accept 
the responsibility yourself.  That has been the federal 
government's position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If nothing else can be said about yesterday's budget, this 
government has finally admitted that it has been a major cause of 
the health care crisis across this country today. Canadians have 
been accusing this government of wilful neglect of our health 
care system, of tearing down health care, and yesterday the 
finance minister finally pleaded guilty.  That is the good news 
in this budget and we agree with those who say that is welcome 
news. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I propose that as part of the finance minister's penalty, as 
part of his penance as my clergy colleague would say, the 
Minister of Finance should be required to perform some community 
service. 
Surely that is a reasonable proposition.  Surely he should be 
required to serve some time.  Serve time in an emergency ward. Go 
and help the families and help the staff cope with the 
overcrowded waiting rooms his policies have created.  Surely that 
is a reasonable sentence. For the real test of this so-called 
health budget will take place in the emergency wards, in the 
surgical wards and the chronic care facilities around this 
country.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once the budget day dust settles and Canadians see how health 
funding figures have been inflated and exaggerated by this 
government, they will be looking to see if this health budget 
makes a real difference in the quality of care they and their 
families actually receive from the health care system. I honestly 
hope it will make a difference.  We all hope it will make a 
difference because Canadians really deserve a break after so many 
years of such devastating cuts to our health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I fear that the crisis is not over.  I think most Canadians know 
in their hearts that the health care crisis is not over. The 
Liberal government has let the problems get so bad and it has 
been so slow to respond to that crisis, so slow to offer the 
needed injection of money, that I fear it will be a very long 
time before Canadians will see any really significant improvement 
in the health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals have inflated the appearance of the new money by 
announcing five years of spending in advance. Announcing five 
years of spending at one time seems like a neat trick on the face 
of it, but at the end of the day this budget will only get us 
back to where we were four years ago.  That is with no accounting 
for inflation, no accounting for the continuing escalation in 
drug costs, no accounting for the increased cost of caring for an 
aging population or any of the other additional costs associated 
with new treatments and new medical technologies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians do not want their health care system going backward. 
They do not want us being dragged backward and they do not want 
us just to be stuck in repairing the damage this government has 
caused.  They want some vision for the future.  They want some 
leadership in how we are going to implement a vision for health 
care in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are desperate for some action on home care and 
pharmacare.  They know from experience that the practice of 
medicine is changing and that patients are being sent home from 
hospitals earlier and earlier after surgery and other treatments. 
In theory that is a welcome development.  We all know some 
patients are better off at home earlier if—and it is an if that 
this government seems not to understand or to be willing to take 
any responsibility for—the home supports are in place to ensure 
people are safe and on the road to recovery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now the reality is quite different.  Today and for some 
time to come, and this government has provided no assurance that 
it is not going to continue for a very long time, countless 
numbers of people, mainly women, daughters, mothers and wives, 
are pitching in.  Another layer of responsibility is being added 
to their family responsibilities and to their work lives, to bear 
the burden of providing care in the home for which they are not 
trained and for which the support is not present. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Early hospital release and outpatient treatment also mean—and 
this is sometimes lost and apparently this government does not 
understand—that many more prescription drug costs are passed on 
to the patient and the patient's family.  Before those costs 
would have been covered as part of the hospital stay. 
As a result of rushing patients out of hospital and placing them 
in their own homes, a double burden is being heaped on those 
families because with very few exceptions, the costs of those 
drugs are borne by the out of hospital patients and their 
families.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Developing a health care system where Canadians all across the 
country can count on publicly provided home care and where all 
Canadians have a drug plan must be a top priority for our health 
care system.  The Liberal Party promised home care and 
prescription pharmacare during the last election.  There was no 
talk then about how this is of no concern to the federal 
government.  “This is not our responsibility; it is the 
responsibility exclusively of the provinces” is the explanation 
we heard today when we raised the concerns again about home care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would have thought that in a budget which the government 
itself trumpeted as the health budget, it would have proposed 
some initiatives on home care and pharmacare.  But no, not a hint 
that the federal government will offer any leadership or any 
initiatives in these critical areas.  It is this absence of 
forward looking vision that is the budget's biggest 
disappointment.  If the government is not going to take action on 
home care and on prescription drugs in what the government itself 
calls the health care budget, then when will the government ever 
take action on home care and pharmacare? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second theme of the budget was tax reduction.  At the outset 
the finance minister appeared to strike the right note on tax 
reform.  In his opening statement he said “Most importantly we 
must always be fair.  If at the end of the day the books of the 
country are better and the lives of Canadians are not, we will 
not have succeeded”.  These are fine words and it is a darn 
shame that the finance minister did not act on those words when 
he brought forward his budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For a budget supposedly designed to improve the lives of 
Canadians, the Liberal government gave the biggest breaks of all 
to those with the biggest incomes.  Those are the facts.  That is 
not Liberal spin.  That is not opposition rhetoric.  Those are 
the facts of this budget. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government gave most of the tax breaks to those 
least in need of them. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the elimination of the surtax to those earning over 
$50,000, the budget delivered over $1 billion of the $2.8 billion 
tax package, or 35%, to 17% of the highest earning taxpayers.  I 
guess that is Liberal tax fairness.  What that means is taking 
advice from the Reform Party to our right; what that means in 
terms of fairness is that the millionaire gets a tax break of 
$8,000 while anyone earning less than $50,000 does not get one 
red cent of a tax break in this budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely that $1 billion could have been better and more fairly 
spent on people who desperately need help in this country: the 
one million kids living in poverty who will get no help from this 
budget; the 800,000 unemployed who are no longer eligible to 
receive unemployment insurance because the government has gutted 
the unemployment insurance program; the 1,000 workers at Devco 
who are losing their jobs, their source of income and their 
pension entitlement after 20 or more years on the job 
sacrificing, as we were reminded this weekend by a coal miner's 
wife, their health, their limbs and in too many instances their 
lives; and the hundreds of thousands of homeless people crowding 
the streets and relying on food banks and shelters for 
sustenance.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The child tax benefit was boosted by $300 million in order to 
raise the floor at which the benefit is phased out.  This change 
is to be welcomed, but it will only provide very modest 
additional relief to families with incomes over $26,000 and about 
$184 a year for families between $40,000 and $60,000 with two 
children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The major problem with this measure, with the federal 
government's child tax benefit break, is that it fails to do 
anything for the poorest of poor children, for the poorest of 
poor families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those families on social assistance who have been struggling to 
get into the paid workforce or who are at home raising their 
young children without the benefit of the oft promised child care 
program from the government, another broken promise, will 
continue to go with no benefits whatsoever from the so-called 
child tax benefit extension. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Three years ago the finance minister sold this child benefit as 
the answer to child poverty.  Since the unanimous adoption in 
parliament of former NDP leader Ed Broadbent's motion in 1989 to 
eliminate child poverty in this country by the year 2000, the 
number of poor kids in Canada has actually risen by over 500,000. 
It has not declined but has risen under this government's policy 
by 500,000.  Today one child in five in the country lives in 
poverty.  Over one million of them are in families on social 
assistance.  These children will receive no help whatsoever from 
the budget.  Not a single cent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does the Minister of Finance measure this breach of 
fairness?  How does the finance minister explain this breach of 
fairness?  He has balanced his books but the lives of the most 
destitute of Canadians remain untouched. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister has provided some general assistance to all 
taxpayers by raising the basic personal exemption to $7,131 from 
$6,456.  This gives about $124 more to individuals.  That is 40 
cents a day.  The government likes to point out how many people 
have been taken off the income tax rolls by this measure. However 
they will still be forced to pay the GST.  They receive no break 
there at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our priority would have been to implement a 1% reduction in the 
GST?  In that way all Canadians would have benefited and it would 
not have depended on their earnings level.  That surely would 
have been a fairer way to bring in tax relief and would have been 
a job generator. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most eloquent and most telling part of the budget, however, 
is in its silences.  Health care is not the only emergency we 
face.  Indeed, many cities across the country have officially 
declared homelessness a national emergency.  Not in living memory 
have so many Canadians found themselves living on the street and 
without adequate shelter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They understand that homelessness can be a complex problem 
including poverty, unemployment, mental health, addiction, family 
breakdown and many other problems, but surely complex problems 
require extra effort and special attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government has done exactly the opposite.  Faced 
with this complex problem it has simply walked away from its 
responsibilities.  It is in the process of getting out of any 
responsibility for social housing at a time when its 
participation was never more needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government's approach to homelessness has been to 
simply walk on the other side of the street.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many other evidences of silences in the budget: 
silence on child care, silence on support for parents, silence on 
helping young people finance their education or get the training 
they need, and silence on eliminating wage discrimination and pay 
inequities.  These silences speak volumes about the extent to 
which the government is out of touch with the lives of ordinary 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government were in tune with the lives and the values of 
ordinary Canadians, it would not engage in the endless 
self-congratulations that we have seen in the last 24 hours.  It 
would accept that in a democratic society we have a 
responsibility to provide for the most vulnerable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that the government lacks the sensitivity and the 
humility to acknowledge that it has failed to provide for the 
most vulnerable Canadians.  That is why we on this side of the 
House have our work cut out for us.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
have a comment and then a question.  My first comment has to do 
with the issue of poverty.  The member has raised poverty in this 
speech and other speeches.  I congratulate her for it.  It is an 
important issue.  Also she correctly pointed out that it was a 
complex problem for which there is no simple solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She dealt with issues such as mental health, physical 
disabilities and alcohol and drug abuse addictions.  She also 
mentioned that family breakdown was the single largest 
contributor to not just child poverty but family poverty in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question has to do with health because it was a health budget 
and the member dealt with that.  In view of the fact that 
pursuant to the Canada Health Act transfers from the federal 
government are directed specifically to hospitals and doctors and 
the delivery of services and ancillary areas are clearly and 
constitutionally the responsibility of the provinces, does she 
believe that the federal government, notwithstanding the social 
union accord developed with the agreement of all provinces except 
Quebec, should have unilaterally proceeded with something to do 
with pharmacare and home care and ignored provincial 
jurisdiction? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough:</B>  Mr. Speaker, let me say how much I 
welcome that question.  What I fear is that I will not have 
enough time to deal with the many questions raised.  Let me go 
right to the heart of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I noticed the member did not ask the question about what we 
should have done for poverty.  Let me say what they should not 
have done, and that is ignore it as they did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me go to health care.  He raised the question of whether the 
government should have totally ignored that delivery of health 
services is provincial, acted unilaterally and shown some 
leadership on home care and pharmacare programs.  I have two 
responses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where were those thoughts when the Liberal Party went all over 
the country during the last election campaign specifically 
promising a national program on home care and a national program 
on pharmacare?  The Liberal government acted unilaterally when it 
did that and it continues to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tommy Douglas used to say it was a darn shame that we have only 
put the first two parts of a universal health care system in 
place:  hospital insurance and provision for physician services. 
We have yet to put the third and perhaps the most important part 
of the health care system in place.  That means expanding what 
the federal government now includes in its description of 
universal health care to add to medical services and hospital 
care a range of other services such as home care and pharmacare 
that are desperately needed by Canadians.

that we will not have a universal health care system.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia—Matane, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, first off, 
I wish to congratulate my New Democratic Party colleague for her 
great sensitivity to the less fortunate, particularly children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said last week, everyone agreed back in 1989 that we should 
eliminate child poverty by the year 2000.  Today, the number of 
poor children stands at 1.5 million, a 500,000 increase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What this means is that, since 1993, this government has shown 
no compassion. 
This is terrible, when children do not get enough to eat, when 
they go to school without a lunch, when they do not have proper 
clothes to wear and are made fun of, and at the same time the 
taxes of rich Canadians are going down. I call that a scandal, 
an outright scandal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the members opposite will agree with the NDP leader that 
this is a scorched earth policy, and that is exactly what I 
mean. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask my wonderfully sensitive colleague how we are going to get 
to zero poverty in the near future, if it is possible at all, 
because I am losing hope.  Fortunately, we already have a zero 
deficit. However, we must get to zero poverty in four or five 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Zero poverty should be everyone's goal. 
How can we make them understand?  I do not know if they have it 
in them.  How can we get together and make them understand that 
zero poverty should be everyone's goal? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough:</B> Mr. Speaker, I agree with my colleague's 
comments. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very true we have witnessed under this government an 
increase in the incidence of child poverty that has added 500,000 
more children to the ranks of poverty in the country.  It is a 
disgrace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we challenge the government on its sense of 
priorities.  What does it say about the priorities of the 
government and the finance minister, that they would bring in a 
measure which gives $8,000 extra to every millionaire in the 
country while there is not a single benefit for the one million 
children in the country who do not have enough food to eat?  What 
does it say about the government's priorities? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not that the government does not know what can be done and 
what must be done to address the problem of poverty.  It gutted 
the unemployment insurance system.  Many families are not 
receiving the income replacement for which they have paid 
insurance premiums. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has so slashed federal transfers to provinces 
that the social assistance system is no longer working to keep 
people out of poverty.  One of the things about which I will have 
a lot more to say in the days ahead is that it is absolutely 
clear, as the government congratulates itself on its health 
budget, that it has no intention of increasing transfers for 
education and for social welfare over the next five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With that so clear, so apparent, so transparent in the budget, 
there is every reason to be even more fearful about the lot of 
over one million poor children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, that is why it is time, 10 years later, after 
all-party endorsement of a resolution to eliminate child poverty 
within a decade, for us to rededicate ourselves and make the 
elimination of child poverty the real millennium project for all 
of Canada.

is absolutely right.  It was health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One province has already indicated it will use the money to hire 
more nurses, to reduce waiting lists for cancer and neonatal

Sometimes it catches up to you.  You cannot mortgage your

leaves them with a debt”.  Take his advice. Stop saying spend, 
spend, spend.  We laid out our priorities.  It is a health 
budget.  The member should stand up and applaud. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough:</B>  Mr. Speaker, this is not about

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
Canadians are profoundly disappointed with this government's 
budget.  This was summed up best in today's </I>Globe and Mail<I> 
editorial: “Poor marks for the finance minister's budget”. It 
said that he has left the impression of a man more interested in 
short term political popularity and budget sleight of hand than 
laying the foundations for a stronger economy in the long run”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very important time for our country.  We are entering 
the 21st century, a time of global opportunity.  The decisions 
and choices we make today as a country can either limit or reduce 
the choices we have as Canadians in the next century.  We fear 
that the minister is making the wrong choices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government did not address the fact that Canada 
currently has the highest personal income taxes of any of the G-7 
countries, the highest tax burden of any of the industrialized 
countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government did not address the fact that our 
productivity growth has been the worst in the G-7 over the last 
two decades.  Our incomes, after taxes and inflation, have been 
declining while our neighbours to the south have enjoyed soaring 
incomes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We live in a world with unprecedented change.  Globalization and

</I></B></P><P align=left>Governments will be successful in bringing their countries into 
the new millennium to be full participants in the global economy 
only if they have the vision and leadership to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our party believes in the free market system but we also believe 
that all Canadians deserve an opportunity to participate in that 
economy.  They need access to the levers of the free market 
economy. Without that we will not have the type of society that 
Canadians want, a prosperous society, a society where all 
Canadians have equality of opportunity regardless of where they 
are from in the country, regardless of the income level or the 
socioeconomic status of their parents. We want to see all 
Canadians participate in economic opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government really has no meaningful agenda.  The Prime 
Minister and the Minister of Finance have demonstrated no real 
vision.  This is a government on cruise control.  It is a 
caretakership government, a government without real leadership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was nowhere more evident than during last summer's dollar 
debacle when the debate surrounded the dollar and the dollar went 
to record lows of sub 65 cents.  At that time the Prime Minister 
actually had the economic naivety, I should say audacity perhaps, 
to say it was good for tourism, implying that somehow the lower 
dollar could help the Canadian economy, implying that we can 
devalue our way to prosperity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The logical corollary of his argument would be that if we reduce 
the dollar to zero by high taxes and productivity inhibiting 
policies ultimately we would become the greatest exporting nation 
in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know a country cannot devalue its way to prosperity. To 
achieve success and prosperity in a global environment requires a 
country that values productivity, that values its people and 
their opportunities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of looking into the next century the Liberals are 
focused on the next election.  The finance minister is focused on 
the next leadership campaign.  Canadians deserve better than 
this.  Economic policies are not short term in nature.  They 
require consistency, a long term focus and they require vision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year when the government even had a vague whiff of a 
surplus what did it do with that?  It took $2.5 billion from 
Canadians for the millennium scholarship fund, $2.5 billion out 
of last year's budget, and stocked it away for the future.  It 
took it from Canadians who needed the economic stimulus, who 
needed the investment in the economy last year and said they 
could not have it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is clearly unacceptable.  Not only does it offend the 
auditor general but it offends Canadians and it offends good 
economic policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen the results of five years of this government. 
Those results have been a beleaguered health care system, a 
health care system that is not there when Canadians need it.  The 
tax burden has grown from $112 billion in 1993 to over $150 
billion last year under this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have here is a budget surplus and a leadership deficit. 
Canadians deserve a full opportunity to succeed.  That is the 
least they deserve.  Our leader, the Right Hon. Joe Clark, said 
recently that sound economic and fiscal policies are the bedrock 
of any country that wants to function effectively in the modern 
world and economic growth is the means to achieve all the goals 
we set for our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some dire warnings out there about the Canadian 
economy from organizations like the IMF and the OECD, one of the 
world's greatest economic think tanks on these types of issues. 
The OECD, headed by a former Liberal cabinet minister, warned 
recently that current trends could “lead to a substantial 
decline in Canada's per capita income relative to the OECD 
average”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, Canada is falling behind our trading partners, behind 
other countries, and Canadians will pay the price in the future 
for a government's lack of vision now and the Liberal 
government's lack of courage in tackling the real problems facing 
Canadians and the Canadian economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians and our party understand the importance of fiscal 
responsibility. 
In 1979 Joe Clark introduced the first fiscally responsible 
budget of a generation, which was defeated for purely partisan 
purposes. The last P.C. government reduced the deficit to GDP 
ratio from 9% when it took office to around 5% when it left 
office.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real price to reduce the deficit has been paid by Canadians, 
Canadians who have seen their health care system slashed, 
Canadians who have seen $19 billion taken from their health care 
system, Canadians who have seen taxes rise dramatically from $114 
billion to $151 billion, EI premiums kept at a ridiculously high 
rate and benefits slashed.  Only 30% of applicants or those who 
pay into the system of EI actually qualify when they need it. 
This is clearly unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals have fought the deficit by charging Canadians more 
and giving the provinces and Canadians less.  They also had some 
help.  The </I>Economist<I> said that much of the credit for 
deficit reduction goes to the passage of time and to successful 
reforms implemented by the previous government, including free 
trade, deregulation of financial services, transportation and 
energy and of course the GST that the Liberals used to be opposed 
to but now embrace and which the Prime Minister claims on foreign 
trips to have invented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Good government will require better choices than this government 
is making.  The previous government gave it the opportunities to 
make the right choices, because that government had the vision to 
make the right choices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this budget there is no tax relief for Canadians.  I think it 
is very important that point be made clear.  What we have is a 
fiscal shell game and an illusion that there are tax benefits in 
this budget, but in fact there are not. Cutting taxes and giving 
more money back to Canadians who have borne the brunt of deficit 
reduction is not important to this government.  Government 
members feel they have cut the deficit.  We see them over there 
like trained seals during question period applauding their 
efforts.  They feel they cut the deficit.  Canadians paid the 
price for reducing and eliminating the deficit and Canadians 
deserve a break now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals increased the basic personal exemption a little in 
this budget and they said it will take 200,000 Canadians off the 
tax rolls.  What about the 1.4 million low income Canadians who 
have been dragged kicking and screaming on to the tax rolls by 
this government by refusing to reindex tax brackets? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been a huge tax grab in the EI fund, $19 billion this 
government has taken from workers and employers, workers who need 
that fund during difficult times, seasonal workers.  During a 
transitional period, during a time of immense change, both 
economically driven and technologically driven, there are regions 
of our country where people need help to make that type of 
change.  This government has turned its back on regions of this 
country, including Atlantic Canada.  The message was very clear 
in the last federal election.  I would add that the message will 
be clear in the next federal election as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government is practising a give and take tax policy where 
it will give some tax breaks through the front door but then 
through the refusal to reindex tax brackets will take it through 
the back door. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bracket creep is costing Canadians around $1 billion per year. 
This government has not addressed that issue.  The budget does 
not address the brain drain issue, the fact that the tax 
disparity between Canada and the U.S. remains immense.  In Canada 
one reaches top marginal tax rate at about $65,000.  In the U.S. 
it is around $400,000 Canadian.  In Canada the top marginal tax 
rate, federal and provincial, is about 50%. In the U.S. it is 
about 40%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The members opposite will say yes, but things are better here. 
The fact is things used to be better when we had a decent health 
care system, when we had a health care system people could rely 
on.  But for the difference in take home pay after taxes, 
Canadians are discovering they can buy health care in the U.S. 
when they need it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is no one in the House or at least in our party 
advocates a private health care system, because we believe in a 
single user pay system that works for Canadians and is provided 
by the government.  We believe very strongly in that because all 
Canadians, regardless of income levels, deserve access to a 
quality health care system. 
This government has devastated the health care system and at the 
same time has continually raised taxes, driving some of our best 
and brightest south of the border.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The EI premiums are an extraordinarily regressive tax.  Payroll 
taxes are particularly regressive.  Someone making $39,000 per 
year will pay the same amount of EI premiums as someone making 
$300,000 per year.  This is the government's idea of a fair tax 
policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of corporate taxes, in June the Mintz report was tabled 
to the finance committee.  It pointed out some of the disparities 
between business taxes in Canada and business taxes in the U.S. 
and our other trading partners.  It pointed out that one of the 
biggest impediments we have to economic growth and productivity 
in Canada is our tax system and particularly our business tax or 
corporate tax system. There was not a mention of really 
addressing the fundamental issues of corporate taxation in the 
budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will continue to lose foreign investment to other countries 
because the budget has not addressed the fundamental issues.  In 
time we will continue to see substandard job growth in Canada. 
The government said unemployment has gone down in recent years. 
It has gone down in the U.S. as well.  In the U.S. the 
unemployment rate is at the lowest point in 20 years.  Canada 
maintains an unemployment rate double that of the U.S.  That is 
clearly unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about lower taxes it is very easy to not really 
explain how important it is to the lives of average Canadians. 
We advocate tax reduction for three reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians need a break.  Canadians have seen their disposable 
incomes decline by 9% in recent years.  During the same period 
U.S. disposable incomes increased by 11%.  Canadians need jobs 
and opportunities.  In every jurisdiction high taxes kill jobs. 
In a global environment it is not possible to maintain an 
artificially high tax rate.  We need to ensure that our tax 
system is competitive and thus Canadians can be competitive in 
the global environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Job creation has been led by Ontario and Alberta. Why? The 
governments in Ontario and Alberta have recognized that lower 
taxes create economic opportunity and jobs. By lowering taxes in 
Ontario the Harris government has actually taken in more tax 
revenues.  It is imperative that the government learn from some 
of its more rational provinces in terms of appropriate tax 
systems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What was really cynical in this budget is it mentioned the 
homeless but there was not one single initiative for the 
homeless.  How dare the Minister of Finance mention the homeless 
but not provide one single initiative to help the homeless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget may talk about poverty, and it is a major issue.  One 
in five Canadian children is living in poverty.  We had a debate 
in the House sponsored by our party on the issue of poverty.  Why 
are children living in poverty?  Their parents are living in 
poverty.  We have slashed access to EI benefits for seasonal 
workers in regions like Atlantic Canada without providing 
anything in the wake of those draconian slashes.  We have 
maintained artificially high taxes which have inhibited job 
growth.  More Canadians need jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parents of these children who are living in poverty want to 
work.  They want opportunities to compete and to succeed.  The 
best way to ensure this is to reduce the tax burden on all 
Canadians to create economic growth and opportunity such that 
these people can participate in the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding there are many constituents with families living on 
less than $10,000 per year.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members opposite have dismissed poverty as something that really 
is not there or they have said that we should change the way we 
measure poverty because the way we currently measure living in 
poverty in Canada is statistically incorrect.  I heard a member 
of the Reform Party compare poverty in Canada to third world 
poverty by saying there may be some Canadians who are starving 
but not many. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my Canada and our party's Canada it is unacceptable that any 
Canadian is starving or that any child is living in poverty.  The 
only way we are going to change that is to recognize that we need 
to attach the hands of Canadians to the levers of economic 
growth, get this government of high taxes and high regulation out 
of the way and provide Canadians with the opportunity to compete 
and succeed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was supposed to be the health care budget.  The last budget 
was the education budget.  I forgot that for a moment because the 
results of the last budget, being an education budget, were 
fairly nebulous.  There was a $2.5 billion millennium scholarship 
fund taken out of last year's books.  Of course it will not 
benefit any Canadian until after the year 2000, even then it will 
only benefit only 4% of students seeking higher education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Interestingly enough, the year after the Liberals' education 
budget, 12,000 graduates have declared bankruptcy.  I shudder to 
think what will happen after the health care budget but it cannot 
be any worse than what the Liberals have done before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister expects to be commended for an $11.5 billion 
reinvestment in health care, which will only bring health care 
spending up by the year 2004 to the 1995 level.   That ignores 
the $3 billion yearly growth in the cost of health care due to 
inflation and an aging population.  That would be like thanking 
an arsonist for burning down your house and then rebuilding a 
smaller one on the same site eight years later.  This is 
ludicrous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The way the Liberals are spending on health care, they have cut 
indiscriminately since 1993 and now they are preparing to spend 
indiscriminately.  Nowhere in the budget was there mention of 
engaging the volunteer sector to better maximize the health care 
spending of organizations like the VON which have served 
Canadians well in the past and will continue to do so in the 
future with very little help from this government. What is the 
strategy to address the fundamental issues of pharmacare and home 
care?  What about palliative care with an aging population? Where 
is the strategy for developing a real program working with the 
provinces to provide not just a more expensive health care system 
but a better health care system? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will be addressing issues in the budget debate over the next 
several days.  This budget has clearly not dealt with some of the 
fundamental issues in the Canadian economy and health care 
system.  On the economic front this government has not set firm 
debt reduction targets.  Again the government is ducking the real 
issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the Minister of Finance who recently said the economy 
is clicking on all cylinders that the economy continues to 
sputter for many Canadians and that we want to see the economy 
firing on all cylinders.  The minister talks about the 
government's strong fundamentals.  John Kenneth Galbraith, 
Canadian ex-patriot and economist, once said beware of 
governments that say their fundamentals are strong.  That is very 
appropriate for this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the fundamentals.  We have an unemployment rate 
twice that of the U.S.  We have record high rates of personal 
bankruptcy, a negative savings rate, the highest personal debt 
rates ever. The IMF and the OECD are saying cut taxes. Brain 
drain is taking our best and brightest.  The economy is not 
clicking on all cylinders and we want to see it click on all 
cylinders for all Canadians.

Mr. Speaker, I did not intend to speak but after hearing the 
outrageous comments of my friend from Kings—Hants I felt 
compelled to do so.  Transport is my game but I have a night job, 
trying to look after some of the interests of the government in 
Canada's largest city.  There are 4.6 million people in the 
greater Toronto area.  We are particularly sensitive to the 
plight of the homeless in that city and in other cities across 
the country.  I take umbrage at my friend for saying there is 
nothing in this budget to deal with homelessness. He obviously 
has not read the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe this is the first time there has been a specific 
mention of this plight in any document of a budgetary nature in 
Canadian history.  I think that took great courage on the part of 
the Minister of Finance.  We at the federal level or at any level 
of government do not want to own this issue.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an issue that has to be dealt with by all levels of 
government.  All Canadians have a stake in dealing with the 
plight of the homeless across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me tell the House what this government has done in the past 
to deal with this issue.  We have the youth employment strategy. 
We have the RRAP to fix up residential housing.  We have made 
facilities such as armouries available in Toronto and in other 
cities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this budget $11.5 billion has been allocated for health care. 
Thirty per cent of the homeless on the streets of cities like 
Toronto are people who have mental illnesses and who can be 
institutionalized.  It is up to the provinces.  It is up to 
people like Mike Harris, their soul mate, to say we now have the 
money, the money has come through health from the federal 
government, we can deal with this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One last point is that the Mulroney government put the cap on 
the old Canada assistance plan.  What that meant to the 
wealthiest provinces like Alberta, B.C. and Ontario was that they 
were restricted in the amount of money they spent on social 
services.  We are lifting the cap on the CHST and that means Mike 
Harris and everybody else can now start to treat the homeless as 
a priority, as they should. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the minister for 
his gentle and erudite comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister said the Liberals are sensitive to the issue of the 
homeless, which was similar to their treatment in the budget 
documents.  It was kind of a warm, touchy feely way to mention 
the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the homeless I want to thank the government for 
mentioning the homeless in its budget.  That is cold comfort to 
the homeless.  There is a role for the federal government to work 
with the provinces and to work with the municipalities to develop 
a real strategy to deal with the homeless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I said the government did not address the issue of the 
homelessness and that it only mentioned it in its budget for 
political purposes, I was quoting one of the heads of the 
Federation of Canadian Municipalities who said during an 
interview last night that it was another level of government that 
has to deal on the front lines with the homeless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is similar to the way the government handles a number of 
economic issues or social issues.  It talks about the homeless 
but there is no way that the government provides a program to 
deal with the homeless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It talks about tax cuts as well.  After this budget someone 
making $39,000 per year will pay more taxes due to rising payroll 
taxes.  This is a government that likes to talk the talk but it 
seldom walks the walk on important issues like homelessness.

the Minister of Transport and his Liberal colleagues when it 
comes to homelessness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If John Cleghorn of the Royal Bank makes $2 million to $3 
million he gets a $16,000 tax break.  If Al Flood of the CIBC

tax breaks to the wealthiest Canadians, would that money not have 
gone to better use, for example, to compensate for all hepatitis 
C victims? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I speak not on behalf of or for the member for Saint John, but 
would that money not have gone to better use for our beloved 
merchant marines who have been struggling against this government 
to try to get recognition and compensation for their work? 
Instead this government in this budget turns around and gives the 
wealthiest Canadians tax breaks.  Would he not agree that is a 
shame?

tax there is.  I mentioned earlier that someone making $39,000

making $300,000 per year.  That is fundamentally unfair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would advocate tax reform in Canada that would build a fairer 
tax system.  I would also advocate a flatter tax system.  However 
the most pernicious, offensive and regressive taxes in Canada 
right now are our payroll taxes and EI premiums which are 
excessively high because the government is using them to pad its 
books and make its bottom line look better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to recognize that while the government is in the 
black, Canadians, particularly low income Canadians, are in the 
red.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the member for Kings—Hants used what he thought was a 
clever turn of phrase when he complained about a budget surplus 
and a leadership deficit.  I submit that when that party was in 
power there was a $42 billion budget deficit and a leadership 
surplus that the Canadian public dealt with by firing every 
member of that party but two in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member not agree that when 36 cents of every tax 
dollar collected goes into paying off a $560 billion deficit 
created by that party, it is contributing more to creating 
homelessness because the government of the day did not have the 
money as a result of the overspending of that party when it was 
in power? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for his question.  He has been spending too much time asking 
softball questions of ministers opposite, because that is a 
softball question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that he speaks with some level of authority about 
building deficits.  As a Liberal he understands that fully, 
because under Liberal governments our deficit in Canada grew from 
zero to $38 billion by the time the previous Conservative 
government took office in 1984, which was 9% of our GDP.  The 
Conservative government reduced that from 9% to about 5% of GDP 
by the time it left office.  Not only did it start deficit 
reduction.  It also implemented the policies which made it 
possible for this government to eliminate the deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would love for the hon. member to explain to the House where 
he stood on free trade, where he stood on the GST, and where he 
stood on deregulation of financial services, transportation and 
energy.  Where did he stand on these policies?  He probably did 
not stand anywhere except in opposition to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that he is absolutely right about leadership. 
Leadership is necessary to address issues.  There is no 
leadership in the government to provide visionary policies that 
will ensure the next government, which will be a PC government, 
has the opportunities provided by strong visionary policies by 
the government now. 
<P><A NAME="LINK160"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, after hearing a couple of hours 
of rhetoric I hope to be able to communicate to Canadians what 
was in the budget rather than what most members opposite believe 
in their own minds and use to their own political advantage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday in the House the Minister of Finance delivered his 
sixth budget.  It describes a vision of higher standard of living 
and a better quality of life for all Canadians.  The budget 
articulated a well thought out vision for tomorrow.  It also 
reinforced a plan for today, a plan that will make that vision a 
reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maintaining sound, economic and financial management is 
certainly an essential component of the plan, but restoring order 
to the nation's finances is not, as the Minister of Finance said 
yesterday, an end in itself.  He indicated in his speech 
yesterday that a better standard of living also requires us to 
invest in key priorities such as health care.  It calls for 
continued tax relief.  That is exactly what the 1999 budget 
proposes to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my remarks today I should like to examine the fiscal and 
economic foundation on which we are building this vision. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1735"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT43"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a nation our capacity to strengthen the health care system, 
to provide tax relief and to make other strategic investments 
depends upon the strength of this foundation.  For the second 
consecutive year the government has brought down a budget that is 
balanced or better.  Canada has moved from a deficit of $42 
billion before the government came to office to a $3.5 billion 
surplus last year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the current fiscal year the government will again balance its 
books or better.  It will be the first time since 1951-52 that 
Canada has been deficit free for two consecutive years.  In fact 
by the accounting standards used in most other industrialized 
countries the government will post a financial surplus for the 
third year in 1998-99.  It is this fiscal hat trick that is 
remarkable, not only in Canadian terms but in global terms.  In 
the global arena Canada is the first G-7 country to post three 
consecutive surpluses in this decade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Minister of Finance confirmed in his speech yesterday, 
the government is committed to keeping federal budgets balanced 
or better in both 1999-2000 and the year after that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we came to office Canada had a history of deficit 
financing.  Today deficit financing is history.  As recently as 
the early 1990s Canada's budgetary position was worse than that 
of any other G-7 country.  Now, when making comparisons across 
countries, adjustments must be made for differences in accounting 
practices and in the distribution of responsibilities among the 
various levels of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of these considerations the most appropriate measure is 
the total government budget balance.  On a comparable statistical 
basis our total national accounts based government sector deficit 
reached a high of 8% of GDP in 1992.  It was more than double the 
3.8% G-7 average at the time.  Today our position is better than 
that of any other country in the G-7.  It has improved each and 
every year since 1992. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is our success in balancing the books that makes it possible 
for the government to consider significant investments in 
priority areas.  First, our success in the fight against the 
deficit has made it possible to begin providing broad based tax 
relief for Canadians, both in last year's budget and again in 
this year's budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Next, the fiscal balance in previous budgets has made it 
possible for us to make a significant investment in health care 
in this year's budget.  This investment, which amounts to $11.5 
billion over the next five years, is the largest single new 
investment the government has every made since coming to office 
over five years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1999 budget also includes a $1.4 billion investment aimed at 
strengthening Canada's health care system through additional 
resources for information systems, health research, as well as 
prevention and other health initiatives.  This budget and this 
investment in health care are more than just transfers to 
provinces.  It is all about ensuring that there is 
accountability, ensuring that there is investment in prevention, 
and ensuring that there is research in service delivery.  It is 
all about ensuring that Canadians in every province now have a 
better opportunity of receiving better quality health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, we have proposed investments that will build on the 
Canadian opportunities strategy by advancing Canada's knowledge 
and innovation agenda.  We said from the beginning that the plan 
we laid out in 1994 would be followed.  Again, in this last 
budget we are building on previous budgets and building on the 
Canadian opportunities strategy, a strategy that ensures 
opportunity for individuals to acquire skills that they need in 
order to compete in the upcoming millennium. 
This budget invests and builds on that strategy and advances 
Canada's knowledge and innovation agenda.  That will provide 
direct support for employment, particularly for youth.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even with the important investments announced in this year's 
budget, Canada's program spending as a percentage of GDP is on a 
clear and downward trend. In 1993-94 program spending amounted to 
16.6% of GDP.  For 1998-99 program spending is expected to drop 
to 12.6% of GDP.  By 2000-01 it should fall to 12% of GDP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This will be the lowest level of program spending relative to 
the size of the economy in 50 years, and that is while we are 
continuing to invest in Canadian priorities: health, education, 
providing tax relief and continuing to pay down debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Focusing our spending on key priorities and putting an end to 
decades of deficit financing have allowed the government to make 
significant inroads in its fight against the debt.  Last year 
Canada's debt to GDP ratio saw its largest single yearly decline 
since 1956-57.  It fell from 70.3% to 66.9%.  For the current 
fiscal year it is expected to fall still further to about 65.3%. 
By 2000-01 the debt ratio should come in at just under 62%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Economic growth is not the only cause of this remarkable decline 
in debt relative to the size of the economy.  The government is 
in fact doing what Canadians have asked.  Canadians have asked 
that the government pay down the debt.  The Minister of Finance 
pointed out in his speech yesterday that we are only one of a few 
countries in the world which is actually paying down its debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nonetheless, Canada's debt to GDP ratio is still too high. Among 
our G-7 counterparts only Italy has a higher level of debt in 
relation to the size of the economy.  We are therefore committed 
to keeping this debt to GDP ratio on a permanent downward track. 
To this end the government is following the debt repayment plan 
set out in last year's budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As part of this strategy we will continue to present two year 
fiscal plans.  These plans will be based on prudent planning 
assumptions and will continue to include a contingency reserve, a 
buffer against unexpected financial pressures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current plan contains a contingency reserve of $3 billion 
each and every year.  When it is not needed, as was the case last 
year, it will go directly to paying down the public debt.  This 
is very important.  Only three years ago when the debt to GDP 
ratio was at its peak, 36 cents of every dollar of federal 
revenue went to pay interest on the debt.  Last year with the 
debt ratio dropping, the portion of each revenue dollar needed to 
service the debt fell to 27 cents, which allows the government 
more flexibility and more opportunity to reinvest in Canadian 
priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These numbers tell a powerful story.  They tell a story of a 
nation that is in control of its destiny, a Canada that is 
securing for itself greater economic freedom. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A diminishing debt burden is freeing up resources to strengthen 
health care and access to knowledge, to provide needed tax 
relief, to fight child poverty, to improve the environment and to 
invest more in a productive economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, spending initiatives and tax cuts will be introduced 
only when they are sustainable, when the government is reasonably 
certain that it has the resources to pay for its actions.  We 
will not commit to tax cuts, to spending that we cannot afford. 
We have turned the corner.  The government is committed.  Members 
on this side of the House are committed never ever to go back to 
the reckless spending years of the Tories across the way who 
continued to bury the country with $42 billion of deficit and 
continued to ensure that Canadians did not have the opportunity 
they were looking for.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Prudence is at the heart of this government's approach to 
managing the nation's finances.  And so it should be, for there 
is absolutely nothing to be gained by introducing tax relief if 
it means running the risk of driving the country back into 
deficit. There is nothing to be gained by bringing in new 
spending initiatives one year if the government has to hike taxes 
the following year to pay for something it thought it could 
afford. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that our opposition critics love the government's prudent 
approach. We heard about it this afternoon.  Why do they love it? 
Because the opposition will always be able to complain that we 
are not moving quickly enough to bring down taxes.  We heard it 
from the leader of the Reform Party.  We heard it from the 
Tories.  Or that we are not acting decisively enough to beef up 
spending.  We heard it from the NDP earlier today.  We heard it 
from the Bloc. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does this strategy mean for Canadians?  That is whom this 
government is speaking for.  It is speaking for Canadians and it 
is speaking to Canadians.  For Canadians it means they can always 
have confidence in this government's ability to deliver 
sustainable measures.  It means they can count on us to continue 
to provide tax relief and to continue to invest in key social and 
economic priorities year after year after year and budget after 
budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The continuing improvement in this government's fiscal situation 
is helping to keep interest rates low.  In fact, short term 
interest rates, currently around 4.7%, have returned to the 
levels of early last year before the financial turmoil in Asia 
sent them rising. Long term interest rates are near historical 
low levels.  The level of interest rates is further proof that 
Canada's economic fundamentals are strong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Kings—Hants made reference to how this 
government continues to talk about economic fundamentals.  The 
essential difference in the management of the economy between 
this government and the past administration is that we focus on 
economic fundamentals.  We ensure that the economic fundamentals 
are in place before we embark on any investment and before we 
embark on any tax cuts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reckless spending and promises that do not mean anything to 
Canadians and that cannot be fulfilled do not cut it with 
Canadians any more.  They are looking for sustainability.  They 
are looking for priorities that will be invested in and they are 
looking for leadership.  This government has provided leadership. 
With the help of Canadians it will continue to provide 
leadership as we move into the next millennium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A person does not need to be an economist to understand the 
benefit of low interest rates.  When rates are low, the benefit 
is felt directly by consumers.  It is felt by Canadians.  It is a 
bottom line benefit for anyone who has a mortgage to pay or car 
payments to make.  It is a bottom line benefit for businesses of 
all sizes that borrow money to invest in capital equipment or to 
expand their operations and create jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the Tories ridicule the idea of fundamentals, fundamentals 
provide a climate of low interest rates and low inflation.  They 
provide an environment where businesses can continue to prosper 
and create those jobs Canadians are looking for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking of jobs, one of the most encouraging developments in 
the last couple of years has been a surge in employment. 
Employment jumped by 453,000 jobs in 1998, building on the 
already impressive gain of 368,000 jobs in 1997.  Canada's 
employment performance in 1998 was the best for the decade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Kings—Hants also made reference to the G-7. 
The G-7 said that Canada will outpace the rate of job creation in 
any other G-7 country.  The trend continued in January of this 
year with 87,000 new jobs created. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not the government that creates these jobs.  It is the 
private sector.  This government has been successful in providing 
an environment conducive to job growth.  The private sector 
continues to be profitable. 
When it is profitable and meeting the needs of the global 
economy, the private sector will be hiring Canadians.  We will 
continue to provide that environment.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The unemployment rate today stands at 7.8%.  It is the lowest 
jobless rate this country has seen since 1990. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the most encouraging aspect of Canada's job performance 
is the fact that almost 40% of the new jobs created in the last 
12 months went to Canada's youth.  This represents 202,000 jobs, 
a 10% gain. The yearly employment gain recorded for youth was the 
strongest in over 25 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as the overall prospects for economic growth are 
concerned, yesterday the Minister of Finance emphasized once 
again that Canada has been affected over the past year by the 
financial instability in the global market. We all know what 
happened in Asia.  We all know what is happening in Russia.  We 
know the impact of what may happen in Brazil. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lower world commodity prices were the most significant channel 
through which the Asian crisis dampened economic growth in Canada 
last year.  In a survey conducted at the beginning of this year, 
private sector forecasters indicated that they expected growth in 
Canada to slow to about 2% this year before picking up to 2.5% in 
the year 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even with the lower growth prospects, both the International 
Monetary Fund and the OECD expect Canada to be among the top 
performers in the G-7. These organizations also expect Canada to 
continue to lead the pack in job creation. When the hon. member 
makes reference to the IMF and the OECD, he should make sure that 
he tells the House and Canadians the complete story.  The IMF and 
the OECD are continuing to provide Canada with high marks in job 
creation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1999 budget invests in health care.  It invests in research 
and innovation and other key areas.  The government is continuing 
to provide general tax relief to all Canadians without borrowing 
money to do so. The government's ability to move on these three 
fronts is a result of its firm commitment to good financial 
management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The figures in this year's budget plan make it clear that Canada 
is breaking new ground and putting in place a strong economic 
foundation.  It is the foundation on which we will build a better 
tomorrow, an enduring period of prosperity and an improving 
quality of life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The actions of this budget are mutually reinforcing.  Unlike 
what the parties opposite say, the initiatives we are proposing 
will work together to ensure that this ambitious but realistic 
vision of 21st century Canada will manifest itself not only in 
our finance minister's eloquent words, but also in the day to day 
lives of all Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Bonaventure—Gaspé—Îles-de-la-Madeleine—Pabok, BQ):</B> 
Madam Speaker, listening to the hon. member opposite I had a 
great deal of difficulty restraining myself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot imagine how the Liberal members opposite manage not to 
choke when they speak in a debate like the one on the budget 
tabled yesterday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is as if we were living on two completely different planets. 
I believe the hon. member is from Ontario. Before making those 
kinds of remarks, he should come and travel across Quebec and 
the maritimes. 
Having done that, if he still cannot show more compassion, he 
may at least not get so carried away about how good this budget 
is, as he described it. I noted a few things. I will first make 
a comment and then put a question to the member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member praised the work done by the Minister of 
Finance, saying that the minister was working with standards 
widely used in the G-7. I am not sure how widely used they are in 
the G-7. But one thing is sure: he was unable to tell us if these 
standards were widely recognized here, in Canada, by Canadians, 
so that comparisons could be made.

<A HREF="#LINKT47"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Neither could the hon. member bring himself to admit that the 
finance minister had his wrists slapped by the auditor general 
precisely because this is not a transparent approach allowing 
figures to be compared from one year to the next. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, to find out what the actual breakdown by province is 
today, one has to request from senior Canadian officials special 
tables, which show in black and white what the Government of 
Quebec told us, and that is that the province is getting no more 
than $150 million for health care. That is my first point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, he said that the Liberal government's priority for 
health care would be to make people more accountable and to make 
the management of the health care system more transparent. They 
dare brag that they will establish audit systems to ensure that 
care is actually provided. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe I am in the Parliament of Canada, which has the role 
of protecting the Canadian Constitution, although some would say 
it is not my job.  The Constitution, which parliament must 
honour, must recognize at least that health care is under 
provincial jurisdiction.  Let them not boast to Canadians 
watching us that they will establish accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another odd thing in the speech by the previous member is that 
the Liberals are accusing the Conservatives of increasing the 
country's debt. 
The Conservatives were in office only two terms. What the 
members opposite forget to say is that the deficits started 
under Pierre Elliott Trudeau.  I would remind the member that we 
were not in a recession at that point.  People who want to 
provide a lesson should reread their history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government says that Canadians can now trust it and 
it will not spend foolishly, or something like that.  Can we 
trust those opposite? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They got elected in 1993 and said they would scrap the GST. 
From 1993 to 1999, that is six years.  This is the sixth budget 
brought down by the current government.  It had the opportunity 
to eliminate the GST, but not a word was said on that in last 
night's budget.  Should we trust the federal government? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give another example of what happens when the Liberals 
say we should trust them. Following the 1995 referendum in Quebec, 
they supported a motion in this House recognizing Quebec's 
unique character. This implied that if Quebec wants to do things 
differently, it should have the right to opt out of programs. 
But what did the government do at the first opportunity, when it 
started making a surplus, last year? It created the millennium 
scholarships, which was yet another intrusion into areas of 
provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals could have eliminated that program in yesterday's 
budget. They did not. This is another example of an unkept 
promise. And they are asking us to trust them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a question for the hon. member. I do not see many members 
from the maritimes here today, but they could put that question 
to him. Health and education are areas of provincial 
jurisdiction. Fisheries, as far as catches are concerned, is a 
federal jurisdiction. 
What is there in the finance minister's budget for fishers, who 
will lose everything in May of this year? This is a federal 
jurisdiction. The federal government could not care less.

<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Bernier:</B> Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I 
wonder if my comments were misinterpreted, because the member 
referred to them as rhetoric of rubbish. Yet, I did not use any 
vulgar expression and I would appreciate it if the member 
opposite could choose his words more carefully. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I would ask the hon. 
member to choose his words carefully. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri:</B>  Absolutely, Madam Speaker.  What I said 
was that it was rhetoric of rubbish.  I do not know if that is 
vulgar or not.  It is not, as far as I was concerned. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Bernier:</B> Madam Speaker, I once again rise on a point of 
order. In dealing with certain issues, I mentioned historical 
facts. I did not used bad words. And if this how he sees it, 
then the answer— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  This is not a point of 
order, this is a point of debate. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri:</B>  Madam Speaker, the two areas that I will 
address, because the member was up for quite a bit of time, are 
with respect to the G-7.  He made reference to the accounting 
practices of the G-7.  G-7 countries make use of what is called 
the financial requirements way of doing their books. We actually 
use the national accounts system which is a bit more stringent. 
In fact, if we moved to the way the G-7 looks at countries and 
the way they do books, our numbers as a country would look much 
better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the health care issue, the member was taking 
exception to my comments about making the health care system 
perhaps a bit more transparent.  What I was really making 
reference to was when a physician perhaps in Quebec or a 
physician in the maritimes or a physician out west may make an 
advance or a discovery in terms of service delivery, there is no 
system in place right now throughout the country where there is 
an exchange of this type of information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When there is an exchange of this type of information we end up 
with a better quality of health care.  I am not sure that the 
hon. member really would want to say he does not want to have 
Quebecers receive a better quality system of health care.  That 
is the whole intent of the health care budget, that whether one 
lives in Quebec, out east or out west, one has an ability to 
receive quality health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question that the delivery of health care is a 
provincial jurisdiction and that there is no intent by the 
federal government to invade provincial jurisdiction, because I 
know that is a big problem for the members opposite.  What this 
health budget does is transfers $11.5 billion to provinces in 
order to deal with health care. But it also provides opportunity 
and framework for provinces and health care providers to 
communicate with each other so that they can provide greater 
efficiency in the health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what it is all about.  It is about Canadians regardless 
of what province they live in. Canadians want better service and 
this budget will help governments deliver it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK162"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, it 
is a pleasure as the chief finance critic of the official 
opposition to respond to the federal budget today, introduced by 
the finance minister yesterday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must say at the outset that the budget read more like a fairy 
tale than an honest accounting of the government's financial 
position.  I want to explain what I mean by simply pointing out 
one thing.  As I went through the budget documents yesterday I 
found it absolutely amazing that nowhere in those documents was I 
able to find the number that told us how much the government was 
prepared to spend this year; $104.5 billion was the number. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we need a much larger debate in this place about how we 
report on the government's financial position.  Sadly I think the 
government has taken to using the budget as a propaganda tool 
instead of an accounting of the government's financial position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition has many particular concerns with this 
budget but these can be summarized simply by saying this budget 
will mean that Canadians will pay much more in taxes and receive 
far less in health care. Pay more and get less.  Members may have 
heard that theme but we will continue to say it because it is 
absolutely true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the House to consider this.  In 1999 the average Canadian 
taxpayer will pay over $2,000 more in taxes than they paid in 
1993.  It is logical to expect that if we pay $2,000 more in 
taxes per taxpayer we would get more services. 
While that is logical, it is absolutely not the case under this 
government. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1805"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT49"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1999 the government will spend $450 less in health care per 
taxpayer than last year.  Put another way, the total cuts to 
health care this government has delivered over the last three 
years per taxpayer amount to about $1,500 per person. This is 
coming from a government that claims to be so caring about health 
care, a government that claims that health care is part of our 
national fabric.  I do not believe the government even believes 
its own rhetoric anymore. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us examine how this whole thing happened.  The government 
argues that it had to keep raising taxes and slashing health care 
in order to eliminate the deficit.  I will argue the government 
did not eliminate the deficit at all.  All it did was transfer it 
on to the backs of taxpayers.  It transferred a big chunk of it 
to taxpayers in the form of $2,000 a year more in taxes every 
year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see the hon. member from London is speaking in House.  This is 
great to see because as far as I know he has never delivered a 
speech in this House before.  It is good to hear him at least 
heckling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other chunk of the deficit was transferred to people who 
needed health care.  This came in the form of a $1,500 per 
taxpayer reduction, as I pointed out a minute ago.  I do not 
think that is the proper approach that this government should 
take if it truly cares about the citizens of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the alternative?  I think the government had some 
alternatives and did not follow them.  In the first place, going 
back to 1993 when this government took power, it should have 
acted a lot faster.  It waited a full 18 months before it brought 
in a substantive budget of any kind.  When one is carrying a debt 
of over $500 billion, time literally is money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did this government act right away to save money for Canadians? 
No.  It took its merry time.  In the meantime, it cost Canadians 
literally thousands of dollars per taxpayer in the form of higher 
taxes and thousands of dollars per health care patient in the 
form of less services for health.  The government really should 
have acted faster. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Secondly, the government should not have cut our most important 
services while maintaining our least important services.  As 
Goethe once said, those things that matter most should never be 
at the mercy of those things that matter least.  However, this 
government does not seem to understand that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consider that while it cut $20 billion out of health care over 
the last several years it did not touch a lot of the wasteful 
spending.  It cut the things that make us healthier, smarter and 
more productive but did not at all touch many of the things that 
many Canadians consider to be extraordinarily wasteful.  I want 
to talk about some of those things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Name them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  I am happy to do that. Let us talk 
about the $4 billion in pork barrel regional development grants 
spent over the last four years.  My friend across the way, the 
hon. Minister of Transport, will know that some of that money was 
even spent in the Prime Minister's riding, given to a business 
associate of his under circumstances which people could only 
describe as very suspicious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about regional development.  Let us talk about the 
millions upon millions of dollars— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David M. Collenette:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a 
point of order.  We cannot sit here and listen to the hon. member 
directly cast aspersions on the Prime Minister and his 
constituency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I will ask the hon. 
member to choose his words more carefully, please. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  Madam Speaker, unfortunately we all 
face the consequences of our actions, and that includes the Prime 
Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are millions of other dollars wasted every year in 
regional development.  I am glad that my colleague, the Minister 
of Transport, helped me make that point. Over the last several 
years we spent $3.2 billion running a television network in 
Canada at the same time as we were cutting billions of dollars 
out of health care. I think that is completely inappropriate.  It 
shows that the government's priorities are totally mixed up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the last few years we have spent over $4 billion in 
redundant bureaucracy in the Department of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friends across the way know that the auditor general 
routinely chastized the government for its bungling of the 
Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development.  The 
department recently spent $91 million to negotiate treaties and 
not a single treaty was actually negotiated.  This was brought to 
the attention of the government by the auditor general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were many things that the government spent money on that 
it did not need to and that it should not have spent money on. At 
the same time it was cutting the heart out of health care.  I 
point out that the Canadian Taxpayers Federation routinely 
uncovers hundreds of millions of dollars in wasteful spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was not very long ago that Walter Robinson, president of the 
federation, a position held by my colleague, the member for 
Calgary Southeast, held a press conference and unveiled access to 
information documents showing the federal government routinely 
makes loans of hundreds of millions of dollars to some of 
Canada's most profitable and most successful corporations and 
then fails to collect on the loans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend across the way says it is not true but he cannot 
provide a shred of evidence that it is not true.  Instead of 
providing that money to health care we see it go to companies 
that are making literally hundreds of millions of dollars in 
profits.  That is a complete mix-up in terms of priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How easy for the Liberals to spend other people's money so 
unwisely.  Even more aggravating is the fact that the voices of 
business, the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, 
Catherine Swift, Garth White, the Chamber of Commerce, the 
Business Council on National Issues, routinely plead with the 
government to quit subsidizing business.  There is not a year 
that goes by when the finance committee does not have those 
groups come before us and say please quit distorting the 
marketplace.  Quit taking money from successful businesses, 
giving it to the government, letting it take a share, passing it 
on to other unsuccessful businesses so that they can be 
subsidized and then turn around and compete against these 
successful businesses.  That makes absolutely no sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is so much wasteful low priority spending in the 
federal government why is the federal government cutting high 
priority things like funding for health care, education and RCMP 
services?  Why is the federal government producing dumb blond 
joke books, giving grants to incredibly profitable businesses and 
building bureaucracies when sick people are forced to sleep in 
wheelchairs and in linen closets in Canada's hospitals?  I argue 
that this government truly is the government that put the hell 
into health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look beyond the bafflegab in yesterday's speech from the 
finance minister, three things become very clear.  The first 
thing is that the government wants us to think that after being 
world champion tax hikers it is now serious about reducing taxes. 
The second is that after savaging health care it wants us to 
believe that it really did not mean it and that taking a dollar 
out and putting 50 cents back in will fix the problems in health 
care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third thing that becomes abundantly clear is that the most 
important thing to the Liberal government is not health care, it 
is not reducing taxes, it is making government bigger. It wants 
to take more of our money and more our options so it can tell us 
how to live our lives.  If members doubt for a moment what I am 
saying, look at the budget documents from yesterday where the 
government announced $30 billion in new spending.  Where did that 
money go?  Only about $11.5 billion went toward health care 
initiatives.  Only $7.7 went to tax decreases.  The remainder 
went to all kinds of other new spending, non-priority spending. 
This government has a huge spending problem.  I fear that it has 
returned to its old free spending ways, its big government 
Liberal ways.  Canadians know that is precisely how we got into 
the situation we are in now, $580 billion in debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me explain why we must have substantive tax relief, why 
making health care healthy requires more than just cash and why 
big government liberalism hurts the poor and the sick and those 
without skills while sucking away our prosperity and our spirit 
of innovation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me talk specifically about why we need tax relief.  I want 
to lay out four different arguments for why Canada needs tax 
relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first point I want to make is that it is the taxpayers' 
turn. It was taxpayers who balanced this budget.  We have had at 
least, to be generous, 38 tax increases since this government 
came to power.  We are now in the 35th year of having increasing 
taxes in Canada.  We have not had a tax break in Canada in 35 
years. We have surtaxes that were added specifically to eliminate 
the deficit.  Well the deficit is still gone but the 5% surtax is 
still there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The machinery of government was preserved through all of this, 
but the taxpayer was hung out to dry, absolutely hung out to dry. 
We saw government bureaucracies in some cases not only not 
shrink but actually get bigger. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first big reason we need to give Canadians some tax relief 
is simply because it is their turn.  Everybody else has benefited 
in the past with what the government has done, but not the 
taxpayers. Taxpayers are the ones who have been the long 
suffering, very patient heroes in this whole mess. They are the 
ones who bailed this government out.  It is time that taxpayers 
got their share. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second point I want to make is that the economy needs a tax 
cut right now.  I heard the parliamentary secretary talking a few 
minutes ago about what is going on around the world and about 
Brazil, Japan and Russia.  We are all very aware of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also know that we had a crisis this summer when the dollar 
hit new lows which was in part because Canada's tax regime was 
completely bloated.  We could not compete with a tax regime that 
had Canadians paying some of the highest personal income taxes in 
the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard the member for Waterloo—Wellington give a member's 
statement about how he was so proud that the dollar had now 
recovered up to 67 cents.  I have never seen anyone so inspired 
by mediocrity in my life.  This government seems to think that a 
67 cent dollar is just fine.  I can guarantee to members across 
the way that the Reform Party does not agree with them. We think 
the dollar is a barometer of the health of the economy.  We will 
not accept a 67 cent dollar.  We will do things to ensure that 
Canada's dollar strengthens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First on the list is to start to cut taxes. I do not agree at 
all with my friend across the way who says that now is not the 
time to cut taxes substantially.  We disagree with that.  We say 
let us cut taxes substantially.  If we do that, the next time 
there is a crisis in the world, money will come to Canada instead 
of fleeing Canada like it routinely does under this Liberal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third reason we need to cut taxes immediately is to stem the 
brain drain.  We see a massive brain drain from the member from 
London.  We see it right now. There are four reasons people are 
leaving Canada in droves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first is that young people get their university educations 
in Canada, subsidized, and then they leave to go to the United 
States.  The reason they go is that there are more jobs in the 
United States, 4.3% unemployment, than in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second point is that the United States pays better.  The 
jobs pay more because there is more of a demand for good 
employees down there.  Jobs end up paying more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third point is that they get to keep more of what they earn 
because their taxes are much lower.  The industry department 
itself pointed out just the other day that in Canada Canadians 
are paying far higher taxes and their incomes are far lower than 
those in the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's own industry department has chastised the 
government saying it is time to get our taxes in line with the 
United States.  The Reform Party agrees completely. We point out 
that if we did cut taxes our revenues would go up just as they 
went up in Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fourth reason people do better when they go to the United 
States is that the U.S. dollar buys more.  We have a 67 cent 
dollar in Canada, the northern peso.  I am embarrassed of our 
dollar.  I think it is ridiculous that my friend from London 
thinks it is so wonderful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  I am not from London. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  Well, from Mars or wherever he is 
from.  He is certainly not from this planet.

<A HREF="#LINKT52"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend across the way is heckling but never have I seen him 
speak in the House on a bill.  I suggest to him that he should 
have the courage of his convictions and rise to his feet and 
debate this budget instead of heckling and spouting inanities 
from the other side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fourth reason we need to cut taxes in Canada is simply 
because we have to put some chains on government.  I fear very 
much that government in Canada is starting to grow again.  I am 
concerned that we will see a return to the old-style liberalism 
where government starts to interfere more and more in people's 
lives.  It already interferes substantially in people's lives and 
many Canadians today resent it greatly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we see after yesterday's budget is a huge increase overall 
in spending.  We saw the government go $7.6 billion over budget 
in this year's spending.  It is proposing to go somewhere in the 
range of $30 billion, I would say over budget, over the next 
three years, at least if this year's budget numbers are used as a 
standard for the next three years.  That is crazy.  We are in a 
situation where we have had exactly two surpluses to date. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time that we put a rein on government, that we put some 
limits on government so that those surpluses can accumulate for 
the benefit of Canadians, so that they can go back to people in 
the form of lower taxes, so that we can pay down the debt, not so 
that we can build up more government programs.  We do not need 
that. That is extraordinarily dangerous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government continues to tax away $11 billion a year from 
people who make less than $30,000.  That is absolutely 
irresponsible.  We are punishing people at the low end of the 
income scale. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The best way to chain a meddling and clumsy government is to 
quit giving it so much in taxes.  I argue it is time to start 
cutting taxes in a substantive way. My party has come up with a 
program that would give Canadians $26 billion in tax relief over 
the next three years, pay down $17 billion in debt, put $6 
billion into health care and also start a debate with the 
provinces and the public on how we can fix health care in Canada 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I argue it is time to take a new approach.  The only think that 
stands in our way is the 157 Liberals across the way, including 
the member for Haliburton—Victoria. I did not know where he was 
from because he never stands up and speaks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage people across the country, if they are tired of high 
taxes and slashed health care, help us throw the Liberals out 
because it is time for Canada to have a new fresh approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Since 
there are quite a few members who want to ask questions of the 
hon. member for Medicine Hat, I would suggest two minutes per 
question. 
<P><A NAME="LINK163"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cannis (Scarborough Centre, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I was quite surprised when the member for Medicine Hat 
stated only about $11.5 billion and the rest are unaccountable 
for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He touched upon an issue that is so important to all of us, and 
I know it is important to them as well, which is the investment 
in our future, our youth, our future scientists, researchers and 
what have you.  He failed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member not agree that the $240 million to support 
development of the Canadian institutes for health research will 
help the future scientists and researchers stay in Canada?  Does 
he not understand that the $200 million to the Canada Foundation 
for Innovation is a worthwhile investment?  Does he not 
understand that the money going to support our soldiers is a 
worthwhile investment?  Does he not understand that $190 million 
to better meet the health needs of the first nations and Inuit 
communities is a good investment? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on and on but time is short.  That is where the rest 
of the money is going. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  Madam Speaker, I am glad the hon. 
member recognizes that people are fleeing Canada in droves and 
the government in its feeble way is trying to staunch the flow. I 
would simply point out that many of those people who are leaving 
are being scared away.  They are being punished by high taxes in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We argue that the government should introduce sweeping tax 
relief.  We argue that we should attract investment here for the 
high tech and biotech industries by cutting the capital gains 
inclusion rate in half.

<A HREF="#LINKT53"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many Canadians in those fields argue that we are on the right 
track. I point out that people from Nesbitt Burns, the Canadian 
Federation of Independent Business and the Chamber of Commerce 
chastised the government in the strongest possible language for 
its performance in the budget this time around. These are people 
who have a vested interest in ensuring that our high tech 
industry is well looked after.  They think that what the 
government did was extraordinarily feeble. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would encourage the member to revisit the budget and consider 
that there is a much better approach and we offered it just a 
minute ago. 
<P><A NAME="LINK164"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
the member mentioned the importance of our high tech industries. 
Earlier in his speech he was critical of the government with 
regard to the technology partnerships.  The government is in 
partnership with a large number of companies to support our high 
tech industries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member also repeated an allegation from the Canadian 
Taxpayers Federation that these refundable loans were not being 
paid back. The fact is that the Canadian Taxpayers Federation 
included in its calculations amounts of loans which were not 
currently repayable under the terms of the agreements. All of 
those loans are being serviced in accordance with the agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the member ignorant of the facts or is he just trying to 
mislead the House? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  Madam Speaker, there is a lot of 
ignorance on the other side.  I think that is a fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend is ignorant if he does not understand that when 
billions of dollars go to high tech companies, it means that 
billions of dollars do not go into health care and they do not go 
into giving low income Canadians tax relief. I think my friend 
across the way is ignorant if he does not understand that 
Canadians know much better how to use that money.  He is ignorant 
if he does not understand that the money will be better spent by 
investors if it is turned back to them in the form of lower 
taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge my friend to become more knowledgeable.  Ignorance does 
not wear well on him. 
<P><A NAME="LINK165"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, the party opposite is always fond of supporting family 
values. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member overlooked in his speech that portion of the budget 
which dealt with the tax breaks to low and middle income 
families.  I refer him to page 130 of the budget plan. A one 
earner family of four earning $30,000 is going to get $353 more 
in tax relief as a result of the budget. Similarly, a family of 
four earning $50,000 is going to get tax relief of $373 with this 
budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member should acknowledge that we are doing something very 
positive for the nuclear family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  Madam Speaker, how sad that my friend 
is perpetrating the shell game. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is going to raise payroll taxes through the 
Canada pension plan by $7.2 billion over the next three years; it 
is going to raise through bracket creep another $2.7 billion, 
$9.9 billion.  The government is offering $7.7 billion in tax 
relief.  In the end, Canadians are worse off by $2 billion. If 
they are worse off by $2 billion, I ask my friend from Hamilton 
how does that leave Canadians better off?  If they are paying 
more money out of their pockets, how are Canadians better off? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> It being 6.30 p.m., pursuant

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.)</B> moved: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House take note of possible Canadian peacekeeping 
activities in Kosovo and the possible changes in peacekeeping 
activities in the Central African Republic. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Madam Speaker, at the outset let me gain the agreement 
of the Chair for a division of time between me and the Minister 
of National Defence.  We will use the opportunity if we may. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me say that tonight we have the opportunity in this forum to 
discuss the situation in two troubled spots on two different 
continents, Kosovo and the Central African Republic, and to 
discuss Canada's contribution in resolving the conflicts faced by 
these regions and the people in these regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a demonstration of the range and the extent of Canada's 
worldwide interest and the responsibilities that the 
international community expects Canada to undertake on behalf of 
the large question of ensuring peace and security in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will recall that last October the House took note of and 
supported the need for the international community to support and 
prevent an impending human disaster in Kosovo.  Fortunately the 
disaster by the actions of the international community was 
averted.  The underlying issues, however, were not resolved.  We 
were simply put in a position where an agreement was made, but 
the parties to that agreement were not prepared to fulfil their 
commitments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore once again the international community has been called 
upon to take action when the breakdown of responsibility in 
Kosovo was so apparent to many of us in terms of the human 
tragedy that was occurring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important, however, to recognize that in the course of 
that we learned a very fundamental lesson.  The willingness to 
take action, the fact that NATO and Canada as a member of NATO 
were prepared to be part of the preparation to take strong, 
effective action, did bring the parties to the table. Once again 
the capacity and the capability of a group of international 
players of which Canada is a part were put forward and brought 
about the new negotiation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of Kosovo we are in the situation now where an 
ultimatum has been given to the parties.  Either they come to an 
agreement to withdraw their troops, to arrive at a settlement 
that will allow for free elections in an open democracy, that 
will provide for police and security forces which reflect the 
population and that they will respect human and civil rights, or 
once again we will be called upon to take action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am here in an optimistic mood in the sense that the 
negotiations in Ramvouillet are continuing.  No one can foresee 
the outcome, but it is important to recognize that if an 
agreement is made, if the parties can come to an agreement based 
upon the principles which were put forward by the top contact 
group, by the NATO council and by the United Nations Security 
Council, then there will be a call upon resources of a 
peacekeeping nature; a responsibility to make sure the agreement 
is enforced; and a robust intervention which will ensure, as we 
did in Bosnia, that the breakdowns, the transgressions and the 
violation that have been so much part of the story of that region 
will be intercepted by an effective international presence in 
Kosovo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of National Defence and I cannot be in the House 
tonight to tell members exactly how many or where or what.  The 
minister of defence will do his best to outline what the nature 
of the rules of engagement would be and the responsibilities. 
However, it is important for us to be able to indicate to the 
international community that we are prepared to participate and 
that we are prepared to make a commitment in this very serious 
and very important condition in the international community at 
this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also important to note that the commitment is not simply 
just for peacekeeping troops.  That will be a very important 
commitment, but accompanying that commitment is also a 
peacebuilding responsibility.  There is no point just simply 
sending in a group of good soldiers to separate the combatants, 
if we are not also prepared to invest in helping to put in place 
the building blocks of a resolution to start helping to develop a 
society in which elections can be held and in which the 
communities can begin to develop some degree of responsibility 
for their own government in which human rights are respected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to notify the House and have it acknowledge that 
this is simply not a peacekeeping initiative.  It would also 
require participation through the OSCE and other bodies of a 
responsibility to help ensure fair and free elections, to help in 
a commitment to develop a civil society, to help in the 
resettlement of refugees of which there are close to 300,000 in 
that country right now, and to help with the basic humanitarian 
requirements.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to note that we already have 40 Canadians in 
Kosovo as part of the verification mission and that CIDA has 
already contributed several millions of dollars to humanitarian 
aid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want it to be clearly understood by the House the reason for 
having this debate.  If an agreement is reached and Canada 
participates we will have more than just troops, as crucial a 
role as they may play.  There will also be the civil 
peacebuilding role that will have to accompany it at the same 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would make the case that it is the kind of contribution 
Canadians would want us to make.  It is an investment worth 
making because to help ensure stability, to help protect the 
security of helpless civilians who have been harassed and 
violated and transgressed against, is part of what Canadians can 
make as a worthwhile, serious contribution to world peace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third element which is also important is that as the 
president of the security council this month we will also be in a 
position to ensure that the United Nations Security Council is 
fully engaged on this matter.  In the last rounds of negotiation 
the council did endorse the peace proposal that came out of the 
meetings of the NATO council.  Canada played a role in ensuring 
that part of the responsibility of the council was met. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would also clearly like to see, if there is a decision or an 
agreement this weekend to go ahead with the development of an 
international presence in Kosovo, that the security council 
endorse such a movement and that there be a full and open 
exchange at the council to assert its responsibility under 
chapter 6 of the charter to exercise that particular role.  Those 
are the kinds of conditions we have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The importance of having the debate now is clear.  Next week the 
House will be in recess.  We will not have the opportunity to 
debate.  If there is an agreement this weekend, which I am sure 
we all heartily hope there will be, then it will be necessary for 
us at least to have this initial debate so that when the 
government decides what course to take, what role we could play, 
we will have had the full opportunity to hear from members of 
parliament from all regions what they think the best judgment 
should be of Canadians on this very crucial issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to speak for a moment as well about peacekeeping in 
the Central African Republic, the other theme of the motion.  As 
the House knows, this is not a new initiative for Canada.  We 
have already been in the Central African Republic, but let us 
just stop for a moment and look to see what is happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot give a full discourse, but throughout central Africa 
and west Africa we are seeing a continuing situation of breakdown 
of governments.  We are seeing the rising emergence of the 
warlords.  We are seeing the interventions of those people who 
prey and profit off conflict by selling goods, by selling arms. 
We are seeing the incredible tragedy of young children being used 
as human shields.  We are seeing the case of young children being 
recruited into armies.  We are seeing the attempt in that area of 
societies that are trying to redevelop out of extreme poverty, 
being faced with, as someone said, the most effective weapon 
today: a young male under 15 with an AK-47.  That is the 
situation we are now facing around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year we were asked by the secretary general to offer 
support for a peacekeeping mission in the Central African 
Republic in order to provide needed communications in both 
languages.  That was a prerequisite for other African members of 
that peacekeeping mission to be able to mount their 
effectiveness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That comes up for renewal.  That is one of our responsibilities. 
We would also like to invite members of parliament to indicate 
their support for a continuation if the United Nations Security 
Council decides to go ahead with the MINURCA-UN project of 
peacekeeping in the Central African Republic.  We believe that 
Canada should continue to play an effective and useful role as 
part of a partnership with other African states in the 
peacekeeping matters there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly, again, we need to have and would like to have the views 
and positions of members of parliament from all regions so that 
we can take that decision based upon the best judgment possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I spoke in the House in October about the role of the 
international community in preventing humanitarian crises, I said 
that we need to act even in imperfect circumstances because all 
that is required for evil to triumph is a good do-nothing.  The 
same formula applies.  It is not perfect.  There are difficulties 
ahead with some risk attached, but if we stand back and do not 
play our role then evil will triumph and that is not the Canadian 
way.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, 
Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, today we are taking note of possible 
peacekeeping activities in Kosovo and in the Central African 
Republic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Foreign Affairs has just explained to the House 
the context for Canadian participation in an extension of the 
commitment to the Central African Republic and our potential 
contribution to a NATO led peace monitoring force in Kosovo.  I 
am in complete agreement with the arguments that he gives for 
Canadian participation in both. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to focus on the operational aspects of these 
missions.  They will have an important bearing of course on any 
government decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me first deal with the Central African Republic where the 
situation is stable but tension remains.  The Canadian forces 
currently have 47 personnel deployed in the Central African 
Republic, including four staff officers attached to a 
multinational force headquarters, a national logistics and 
command element, and a signals unit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian contingent provides the communications backbone for 
this multinational force which is known as MINURCA.  This force 
would not have achieved its past success without Canada's 
important contribution in communications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While MINURCA's extended mandate would remain essentially the 
same, as would the communications role, the number of personnel 
involved would remain the same with one possible exception.  We 
may be asked to augment our current contribution during the 
presidential election period which is expected this fall.  These 
troops would enhance the force's communication capability during 
the elections.  This was already done last fall during 
parliamentary elections.  It involves only the deployment of 
another 16 members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can assure the House that a continuing contribution of this 
scope is sustainable, particularly over the initial six month 
period that the Secretary General of the United Nations is 
recommending.  After a 10 month period we would have to assess 
our ability to continue to support MINURCA.  However, given that 
the UN intends to end the mandate 60 days after the fall election 
is announced, we do not see any problem with respect to 
sustainability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because we are serving as MINURCA's communications backbone, the 
withdrawal of our troops we feel would seriously compromise that 
entire operation.  Nonetheless, there are some operational 
considerations that must be satisfied before the government can 
agree to extend Canadian participation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The French intention to withdraw from the force at the end of 
the current mandate raises several important issues.  Canada must 
be satisfied that the alternative UN plans to cover logistics, 
medical and security arrangements will be adequate.  We are 
working with our MINURCA colleagues to resolve these matters, 
including assurances that a plan and the capability exist to 
withdraw our troops should the local situation come to pose 
serious dangers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can assure all hon. members that the government will not put 
the Canadian forces at an unacceptable risk in this or any other 
operation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All in all we believe the prospects for this mission are 
promising.  So long as the outstanding operational questions can 
be resolved, I believe the House should fully endorse our 
continued participation in this mission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Turning to Kosovo, in Kosovo we face a different kind of 
military commitment with different operational considerations. 
Its deployment would first and foremost require a diplomatic 
agreement and a permissive environment for operations.  The 
ultimate size and shape of this NATO led force will depend on the 
role it is assigned and the specific conditions governing its 
operations.  This of course depends on the outcome of the 
negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nonetheless, we can expect that the key elements of the mission 
would be to deter new conflict in Kosovo, to monitor the 
compliance of the parties with the interim agreement and, if 
necessary, to enforce compliance with that agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The force would also likely be charged with broad support for 
the implementation of the civil aspects of the interim agreement, 
including support to other organizations involved in humanitarian 
assistance.  Support of demining efforts would also be an 
important task for the force.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where do our friends stand?  All of Canada's key allies have 
announced that they will participate.  The U.K. and France will 
lead with a troop contribution of approximately 8,000 and 5,000, 
respectively.  The U.S., Germany and Italy plan to contribute 
approximately 4,000, 3,000 and 2,500 troops, respectively.  Other 
non-NATO countries are expected to contribute as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an impressive display of international resolve and a 
significant moment for NATO.  On this, the eve of the 50th 
anniversary of the alliance it has demonstrated its continued 
relevance and ability to act as a force for peace and stability. 
Canada has always championed collective action.  That makes an 
important contribution to international stability. It is 
inconceivable for me that under these circumstances Canada would 
choose not to stand shoulder to shoulder with our allies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian forces are in a position to make a meaningful 
contribution to this mission.  The appropriate composition of our 
contingent as in the case of the entire NATO led force must await 
the outcome of the diplomatic process.  However, I can say that 
we are in a position to consider making available certain 
elements of our land forces, possibly supported by helicopters. 
As members of the House are aware, we have six CF-18s stationed 
in Aviano, Italy.  These aircraft would support the NATO 
monitoring force as well.  As we discussed last fall, they are 
also there in case any air action is taken with respect to Kosovo 
should the negotiations break down in Rambouillet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Aside from being appropriate to the tasks the NATO force would 
perform, our contribution must be sustainable.  It is clear that 
any operation in Kosovo would need to be mounted for some time, 
probably at least three years.  A sustainable Canadian 
contribution must take into account the current and future 
commitments of the Canadian forces.  On the domestic side we must 
be in a position to respond to the potential Y2K disruptions.  We 
hope they will not take place but we must be prepared. On the 
international side we are already busy.  The Canadian forces are 
currently deployed in 18 missions around the globe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this range of commitments our potential contribution has 
limits.  I can inform the House that while the file number will 
depend on the nature of the agreement that will be reached in 
Rambouillet, France, we could make a sustainable contribution in 
Kosovo in the order of 500 to 800 troops. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can assure the House that a Canadian contribution would be 
structured to respect our long established practice of only 
deploying militarily viable units under Canadian national 
command.  I can also assure hon. members that a Canadian 
contribution would respect our equally longstanding principle of 
deploying Canadian personnel only within acceptable levels of 
risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The creation of a powerful NATO force is the appropriate answer 
to the concerns about risk.  Canadians can be confident that a 
military operation with our closest allies will be successful. 
The NATO force will be robust and very able to provide for its 
own protection.  The Canadian forces are ready to participate. 
They would join a Kosovo bound force with a wealth of experience 
in Bosnia behind them.  If they go to Kosovo let this House and 
all Canadians give them the support and gratitude they deserve.

have a question to either the hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs or 
the Minister of National Defence.  In his mention of the Central 
African Republic, the hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs also 
mentioned west Africa.  Does that include Sierra Leone?  Could 
someone elaborate more specifically on what our troops would be 
doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recall seeing videotapes and hearing reports of various 
peacekeeping missions where it seemed the people being sent over 
were pretty helpless in preventing certain things from happening. 
They had guns pointed at their heads and they were in situations 
where they saw people being slaughtered but they were unable to 
actually intervene because of the nature of the peacekeeping 
mission, so to speak.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Will our troops be able to protect themselves and to intercede 
in situations where it appears that human life may be in danger? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  The question is for 
the hon. Minister of National Defence.  Is there unanimous 
consent that either one of the ministers may answer? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy:</B>  Madam Speaker, in answer to the 
first question, in my opening remarks I wanted to draw the 
attention of the House that within Africa there are number of 
major trouble spots. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been able in the Central Africa Republic to effectively 
participate in a peacekeeping mission that has stabilized one of 
the areas.  In the case of Sierra Leone the tragedy is ongoing. 
In the west African nations there is the peacekeeping force, 
ECOMOG force.   We have already made $1 million contribution to 
support that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now as president of the council of the United Nations we 
are sponsoring a major discussion about what to do in Sierra 
Leone.  What we are talking about is a specific mission in the 
Central Africa Republic of the nature described by the Minister 
of National Defence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should be aware of the fact that as these things unfold there 
will be a continuing necessity for the House and the government 
to look at how we can help in Africa to build up a higher 
level of stability and to support many of our partners in Africa 
that are taking on the responsibility of peacekeeping. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I realize that the 
questions from the member were for two different ministers.  It 
is unusual to do that but with the consent of the House the 
Minister of National Defence could answer also.  Is it agreed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>   Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton:</B>  Madam Speaker, the second 
question was what would the troops be doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has not yet been worked out.  We are in the throes of 
seeing that done.  There is a NATO meeting of military personnel 
tomorrow in Brussels who will finalize the preliminary plan.  I 
say preliminary plan because until the parties in Rambouillet 
agree on a formula for allowing ground troops to go in in a 
peacekeeping role, we cannot finalize what the exact roles will 
be.  In turn we cannot finalize what the roles for Canadians 
would be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When that is done we would then get two weeks notice to give a 
formal response agreeing to NATO's request which would be issued 
sometime after the agreement is reached.  Then there would be 60 
days to actually put them in the field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He mentioned the difficulties we are experiencing in Bosnia by 
the UN troops.  That is one of the reasons they went to NATO 
troops.  NATO troops operate under a different set of rules of 
engagement and are able to overcome those kinds of difficulties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of Kosovo we are again looking at a NATO led 
operation that would be quite successful in being able to keep 
the hostilities from happening again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  The time for 
questions and comments has expired.  If the ministers were to 
agree and with the consent of the House we could add another 10 
minutes to this period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it agreed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK170"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Price (Compton—Stanstead, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
my question is to the minister of defence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week with the joint committee of foreign affairs and 
defence regarding Kosovo, we heard that we have roughly 2,000 
troops out now.  We talked about the possibility of 1,000 other 
troops.  The minister mentioned this evening that it might be up 
around 800.  We were told that a 1,000 troops would be really 
stretching things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are we going to do in terms of any emergency that comes up? 
The minister is stating that we are not looking at a short term. 
Three years is not what I call a short term in this kind of 
mission, especially with the kind of back-up that is required. 
We still have Bosnia ongoing and our 2,000 other troops out there 
who need to be supported.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am wondering what we do in the case of an emergency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton:</B>  Madam Speaker, we have outlined 
in the policy framework for defence, the 1994 white paper, 
exactly what our contingency levels of commitment are in terms of 
NATO, the UN and NORAD.  We will continue to meet those. Those 
are always taken into consideration when we decide to deploy 
people overseas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We currently have about 2,000 on 18 missions although 
three-quarters of that number are on two missions, the largest 
number being 1,300 in Bosnia and the second largest being 185 in 
the Golan Heights where we also at the moment have the commanding 
officer position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can manage this at a 500 to 800 level.  Quite right, we would 
be stretching it at the 1,000 level, particularly in terms of 
sustainability, but that is why we have recommended the 500 to 
800 level.  I know that is somewhat of a spread but as NATO firms 
up what its needs will be, and as the agreement is reached 
hopefully in Rambouillet, then we will be able to pin down more 
precisely the exact number.

<P><A NAME="LINK171"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois—Salaberry, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
tomorrow's edition, </I>Le Monde<I> quotes President Milosevic, who 
says this on the subject of the potential deployment of an 
international force of 30,000 in Kosovo: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our negative attitude to the presence of foreign troops in 
Kosovo is not just that of the Yugoslav government, it is also 
that of the people of our country, and the unanimous attitude of 
the representatives of the people in the Serbian Assembly, 
independent of their political leanings. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the words of President Milosevic.  In the light of 
this attitude, it is highly likely that the troops to be 
deployed will not be doing peacekeeping, but rather carrying out 
air strikes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know from the Minister of National Defence what 
the situation is in his opinion, in the light of the statement 
by President Milosevic, and whether the Canadian contingent 
would be different depending on whether the mission is one of 
more peaceful deployment or has the mandate to carry out air 
strikes in Yugoslavia? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy:</B>  Madam Speaker, I should first point 
out that under no circumstances are we talking about a force that 
would be going in as an active intervention.  What we are 
discussing in the House is a peacekeeping mission that would be 
required to fulfill an agreement that was arrived at by both 
sides. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members know, in any negotiations various bargaining 
statements are made by both sides in order to up the ante and to 
gain leverage.  It is somewhat encouraging that the Russian 
foreign minister, Mr. Ivanov, whom I spoke to directly a few days 
ago, is undertaking a very specific mission to try to convince 
the Serbs that it would be in their best interests to reach an 
agreement.  The alternative is frankly what we discussed in the 
opening statement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We still have in place the activation orders of NATO that could 
be used in the way of air strikes.  But that is the only form of 
NATO action being contemplated of a non-peacekeeping nature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to assure the House and the hon. member that what we are 
talking about here is purely peacekeeping activities of ground 
forces that would be required under an agreement if it is arrived 
at this weekend. 
<P><A NAME="LINK172"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I have listened fairly closely to the minister of defence. There 
seems to be a misconception, and I ask for clarification, that 
this is not a NATO participation role in Kosovo.  Is that 
correct?  In other words, it is a UN peacekeeping mission.

<A HREF="#LINKT60"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton:</B>  It is NATO led. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger:</B>  If it is a NATO led force my 
understanding is it will be interventionist.  They will go in and 
make peace.  That is also some of the discussion that has gone on 
in spite of the statement of the Minister of Foreign Affairs.  If 
we are not going in as peacemakers but as peacekeepers is it 
under the UN banner?  I do not think that is very clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What kind of equipment will they have?  The equipment they have 
right now in any hostilities would not be adequate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton:</B>  Madam Speaker, as the Minister 
of Foreign Affairs clearly stated, we are not going in there 
under some war like conditions if we go in there with ground 
troops. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would be going in under similar conditions as in Bosnia to 
enforce an agreement and ensure peace.  That is the basis on 
which troops would be deployed.  They would be deployed on a NATO 
led basis.  The UN security council would be asked to endorse, 
and certainly every indication is that it would want to endorse, 
any agreement that is reached between the parties because the UN 
has quite clearly said that it wants the killing to stop.  It 
wants the parties to come to an agreement.  If they do come to an 
agreement it would be a NATO led force but it would not be just 
NATO that would be there.  We would expect and hope the Russians 
would be there and other non-NATO countries, just as we have 
currently in Bosnia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the hon. member looks at the situation in Bosnia in terms of 
the division of different forces under a NATO led banner he would 
see a similar situation that would happen in this case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the equipment, we are going to send our people in 
with the best equipment.  We bought some new armed personnel 
carriers.  We have in terms of our reconnaissance vehicle the 
Coyote, one of the best found anywhere in the world. We have been 
getting new clothing and many new aspects of equipment and kit 
for our troops and we would send them in there with the best 
equipment so that they could do their job.  They will do a very 
effective job as they have done in many cases before. 
<P><A NAME="LINK173"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, there are 
a number of issues I would like to deal with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first one is central Africa.  We have a briefing set for 
central Africa tomorrow.  Of course the debate is tonight but 
that is probably not a problem to the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I contacted foreign affairs yesterday, five times today, and at 
6.53 this evening I got my briefing sheet on the Central African 
Republic.  I think that probably tells us the level of importance 
of what we are doing here tonight when this kind of blatant abuse 
goes on in parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To deal with this situation first, the government did not have 
the briefing and therefore I felt it was essential that somebody 
at least try to find out a bit of what our mission is all about. 
This is a rather unstable former French colony of 3.3 million 
people.  It has had a very fragile France sponsored democracy 
since 1993.  Basically the French government has propped up 
various dictators and regimes from about 1979. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a 1,400 man French force that was withdrawn on April 
15 of last year and replaced by 1,350 international francophone 
peacekeepers, of whom Canada had 45.

<A HREF="#LINKT61"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today the number of Canadians there is 47 and basically they are 
attempting to maintain stability.  When we look at the stability 
that is being created this is the sort of thing we have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>President Patasse has faced three armed rebellions 
since May 1996 and really could not have remained in power 
without these foreign troops, the French and 47 Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mutinies are motivated by unpaid wages, ethnic hatred of the 
president and the story goes on.  Human rights records are that 
there are routine summary executions, torture, restrictions on 
basic freedoms, looting by the peacekeepers, mistreatment of 
women and of a whole race of pygmies in the area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With no information from foreign affairs or DND we are here to 
endorse the keeping of Canadian troops there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are only 47 but those are 47 Canadian lives we are saying 
we should leave there or extend there, whatever.  But we do not 
live in a dictatorship.  We live in a democracy where we need the 
information.  Canadians need the information.  We should be 
talking about this and it should not be a partisan issue.  We are 
talking about Canadian lives, men and women, our armed forces. 
That is the kind of disrespect the government shows for those 
fighting people of our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is much more that we can talk about with Kosovo because 
all of us have watched CNN, we have read the news and we have 
been part of this debate for a long time.  It was back in about 
1990 that everybody felt Kosovo would be the part of Yugoslavia 
to break away first.  It has always had a problem and that goes 
back maybe 1,500 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can also be fairly certain as Canadians that a decision has 
already been made as to what we will do.  On January 29 when the 
Prime Minister committed Canadian forces he did not do that 
by accident.  That decision had already been made.  The 
defence minister of course immediately questioned it.  The 
general questioned it.  He said we really could not do that. 
Our critic from Calgary North questioned it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly we said we should be debating it.  In the February 16 
</I>Toronto Star<I> the defence minister also said maybe we will 
have to skip a debate in the House and go on with that. On 
February 16 when asked that question in the House, it was rather 
interesting to see the House leader jump up and answer the 
question.  He said dare you ask that question because at the 
House leaders meeting today we are going to be discussing that 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How am I supposed to know what will be discussed at the House 
leaders meeting after question period?  Our House leader 
certainly did not know what the agenda would be and I am not even 
sure what that answer was all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The decision has already been made.  The government does not 
care much about this.  It wants this for bragging rights, to say 
the issue was brought here to be debated by parliamentarians so 
that parliamentarians had a say in what would happen.  Of course 
that justifies anything that happens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are men's and women's lives we are talking about.  We 
should not be talking about politics.  It should be non-partisan. 
We should be talking about whether we should participate, what we 
are participating in, how much it will cost, what our role will 
be and who will command those troops.  All those are the kinds of 
questions that should be dealt with here tonight but which I 
doubt will even be mentioned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How could we do it better?  This will now be the sixth time I 
believe we have had a take note debate since I have been here. 
The proposal I will put forward again will be very simple. 
The way to really accomplish all we want to accomplish is to have 
a committee of the whole with 301 MPs who should be responsible. 
They should be in the House listening to this because it is men 
and women from their ridings who could conceivably lose their 
lives.  We should be here to give support to those troops who do 
such a heck of a fine job.  I will always remember meeting those 
troops in Yugoslavia and thinking wow, these people are 
Canadians.  I was proud of the flag and proud of seeing them 
there.  They need to know we are 100% behind them.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What should we do?  We should have the experts come in and tell 
301 members of parliament the exact and complete information. 
Then what we should do is have two or however many party members 
from each party and extra ones from the government present the 
party position. Then we should have a free vote.  We should be 
voting on this item because it is the lives of our men and women. 
That is what is really important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know why the government does not like that idea.  We 
would inform members of parliament, we would inform Canadians and 
we would then have an intelligent presentation and a free vote. 
The government would not fall if it was the decision of 301 
members to not go to a country.  Maybe we should not be going to 
the Central African Republic or staying there.  Maybe we cannot 
be the 911 number for all peacekeeping missions.  Those are the 
kinds of things this House should decide and the onus should be 
on us to decide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us get to the committing of troops to this imaginary UN or 
maybe NATO force that we might send.  Should we commit them? 
Obviously all of us have seen the newsreels.  We have seen the 40 
people from a village brutally killed and mutilated and tortured. 
All of us are sickened by that. They are unforgettable sights. 
All Canadians are hurt by those.  All Canadians say we should be 
involved in trying to stop those. That is not the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a lot deeper than that.  We have to understand the 
cultural nature of these conflicts.  We have to understand the 
propaganda involved.  We have to understand the interrelationship 
of history, religion and the conflict going on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we would all say those tragedies have to stop. We all 
abhor them.  We cannot stand them and we want to do something.  I 
think the question that comes down is what should we do.  As 
Canadians I am not sure that it is fair or that it helps us to 
send troops, to send planes, to send whatever it takes unless 
they are equipped and unless they can do the very best possible 
job they are required to do.  I am not saying they would not try. 
The problem is that we handicap them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again I go back to Bosnia when I saw those Canadian vehicles 
with patches, part paint jobs, 35 years old, belching diesel fuel 
and then I saw some of the other countries' equipment, silent and 
fast moving.  I thought our guys and girls are there trying to do 
the job for us.  But we are handicapping them.  We have to be 
hurting them and their pride just because of what we do.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to take that into consideration.  We cannot simply go 
everywhere.  Many of our veterans are particularly touched by 
this issue as well.  During the world wars we were right there. 
We were part of the decision making.  We were leading in a lot of 
situations.  There was a huge amount of pride.  We had a huge 
role in many of those conflicts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was a Canadian prime minister who started peacekeeping back 
in the Suez Canal days.  There was pride.  There was pride when 
we went to Cyprus.  I believe we have hurt that pride.  We have 
done in this country something to lessen our position.  By 
sending off troops and again asking them to do something, we do 
not really know what, we are doing nothing to help enhance that 
pride. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot help but remind the House about 1996 and the Zaire 
mission.  The Prime Minister and his wife were sitting around 
watching television.  They saw a terrible massacre on CNN and 
said “We should call Raymond and tell him to do something about 
this”.  They called Raymond down in Washington and Raymond went 
flying over and said “Yes, we will be the saviours; we will be 
the white knights”.  The only problem was that nobody else 
followed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We started moving troops there.  We did not know what they would 
do.  It was probably one of the biggest military-foreign affairs 
embarrassments we had ever had.  A week later it was all 
cancelled, and we said we had to watch the Prime Minister 
watching television. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have to ask about our UN Security Council position.  I 
am glad we are there.  I hope we can make a difference.  We must 
remember that we held it in 1948-49, 1958-59, 1967-68, 1977-78, 
1989-90 and 1999-2000.  We have had it every 10 years for the 
last six decades.  That is what we would expect.  We are along 
with Gabon, Namibia, Slovenia and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should not brag too much about that.  We should do something. 
Instead of just talking we should do something.  As far as soft 
power is concerned, as long as there are no bad guys left in the 
world it might work, but flower power will only go so far. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are lots of bad guys out there:  the North Koreas, the 
Kadaffes, the Saddam Husseins and the Angolas.  The minister is 
very proud of our record in Angola where we have spent $2.3 
billion on UN peacekeeping.  We are about to reduce the 1,000 
peacekeepers down to 100 and basically leave in disgrace.  The 
British ambassador says that the crises in Sudan, Angola, 
Somalia, Sierra Leone, Eritrea and so on demonstrate that the UN 
is powerless to cope with crises as they arise.  While we brag a 
lot, maybe we should ask what we are to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of questions need to be asked about Kosovo.  Who will make 
the decisions on what happens there?  Who is in the contact 
group?  Will we have any say as to what happens to our 500 to 800 
troops?  What are the NATO objectives?  Do we agree that there 
should be a referendum in Kosovo in three years and a vote 
possibly to separate?  Do we agree with those kinds of politics? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What will we bomb if we bomb something?  What sort of long term 
plans do we have?  Will we just be a police force with a big 
stick?  The minute we leave will it go back into crisis again? 
Or, will we really try to accomplish something?  What about the 
expansion of this conflict? What are the chances of it spreading 
to Albania, Macedonia, Montenegro and so on?  Has anybody thought 
about that?  What happens when we put this force in Kosovo?  Will 
it spread out?

refugees.  Who will take care of that problem?  Who will work on 
that?  What kind of plans are there?  We are being asked to 
provide troops.  Will we also provide infrastructure?  What are 
we being asked?  Are we being asked for a blank cheque, or what 
exactly is it that the government wants? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These questions have not been answered.  We are not equipped to 
handle it.  We will not have any control over our troops. As I 
say, it is a blank cheque.  We are showing no leadership.  We are 
showing no new spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Basically I am embarrassed when NATO calls upon us that we are 
not prepared to deliver.  It is embarrassing for us as 
parliamentarians.  It is embarrassing for our troops.  How can we 
support a full mission?  We want to support it.  Obviously we owe 
that to NATO.  I think we have tied our hands behind our backs. 
Governments for the past 30 years have made it very difficult for 
us to support something like this.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Julian Reed (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I remind the House that 
this debate is not about whether we bomb anybody.  It is not 
about whether we send troops into a conflagration.  It is a 
debate about peacekeeping forces and whether they should go into 
the Central African Republic and into Kosovo.  It has nothing to 
do with bombing.  It has nothing to do with striking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to cut through all the convoluted rhetoric I have 
heard across the House and ask the hon. member for Red Deer 
whether or not he wants to send troops.  Yes or no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the obvious answer is that we 
are talking about going into a very difficult area, into a war 
zone.  Obviously I am saying we are not equipped to send troops 
and therefore we cannot send troops. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can provide some support, but we basically cannot get into 
this without knowing more details about our ability to deliver. 
We just do not know any answers.  The government has not given us 
anything.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois—Salaberry, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
the same question as the parliamentary secretary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have also heard a lot of rhetoric.  I heard someone whose 
position was not very clear.  The government's position is that 
we should offer to take part in these peacekeeping missions, if 
peacekeeping is what is involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party critic is not acting as a responsible member of 
the official opposition should.  I think the Bloc Quebecois was 
a much more responsible official opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an important question:  Should Canada participate or not 
in a peacekeeping force to Kosovo and the Central African 
Republic?  I repeat the question: What does the Reform Party 
member think?  I would like him to give a clear answer. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we have responsibilities as a 
member of NATO.  We cannot live up to the full responsibilities 
in NATO because the government has undermined our military for 30 
years.  That is why we cannot live up to what we would want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we had the best, if we were able to deliver on what they are 
asking, yes, we are for that.  Because of what the government has 
done, we have to take a lesser role.  That lesser role means we 
cannot send troops into combat in these areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not now how else to say that more clearly to you except to 
answer in that way.  We should not send troops into a combat 
zone. Show us all the answers to these questions and then we will 
say what kind of support we can give. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Before we get into

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Julian Reed:</B>  Mr. Speaker, if the hon. member's 
recollection is right, it was 29 years since the government was 
accused of neglecting the armed forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had a debate a year ago in committee on the Central African 
Republic and the provision of peacekeepers.  Surprisingly the 
Reform Party agreed.  There was no dissension. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we have quite a different 
situation.  There was no information provided, as much as we 
tried.  I got the information I just presented. I trust that it 
is true.  If it is true, we are in a total different situation 
than we were then.  Obviously our 47 people are in jeopardy, if 
the information I related to the House is true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it is not true information, I would certainly stand 
corrected.  It certainly is not because we got any help from the 
government in finding out what the truth really was. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK176"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
put the following question to my colleague. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does he not think that the situation in Kosovo is a lot like the 
one in Sarajevo?  And Canada took part in the events in 
Bosnia-Hercegovina. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party was in favour then.  In this case, it is not 
Canada that has taken the peacekeeping initiative.  It is an 
initiative by allies who have talked and decided to contribute 
what they can to ensure stability in the Balkans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Reform Party agreed back then, what does it think is so 
different this time around that it raises considerations of 
available equipment and troop numbers?  That is not the 
question.  The question is whether or not Canada agrees to 
participate, as its allies are doing, in a peacekeeping 
operation, subject obviously to the resources and equipment now 
available to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the real question.  It is no different than 
Bosnia-Hercegovina and the Reform Party supported that. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills:</B>  Mr. Speaker, basically the government 
wants the best of both worlds.  It wants to continue to cut the 
forces, not provide any money for new equipment and not provide a 
better standard of living for the troops.  The government wants 
to go everywhere, to be everywhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We deplore what is happening in Kosovo.  As a NATO ally we 
should be equipped to go there and do our part.  The problem is 
because of government negligence we are not able to do our job. 
That is the bottom line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do we want to go?  Do we support going?  Yes, but not the way we 
are and the way we are equipped today.  We are asking our men and 
women to go into an impossible situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  For the benefit of 
members in the House who may not have been here earlier and for 
the television audience across the country, I will make a 
statement now which reflects on issues that occurred earlier 
tonight in the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the standing orders for this debate, the rules were that 
there would be no requests for unanimous consent and no dilatory 
motions.  One was entertained, so for the purposes of ensuring 
that this is not precedential in nature and so there will no 
confusion in future dates, I will read it into the record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Chair reminds the House that the special order under which 
this debate is being conducted states clearly that the Chair may 
receive no requests for unanimous consent to waive rules.  The 
Chair has wanted to accommodate the will of the House and of the 
sponsoring ministers in permitting a period of joint questions 
and comments after the ministers had spoken.  However, the Chair 
would be remiss if I did not point out that this is not to be 
considered a precedent in the remainder of this debate tonight or 
indeed on future occasions governed by similar special orders.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois—Salaberry, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak on behalf of the Bloc Quebecois and to tell you 
that I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for 
Joliette. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I want to stress the importance of such a debate. The 
Bloc Quebecois has always supported such debates, because it is 
important for Parliament to discuss peacekeeping or 
peace-building missions before we send troops to implement 
decisions made by a regional or universal international 
organization such as the United Nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I basically agree with the Reform Party, which proposed ways to 
make parliamentary debates more meaningful and influential 
because, as you can see, there are just a few of us here in the 
House. The ministers have left and a meaningful debate should 
take place under circumstances and according to procedures that 
would promote greater participation from parliamentarians. In 
that sense, it is unfortunate that the motion recently moved by 
the hon. member for Red Deer was defeated after a vote in the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that lack of preparation is certainly one the main 
problems with this kind of parliamentary debate, as exemplified 
by the preparatory briefings held last week on the issue of 
Kosovo; briefings on the Central African Republic were scheduled 
for tomorrow, but they will be pointless because the debate will 
have taken place the evening before in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That having been said, we have a decision to make on whether or 
not to dispatch Canadian troops to Kosovo if a peace agreement 
were to be signed in the next few days in Rambouillet as well as 
on renewing the MINURCA mandate in the Central African Republic. 
Unlike the Reform Party, the Bloc Quebecois will be clear: we 
are in favour of sending a Canadian contingent, should a 
peacekeeping mission in Kosovo be decided on, and in favour of 
renewing the mandate of the mission set up by the United Nations 
in the Central African Republic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not to say that we have no concerns. With respect to 
Kosovo, I would like to share two concerns of ours, which 
deserve consideration by this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, regarding the nature of the mission to be deployed in 
Kosovo, what we are expected to be debating this evening is 
obviously the dispatch of a peacekeeping mission. But it is far 
from certain that this is the kind of mission that will be 
contemplated in the next few days, since, as we know full well 
today, negotiations in Rambouillet are stalled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>President Milosevic has issued a statement indicating that he 
did not want any multinational force in Kosovo. 
In this case, unless the President of Yugoslavia changes his 
position—the Minister of External Affairs suggested a few 
moments ago that it could be a bargaining position—the mission 
in which Canada must take part may very well not be a mission to 
maintain a negotiated peace, but rather a mission to force the 
Yugoslav government to accept a negotiated peace, which would 
most likely involve the use of armed force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such debate is not taking place but it should because, should 
Canada be called upon to take part not in a peacekeeping mission 
but in a mission involving air strikes, Parliament should have 
an opportunity to debate the issue. 
This debate should not be restricted in such a way as to prevent 
us from authorizing the government to take part in a mission of 
a totally different nature. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1935"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT68"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT68"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1935

<A HREF="#LINKT67"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is one concern that had to be voiced by the Bloc Quebecois. 
Another concern is the way in which this peacekeeping mission, 
if such is the case, will be set up and whether or not it will 
be authorized by the United Nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On several occasions, I have expressed in this House our party's 
concern that such a mission should be authorized by the United 
Nations. Obviously, the Security Council does not seem in a 
position to authorize such a mission since any country that has 
the right of veto can exercise that right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consequently, Canada, and the Minister of Foreign Affairs, who 
himself could chair the Security Council, must still make sure 
that this question is put to the Council and eventually the 
General Assembly of the United Nations, since it can deal with 
it should the Security Council be stymied by a veto. The famous 
Acheson resolution, which my colleague from Vancouver Quadra 
knows so well, would enable the General Assembly to consider 
this mission in Kosovo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, there are two unanswered questions that should be the 
subject of concern to the Government of Canada before a 
peacekeeping mission is sent to Kosovo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding the mission to the Central African Republic, I was in 
New York on a parliamentary mission when Canada was asked to be 
part of this mission.  The Bloc Quebecois immediately indicated 
its support for such a mission there. 
That is still true today.  We know this mission ends February 28 
and Canada's participation is to be renewed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to maintain a certain stability in this African 
country, which is starting the process of democracy that will 
lead to presidential elections, and it may help if foreign 
troops are present as part of MINURCA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois has always supported the idea of sending 
peacekeeping and peacebuilding troops abroad.  We believe it is 
an investment for and in peace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I hear the objections of my Reform Party colleagues, with 
more of the rhetoric we saw earlier this evening, I do not think 
they show any sign of being able to form an alternative, even a 
united one, in Canada, to the government, or of being concerned 
with the matters that should concern a party with ambitions of 
forming a government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The concerns of the present government, as presented by the 
ministers, have enough merit in our view that our party will be 
supporting them. 
As it did before, our party reiterates this support and also 
notes, as did the Reform Party, that it would like to see 
debates such as this one have a greater impact, be better 
prepared and be discussed beforehand, probably in the Standing 
Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade, as was 
done before. This way, the public would have a better 
understanding of, and be more open to, the investment in 
material and human resources required of a country engaged in 
peacekeeping missions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will close with the statement that, if war is necessary—because 
it is likely or at least possible, and the Bloc Quebecois no 
more wants to see a war than any other reasonable person, just 
to make Yugoslavia listen to reason in its dispute with the 
Kosovars—then let us hope, as André Malraux wrote in the 
wonderful novel </I>Les Noyers de l'Altenburg<I> that victory goes to 
those who go to war but take no pleasure in it.

</I></B></P><P align=left>But I would rather quote Aristide Briand to the House. I address 
my words to the Yugoslavians listening this evening, and 
particularly to their representative who is in the gallery. 
Aristide Briand said “It takes two to stop fighting: you and the 
other fellow”. 
<P><A NAME="LINK178"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
hon. member for Beauharnois—Salaberry stressed very appropriately 
the difference between chapter 6 and chapter 7 of the UN 
charter. There is a huge legal gap between the two concepts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did he consider the fact that international common law prevails? 
That was the ruling made by the international court, in the case 
of Nicaragua versus the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support the principle of humanitarian intervention, which was 
so abused by colonial powers during the 19th century and even at 
the beginning of the 20th century. Some have raised that 
possibility. Does the hon. member think this could provide a 
legal basis for the actions contemplated by the hon. member for 
Red Deer? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Daniel Turp:</B> Mr. Speaker, this evening, as in October, the 
member for Vancouver Quadra wants once again to discuss 
international law in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is fine, but let us never forget that international law 
must, first and foremost, serve peace. We are reminded of that 
in the preamble of the UN charter, which includes its most 
important provisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, we can always claim and argue that international common 
law now authorizes humanitarian types of interventions, 
interventions that are different from 19th century humanitarian 
interventions, which were made for eminently political reasons 
and far less humanitarian ones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But I do believe that a practice has developed that would now 
allow states to take an action such as the one being 
contemplated for Kosovo, or that was contemplated under other 
circumstances. That action could be based on international law, 
so as to avoid the issue of the legality of such an intervention 
without the security council's formal and express authorization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But still, I am urging the parliamentary secretary to act as a 
messenger to the Minister of Foreign Affairs. I told him this 
afternoon, when the standing committee met, that, in spite of 
the possibility of invoking humanitarian international law, if 
the UN is to maintain its credibility and its legitimacy in this 
intervention in Kosovo, the security council must, if not the UN 
general assembly, be involved. 
The UN must have an opportunity to approve the intervention by 
soldiers from various national contingents on behalf of NATO.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, as indicated by the 
Minister of External Affairs and the Minister of National 
Defence, we have two issues to debate this evening. The first 
one is Canada's participation in the United Nations mission to 
the Central African Republic. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1945"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT70"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT70"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1945

<A HREF="#LINKT69"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On this issue, I too would have appreciated a preliminary 
briefing. We had requested a joint foreign affairs and national 
defence committee, which was originally approved and scheduled 
to sit tomorrow. However, this evening, shortly before dinner, 
we learned that the meeting had been cancelled and could not be 
held. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is always desirable that members of parliament be as well 
informed as possible before undertaking a debate like this one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any event, concerning the United Nations mission in the 
Central African Republic, we know that it involves a small 
contingent of Canadian signals and logistics officers. This is 
part of one of the agreements previously entered into by Canada. 
Obviously, the Bloc will support the renewal of this mission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second issue we are dealing with this evening is a more 
serious issue: Canada's participation in a peace mission to 
Kosovo. As the previous speaker said, the Bloc Quebecois' 
position is clear on this issue. We have repeatedly expressed 
concern about the situation in Kosovo. We have condemned the 
repression, brutality and inhumanity of Serb security forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spoke on this very issue in March, as did my colleague from 
Beauharnois—Salaberry. 
We strongly condemned the inhuman operations carried out in that 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also put several questions in the House, asking the foreign 
affairs minister what he intended to do to put an end to this 
conflict. We also asked if he was willing to use force, if 
necessary, and if he thought diplomacy was good enough when 
dealing with someone like Slobodan Milosevic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois is in favour of Canada sending troops to this 
interposition and peacekeeping operation. 
On a more general note, we also agree with the use of force to 
put an end to atrocities occurring anywhere in the world, 
especially when these brutal conflicts or operations are taking 
place in countries that can undermine the very stability of our 
political system, our democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, we are in agreement, and I would like to give the House a 
few reasons why we will be supporting this government decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, the world community has repeatedly called for 
hostilities to end and negotiations to start, but its calls went 
unanswered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, warnings were given by various countries, including 
France, the United Kingdom, the United States and even Canada. 
Diplomatic and economic sanctions have been implemented against 
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and the UN has adopted 
resolutions 1199 and 1203, but all to no avail. Instead, the 
conflict has slowly escalated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The present conflict is a humanitarian disaster involving the 
killing of civilians, torture, rape, and the massive exodus of 
whole villages. The conflict in Kosovo could very well spell 
instability for the whole region, and especially for Macedonia, 
officially the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia or FYROM, 
with an Albanian speaking minority of 30%, and Albania itself, 
which is already struggling with economic instability.

<A HREF="#LINKT70"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is a party to the Dayton 
Accords, and its present conduct is contrary to the letter and 
the spirit of the accords, and further threatens a regional 
stabilization process that is already precarious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of the de facto failure of the Dayton Accords, the 
international community has decided to impose the Rambouillet 
negotiations, and the deadline the Americans have set to reach a 
conclusion is Saturday, February 20. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it is not to lose all credibility, the international 
community must therefore follow through with the use of force if 
its warnings go unheeded. In this case, the aggressor has been 
clearly identified and its aggression has been going on for 
several years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This behaviour violates international law as well as the spirit 
and letter of the UN Charter. It destabilizes the Balkans and 
damages international relations. It increases international 
instability. It violates UN Security Council resolution 1199, as 
I was saying a few moments ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, for a number of years, the behaviour of the Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia has violated the basic values and 
principles which must guide the international community in its 
quest for a world that is safer, that is more fair and that 
respects the most fundamental human values. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Rambouillet negotiations must be the last chance. One cannot 
negotiate indefinitely with someone who does not understand 
democracy, who does not understand what negotiating is all about 
and who can only be made to understand through the use of force. 
We must see the obvious and accept the use of force to restore 
peace in that country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we think the use of force must meet certain conditions. 
The security of civilians, which is the first condition, must be 
the primary concern in any intervention. Canada's interventions 
must take place under the auspices of international 
organizations, ideally the UN, of course, or NATO. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any action by the international community in Yugoslavia should 
ideally be supported by as many countries as possible. The 
larger the number of countries willing to use persuasion to 
settle the conflict in Kosovo, the easier it will be to achieve 
the desired results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The forces involved in such a mission must be multinational. 
The objectives must correspond to resolutions by the Security 
Council  The specific requirements of the parties to the 
conflict must be made publicly and armed force used until the 
parties agree publicly to meet these requirements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Independence for Kosovo must be seriously considered rather than 
simply dismissed, because it is one solution to be explored to 
restore peace in the region, including at the end of the 
three-year transitional period when the Kosovar people will have 
to decide on their political status. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The aim of our intervention is not to decide for the Kosovars, 
the Serbs or the Albanians.  It is to ensure peace while they 
continue their negotiations in an effort to find a way to ensure 
the safety of civilians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My time is almost up.  There are other things I would have liked 
to say, but I hope to be asked questions that will allow me to 
complete my comments. 
<P><A NAME="LINK180"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Price (Compton—Stanstead, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, to help my 
colleague, I am going to ask him a few questions. But first I 
would like to mention that the member said he agreed about the 
need to maintain peace in Kosovo.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question concerns how long we are prepared to stay.  This 
relates to something that happened two weeks ago in Washington. 
We were briefed on what the United States was going to do.  It 
is starting to sing a different tune. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now it says it is prepared to go to Kosovo, but for a very short 
period, at the request of other NATO members.  It says that this 
is a conflict taking place in Europe and one that should 
therefore be covered by Europeans, who are right there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is perhaps not a bad idea.  It wants our presence, it wants 
visibility, particularly at the beginning, to put together a 
peacekeeping system. 
Once the system is up and running, we should withdraw. We should 
stay perhaps three months, six at most, and not become mired as 
we are in Bosnia, where we will be stuck for a long time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that Kosovo will be the same, that it will drag on if we 
become involved.  Should we not perhaps consider something like 
that, taking part at the beginning and then providing support 
for ground forces? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Laurin:</B> Mr. Speaker, if an agreement is reached in 
Rambouillet before troops are sent to that country, the 
peacemaking process should be a lot easier. It will be a matter 
of staying in Kosovo, monitoring the situation and ensuring that 
the conflict does not erupt again in a month or two. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, if we must impose peace, it could take 
longer. As we know, “you can lead a horse to water but you can't 
make him drink”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Getting the Serbs and the Kosovars to stop shooting at and 
shelling each other, getting them to stay on their respective 
side and to start negotiating again will not be achieved in just 
a month. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such a mission could take three years. This may be a reasonable 
minimum. 
If, unfortunately, peace is not restored after three years, we 
would then have to contemplate alternatives. It could be that 
Canada would find another country prepared to take over the 
operation. It is not just Canada's responsibility. There are 
many other countries in the world. NATO and the UN have many 
members and they are all concerned about maintaining peace in 
the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada plays a role because it made commitments to NATO. It 
plays a role because it is a member of the United Nations. The 
mission may involve 500 to 800 troops. It is reasonable that we 
be there, given Canada's credibility, given its international 
reputation as a peacemaking and a peacekeeping country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must not back off because of a matter of months. 
This is an operation which we must support to help make it a 
success. Let us learn from our past experiences in other 
countries to make this operation a success. 
<P><A NAME="LINK181"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am very 
happy to have an opportunity to speak on this very important 
subject. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On October 7, 1998 we gathered together in this House and had a 
debate on Kosovo.  At that time we debated a motion put forward 
by the hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House take note of the dire humanitarian situation 
confronting the people of Kosovo and the government's intention 
to take measures in co-operation with the international community 
to resolve the conflict, promote a political settlement for 
Kosovo and facilitate the provision of humanitarian assistance to 
refugees. 
</UL>
<Tonight we are debating the motion: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House take note of possible Canadian peacekeeping 
activities in Kosovo and the possible changes in peacekeeping 
activities in the Central African Republic. 
</UL>
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2000"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT72"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would say right up front, on behalf of the NDP caucus, that we 
certainly support the idea that Canada should fulfil its 
international obligations and should take every measure possible 
to try to end the suffering, to end the senseless bloodshed that 
occurs in a lot of these countries and to bring about some 
humanitarian efforts and to try to stabilize such countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also have to raise a number of issues around this motion and 
what we are doing here tonight.  First, as was mentioned earlier, 
we are to have a briefing tomorrow afternoon on Kosovo and the 
Central African Republic.  It certainly would have been 
preferable to have had this briefing prior to coming here to 
debate this very important topic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I realize and I am learning every day in politics that things 
seem to happen very quickly and in a hurry, but I am not 
convinced yet that is the way things have to be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My mother has a phrase she has used many times, haste makes 
waste.  I am afraid that in this political business far too often 
we hurry very important business to the point that we make a lot 
of mistakes that would not be made otherwise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I realize that many times things happen quickly and we have to 
respond quickly.  I am sure this issue did not develop overnight. 
I am sure the hon. ministers could and should have found time to 
brief us in advance and then had the debate so everyone is 
debating from a knowledge perspective about the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Far too often I find I walk in on a certain day and I am told we 
are going to have a debate on this tomorrow night and I am 
speaking on it or can I speak on it.  One does the best one can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased that we are at least having the opportunity to 
discuss this.  A while back I was quite concerned about this 
whole issue when I heard through the media that the Prime 
Minister had somehow committed Canadian troops to Kosovo and the 
matter at that point had not been brought before this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I actually had a question prepared but it did not get on the 
agenda unfortunately.  The question was this.  Canadian troops 
have been put on standby for military action in Kosovo.  Has the 
Prime Minister decided to take unilateral control over decision 
making around Canada going to war or has he handed that over to 
the NATO generals?  Will the Prime Minister commit to bringing 
any proposal to send Canadian women and men into battle before 
this elected House and ensure that any such action is backed by a 
UN resolution?  Those questions have some very important points 
that are still relevant today as we discuss this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it very interesting that I am standing here tonight in 
the House and I can count on one hand the number of people who 
are here listening to this debate.  We had two hon. ministers 
come to present their information around something that we are 
going to make a very important decision on and they are no longer 
present. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that something as important— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  We let the first one 
slide by but we are not letting the second one slide by.  We do 
not refer to the presence or absence of members.  As the hon. 
member knows, the parliamentary precincts are full of people 
watching this debate from their offices and from other places. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I withdraw those remarks. 
I am very sorry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The importance of this issue cannot be underscored enough 
because we are talking here tonight about sending our men and 
women off to very dangerous situations.  While it has been 
indicated that we are talking about peacekeeping activities I 
guess we have to ask ourselves what does this really mean. What 
do we really mean when we talk about peacekeeping? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at these countries and see the atrocities taking 
place, far too often peacekeeping means actually peacemaking.  It 
means people going into a very dangerous situation not only for 
themselves but for many of the innocent civilians living in the 
area. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2005"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT73"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about sending our men and women into a war torn 
zone.  It is a zone where people are killing each other, where 
there is senseless slaughter.  We are talking about sending our 
troops to these areas.  We must be mindful of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other thing I am concerned about is that we saw various 
tapes and heard various reports about people who had returned 
from previous peacekeeping missions, whether it was in the gulf 
war or elsewhere.  We heard about the post-traumatic stress 
syndrome and the after effects that many of these people 
experienced from being on these missions.  The question is how 
well prepared are we to provide support when our troops return 
home. What kinds of preparation do we give people for these kinds 
of missions?  How well equipped are our troops?  This issue has 
been raised already in terms of what kinds of equipment we will 
have.  We have heard stories of people returning from other 
missions. As they were crossing over and they knew people were 
going, they were exchanging helmets because we did not have 
proper supplies for these people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other issue that has been raised recently in the House is 
with respect to vaccines.  We heard about troops who were given 
vaccines.  There were questions as to whether these were properly 
tested, whether they were safe for our troops and so forth. These 
are issues that come to mind as well.  We saw a person who was 
court martialled because he did not want to take a vaccine which 
he felt had some very serious questions about his safety and his 
health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are questions we have to look at when we think about these 
missions.  Quite often we find that the people who have gone on 
these missions have become skilled and experienced.  When 
it comes time for another mission we redeploy the same troops. We 
find these people are leaving their families again and are going 
off on missions quite often for unspecified periods of time. 
These are questions that have to be dealt with as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other thing I asked the hon. minister earlier is what would 
be the duties of these people.  What authority will they have to 
protect themselves and take action when they are faced with very 
serious and dangerous situations.  The response was these things 
have not been defined yet.  These will be worked out in due 
course.  These are the kinds of issues that are very important 
and that we want to know before a decision is made to engage 
people in that activity.  We want to know the kind of training 
received. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other very important issue is will these missions be backed 
by a UN resolution. We find more and more we are moving toward, 
as the minister said, NATO led missions.  What exactly does that 
mean?  We know that when it comes to international affairs and 
concerns the United Nations is the body that should sanction and 
give approval to these kinds of missions.  That is a very 
important issue that should be dealt with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Generally speaking, when we think should we get involved in 
these missions, I do not feel we have much choice when it 
comes to deciding whether to help fellow 
human beings overcome adversity.  It is very important that we as 
individuals, we as human beings, fulfil our responsibility to our 
brothers and our sisters.  Am I my brother's keeper?  I 
believe we are.  We have an international obligation to fulfil 
our responsibilities in that regard.  But we must do it under 
appropriate conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must do it knowing the situation. We should not be responding 
with a knee-jerk reaction simply because someone else is deciding 
that they need us to assist them in that mission.  We should know 
the facts.  We should know the details.  We should be fully 
briefed ahead of time and able to address these issues with some 
degree of knowledge and some base of information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to draw the attention of the House to what I feel is a 
very important matter.  While we are looking at fighting or 
sending our troops to deal with issues in other parts of the 
world, it is important that we not loose sight of the fact that 
there are many issues at home that have an underlying dimension 
which is similar. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2010"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT74"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have talked many times about ethic cleansing when we look at 
what is happening in some of the other parts of the world.  But 
we see the same dynamics happening right here at home when we 
look at different situations involving our own people here in 
Canada.  It is a matter of degree as to where the difference is 
but basically the same principle is there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to respect each other as fellow human beings and deal 
with the issues of sharing of resources. A lot of these conflicts 
are based around struggles for power, for resources, whether it 
be mines with diamonds or whatever. These are quite often the 
things that are causing conflict between people. Everybody is 
struggling for these precious resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the same thing happening to a large degree right here in 
Canada.  We do not have the kind of sharing of resources that we 
should have in order for people to take advantage of them, to get 
along together and lead a productive life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to apply the lessons that we learn abroad here at home. 
It is just one step beyond that we could find ourselves facing 
similar kinds of strife within our country. Far too often we look 
at conflicts in other parts of the world and we think it is 
happening over there, it is really not the kind of thing that 
could happen here in Canada.  But is it really something that 
could not happen here in Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was watching TV the other night when the riot police were 
called out to deal with the homeless who had come to Ottawa.  My 
daughter said “Oh my goodness, dad, I have never seen anything 
like this before in Canada”. We could have very easily 
transposed that scene to a foreign country where there would be 
fighting in the street and riot police confronting people.  We 
are not that different.  Let us not kid ourselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though there are very serious questions around these 
missions and even though I am speaking on the basis of a lack of 
appropriate information because of the manner in which we have 
been briefed on this, I do feel that it is very important for 
Canada to support its allies with respect to trying to maintain 
peace and harmony in other countries and to help avoid the 
senseless bloodshed we see taking place with human beings being 
killed, maimed and violated every day in various ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I feel it is important for us to fulfill our duty and we would 
support the efforts that would be taken in that regard.  As I 
said before, we must deal with those other issues and not always 
be responding after the fact and making the decisions in an 
emergency situation when there is sufficient time to get 
information in advance and to be briefed on these things 
properly. 
<P><A NAME="LINK182"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to quote back to the previous speaker his question, am 
I my brother's keeper, and his injunction that indeed we should 
be and we should respond positively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly all Canadians feel that way.  The difficulty the 
Reform Party has with this in very specific terms is that we have 
seen this Liberal government, that wants to bring this motion and 
send our troops, gut the armed forces to the tune of $7 billion 
and take away their ability to do things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have people in our armed forces who are absolutely second to 
none.  We have heroes and heroines in our armed forces who are 
there to serve our country and to serve humanity, as the previous 
speaker said.  The problem is that it is undefined whether this 
is a peacekeeping or peacemaking mission, it is undefined whether 
this is going to be strictly under a NATO mandate or a UN 
mandate.  This seems to be chewing gum and baling wire where the 
government is working it as it goes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government cut $7 billion from the Canadian armed forces. 
The Reform Party has had a consistent position that whatever we 
ask our armed forces to do, we must be prepared to give them the 
proper resources, training, manpower, equipment, counselling, 
back-up support, health care, whatever is required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are not prepared to resource the armed forces adequately, 
we should not be asking them to be doing things they are not 
capable of doing.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know what the position of the NDP is relative to 
the funding of the armed forces because I labour under the 
impression, particularly as a result of some of the comments and 
pronouncements that have been made by the member for 
Burnaby—Douglas, a very outspoken NDP member, that the idea 
would be to cut back and to cut back on the armed forces budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot have it both ways.  We cannot ask our heroes and 
heroines in our armed forces to go into these conflicts without 
proper backup training, support, medication, counselling and 
equipment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the position of the NDP?  If we are going to be doing 
this kind of activity, would the NDP see putting money, not just 
the $400 million band-aid the government is talking about in this 
budget, but the proper resources back into the armed forces so 
that our people will have the ability to do the job that we are 
asking them to do? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am sure if the member 
would check the records of the comments we have made on 
equipment, supplies and adequate financial remuneration for the 
armed forces, he would find that we certainly support that.  We 
have supported the standing committee's report with respect to 
the various recommendations made therein. Personally I was quite 
disappointed to see in this budget the relatively small amount 
committed to meet the recommendations of that report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was also informed today that another Sea King was forced to 
land because of difficulties it was having.  It struck a chord 
when the minister mentioned earlier in terms of this mission of 
supplying helicopters and so forth.  We feel that it is very 
important for the armed forces to have adequate and safe 
equipment with which to do their jobs.  I have no quarrel with 
that comment.  I agree with it 100%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I still feel that we have to support trying to do something to 
end the senseless slaughter that is taking place even if it is 
scaled down to what we can afford.  I do feel that it is 
important for people to be properly prepared, to have proper 
equipment and that there is proper follow-up when they return. 
<P><A NAME="LINK183"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Julian Reed (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member and 
indeed some other members remarked that they were not briefed 
before this debate tonight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure the hon. member and all members will agree that the 
reason this debate is being held tonight and not next week is 
simply due to a logistical problem.  All the House leaders agreed 
that the debate should take place tonight because the House will 
not be in session next week.  As the hon. member and all members 
know, the full briefing will take place tomorrow.  It is simply a 
matter of sorting out the basic logistics and the House leaders 
agreed.  It should not be a matter of debate in terms of accusing 
the government of not doing something. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. friend talks about NATO led forces. Does he believe that 
a NATO led force and a UN sanctioned action are mutually 
exclusive? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle:</B>  Mr. Speaker, on the first point with 
respect to the debate, I hope the hon. member understands that I 
was certainly not suggesting that the debate be held next week. I 
was merely suggesting that the briefing should have been held in 
advance of the debate.  I do not know why the briefing could not 
have been held prior to the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That aside, to come to the question on whether a NATO led force 
and a UN sanctioned action are exclusive, no I have not suggested 
that either. The hon. minister mentioned with respect to whether 
this was backed by the UN, that it was NATO led and that there 
should not be any problem getting UN support.  It seemed to me 
that was putting the cart before the horse.  Perhaps the UN 
support should have been there and then if it was deemed that it 
be NATO led, that would be the route.  That is simply what I was 
saying.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Robert Bertrand (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have more of a comment 
than a question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been hearing a lot of noise tonight about our government 
not giving enough money to the Canadian armed forces. In 
yesterday's budget there was quite an amount given to the 
Canadian armed forces.  I believe it was the first time in 12 
years that the Canadian armed forces have had new money. If 
memory serves me correctly, there was $175 million for the next 
three years and also about another $150 million a year in 
incremental terms. We are looking at close to $1 billion over 
three years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member from the Reform Party says it is a band-aid solution. 
I think $1 billion for the Canadian armed forces is a lot more 
than a band-aid solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle:</B>  Mr. Speaker, there really was no 
question so I will comment on the comment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When one uses figures and says that the amount is over three 
years and which adds up to a large number, what is missed in the 
equation is what was cut in the years before. If so much has been 
cut to the point that one is operating with an inadequate amount 
and then something is thrown back in, it does not necessarily 
mean the full need has been met. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was saying that the recommendations in the report of the 
standing committee certainly would have called for a larger 
amount than $175 million over three years.  The minister's 
estimate was at least $700 million to start with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was less put in than would be determined to meet the need. 
Perhaps we can agree to disagree on that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Bachand (Richmond—Arthabaska, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to inform you that I will be splitting my time with my 
colleague, the member for Compton—Stanstead. You will recall that 
my colleague is the one who revealed to Canadians that North 
Korean missiles were aimed at Montreal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This being said, this debate, which is not really a debate, but 
rather the opportunity to express our emotions, raises several 
questions. Parliamentary rules do not really apply and members 
have until 11.30 p.m. to speak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one thing government members have been asking us often 
and that is “Will the opposition parties support the government 
sending troops to Kosovo?” In fact, the true question is “Will 
the government support Canadian armed forces so they can to do 
their job” This is the real question. My colleague from 
Compton—Stanstead will elaborate on this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For my part I would like to deal with the diplomatic and 
geopolitical aspects of the problem in Kosovo. It has been going 
on for some time now. I do not want to trace the history of this 
situation at this point, but as members know, throughout 
history, wars have caused countries to be born and countries to 
disappear, empires to be built and empires to crumble, and 
borders to be redefined. 
On a regular basis, we see very regional problems following 
various operations, various wars that occurred during the last 
few decades or the last century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But our main concern about the situation in Kosovo is the way 
these activities will be justified and explained. We are 
thinking about sending a peacekeeping force led by NATO. So 
there is a problem in that the missions we participate in are 
normally led by the UN or, in a few cases, by the U.S. But this 
mission would be led by NATO. The foreign affairs minister talks 
about “NATO plus”.

<A HREF="#LINKT77"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This reminds me of when the Americans decided to attack Irak. To 
justify that operation, the expression “United States plus” was 
coined, but we said we would not go until a peace agreement was 
reached. So we hope such an agreement will be reached by 
February 20. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this happens before February 20 and we send troops in support 
of a NATO operation, how will the Serbs and the Kosovars react? 
These are NATO troops we will be sending over there. These last 
few months, we had NATO aircraft flying over the Kosovar and 
Serb territories. This is not a peacekeeping force. That is why 
it is so hard to justify it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the Progressive Conservative Party have no lessons to 
learn from anyone. 
We will indeed support sending troops on peacekeeping duty. It 
is part of our traditions and we will maintain this tradition. 
However, I do hope the government realizes we are facing a 
problem justifying our decision internationally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Serbia, Albania and the whole geopolitical region are fragile. 
There are problems in nearby Greece and in Macedonia, where many 
Albanians live. In Greece, the problems are with the Turks. Then 
there is not-so-distant Russia, which is preventing us from 
securing UN support by using its right of veto. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So we are left wondering under which international organization 
our troops should be deployed. Next thing you know, there will 
be a new international organization. Should our troops be 
deployed under the UN? Under NATO? It may not be NATO's role. 
Perhaps NATO's role will be redefined. It was the role of the 
UN, but it has financial problems and can no longer afford to 
send troops on peacekeeping missions. The UN does not have any 
money to pay for these missions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the UN was established, funding for peacekeeping forces was 
to be provided by the UN. In committee this afternoon, the 
Minister of External Affairs gave a very good example, 
Bangladesh, which used to send highly professional and 
disciplined peacekeeping troops but can no longer afford to do 
so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in Canada keep sending troops. Canadian taxpayers are paying 
for that, but the government opposite is not being very 
supportive. Otherwise, the men and women of our armed forces 
would be better dressed, they would have boots to wear. 
Thank God, things are beginning to move in the right direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But, once again, we have a problem justifying our involvement. 
Working only with NATO is dangerous. It is extremely dangerous. 
It sends a very bad message. The Serbs do not seem to take this 
threat seriously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And what will happen should the peacekeeping negotiations fail? 
The UN's efforts have failed. NATO's efforts have failed. At one 
point, even the OSCE had representatives in Kosovo. There is a 
whole lot of people who have gone to Kosovo without having the 
mandate to settle the conflict. And we are now trying to justify 
sending our troops there. It is extremely dangerous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are pleased to have an opportunity to discuss this issue. 
I will simply say that I hope parliament will be unanimous in 
sending our troops on a peacekeeping mission. This is extremely 
important. We must avoid another situation like the Gulf war, 
even though this is different, where our Liberal friends refused 
to support our armed forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I sincerely hope that, together, we will be able to support our 
armed forces in this mission. I also hope that we will be able 
to provide financial and technical support to our men and women 
who will represent us in this peacekeeping mission to Kosovo.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby—Douglas, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
hon. member mentioned the situation in Turkey. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While it is profoundly important that we debate in this chamber 
tonight the role of Canada in Kosovo and our possible role in 
Africa, it is also essential, particularly at this very crucial 
and difficult time, that we note another human tragedy unfolding, 
the tragedy of the Kurds. 
I want to take the opportunity of this debate to make a brief 
comment on that. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2030"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members know, Kurds around the world have been voicing a 
sense of anguish, pain, anger, outrage and deep concern about the 
arrest of Abdullah Ocalan or Apo.  Here in Ottawa today we 
unfortunately saw a violent confrontation outside the Turkish 
embassy.  Fortunately it was ultimately resolved in a peaceful 
manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to take the opportunity of this debate to call on our 
government, the Government of Canada, to end its shameful silence 
on the plight of the Kurds, particularly in Turkey but also in 
Iraq, Iran and Syria.  I fear that our desire to sell Candu 
reactors and military hardware as well as our membership in the 
NATO alliance have silenced us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot remain silent on this issue.  It is essential that 
Canada play an important role.  With respect to the arrest of 
Ocalan, it is essential that Canada and others in the 
international community take steps urgently to ensure an open and 
fair trial for Mr. Ocalan, to see that he is not tortured as the 
UN special rapporteur on torture has urged as well.  I am calling 
on our government to send a delegation to Turkey to monitor this 
very serious question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most important, it is time that our government spoke out with 
respect to the underlying massive violation of the fundamental 
human, political and cultural rights of the Kurdish people which 
have led to the destruction of Kurdish villages, which have led 
to the murder, torture and killing of over 30,000 people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion I take this opportunity to say that we face 
terrible tragedy in Kosovo and the Central African Republic, but 
let us not lose sight of the unfolding human tragedy of the 
Kurdish people that for too long has been ignored.  </I>Biji 
Kurdistan<I>. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Bachand:</B> Mr. Speaker, I find my colleague's comment 
interesting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, it is obvious that he is quite familiar with procedure; 
he is using this debate on a specific problem to raise other 
issues. I believe I could have done the same on a topic I raised 
this afternoon in committee, namely North Korea, where three 
million people have died in recent years, out of a total 
population of 20 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This being said, tonight's debate is on Kosovo and that 
geopolitical region. I have, however, raised the Kurdish problem 
in an indirect way. 
What I am asking is that the government, through various 
embassies, non-governmental organisations or even the minister 
himself, continue to apply use accelerated, effective and 
productive diplomacy, not only with Serbia or representatives of 
Kosovo but with every country in the whole region, in order to 
prevent its breakdown. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This issue must not become a time bomb. If we can deal with the 
Kurdish problem, so much the better; if we can deal with the 
problems in other areas of that region, so much the better. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I listened 
carefully.  I knew the hon. member for Burnaby—Douglas was 
straying strictly speaking from the topic tonight.  However there 
is no question that these issues are all interrelated.  I felt, 
since we are here enjoying each other's comments, what is a 
little bit of extension. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Bachand:</B>  I love you and you love me; it is a 
big family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Exactly. 
<P><A NAME="LINK187"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Price (Compton—Stanstead, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the situation in Kosovo is grave.  We recently witnessed an 
atrocious massacre and the spring campaign season is upon us 
within weeks.   NATO has given both sides until February 20 to 
reach a peace agreement or face NATO air power.  The United 
States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany and our other NATO 
allies are preparing to send ground troops into the bloody 
province and the NATO secretary general is asking for Canadian 
participation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister, in his usual open mouth insert foot manner 
said that we might send ground troops to Kosovo in addition to 
our CF-18s based in Italy, without our being asked formally or 
informally for troops by anyone. 
I cannot imagine another responsible statesman in the world doing 
such a thing, but there we have it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The foreign affairs minister and Nobel Peace Prize wannabe has 
said that Canada would send ground forces only if the operation 
was approved by the UN Security Council.  It seems he has changed 
his mind.  The defence minister who obviously has not clout 
around the cabinet table after yesterday's insulting budget has 
said it will not be an aggressive force but simple peacekeeping 
like Bosnia.  Bosnia has already cost 16 Canadian lives.  That is 
something I cannot dismiss quite so cavalierly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Serbs have rejected any NATO peacekeeping force on their 
soil.  The defence minister has also said that sending ground 
troops would stretch the Canadian forces to the limit, which begs 
the question as to where are the troops for Kosovo going to come 
from, especially after yesterday's budget which made significant 
troop cuts a reality.  This lack of Liberal clarity has left 
Canadians wondering what is the government's policy on Kosovo. It 
has left Canadians with several questions about the deployment of 
Canadian military forces to this troubled region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lieutenant General Lewis MacKenzie, one of Canada's most famous 
peacekeepers and someone who is very familiar with the region, 
has questioned Canadian involvement and has demanded that there 
be a public debate.  This is a public debate in a sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger:</B>  With no information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Price:</B>  Absolutely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My fear is that the time when we controlled events with regard 
to our involvement in Kosovo is now long since past.  I want to 
join our foreign affairs critic and say that all peace loving 
people would like to see an end to fighting in Kosovo and an end 
to the killing of innocent civilians.  I also think that if NATO 
decides to go into to Kosovo we as NATO allies must join our 
closest international friends in facing our joint destiny. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also think that the deployment of ground troops and military 
power is the worst decision that any statesman ever has to make. 
Once taken by the governor in council Canadians will support the 
government of the day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are conclusions that all responsible Canadians would come 
to with regard to the Kosovo question.  The big issue for me is: 
Are our Canadian forces ready to go to Kosovo and what units are 
going?  The problem is that serious questions are left unanswered 
about Kosovo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have never really had an opportunity to debate government 
deployment of Canadian forces to the Central African Republic. 
That was done with a sleight of hand, but I will concentrate on 
Kosovo today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has told us that we would only be going in a 
ceasefire mode.  In terms of entering the area on the basis of 
ceasefire, I point out that just because we enter in ceasefire 
does not mean that it will hold.  We might find ourselves in a 
situation worse than an invasion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the state of the Canadian forces.  The present 
government defined its defence policy with the 1994 defence white 
paper which committed Canada to the maintenance of a modern, 
combat capable land, sea and air force to deal with operations 
all across the spectrum of combat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of implementing our national security objectives the 
government directed the Canadian forces to provide a joint task 
force headquarters and one or more of the following: an able task 
group of four major service combatants, one support ship and a 
maritime air support, three separate battle groups or a brigade 
group, a fighter wing and a transport squadron, for a grand total 
of 10,000 personnel at one time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The intent was to have the vanguard of this joint task force in 
place within three weeks and the entire force operational within 
three months.  This was to be done by a regular force of 60,000 
personnel.  Therefore we have a question today.  We have 2,000 on 
the ground now.  It is tough to get another 1,000 and yet we have 
60,400 troops that are being paid.  We are supposed to be able to 
get 10,000.  There are lots of people missing there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the navy, the government started out with an urgent 
need for a new maritime helicopter to replace the aging Sea King. 
The white paper also promised to examine the option to buy United 
Kingdom upholder class submarines.  Last, the government stated 
it would consider replacing our old operational support vessels.

<A HREF="#LINKT80"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's army was promised three adequately equipped brigade 
groups and some 3,000 more soldiers in three light infantry 
battalions.  The white paper called for new armoured personnel 
carriers to replace the obsolete M-113 fleet.  There was also a 
discussion in very loose terms for the future replacement of 
direct fire support vehicles.  There was not mention of a new 
main battle tank to replace the obsolete Leopard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The air force was promised an upgrade of its CF-18 fighter 
aircraft fleet and new search and rescue helicopters.  The 
government also stated its intention to reduce Canada's fighter 
fleet by 25%, but the remaining fighters would receive new 
precision guided munitions for ground support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the end, as always, the 1994 defence white paper has been big 
on promises and very short on substance, with the result that it 
is now sadly outdated if for no other reason than the absolute 
lack of leadership and budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's navy has yet to see a new maritime helicopter and after 
yesterday's Liberal budget it is increasingly unlikely to see 
them for probably up to eight years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been little discussion by the government of the 
proposed multi-role support vehicles, and the lack of strategic 
sealift means that the army is largely landlocked on the 
continent.  The upholder class submarines will not start arriving 
until the year 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The army has just started to receive its new armoured personnel 
carriers in the form of the LAV-25, but we do not have enough. I 
suspect we do not have enough for a good recce regiment.  The 
three light battalions were created of about 3,000 soldiers. 
However, the army has such a budget problem—and I am told right 
now that it is about $170 million in deficit—that it may be 
forced to cut 3,000 positions.  This cut would be in addition to 
yesterday's budgetary slap in the face and would mean cuts 
through the other three services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The air force acquired new precision guided munitions for the 
existing CF-18 fleet.  It also got the long awaited EH-101 
helicopters for search and rescue.  They are getting them; they 
are not there yet.  However the air force lost its air refuelling 
tankers and received no new airlift capability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As of today Canada lacks both strategic sealift and strategic 
airlift capabilities and thus is forced to rent these items on 
the open market or to be dependent upon the United States for any 
large military operation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The old commitment and capability gap still haunts Canada.  The 
lack of power projection capability is Canada's biggest force 
problem.  After that of course there is money.  That is the 
central issue.  The white paper must be implemented if we are to 
be able to project our forces abroad effectively in support of 
foreign policy objectives, and that includes Kosovo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian army and air force are virtually incapable of 
projecting power without outside international assistance, and 
thus the only real force we have for independent timely service 
is Canada's navy.  Unfortunately for the government, Kosovo is 
landlocked and the navy is just out of the picture.  We are left 
with CF-18s that the air force says need an upgrade and an army 
that lacks the modern armoured personnel carriers, main battle 
tanks and troops. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The white paper stated that Canada should be able to deploy 
10,000 personnel around the world at any one time, but the 
minister has said that it would be stretched to the limit to come 
up with just another 1,000 or so for Kosovo.  Tonight he said 
800.  That gives him a 200 leeway so now he is not quite as 
stretched.  That was before yesterday's miserly defence 
allocation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having examined the state of Canada's Liberal neglected military 
and its deficiencies brings me to my last point.  In terms of the 
Kosovo operation a number of issues need examination by 
parliament prior to the deployment of Canadian forces.  For 
instance, how long does NATO make a commitment to stay in Kosovo? 
Judging by Bosnia it will be measured in years and not just 
months.  The United States, from my discussions in recent 
briefings with United States officials, do not want a long term 
commitment.  They want to be in and then out.  They do not 
believe that Canada's participation is really necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happens if both sides decide to engage in hostilities with 
each other or NATO?  This situation could turn to war at any 
moment.  We do not even know how NATO troops, our troops, are 
getting in and out if it turns to all-out war.  Sadly, next to it 
is Bosnia.  What happens to Bosnia?  Will we send a significant 
contingent, perhaps a battalion sized group, or no troops at all?

</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not know what the national command relationships will be. 
What are the rules of engagement? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other day on television a British commander said that his 
orders were to shoot to kill.  I cannot imagine a Canadian 
officer daring to say that, right or wrong, in the present 
post-Somalia inquiry climate.  We do not know how we will get our 
troops over to Kosovo because we have no real sea lift or air 
lift capability.  How will we sustain them in Kosovo?  I would 
suggest probably piggybacking our existing air supply to Bosnia, 
but no one has said that for sure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Order, please. 
Unfortunately your time is up.  We were trying to give you a 
couple of minutes to wrap up.  If the hon. member for 
Compton—Stanstead wants 15 seconds to put a lid on it, fair 
enough, but that is it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Price:</B>  Mr. Speaker, lastly, we do not even know who 
will pay for this venture.  Will there be a supplementary 
increase in the defence budget or are we facing even greater 
troop cuts than the </I>Globe and Mail<I> reported?  After yesterday's 
budget, I think it is a big question mark. 
<P><A NAME="LINK188"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
listened to the member's comments and his concerns about our 
military and about the possible engagement in Kosovo.  It is 
obvious that we are not getting a clear message from the 
government side of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that the member for Compton—Stanstead sits on the 
defence committee.  He has been over to Bosnia.  He has talked to 
troops from across this country who have served over there.   He 
has an idea of the record of the Canadian military.  Those men 
and women served in the Bosnia theatre under a peacekeeping 
mission when war was raging all around them.  It was the most 
foolish thing that probably ever happened to Canadian soldiers 
who put their lives in that kind of jeopardy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the member has had some experience in his travels as a 
parliamentarian, how does he analyse the situation in Kosovo? 
Looking at the equipment that our Canadian military has right 
now, would our troops be safe there in any kind of a peacemaking 
role?  If not, what should they or could they possibly do? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Price:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
his question.  It gives me the opportunity to continue on a 
little bit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been talking all along about the fact that we really do 
not have the troops to send into Kosovo to start off with.  Our 
troops are being rotated so often that they do not have a chance 
to get proper training.  It is obvious they do not have the 
equipment.  We keep harping on that but nothing is happening. 
This budget ended up giving zilch for equipment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People watching the debate on TV might think that $175 million 
is a lot of dollars, but it is not really.  It is $175 million 
for this year.  We need $700 million just to come up even with 
our quality of life study without even talking about what is 
needed for equipment.  There is no equipment upgrade in that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Raymonde Folco (Laval West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to share my time with the member for Halton and Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Minister of Foreign Affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last October, in Kosovo, tens of thousands of displaced people 
were living homeless as an armed conflict was raging between 
separatist Albanian Kosovars and security forces of the federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In spite of the protests from the international community and of 
the attention by the United Nations security council, the 
conflict continued and innocent civilians suffered. 
It is only when NATO made a credible threat to use force against 
President Milosevic that a humanitarian disaster was prevented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In spite of the positive effects of the events of last October 
and of the agreements with NATO and OSCE, which the Yugoslav 
government accepted, no real progress has been achieved toward a 
durable peace in Kosovo. Diplomatic efforts have not succeeded 
in getting both sides to the table and the ceasefire in the area 
remains tense and fragile. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, I was reading today, in one of the Montreal dailies, 
that Robin Cook, the British Minister of Foreign Affairs, said 
in the Commons, and I quote “Two weeks ago, I warned the House 
of Commons that I could not guarantee that the talks would 
necessarily lead to an agreement. Today I am sorry to say that 
this is still the case”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, after weeks of provocation from both sides and the 
killing of dozens of innocent people, it became clear that, once 
again, we had to force President Milosevic and the Kosovar 
leaders to choose between serious negotiations or the use of 
force by NATO. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>NATO support for the diplomatic endeavours of the international 
community did produce results in Kosovo. On February 6, both 
parties met in Rambouillet, France, to work out a peace 
agreement. It is no secret that, to this day, the Rambouillet 
talks have not been easy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know there is still much to be done and that the eventual 
conclusion of a final agreement would be a significant 
achievement. Although the outcome of the talks is still 
uncertain, the involvement of the international community in 
Kosovo is just beginning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The conflict in Kosovo has ramifications that extend well beyond 
the borders of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. We should not 
ignore the fact that this war-torn region has been devastated 
because of leaders who shamelessly play on people's fears in 
order to fuel the conflict. Once again, the Yugoslav 
government's actions in Kosovo hurt the most vulnerable and make 
the peace process and the integration of the various ethnic 
groups in the Balkans all the more difficult. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The displacement of Albanian Kosovar civilians and the 
polarization of communities resulting from the conflict have had 
a direct impact not only on Serbia and Montenegro, but also on 
neighbouring countries. Hundreds if not thousands of Albanians 
have tried to flee their country because they feared for their 
lives. In the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and in 
Bosnia, refugees have also tried to escape from the country. 
The conflict is having repercussions on all of southern Europe 
and the international community cannot ignore them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Rambouillet talks provide an historic opportunity for the 
leaders of both parties.  For peace is now in sight, if the 
parties gathered in Rambouillet negotiate in good faith and 
agree to the fair solution being offered.  It is up to them to 
fulfil their obligations to the UN, to the international 
community and, let us not forget, to the local populations they 
claim to represent.  This unique opportunity must not be allowed 
to go by. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the antagonists shoulder their responsibilities and take this 
opportunity to reach a peace agreement, the international 
community should support their efforts.  Implementation of a 
peace accord in Kosovo will certainly be no easy matter. 
Rebuilding the civil institutions destroyed during months of 
fighting, introducing a democratic political system and creating 
a representative police force are daunting tasks.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The OSCE and other organizations will face quite a challenge 
implementing the civilian aspects of a peace accord.  Without a 
safe environment, however, none of these undertakings will even 
be possible.  It is impossible to envisage a positive outcome. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But NATO is in a position to make a tremendous contribution to 
peace in Kosovo, having already played a crucial role in ending 
the hostilities and getting the parties to the negotiating 
table.  Once an accord has been signed, as was the case in 
Bosnia, NATO's presence will be essential to implementing the 
military aspects of the accord, separating the forces and 
supervising troop withdrawal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>NATO will be just as important in establishing a safe and stable 
environment for the civilian reconstruction of the country and 
the establishment of peace, and that is what we are talking 
about.  This is a vital contribution that NATO, with its 
incomparable experience, can readily handle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As regards the United Kingdom, London would like to help by 
sending troops to establish peace in the Serb province, but only 
as part of an international force ensuring stability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To respond to the member for Compton—Stanstead, I read in the 
same paper that the some 8,000 British soldiers are on standby 
and that according to the Pentagon spokesperson, the rapid 
dispatch of marines is an obvious option. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can see therefore that other countries are preparing to 
intervene under the NATO umbrella. 
As concerns Canada, we have been playing an important role in 
the Balkans for a number of years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After years of peacekeeping with the blue berets serving as part 
of the United Nations' forces in Bosnia, we will continue as a 
member of NATO and its stabilization force to make a significant 
contribution to peace in the region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The international community recognizes that NATO has played a 
vital role, not only to establish peace in Bosnia, but to help 
preserve this peace and to bring the country closer to stability 
and normality.  Once again, NATO is called on to establish peace 
in the Balkans and, once again, Canada must be prepared to play 
its role. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The international community is contemplating deploying 30,000 
men under NATO command in Kosovo to oversee the application of a 
future peace accord. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this crucial time, in this crucial place, we must protect the 
investments we and our allies have made in the Balkans over the 
past ten years. Recent history has shown NATO can play a 
positive role in supporting the international community's 
determination to restore peace and promote stability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly NATO's presence in Kosovo is critical if one wants to 
give peace a real chance. It is a well known fact that for a 
long time now President Milosevic has been making commitments, 
only to break them as soon as he no longer is the focus of 
international attention. It thus follows that a peace agreement 
without teeth would be easy to ignore and would most likely 
fail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>NATO's credibility made these negotiations possible, and without 
it peace would not last in Kosovo. 
We believe Canada, as an important member of the alliance, has a 
crucial role to play in any NATO operation in Kosovo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have accomplished a lot, but there is still a lot to do. 
NATO's role in Kosovo is clear and crucial, and Canada has an 
important role to play to ensure the alliance's intervention is 
a success.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Julian Reed (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, earlier in the evening 
during the debate, I inadvertently misled the member for Halifax 
West concerning a briefing tomorrow. 
Apparently what was news earlier today is not news now.  I ask 
him to accept my apology and my withdrawal in the spirit in which 
it is given.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on as well because my speech will focus on the 
Central African Republic.  I want to point out to him that 
concerning briefings on that part, on February 9 at the regular 
House leaders meeting the leaders of all the official parties 
agreed that this matter could be dealt with in committee and due 
notice was given. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Few areas of national endeavour come close as peacekeeping to a 
source of national pride and international respect and influence. 
In this House we have a responsibility to examine current and 
possible peacekeeping operations.  We owe it to the peacekeepers 
and to the mothers and brothers and sisters and fathers to make 
very good use of this time tonight.  Anything less would be a 
disservice to those who wear the uniform of the Canadian Armed 
Forces and who daily put their lives on the line for us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This country strongly supports a continued primary role for the 
United Nations in the maintenance of international peace and 
security.  Canada's pre-eminence in peacekeeping has resulted 
from our willingness to become involved and our ability to do so 
quickly and effectively.  This has won us the acclaim and 
admiration of the entire international community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government is proud of Canada's peacekeeping tradition and 
respects the sacrifices of Canadian men and women who have worn 
the blue beret.  We are asking them to take up the blue berets 
once again, travel thousand of kilometres away from Canada and 
help unfamiliar people to make sense of their own lives.  The 
government believes Canada must continue to participate in the 
Mission des Nations unies en République centrafricaine, MINURCA. 
This is a concrete example of our support for the UN and our 
concern over continuing conflicts in Africa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No area of policy has been more openly discussed than Canada's 
contribution to international security.  Canadians of all walks 
of life continually express their views on Canada's participation 
in peacekeeping operations.  They demand that parliament ensure 
our peacekeepers are properly supported, properly equipped and 
that they are sent on missions which make sense and where the 
Canadian contribution is used effectively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The events being discussed here tonight serve to underscore the 
crucial role parliamentarians can and must play in examining 
matters of international peace and security.  The situation in 
Kosovo has given rise to careful and meaningful debate tonight. 
The standing committees have kept a close watch on the UN 
peacekeeping operation in the Central African Republic.  The 
government sincerely hopes that parliamentarians will continue to 
work on Kosovo and the Central African Republic and on other 
priority issues of foreign and defence policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliament is fully engaged as part of the overall Canadian 
effort to build a safer and more just global community.  We are 
gratified by the contributions made by all members of the House 
so far and are taking careful note of the points raised by 
members of all parties here tonight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the ministers have noted, the United Nations peacekeeping 
operation in the Central African Republic has been in existence 
for almost a year.  Canada has been involved since the beginning 
for several good reasons.  Our troops have performed admirably 
and have made a clear contribution to the overall success of the 
mission so far.  We fully anticipate that this success can be 
continued throughout 1999 until the current mandate and 
objectives have been completed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The year 1993 was crucial in the democratic development of the 
Central African Republic.  After years of struggle for democracy, 
the CAR held free and fair presidential elections for the first 
time in its history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of the Central African Republic are among the poorest 
of the poor. 
The CAR is a land locked country with few marketable resources.

<A HREF="#LINKT85"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1998 United Nations human development index ranked the 
Central African Republic 154th out of 174 countries.  Canada was 
marked first.  Real per capita gross domestic product is 
approximately $1,092 in U.S. currency, less than one-twentieth of 
the gross domestic product enjoyed by Canadians.  Life expectancy 
in the CAR is 48 years.  The average Canadian can expect to live 
31 years longer than the average person in the Central African 
Republic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to severe economic and developmental constraints and 
the growing pains that have come with a brand new multiparty 
political system, the CAR has to deal with internal and external 
conflicts.  The government of President Ange Félex Patasse has 
for several years now faced unrest among some members of the 
country's military.  Soldiers have mutinied on several occasions. 
French troops then stationed in the CAR were called on to quell 
the unrest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the terms of a 1997 peace accord rebels and forces loyal 
to the president agreed to establish a multinational Mission 
Interafricaine de Surveillance de l'Application des Accords de 
Bangui.  MISAB's job was to maintain peace and security in the 
capital city Bangui and to monitor the implementation of the 
peace agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By early 1998 with MISAB's mandate winding down and long planned 
withdrawal of French military forces underway, it was clear that 
further international assistance was needed to keep the Central 
African Republic on a even keel.  On March 27, 1998 the UN 
security council unanimously adopted resolution 1159 establishing 
MINURCA.  This new UN mission has been deployed in the CAR since 
April 15, 1998 with some 1,350 troops from six African countries, 
France and Canada.  A Canadian forces contingent of approximately 
47 has been providing core communication services to MINURCA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>MINURCA was mandated first and foremost to assist the legitimate 
government of the Central African Republic to maintain security 
in and around the capital.  Other key functions have included 
dealing with surrendered weapons and demobilised factions, 
ensuring the security and freedom of movement of UN personnel, 
training civilian police, and providing advice and technical 
support for legislative elections. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The activities of MINURCA in the Central African Republic have 
been absolutely essential to maintaining stability in that part 
of the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government and the Canadian people are proud of Canada's 
role as world leader in the field of peacekeeping and as a 
reliable alliance partner and supporter of the United Nations. 
MINURCA is important for Canadians, for Africans and for the 
international community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us tell our peacekeepers in the Central African Republic 
that the Parliament of Canada is thinking of them, that we 
support them and will welcome them home with honour when their 
work is complete. 
<P><A NAME="LINK191"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
was looking forward to tonight and to this debate.  I have to say 
that I was profoundly disappointed.  The Minister of National 
Defence and the Minister of Foreign Affairs were here to brief 
the House and the Canadian people as to the situation is Kosovo, 
and to inform everyone of Canada's role, as best they could, up 
to this point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am confused over some of the information that came from both 
these ministers. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2110"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT87"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT87"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 2110

<A HREF="#LINKT86"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On one hand they talk about acceptable levels of risk that our 
military men and women would be placed in if sent to Kosovo. They 
talked about the rules of engagement and there was some 
indication that there would be combat troops sent over.  On the 
other hand, the foreign affairs minister brought up the point 
that it would be a non-interventionist type force, a peacekeeping 
force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem that exists right now in Kosovo is that there needs 
to be peace.  I do not know how peace can be kept in the midst of 
war.  That sounds like another Bosnia situation to me where our 
troops were chained to poles, a sight for the world to see. It 
raised all kinds of questions in the minds of the people in this 
country as to what our military was doing chained to poles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was embarrassing to say the least to know that our troops, 
fighting men and women who should have been engaged in battle 
protecting themselves and their equipment, were in that kind of 
horrible dilemma and needed a negotiator to get them out of 
trouble. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to see our Canadian men and women placed in that 
kind of a role again.  I cannot imagine that happening.  I do not 
think the Canadian public wants to see that and yet this is what 
seems to be the message coming from the minister of defence in 
part but definitely from the foreign affairs minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is need for debate but not from this level because 
obviously the government side has to resort to newspapers to 
really find out what is happening in Kosovo as the previous 
speaker just alluded to in her statement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There seems to be a real lack of information on the part of the 
government.  One would have to ask why that information is not 
there.  Why is the government side not able to information this 
House and the Canadian public about what on earth is going on 
over in Kosovo?  I can only think of one reason, that Canada has 
been cut out of the negotiations at the international level, both 
in NATO and probably in the UN, because she is no longer a 
player, she is no longer able to contribute.  That is what I 
believe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To have to go through this situation tonight with the foreign 
affairs minister unable to inform this House and all members in 
it and the Canadian public about the situation in Kosovo and 
Canada's role is a sham.  It is disgraceful. I expected a lot 
more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Red Deer spoke about the Central African 
Republic.  I will base most of my comments with reference to the 
Kosovo question. It certainly is more complicated than the 
Central African Republic but it needs to be addressed in some 
terms that we can all think about and questions that should be 
answered before decisions of any kind are taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to take the opportunity first to argue in favour of 
lending morale support to international action to end the 
suffering in Kosovo.  Canada has an undeniable obligation to its 
NATO allies.  We also have a proud history of international 
engagement and involvement and we should not let that lapse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the alliance decides to take military action Canada must 
support that.  We have an obligation to support that.  That is a 
moral obligation.  No one should accept any form of ethnic 
cleansing.  There is our moral obligation.  And we have a moral 
obligation to take action against the systemic murder and torture 
of innocent civilians.  That has been going on for some time.

<A HREF="#LINKT87"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no doubt that the international community must not 
stand idly by while Serbian forces commit flagrant human rights 
atrocities against Kosovars. Ultimately we must support our 
allies.  Canada cannot shirk from its responsibility in this 
regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nevertheless, there are some serious questions concerning 
possible military action which give us cause for concern.  We 
have a duty to ask these questions. There is an obligation to the 
Canadian troops whose lives we may put on the line. A series of 
questions must be asked and no answers have been supplied by the 
government thus far. Granted, there may be some questions that 
cannot be answered at this point in time but the government does 
not seem to be moving in that direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the questions:  One, have all diplomatic efforts to 
resolve the crisis failed?  Two, what are the dangers and 
possible implications of military action?  Three, is there true 
multinational support for this mission into Kosovo?  Four, is 
there a workable plan for military action? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Five, what precisely is Canada's role to be?  This is a major 
point.  There are almost conflicting points of view between the 
foreign affairs minister and the defence minister. Six, is that 
role realistic in terms of Canada's military capability? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seven, who will command Canadian troops? I think that is a very 
important role which will concern a lot of soldiers. There are so 
many different countries participating in peacekeeping missions 
in that region.  The troops could fall under the jurisdiction of 
some other commander and they may not be very comfortable with 
that.  I certainly would not be after having seen some of the 
things that have happened in other peacekeeping missions Canada 
has been involved in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us go back to the first question.  Have diplomatic efforts 
failed?  We have yet to see.  The Serbs continue to drag their 
feet.  They have been negotiating hard for their own position to 
maintain control of that area.  They do not want NATO forces in 
there. That was pretty clear right from the very beginning.  That 
question has yet to be answered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the second question, there is obviously a deep 
concern about the fighting in Kosovo and whether it may escalate 
into other countries.  We have troops right now in Bosnia.  Could 
they be affected if things go sour in Kosovo?  Who is going to 
protect our Canadian troops?  Is there some sort of an extraction 
force? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next question concerns a workable plan for military action. 
We have not seen anything like that and there have been no 
assurances tonight that there will be limitations and what those 
limitations will be.  It is very unfortunate because there is an 
equipment problem in our military and to go into any hot spot, a 
high intensity conflict or even a low intensity conflict with 
those problems, the lives of our troops will be in danger.  There 
is no question about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of the questions including the ones I raised tonight have 
yet to be answered.  It is incumbent upon the government to keep 
everyone informed.  I do not believe at this stage of the game 
that the government is doing that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Order, please. Perhaps the 
hon. member for Calgary Northeast would clarify this for the 
chair. Is it the intention of the hon. member to split his time 
with the member for Calgary West? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger:</B>  Mr. Speaker, my colleague has advised me 
that he would give me some more time if I needed it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Then it is up to 
you.  If you keep going then you are taking a 30-minute slot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am going to take a little 
more time here.  It is important to go back to the points I 
mentioned. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2120"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT89"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT89"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 2120

<A HREF="#LINKT88"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is very much unaware of the implications when it 
comes to sending troops.  Actually it seems that the foreign 
affairs minister is running the military.  The minister has come 
up with a policy of soft power. I still do not know what that 
means but it sure as blazes scares me.  If we are going to depend 
on our troops and soft power is the motivating factor, I think we 
are in trouble.  It sounds like flower power to me and people who 
were raised in the sixties would understand what flower power is 
all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The defence minister has already implied that the troop 
selection number will be around 500 to 800.  The Canadian army is 
already stretched to the limit despite the claim made in the 
government's white paper on defence.  We cannot send a combat 
capable brigade overseas.  All we can send is a smaller battalion 
group force and that would put a severe strain our capabilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Time and time again it comes back to the issue of equipment. I 
was over in Bosnia, as was with the member for 
Compton—Stanstead. We both have had the opportunity to examine 
various equipment that the military is using.  I was not aware 
that Coyotes were rolling off the assembly line.  The minister of 
defence mentioned that tonight.  It was a remarkable revelation. 
There has been no announcement of it. Certainly they are on line 
but I would suggest that if troops were going over there, they 
would need those vehicles and some pretty good fire power too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To my knowledge that has not been considered nor is it part of 
the completed plan of the military to mount guns on those new 
APCs.  That is a deficiency right there.  That would concern me 
if I were a soldier.  What kind of equipment is there?  Apart 
from that, all we have is 20-year old tanks, 30-year old 
self-propelled artillery, 40-year old towed artillery and 
tactical helicopters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister mentioned something about tactical helicopters for 
lift.  Obviously the minister has not read the auditor general's 
report nor rode around in one of these helicopters.  I suggest 
that the minister be the first man off the helicopter just before 
it lands on the ground.  He would have a new hairdo.  There is a 
static electricity and shock problem. Those helicopters cannot be 
used for what they were intended. Not only do they have that 
problem but their lift capacity is far lower than what it was 
intended to be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the military were to use that helicopter as an extraction 
machine to pull troops out of a troubled area, a gun cannot be 
mounted because it would be too heavy.  We have 100 brand new 
helicopters that just came off the line last year at a cost of 
$1.2 billion, and they cannot be used for what they were 
intended. The minister talks about using those tactical 
helicopters, and I use the word tactical loosely because they 
cannot do the job.  They are junk.  One hundred new helicopters 
and they are junk.  They cannot be used as tactical helicopters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the armoured personnel carriers, certainly some good 
equipment, yet there are not in full use.  They are not coming 
off the assembly line fast enough nor from what I understand, are 
they armed properly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our troops are going to have to live by their wits because there 
is no one to take them out if they get into trouble.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the circumstances, troops sent into a low intensity 
conflict area like that would be sitting ducks.  If we consider 
the mountainous terrain in Kosovo, it would be a grave mistake if 
we were to again send troops into ground like that if we did not 
have good support.  So we have to turn to our allies again.  That 
is troubling, because we do not have the capability to survive on 
our own, not even to protect our own men and women if they get 
into trouble in a place like that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have good cause to be concerned about the poor position 
Canada is regarding the decision making process in this NATO 
area.  Because our contribution is so limited now, we do not sit 
at the negotiating table any more.  The minister ought to know 
what the negotiating table is.  He has been weak in delivering 
funds to support our military.  He is also very weak when dealing 
with a good plan to keep our troops safe and give them the 
support they need overseas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It all comes down to this.  The Liberal government has cut $7.8 
billion from the defence department since it took office.  It has 
effectively removed the combat readiness of our forces. Our 
allies know it and it has seriously damaged our international 
credibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, we must ultimately support the alliance and we 
must support our troops if committed.  We must however, be clear 
and realistic about Canada's role.  The Canadian forces must not 
be committed to a mission which is beyond the operational 
capability of the military.  We must not send our troops anywhere 
without reflecting on the practical implications of the mission. 
We must support our allies, but we must also support our troops.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Price (Compton—Stanstead, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
thought the hon. member for Calgary Northeast was just starting 
to roll. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member talked about the famous helicopters and about our 
working with our allies.  Unfortunately we cannot even work with 
our allies because we cannot talk to them.  The radios in the 
helicopters do not work.  They only work to talk to each other. 
It is a strange situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member, one of the Liberal members and I were in 
Washington a little over a week ago.  We had some briefings from 
our American friends. What they had to say was very interesting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all they did not even mention Canada. They were talking 
about Kosovo and what would probably happen going in there.  They 
were looking at probably 2,000 to 4,000 troops.  It was quite 
clear that those 2,000 to 4,000 troops would probably be marines 
and would probably be in and out very quickly.  They were only 
talking about showing a presence on the ground. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is probably what our Canadian troops should really be 
looking at too. We do not want another long term stay like there 
was in Bosnia.  We do not have the troops to do it.  The turnover 
is just not working out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to hear the member's comments on that particular 
scenario and how we could go into the area for a while to 
establish our presence and show that we are supporting our NATO 
allies.  By the way, most of our NATO allies who were with us in 
Washington agreed that it should be European troops on the ground 
in Europe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the member's 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was in Washington with the member and several other 
parliamentarians and there was someone from the Liberal side at 
the briefing.  There was a tour of various places, the State 
Department, the Pentagon, the war college in Carlisle, 
Pennsylvania. 
It was a real eye-opener, I must say.  They talked about risks. 
They talked about protection of the homeland.  They talked about 
Kosovo and the fact that they should be in and they should be 
out.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be nice to say that Canada should do the same thing—I 
would agree with that wholeheartedly—and to say then that Europe 
could move back in with its peacekeeping role or its peace 
maintenance role and look after things afterward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I shudder when I look at Canada's military and the backup to it. 
Where is the backup?  The Americans have all kinds of fire power 
behind them.  If their boys get into trouble they are in there 
with their helicopters and they will take them out of there.  We 
do not have that kind of capability.  We should have because we 
have had our members in these hot spots.  Bosnia was one such 
place.  Kosovo is very similar to what happened in Bosnia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would not want to see our men and women trapped somewhere and 
we could not get them out.  I find that unacceptable.  I think 
most Canadians would find that very unacceptable if they knew the 
plight our military was in and the expectations across the floor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not coming from a military standpoint at all.  The foreign 
affairs minister is driving our military.  Unfortunately we could 
never participate in a role like the Americans can, even though 
we could if we had the equipment.  We could never do it because 
we just do not have the equipment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK193"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for Mississauga 
South. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This debate is in many respects a reprise of the debate we had 
in the House on October 7, 1998 on the peacekeeping issue.  It 
enables us to reiterate some points in the evolving 
constitutional law of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government is not the Government of the United States.  We 
are not bound by the United States constitution.  The power to 
make war, to declare war, is within the prerogative power of the 
executive alone here.  Even in the United States undeclared wars, 
which are the phenomena of our times, are a different 
constitutional system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What our government has done is to engage, to submit to the 
House of Commons any question of the involvement of Canadian 
Armed Forces in service outside Canada.  That is to say, when 
parliament is in session, we will allow a House debate.  When 
parliament is not in session, a practice which I in fact was the 
instrument of in the last parliament when I was parliamentary 
secretary, we will inform the leaders or the porte-parole of the 
opposition parties of our intention.  That is the constitutional 
law of parliament today.  It is part of our conventions and I 
welcome its reiteration in this case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue that I am addressing myself to is really the issue of 
international law, the technical base of our involvement, because 
many of the high policy aspects, the political foreign policy 
aspects have been already covered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are others like Dean Acheson, President Truman's secretary 
of state, who said that survival of the state is not a matter of 
law; it is a matter of power.  I think most of us would prefer 
President Kennedy's point that a great state wishes its actions 
to be in conformity with international law, not merely in terms 
of the substantive principles but also in terms of the manner of 
exercise, that the more moderate controls less than force are 
controlling when they are available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our approach to involvement in military operations abroad has 
without exception been with the United Nations under the United 
Nations charter.  It is our great foreign minister and later 
Prime Minister Lester Pearson who developed the concept of UN 
peacekeeping.  It was a notion implicit in chapter 6 of the 
charter as drafted, but until the Suez war it was not an 
actuality.  As has been said in this debate, it involves the 
interposition of unarmed forces between combatants who normally 
have already agreed to cease hostilities and want a face-saving 
way out of that. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2135"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT91"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The gap between peacekeeping in chapters 6 and 7 of the charter 
is a very large one.  Chapter 7, the imposition of force, 
gets into the areas that are under interdiction in the United 
Nations charter itself.  The principle of the non-use of force, 
which is one of the imperative principles of the United Nations 
enshrined in one of the opening sections, article 2(4) of the 
charter, is also the key to chapter 7 of the charter.  The use of 
force is outlawed except in the limited situation of self-defence 
which is strictly defined and in accordance with United Nations 
practice must be authorized by UN Security Council 
resolutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a fact that even in operations that have been strictly 
chapter 7 operations, for example the original gulf war in 
1990-91 where the authority was security council umbrella resolutions, 
some very general and very many of them under which the United 
Nations command force operated, there was no direct involvement 
of Canadian forces in armed military offensive action.  Ours was 
an ancillary role. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was true again in the activities in 1996 in which we 
committed ourselves but in which we were not directly engaged. 
Ours was an ancillary, supporting role.  We ourselves have been 
aware of the difficulty of legal definition and of establishing a 
legal base when we get into offensive armed military operations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of regional organizations has been raised.  It is true 
that the legal justification or raison d'être of regional 
military organizations today comes from the United Nations 
today and only from the United Nations charter.  They 
cannot exceed the mandate of the United Nations charter.  They 
cannot exceed or transgress the stipulations limiting the use of 
force which are established in the charter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a discussion with a European diplomat in recent days I talked 
about the issue of whether NATO itself, as a regional security 
organization, could not give a contractual style legal 
justification within its region.  The problem with that would be 
within Europe itself.  This would exclude the strangers to 
Europe, and I use that in the geographical sense, Canada and the 
United States.  For our purposes the security council is our 
source of power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are aware of the limitations in article 27(3), the veto 
power given to the big powers.  We are aware of the possibility 
of a wilful or intemperate use of the veto power to obstruct the 
primary peacekeeping role of the United Nations.  As the member 
for Beauharnois—Salaberry reminded himself, that was overcome by 
the uniting for peace resolution in which it was established 
quite clearly that the UN general assembly could fill the gap. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The case of Nicaragua and the United States establishes that the 
United Nations does not cover the whole field of international 
law.  There remains the area of customary international law. This 
is perhaps the most interesting area of international law because 
it is in the new concept of international humanitarian law. 
Humanitarian intervention is given a role more noble and more 
altruistic than its 19th century essentially colonialist 
application by European and other powers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is in this area in which there is not much doctrine—there is 
certainly no jurisprudence constante in the sense of court decisions—that 
I think the future lies.  It is perhaps best there.  If we have 
reached a situation where common humanity cries out for 
intervention, that is where the direction for support should be 
placed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My advice is to rely on the security council resolution and a 
recent one where possible, but the new norms of the new 
international law are there and they have a habit, the new 
customary law, of galloping along to meet new realities.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is a pleasure to speak to the motion calling on the House to take 
note of possible Canadian peacekeeping activities in Kosovo and 
possible changes to our peacekeeping activities in the Central 
African Republic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First I would like to address some comments to the issues 
relating to the situation in the Central African Republic 
beginning with the background to the current situation that we 
are facing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The past several years have been enormously difficult ones in 
that country.  In November and December of last year, free and 
fair legislative elections were held.  These were the first 
tentative steps toward the restoration of national institutions 
since dire political and economic conditions swept the country in 
1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In recent years, unpaid soldiers mutinied on three separate 
occasions and French troops were brought in to quash the 
uprisings.  In January 1997 the rebel soldiers and those forces 
still loyal to President Patassé signed the Bangui accords which 
addressed measures necessary to bring peace back to that country. 
This agreement also established the Mission Interafricaine de 
Surveillance de l'Application des Accords de Bangui, or commonly 
referred to as MISAB. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This mission, made up of military and civilian personnel from 
France and six African countries, was created in order to 
maintain peace and security and to monitor the implementation of 
the Bangui accords.  In June 1997, MISAB was forced to put down 
another mutiny against the government.  Meanwhile, conditions in 
the country continued to deteriorate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By early 1998 MISAB's mandate was coming to an end and French 
troops had begun their withdrawal.  It was apparent, however, 
that further international assistance was required if the Central 
African Republic was to remain free of violence.  In March of 
last year the UN Security Council unanimously adopted resolution 
1159 establishing a UN peacekeeping operation to replace MISAB. 
The initial three month mandate of this new mission, the Mission 
des Nations unies en Republique centrafricaine, or MINURCA, began 
with 1,350 troops from six African countries, France and Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As was previously outlined in the debate, MINURCA was given a 
variety of roles including maintaining security in and around the 
capital of Bangui, training civilian police and ensuring the 
security and freedom of movement of UN personnel.  This mandate 
was extended in July 1998 and again the following October. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The UN Secretary General recognized the progress that had been 
made in his December 1998 report to the security council 
suggesting that MINURCA was a success story so far.  UN 
involvement has allowed the Central African Republic to become as 
he said “an island of relative stability in an otherwise wartorn 
region”.  He reported that the mission had played an important 
role in the legislative elections just a couple of months ago and 
had been instrumental in helping the government prepare plans for 
restructuring the army and civilian police force.  As we also 
know, the UN presence launched a human rights awareness campaign 
and provided medical and humanitarian assistance in and around 
Bangui.  In addition, the stabilization of the country has led to 
some economic recovery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nevertheless the secretary general also noted that peace remains 
fragile and that the political climate is still permeated by 
division and distrust.  He concluded that continued MINURCA 
presence is required at least until the fall of 1999 when there 
will be presidential elections.  The UN Secretary General, Mr. 
Annan, is recommending that MINURCA's mandate should be extended 
and that the force structure should remain essentially the same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current mandate will expire at the end of this month. 
MINURCA still has a very important role to play in a slow but 
steady recovery of the Central African Republic.  It is important 
to seize that opportunity to build on our success to date. 
Canadian participation is vital in this regard as our forces are 
providing the communications framework for the multinational 
force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the joint defence and foreign affairs committee meeting last 
April, members of parliament recognized the importance of this 
contribution and unanimously resolved that Canada should 
participate in MINURCA.  Today there are compelling reasons to 
support both the extension of MINURCA as well as our continued 
participation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The extension would allow MINURCA forces to continue to foster a 
secure and stable environment so that the presidential elections 
scheduled for later this year can take place in a free and fair 
way.  It would also continue to foster the process of 
reconciliation and reconstruction in the Central African 
Republic.

<A HREF="#LINKT93"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The key considerations in this matter are clear.  First, given 
our past involvement in the region and our record of leadership 
in peacekeeping and peace support operations, it is only natural 
that the UN would look on us to stay the course.  We are in a 
position to share our valuable experience and to work with the 
Africans to help them to find lasting solutions to complex the 
challenges they face.  Through MINURCA and other operations, 
through our memberships in La Francophonie and through our 
membership in an ad hoc UN group known as the friends of the 
Central African Republic, Canada has already made meaningful 
contributions to international efforts to maintain stability in 
Africa.  The UN is looking to us for help by continuing in this 
effort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, we are in privileged during our two year membership on 
the UN security council, and during our presidency of the body 
this month, to make an especially meaningful difference efforts 
to improve the situation in the Central African Republic. Our 
continued participation in MINURCA is a natural way of making 
most of our opportunities in this sphere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the skills and professionalism of our troops would 
clearly of enormous benefit to our colleagues in MINURCA.  As is 
well known, Canada has contributed to almost all UN peacekeeping 
missions and along the way has developed a wealth of experience. 
This experience and our ability to work in English and in French 
make Canadian soldiers perfectly suited to work alongside other 
military contingents of MINURCA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Central African Republic we have a chance to continue to 
help foster stability in a troubled and fragile place.  We have 
the opportunity to demonstrate once again our continued ability 
and willingness to promote international peace and security. 
Finally, we have another chance to reflect the wishes of 
Canadians who have told us that they want Canada to continue to 
work toward a stable global order.  In my view if the right 
security and other assurances can be provided these alone are 
compelling reasons for us to continue our efforts to make a 
difference in the Central African Republic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the final moments I have I would like to briefly comment with 
regard to our position in Kosovo.  Earlier this day I listened 
carefully to the Minister of Foreign Affairs and to the Minister 
of National Defence.  All parliamentarians appreciated their 
words of praise for our troops and about the need for Canada's 
continued participation, particularly in Kosovo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Foreign Affairs said something that I thought 
was very relevant, very simple but straightforward.  He referred 
to our participation not just as a peacekeeping contingent but 
for civil peace building.  This aspect of peace building is 
extremely important.  Canada has developed an international 
reputation as peacekeepers as well as peace builders.  It is that 
reputation, that skill and that ability that we can bring to the 
situation in Kosovo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister also referred to the human rights situation, the 
fact that young children are being drawn into military conflict 
and that Canada as an internationally recognized champion of 
human rights around the world is well suited.  It is important 
for us to play a role there.  I wanted to highlight that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the minister concluded his speech he finally asked 
parliamentarians to put on record their views on this matter.  I 
am pleased to have participated in this debate and I am pleased 
to support the minister's call for parliamentarians to support 
our participation in Kosovo as well as in the Central African 
Republic.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening to participate in this 
special debate on sending Canadian troops to Kosovo and to the 
Central African Republic to conduct peacekeeping operations. I 
will not speak as an expert, I do not claim to be an expert in 
external affairs or defence, but rather as the member 
representing a riding in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have had the opportunity to participate in this kind of debate 
in the past, the debate on Bosnia for instance, because soldiers 
from Quebec and Canada were to be deployed. People from my 
riding were among those who eventually participated in those 
missions.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This gives a different perspective to such situations, and I 
think it is important to take the attitude we are taking. I 
believe it is important to have debates like the one we are 
having this evening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Basically, what holding a debate like this one means is that we 
believe in discussion rather than force. We believe that people 
can often be convinced to settle difficult situations 
peacefully. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Government of Canada wants not only to enjoy the 
privileges but also to assume the obligations associated with 
its election to the security council and its present position as 
chair, it is important that government decisions be supported by 
the House, unless the situation is extremely urgent. It allows 
us to see, especially with regard to these kinds of 
international issues, if there is a consensus, if a common 
position can be arrived at to contribute to the quality of the 
international debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not kid ourselves. What is going on right now in 
Rambouillet is a negotiating game in which the various parties 
involved will be influenced by the strength of those who favour 
a particular way of solving the problem over others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the U.S. Secretary of State went to Rambouillet, she told 
the parties they had to choose between working hard to find a 
compromise that would allow them to live in normal political 
states, or to be caught up once again in the vicious circle of 
permanent conflict. In this debate on Kosovo, it is important to 
be well aware of the role of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must also be aware of the fact that Canada must show 
leadership, as I said earlier. The time has come for the 
international community to take action. We have had signs, over 
the last few weeks, that efforts to solve this conflict would 
intensify. Members who spoke before me talked about, among other 
things, the similar debate that took place in this House on 
October 7, 1998. At that time, we talked about the situation in 
Kosovo, about the need to adopt a humanitarian approach and to 
seek a political solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, a few months later, there is still no solution on the 
table. Proposals have been made. There is a will to come to an 
satisfactory solution, and our interventions must be made in 
that context. We have to ask ourselves what more we can bring to 
the table, what contribution we can make to help both sides find 
a peaceful solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an urgent need to take action, if only on a strictly 
humanitarian level. Many Kosovars are already in exile. Many 
people are in danger of being killed, raped or tortured. These 
people are facing very difficult situations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must send a clear message to the Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia. We must not forget the civilian populations which 
have already suffered too much. It is above all for this reason 
that the international community must take action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the geopolitical considerations are but one aspect of the 
problem. However, the fundamental problem is a human one. The 
fact is that we cannot treat human beings as they are being 
treated right now. The international community as a whole must 
be made aware of the urgent need to address the situation. 
Today's debate is a way to help ensure that a consistent and 
effective solution is found. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for us, it is urgent that we take concerted action. The 
minister's concern must be above all a humanitarian one. 
We should not be afraid to consider every solution which could 
lead to a compromise, any solution which stakeholders might 
accept in order to pull out of the conflict and try to resolve 
this difficult international situation. The further you are from 
a problem, the more you tend to believe that solutions are easy. 
But when you get closer, you can see all the implications. 
There is certainly no easy solution, but there is a will to act, 
so let us build on the momentum so that peace is restored as 
soon as possible.

</I></B></P><P align=left>So far Canada has remained firm with Mr. Milosevic. We have 
shown our position very clearly. The presence of Canada and our 
providing a sizeable military contingent, mainly in Bosnia, sent 
a clear message about the role and the solutions we wanted to 
put forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois has often showed how concerned it was about 
the situation in Kosovo by condemning the repressiveness, 
brutality and inhuman behaviour of the Serb security forces. The 
Bloc Quebecois is in favour of sending Canadian troops as part 
of interposition or peacekeeping operations. The Bloc hopes that 
this peacekeeping mission is the result of a negotiated 
agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I read in </I>Le Monde<I> that this is currently one of the major 
problems which have not yet been settled by negotiation. The 
article says that on Tuesday, three days before the deadline, 
Mr. Milosevic reiterated Belgrade's opposition to the deployment 
of a multinational force in Kosovo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Saying today that we support Canadian involvement in a 
peacekeeping mission, provided this mission is the result of 
negotiations and helps to achieve peace, is our way of 
contributing to the search for a solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the meantime, NATO continues to plan for an operation. This 
pressure is part of the negotiating process. 
If there are no clear signals that we really intend to intervene 
if necessary and to help restore sustainable peace or to at 
least eliminate violence, the people who are not really 
interested in this type of solution will just sit and wait. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the international community truly supports this type of 
position, and I think that tonight's debate will help Canada 
make its position clearer, then I believe we can play an 
interesting role. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was clearly established that the deployment of troops is the 
main issue to be resolved during the current negotiations. So, 
let us send a clear message that Canada believes a peacekeeping 
mission might be one of the key elements to a solution, an 
approach to the future that would finally restore peace in this 
part of the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under these circumstances, the Rambouillet negotiations must be 
the last chance negotiations, not in the sense that negotiations 
will come to a stop tomorrow, but in the sense that we have to 
give these people every possibility to succeed and reach an 
agreement before the deadline. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a parliament, however, the mandate we would like the 
government to give our troops must be subject to some 
conditions. First, the security of civilians must be our main 
concern in any intervention. On this issue, I would like to 
qualify the position we have heard from some members in this 
House tonight. We hear a lot about the Canadian soldiers who 
will take part in these activities and we seem to focus only on 
their security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the lives of all the people taking part in this 
operation have to be protected. 
Obviously, we are responsible for the lives of Canadian 
citizens, but we must take a humanitarian approach so that our 
first concern is the safety of individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's interventions must be under the aegis of recognized 
international organizations, ideally the UN or, failing that, 
NATO.  With mandates Canada has accepted from the UN, to do 
otherwise would not be acceptable in the present situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Specific requirements must be imposed on the parties to the 
conflict and stated publicly, and armed force must be used until 
the parties formally agree to meet these requirements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must give thought to the possibility of recognizing the 
independence of Kosovo rather than writing off the idea, because 
it could be one of the solutions to be explored in order to 
restore peace to the region, including at the expiry of the 
three-year transitional period when the Kosovar people will have 
to decide on their political status.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The solution may lie here.  What compromise may be found at the 
end of the current debate, following the exchanges and 
negotiations being carried out at the moment?  All we are saying 
is that we must not eliminate an option at the outset.  We must 
look at all the possibilities and let the negotiations take 
their course. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to mention too that this is a time for modesty in 
international diplomacy.   In this conflict, which began in 
1989, the international community, of which Canada is a part, 
failed to recognize the Bosnian tragedy and the cost in human, 
financial and political terms of the failure to intervene 
forcefully when it was time to do so. 
The time may have come to draw lessons from that experience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is high time Canada, which sits on the UN Security Council 
and has been chairing its sessions since February 1, assumed the 
necessary leadership to resolve this crisis. This country could 
play a greater role in Rambouillet. Following this evening's 
debate and the position adopted by this House, Canada's 
representations will be more visible, more present and will help 
find a solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must also be aware of the stubbornness of certain states that 
refuse to consider the declaration of independence of a wide 
majority of people over a defined territory, when these people 
are being oppressed. As I said earlier, no peaceful solution 
should be dismissed out of hand. We must consider all the 
options. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such an attitude did not stop the inescapable independence of 
Slovenia, Bosnia and Croatia, but it did not prevent a terrible 
war. The international community must take note of the very 
recent past and be innovative and open so that potential 
conflicts can be resolved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Kosovo, it is important that the ongoing negotiations be 
supported by the international community. It is important that 
Canada fully assume its leadership role in that respect. It is 
to be hoped that, following this evening's debate, the Canadian 
government will be on solid ground and will feel it has the 
support of all members of Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to say a few words about the issue of the Central 
African Republic, which is the second part of this evening's 
debate.  At the invitation of the Minister of Foreign Affairs, I 
took part last fall in the meeting of African leaders in Burkina 
Faso and one thing that struck me was the fragility of the 
political situation in Africa.  Situations can change from one 
day to the next and from one country to the next. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Great care must be taken as to the form of intervention.  When a 
peacekeeping mission has been set up and it is felt that this 
type of safeguard might be needed for a while longer, peace must 
be maintained so as to avoid the situation where a decision 
taken in haste or in the interests of short-term savings leads to 
the outbreak of another crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us put all the chances on our side. 
The relations Canada has built up with a number of African 
countries merit this attention.  This is important, because this 
is one continent where all the rich nations can be judged by 
their international actions.  Thought must be given to how 
Africa can be helped to build strong governments, improve 
governance, and acquire independence and the democratic tools 
needed for further progress. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This evening's debate on these two issues shows us that 
discussion is valuable.  As parliamentarians, we have an 
opportunity to bring matters to the public arena.  It is 
important that we make these positions known to Quebeckers and 
to Canadians.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the kind of action international peace is built on. Let 
us continue to clearly show that solutions can be found by 
discussing instead of fighting and making a show of strength. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that sense, our debate tonight is of the kind that will 
eventually contribute to a solution. 
We must recognize that the international community ought to 
intensify its effort and put extra energy into finding a 
solution, so that next week, next month or two months from now, 
we are not faced with a tragic situation in both of these 
countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is already involved in one of them and it would be 
desirable for it to intervene in the other, especially if there 
is an agreement calling for this kind of peace force. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK196"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I listened to the hon. member very carefully but I would like to 
ask him one thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the present situation of calling this debate on such short 
notice and without any briefing to government members on this 
issue, perhaps a decision has already been made and this take 
note debate is merely a formality. On the other hand, we are 
committing our brave men and women of the defence forces to go to 
a country without the proper equipment to help them fight a war 
or maintain peace in that country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not know what the long terms plans are.  We do not know 
how much it will cost.  We do not know a lot of things and so 
many questions have been unanswered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given these situations and these uncertainties, does the member 
feel we should send our forces or not? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête:</B> Mr. Speaker, first of all I would like to remind 
my colleague that we already had a debate on Kosovo in this 
House, on October 7, 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We said then that what was needed was a political settlement on 
a humanitarian basis. Several months later, he proposes instead 
to wait for more information, to wait and see what happens and 
then to hold a debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will this better serve the cause at issue here tonight? Would 
this help find a solution in Kosovo? Would this help the ongoing 
negotiations in Rambouillet lead to some kind of settlement? 
Personally, I do not believe this is the solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do believe that tonight we must send the message that should a 
peacekeeping mission be organized, Canada will participate to 
the best of its abilities and limited financial resources. If 
the government ever spent too much money on this, it would be 
held accountable, and we in this House would let them know what 
we think. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This does not mean the member is wrong. It would be interesting 
to be better prepared. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed we might want to have an annual debate on Canadian 
foreign policy as a whole. We could hold a one- or two-day debate 
during which members could speak on various aspects of a 
specific issue. 
The minister could answer questions, not from a partisan point 
of view as is done in question period, but in a more open debate 
where we would see in advance what the Canadian government's 
approach is with regard to the various problems encountered in 
international politics. It is an interesting avenue that I think 
is worth considering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, to answer my colleague's question, I think it is 
important that we have this debate tonight in the House of 
Commons, even though we do not have all the information required 
on the practical and technical impacts of the intervention, so 
we can send a clear and precise message to the international 
community.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Robert Bertrand (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will share my time with 
the hon. member for Nepean—Carleton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to address the motion moved by the Minister of 
Foreign Affairs regarding Canada's possible role in Kosovo and 
the changes that could be made to our peacekeeping activities in 
the Central African Republic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has been a promoter of internationalism for a long time. 
We fought tyranny during the two world wars, and also in Korea 
and in the Persian gulf. We are a founding member of the League 
of Nations, the United Nations and NATO. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over 100,000 Canadian men and women have served in peacekeeping 
operations all over the world. In fact, Canada has participated 
in almost every UN mission. We have made exceptional 
contributions to international peace and security during 
missions in various countries around the globe, including 
Cyprus, Afghanistan, Rwanda and Haiti. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian forces can really be proud of that tradition of 
commitment and courage. Today, we have once again an opportunity 
to publicly express our support for that tradition and our 
determination to maintain it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me first discuss the fragile peace established by MINURCA, 
the UN mission in the Central African Republic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Established in 1998, MINURCA started carrying out its initial 
three month mandate with 1,350 soldiers from Canada, France and 
six African countries after a series of military mutinies in 
1996 and 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At a meeting of the Standing Joint Committee on Defence and 
Foreign Affairs in April, committee members recognized the 
contribution Canadian forces could make in the context of this 
sort of mission.  They unanimously passed a resolution 
recommending Canada's participation in MINURCA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>MINURCA's mandate consisted in helping the government of the 
Central African Republic maintain security in and around the 
capital, look after the arms given up by demobilized factions, 
ensure the safety and freedom of UN personnel, establish a 
civilian police force and provide limited advice and technical 
support for the legislative elections. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>MINURCA made a lot of gains and in so doing paved the way to the 
political progress necessary to national reconciliation. 
Nevertheless, despite improvements, the UN secretary general 
indicated that a very fragile peace had been established.  He 
considered that an extension of MINURCA's mandate would help 
consolidate the progress made to that point.  The secretary 
general also pointed out that it would be vital to maintain an 
ongoing UN presence to ensure that the presidential elections, 
slated for the fall of 1999, are free and fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By deploying 47 members of the Canadian armed forces to MINURCA, 
our country has made a vital contribution since the start of 
this mission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Provided that certain conditions are met, I think we should 
extend our participation in MINURCA.  Because we are providing 
the signals component, we are pivotal to the mission.  Our 
bilingual soldiers are getting along well with their 
counterparts from other countries also taking part in the 
mission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a wide range of experience to share with African nations 
regarding all sorts of peacekeeping and peacemaking operations. 
Our tradition of and commitment to adopting multilateral 
solutions to peace and security challenges naturally inclines us 
to provide assistance to others when we can change something. 
And, in my view, we can still do this in the Central African 
Republic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For these reasons, we feel that a response to the secretary 
general's request to extend the MINURCA mission is imperative. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2215"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT99"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also recommend that Canada continue to supply a contingent to 
MINURCA, provided that security, logistical and sanitary support 
services are put in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for possible participation by Canada in Kosovo, although the 
details are different, the broad principles are similar to those 
mentioned earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will recall that, during the special debate on Kosovo 
last October, all parties agreed that the crisis had taken on a 
humanitarian dimension.  Members also agreed that Canada should 
continue to support its allies in this struggle against 
aggression and human rights violations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I for one had given many reasons in support of Canada's 
participation in the peace restoring effort in Kosovo. First, we 
have an obligation to support our allies and to respond to the 
acts of violence and human rights violations in Kosovo. Canada's 
commitment to freedom and respect for human rights would become 
meaningless if we failed to act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, Canada should be part of any peacemaking force mobilized 
by NATO following the negotiations because of the alliance's 
proven expertise in carrying out this kind of mission. On the 
eve of NATO'S 50th anniversary, we must continue to co-operate 
with our NATO allies in maintaining peace and stability in 
Europe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, our participation would be in line with our foreign and 
defence policies, which are based on promoting Canadian values 
abroad and contributing to international peace and security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I had indicated that Canada's participation would 
constitute a logical extension of our prior and current 
contributions to UN and NATO peace operations in that region 
since 1991. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My position has not changed since our debate in October. 
Unfortunately, the situation has deteriorated in many regards. 
We cannot accept human rights violations like the ones in Racak, 
nor can we ignore the serious geopolitical problems associated 
with this crisis. I am more than ever convinced that the 
international community, of which Canada is a member, must be 
prepared to take action in favour of peace and stability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During my first trip to Bosnia in 1994, I was able to see the 
damage caused by years of war to the people and the country. I 
witnessed the contribution of the NATO stabilisation force in 
Bosnia when I went back to Bosnia in November 1997 as part of a 
delegation of members from the defence and foreign affairs 
committees. At the time we met with members from the Canadian 
armed forces and we saw all their efforts to promote peace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The international community has taken several steps to bring 
about a peaceful solution to the conflict which has been going 
on in Kosovo since hostilities first escalated in early 1998. We 
are eagerly awaiting the outcome of the Rambouillet negotiations 
hoping the leaders of the Albanians in Kosovo and the 
representatives of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia will be 
able to settle their differences at the negotiating table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge all my colleagues to recognize the seriousness of the 
situation both in Kosovo and the Central African Republic. Under 
these circumstances, we would be well advised to maintain our 
presence in MINURCA in the Central African Republic. Moreover, 
if it is determined that a NATO led implementation force should 
be part of the solution to the crisis in Kosovo, Canada would be 
well advised to be involved in such a force.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Pratt (Nepean—Carleton, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
renewed fighting in Kosovo has once again fixed the eyes of the 
world on the Balkans and as we debate this issue in the House 
tonight we do so with a real hope that a solution can be found. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I direct my remarks to this aspect of the motion we have before 
us.  The contact group sponsored talks between the Serbs and the 
Kosovar Albanians in Rambouillet, France offer for the first time 
the possibility of a solution to this struggle.  We earnestly 
hope the parties can come to an agreement and that the 
differences between them can be resolved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada must be prepared to participate in any potential peace 
agreement emerging from the Rambouillet process.

<A HREF="#LINKT100"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just as we were ready to participate in NATO's implementation 
force upon confirmation of success at the Dayton peace process, 
we must be prepared to react should these talks also succeed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member of the international community, as a member of the 
NATO alliance and as a nation that values peace and democracy, we 
have a moral obligation to participate in a NATO led peace 
operation in Kosovo should such action be deemed necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Peace and security in the Balkans have been under threat for 
nearly a decade now and Canada has joined the international 
community from the beginning to respond to those threats. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I conceive it there are four key reasons why we should 
favourably consider a role in any NATO led operation in Kosovo. 
First, let me remind members that Canada has a proud multilateral 
history.  As a major trading nation, this country thrives in a 
stable, international system where we protect our interests by 
working with others.  While Canada faces no immediate direct 
military threat, we are directly affected by instability 
elsewhere.  Our security and prosperity depend on global peace 
and stability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our willingness to play a meaningful role in international 
relations is a Canadian tradition.  We went to Europe to fight 
for peace in 1914 and returned to do so again in 1939.  After the 
end of the second world war we fought for those same ideals in 
Korea.  In addition, we have done so for many years through our 
commitments to peacekeeping.  Over the last 50 years over 100,000 
Canadian men and women have served in peacekeeping missions 
around the world.  We must continue this tradition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are internationalists and not isolationists by nature. 
We are proud of our heritage of service abroad.  Our 
multilateralism is an expression of Canadian values at work in 
the world.  We care about the course of events abroad and so we 
are willing to work with other countries to maintain peace and 
stability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, our desire to contribute to international security has 
made us active partners in the North Atlantic treaty alliance. 
The North Atlantic community is one of Canada's most important 
and enduring international links.  We are fully committed to 
collective defence and see the alliance as a force for stability, 
deterrence and rapid reaction to emergency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have kept faith with NATO and these ideals for five 
decades now.  We have always been ready to join our allies in 
opposing threats to stability and peace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we face another such situation.  If NATO becomes involved 
in a peace support mission in Kosovo then we should be there to 
play our part.  Canadian participation in a NATO peace mission to 
Kosovo is in every way consistent with our commitment to peace 
and security in the transatlantic region and our commitment to 
the North Atlantic alliance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, the Balkan region is highly volatile and represents a 
serious threat to international peace and security.  Should the 
situation in Kosovo worsen, the risk of neighbouring states 
getting drawn into the conflict would also rise.  Albania, the 
former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia and Bulgaria, as well as 
Greece, Turkey or even more distant powers such as Russia and 
Iran could conceivably become involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Twice in this century brush fires in the Balkans have resulted 
in war in Europe.  Canadians are not blind to the lessons of 
history.  While the chance of another major war seems remote, in 
the Balkans and elsewhere we must persevere with our efforts to 
maintain international peace and security through the 
reinforcement of regional stability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This brings me to my fourth reason for continuing a Canadian 
presence in this troubled region.  We have been an active player 
in the Balkans since war first broke out in 1991.  So long as we 
can make a meaningful contribution to improving the situation 
there we should continue to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the warring factions agreed to a ceasefire in the former 
republic of Yugoslavia in September 1991 we were among the first 
participants in the European community monitoring mission that 
was set up to verify the settlement, contributing up to 15 of the 
mission's 350 civilian and military observers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1992 the UN security council established the United Nations 
protection force in Yugoslavia, UNPROFOR, as an arrangement to 
facilitate a negotiated settlement in an atmosphere of peace 
and security.  Canada contributed two major units, a logistics 
battalion and personnel for various headquarters positions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>UNPROFOR's mandate included the protection and demilitarization 
of the three UN protected areas, deimplementation of various 
ceasefire agreements in Croatia and Bosnia-Hercegovina, the 
delivery of humanitarian aid and the protection and monitoring of 
the no fly zones and the UN safe areas.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>NATO's implementation force or IFOR was the next significant 
step to establishing peace and stability in the Balkan region. 
The purpose of IFOR was to enforce compliance by the warring 
parties in the former Yugoslavia with the Dayton peace accord. 
Canada contributed more than 1,000 personnel, including a brigade 
headquarters, an infantry company, an armoured squadron, an 
engineer squadron, a military police platoon and support 
personnel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Building on IFOR successes was NATO's stabilization force or 
SFOR.  Responding to a UN security council resolution, the North 
Atlantic council authorized in late 1996 a NATO operation to 
support the further implementation of the Dayton peace agreement. 
SFOR's mission, still being carried out today, is to provide a 
continued military presence to deter renewed hostilities and to 
stabilize and consolidate peace in Bosnia-Hercegovina.  There are 
currently about 1,300 Canadian troops deployed with SFOR.  Our 
contingent, deployed throughout an area roughly the size of 
Prince Edward Island, includes a mechanized infantry battalion 
group, national support and command elements and an engineer 
design and works team.  Canada also provides personnel to various 
multinational staff positions in SFOR headquarters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our other operations in the Balkans that Canadian forces 
personnel have or are participating in include a NATO led 
operation enforcing compliance of the no-fly zone over 
Bosnia-Hercegovina, the enforcement of a United Nations embargo 
of the former Yugoslavia, the United Nations mission of observers 
in Prevlaka and the UN preventive deployment force in the former 
Yugoslav republic of Macedonia. We have also been contributing to 
a variety of multinational operations in Kosovo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We currently have 23 troops deployed with the OSCE Kosovo 
verification mission, established to verify compliance by all 
parties to the October 1998 Holbrooke-Milosevic agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our contributions to current NATO operations in Kosovo include 
60 personnel with the extraction force ready to remove OSCE 
verifiers and other designated persons from Kosovo should it 
prove necessary, eight Canadian forces personnel deployed as 
headquarters staff with the Kosovo air verification mission, and 
130 personnel and 6 CF-18s with operation echo, ready to 
participate in any NATO operations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The many operations and missions I have just outlined are 
illustrative of Canada's strong and continued commitment to 
maintaining peace in the Balkan region.  More than 20,000 
Canadian forces personnel have rotated in and out of that 
theatre.  We clearly have invested significant personnel and 
resources in order to promote peace and security there and have 
made a genuine and meaningful difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should maintain that investment because more remains to be 
done, as events of the past few weeks have clearly shown.  Large 
refugee flows, political struggles between various ethnic groups, 
continued human rights abuses and the ever present danger of 
widespread war are all illustrative of just how much more work 
the international community needs to do.  With the right kind of 
agreement out of the negotiations in Rambouillet, we can and 
should once again shoulder our share of the international efforts 
in the region.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
given the situation we are facing today, let us keep the question 
to one side that the brave men and women of the armed forces are 
not well equipped.  They do not have enough facilities to go to 
those countries.  Keeping aside the question of how much it is 
going to cost us, keeping aside what our long term plans are, I 
would like to find out from the member if he knows how much 
involvement we are asking from the European Community or the 
other affected or related countries to deal with this issue in 
their own backyard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to find out from the member what strategy we 
have to deal with the regional security in that area? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Pratt:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would be happy to respond 
to the hon. member's question.  First of all, with respect to the 
issue of how many troops would be provided by other European 
countries, I think it is safe to say that still is part of the 
negotiating process within the NATO member countries. 
Unfortunately we have not yet got an agreement at Rambouillet 
although there are increasing signs that the Americans, the 
French and the British are putting significant pressure on the 
negotiating parties to come up with an agreement.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly when there was discussion about the number of troops 
that would be involved, the numbers were somewhere between 25,000 
and 30,000 troops.  It is obvious that the Europeans would be 
required to shoulder a significant amount of that burden. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of my colleagues and I on the defence committee had the 
opportunity to visit Germany recently to get briefings on what 
was happening with the German armed forces and their views along 
with the foreign ministry officials' views of what was going on 
in Kosovo.  They understand fully the need for more European 
participation in a Kosovo operation. They understand as well as 
we do that if the situation in Kosovo is allowed to deteriorate, 
then the stability of the Balkans itself comes into question. 
That is something that no members of the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization would want to have happen. 
<P><A NAME="LINK200"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
wonder what the Liberal member across the way thinks about the in 
excess of $7 billion worth of cuts his government has made to the 
Canadian military and whether or not he thinks that assists them 
in their mission overseas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Pratt:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is clear that when this 
government took office back in 1993 a number of very difficult 
decisions had to be made.  There were cuts to transfer payments. 
There were across the board cuts in many government departments. 
And yes, there were cuts to the military. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We saw in the budget an increase in funds for health care, a 
rejuvenation of many programs of departments of the government, 
including national defence.  We are going to see in the years to 
come continued reinvestment in Canadian programs and services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the ability of the military to do the job in both 
Bosnia and Kosovo, I have the greatest of respect for our 
commanders in the field both in Canada and overseas.  I had the 
opportunity to see them in action during the ice storm and with 
my colleagues on the national defence committee when we visited 
Bosnia last May. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to the hon. member across the way that they are well 
equipped in Bosnia.  They are fully able to do the job and they 
are doing a tremendous job over there.  If Canadians had the 
opportunity to see what our troops face from day to day they 
would be extremely proud as I was to see that maple leaf flag 
flying over the camp at Velika Kladusa, in Zgon and in other 
camps where the Canadians soldiers are based.  They are doing a 
tremendous job. They have the equipment and they are getting 
better equipment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the years I think the Canadian forces can look forward to 
even greater triumphs in terms of peacekeeping and contributing 
to world peace and security. 
<P><A NAME="LINK201"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, for the 
folks back home I am going to give them a thumbnail sketch of why 
this is going on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This evening we are debating whether or not Canada should be 
sending troops to Kosovo and the Central African Republic.  That 
is the basic gist of why we are here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our servicemen should be commended for their loyalty and 
dedication to Canada.  Even though their morale is at an all-time 
low they should be commended for their continued commitment to 
the armed forces. Despite everything else, it is nothing short of 
outstanding when we consider what they are making do with under 
the circumstances.  My hat tips to the Canadian armed forces and 
I appreciate what they do.

<A HREF="#LINKT103"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To give a little background on the issue, the ethnic Albanian 
majority in Kosovo is mounting an ongoing campaign to liberate 
Kosovo from Serbian control.  The Serbs meanwhile are mounting an 
offensive against the ethnic Albanians in what appears to be an 
attempt at ethnic cleansing.  The North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization, NATO, has served notice that unless Serbian 
aggression toward ethnic Albanians in Kosovo ceases, NATO will 
use military force against Serbian military positions until the 
Serbs back down. Canada has been asked to participate in any NATO 
action in Kosovo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further to the issue of Kosovo, the population of Kosovo is some 
90% Albanian and 10% Serb.  Kosovo had political autonomy within 
Yugoslavia until 1989 when that autonomy was abolished. The 
region is of great historic and symbolic significance to the 
Serbs who lost their national independence to the Turks in the 
battle of Kosovo in 1389.  I will say that date again, 1389. That 
is a long time ago, over 600 years.  I guess some are beginning 
to wonder whether a few even though passionate but poorly 
equipped Canadians are going to be able to rectify a situation 
that has been more than 600 years to the boiling point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to quote someone who I think has relevance with 
regard to this debate, General Lewis MacKenzie.  He stated that a 
full parliamentary debate had to be held on this issue.  In his 
words, “I would like mothers and fathers of soldiers and spouses 
of soldiers if and when they are killed to feel that it was a 
justifiable cause that only can be determined after a public 
debate”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to touch on the fact that one of the Reform 
caucus members, the member of parliament for Calgary Northeast 
and the Reform Party defence critic, has been quoted recently 
that if the number of our forces drops below 60,000, as some 
people are saying, it is unrealistic to participate in activities 
such as Kosovo. I am going to talk about that during my speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite how badly some of our forces would like to see time in 
the field, and I can certainly understand that, nonetheless they 
know and I know, and I am going to talk about it this evening, 
how they are suffering because of the lack of proper equipment 
which they need to be able to get the job done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us run down a top 10 list, a thumbnail sketch of why there 
are problems and then I will put flesh on the bones of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, sending our troops to Kosovo is going to put them at 
risk. That is always the case with military operations. 
Furthermore the current chief of the defence staff and his 
predecessor both have said that Canada is not combat ready.  I 
repeat that, the chief of the defence staff and his predecessor 
have both said that Canada is not combat ready. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is that?  I am going on to my next point.  It is because 
this Liberal government is starving our military. That is why 
this is going on.  How has the government been starving the 
military? The Liberals have siphoned off over $7 billion from the 
military budget since they have come to office. That is why there 
is a problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has cut a third of our military, over 30,000 
personnel.  I guess we could say it all started with Pierre 
Elliot Trudeau and not having a love or appreciation of the armed 
forces, but the song goes on with the Liberals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is not giving our troops the tools they need to 
do the job.  What type of tools are we looking at?  Artillery 
that is 25 years old, helicopters 35 years old, tanks 35 years 
old.  They barely have the funds to train properly never mind an 
insufficient budget for live firing. They cannot even do live 
firing.  I have been on some of these ranges.  It is absurd that 
we are training troops without the ability to do live firing with 
live ammunition.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To be a player in international politics we have to pay the 
price.  If we want to have power and influence to make peace in 
places like Kosovo, we have to pay that price.  The price is 
combat capable armed forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals have failed our hardworking military.  They are 
starving our military the funds they need to do their excellent 
work.  This Liberal irresponsibility, inadequate training and old 
equipment are putting our troops in jeopardy and the blood of our 
troops will be in their hands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a brief thumbnail sketch. I am going to put some meat on 
the bones of this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What type of Canadian contribution to a NATO force is envisaged? 
What size of force is envisaged?  What equipment will it have? 
How can parliamentarians discuss in an informed way what Canada's 
role should be when they do not know these facts? We are being 
asked to send troops but because of all the problems with the 
funding, the equipment and everything else we are going into this 
blind.  And it is not as if that has not been done before by this 
government, has it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Political decisions are being made by the leading western powers 
at negotiations in France, at which Canada has almost no voice. 
Why do we have no voice?  Because our influence in NATO has 
eroded so badly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was in Esquimalt last year I was told that we were going 
to be removed from the grid for undersea mapping because we were 
no longer in the submarine club. The United States would love to 
have an ally to share that information with and to participate in 
games with so they could test their capability.  But when we no 
longer have any ability to provide information for that, they can 
no longer justify keeping us on the grid.  Because of that 
pressure, the government went ahead and purchased the bare 
minimum needed to stay part of the grid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the reason Canada is a joke when it comes to things like 
NATO. That is a travesty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to participate in a NATO military force but the forces 
we have are seriously deficient.  We have no combat helicopters. 
We have no heavy lift helicopters.  We have mostly light armoured 
vehicles, not heavy armoured vehicles.  We have no ability to 
withdraw or reinforce our troops in a crisis due to the lack of 
any strategic lift.  Those are serious problems with this 
mission.  The equipment of the forces is a real disgrace.  It is 
rusting out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One example is the Griffon helicopters. The auditor general 
reported that they have inadequate lift capability.  They have 
poor reconnaissance capability.  They can lift army artillery 
only for very short distances. They have a buildup of static 
electricity.  Yet these are the helicopters we are planning to 
deploy in Kosovo.  They cannot mount guns.  They are unable to be 
used for the purposes for which they were bought. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I list off all these things and the government is still 
considering going ahead and doing these things when it is not 
properly equipping the forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have already one battalion group, 1,300 troops in Bosnia.  On 
February 9 the deputy chief of defence staff stated before the 
House of Commons foreign affairs and defence committee that he 
could have no definitive answer to the question of how many 
troops could be sustained overseas.  Yet we are increasing our 
contingent.  I know the people in the armed forces would like to 
see time in the field. They know and I know and the Canadian 
public now knows that they are being sent into these operations 
without having what they need to do the job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That all being considered, Canada because of all these 
considerations is going to be reliant on our allies for logistics 
in helicopter support.  What other option is there?  We are 
playing Russian roulette with the lives of Canadian troops 
because we do not have the proper things to give them in this 
particular situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A ground invasion of Kosovo has already been ruled out.  If a 
ground invasion has been ruled out, what is left is an air only 
campaign.  There is a question of whether or not that is likely 
to achieve the desired results. With an air only campaign, we are 
sending in helicopters that are ill fitted for the mission. 
It has already been ruled out that there cannot be a ground 
campaign.  It will have to be an air only campaign.  Yet we are 
sending troops into the area without having appropriate air 
support.  I do not know how that makes any sense.  But I guess 
that is Liberal logic when it comes to the armed forces.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to talk about Canada's national interest.  We do have 
national interests in the Balkans.  We certainly have a strong 
interest in regional stability.  We have an interest in ensuring 
that the instability in the Balkans does not spill over into 
neighbouring countries.  But the question is are these vital 
national interests?  Whether these are vital national interests 
has never been adequately addressed by our government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should Canadians die to ensure the stability of the Balkans? 
This is a sobering question.  But we have to reflect on the fact 
that 17 Canadians have already died in Bosnia and more than 100 
have been wounded.  How big a sacrifice can Canada be expected to 
make if our vital interests are not at stake and especially if 
this government is not willing to give them the supplies, 
material and equipment they need to be able to make sure they are 
not putting their lives at any more risk than they absolutely 
need to? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The national interest considerations need to be at the forefront 
when troop deployment decisions are taken by any Canadian 
government.  We owe that to our troops and we owe it to the 
Canadian people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform has laid out six criteria that should be met with regard 
to committing and deploying Canadian troops.  One, there is a 
serious threat to international stability and that diplomatic 
efforts have been exhausted.  Two, that so far as possible there 
is multinational support for military action. Three, that there 
is a workable plan and strategy for military action to resolve 
the issue.  Four, that the plan includes a well defined mission 
and a clear definition of Canada's role.  Five, that the role 
expected of Canada is within our fiscal and military capability. 
Six, that there is a command and control arrangement satisfactory 
to Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have run through six questions and we do not have satisfactory 
fulfilment of these six criteria for the deployment of Canadian 
forces, all this considering that we have a crippled armed 
forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to talk about some of the problems we have. This is a 
question that was posed a few days ago to the defence minister in 
the House of Commons. I quote part of it: “Since the Liberal 
government has come into power it has cut over $7 billion from 
the defence budget. The Sea Kings were grounded again and unable 
to fly.  Pilots are taking risks, undue risks, flying old 
equipment”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When that question was posed, and we all know the problems that 
have happened with the Sea Kings, what did the Minister of 
National Defence say when he was questioned on this important 
subject?  The minister said: “We are developing a procurement 
strategy”.  Men are dying in the field.  I am happy to know that 
our defence minister is developing a procurement strategy.  Good 
for him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the election of 1993 the Prime Minister promised he would 
cancel the Conservative government's EH-101 contract valued at 
$5.8 billion for 50 helicopters.  Those are 1992 estimates.  The 
cost of the promise was approximately $530 million due to 
cancellation costs and penalties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is ironic that the new helicopters are similar in design to 
the cancelled EH-101s.  As a matter of fact, the similarities 
between the models are so prevalent that it forces us to question 
what the real motives behind the Liberal's 1993 election promise 
were. This is an important issue and it will not go away. It will 
only get worse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a news conference in Shearwater regarding ignition 
problems with our 35 year old Sea Kings.  There have been seven 
engine failures in a month, six on start-up and one on taxi. 
This is the same engine of the ill fated Labrador.  We all 
remember the complications when we actually had troops die.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we have unreliable aging aircraft and the government is 
putting lives before budget dollars with this.  This is a 
question that was posed to the Minister of National Defence. What 
did he say when he was asked about our 35 year old helicopters 
that have had seven engine failures?  He said:  “In this case 
there have been starter problems with the engines when they start 
them on the ground”.  Bravo.  Where else do you start helicopter 
engines but on the ground?  Are we supposed to start them in 
mid-air?  Do helicopters just start a thousand feet in the air 
and then plummet to the earth killing the people on board?  I do 
not think so but our good old Minister of National Defence seems 
to think that just might be the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My conservative estimate of what Somalia cost us is $30 million 
although it could have been higher. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will talk to the issue of tanks because we have terribly old 
tanks.  The United States was willing to give us Abrams tanks.  I 
was told this by people in the U.S. embassy and by our own 
Canadian soldiers.  Rather than mothball them in the desert in 
Arizona, the American government was willing to give us these its 
and willing to pay for maintenance costs because we are their 
ally.  This government turned down those tanks.  It would rather 
have them sit in mothballs in Arizona than use this equipment, 
and it bellyaches about funding.  Shame on the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding CFB Calgary was closed.  There were a thousand 
acres of land.  The troops were moved up to Edmonton where there 
were only 640 acres of land.  It does not sound like a very wise 
move in terms of the land space but nonetheless that was done.  I 
have it written down that there was a $65 million price tag but 
there are speculations it cost a lot more than that.  All this 
was going on yet our government continued to cut troops and put 
them into commitments it knows it will not be able to properly 
fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government wants to go ahead and send our troops to Kosovo. 
I know some troops want to see time in the field, and I 
appreciate that.  I could feel that when I was on the Standing 
Committee on National Defence and Veterans Affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish I had more time.  I could go on about other UN 
involvements we have had. For example, they have not solved the 
problems in Angola even though the UN tries to play international 
cop and does not seem to have what it takes to do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on about who will have to pay for this.  The </I>Globe 
and Mail<I> has talked about the fact that paying for these types 
of operations with a shrinking military budget means there will 
have to be more troop cuts, that we will have to rotate more of 
our troops and they will be more tired and more prone to 
accidents and fatalities on the job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could talk about the search and rescue problems we have in 
Esquimalt.  We cannot do our own search and rescue.  We have to 
rely on Americans because of budget cuts and because we do not 
have helicopters.  I could go on and on but I have wrapped up my 
time.  I wish the best of luck to our men and women in the armed 
forces.  I only wish the government appreciated them more and 
funded them properly.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Graham (Toronto Centre—Rosedale, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to speak in the debate this evening, 
however late the hour, to share with members of the House some 
thoughts on this important issue.  I do not believe the last 
member who spoke bothered to address the second aspect of this 
question, whether we should continue our troop presence in the 
Central African Republic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This debate is to deal with two things, whether we should retain 
our troops in the Central African Republic and whether we should 
make our troops available in the event, and only in the event, 
they are needed for an operation in Kosovo.  I would like to 
address those two items. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2255"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT107"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first item is dealt with more simply.  It is a smaller 
number of troops, some 65 or 75 troops, who are in a 
communications position in the Central African Republic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to speak to this because it shows the type of 
commitment that Canada and our armed services are making toward 
peacekeeping in the world.  We need to keep our troops in the 
Central African Republic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an election to be held there shortly.  We have 
responsibilities as a member of the security council to ensure 
peace and security in the world.  We have chosen to be on the 
security council.  We must accept the responsibilities that go 
with that post. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that Canadians and our armed services as well 
would be anxious to serve and to continue to serve in the Central 
African Republic to ensure that an election will be held there in 
a way that will guarantee establishment of a free and democratic 
country there.  It is one of the best things we are doing in the 
world today where we are able to provide to the world some of the 
finest people in terms of peacekeeping. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are some of the finest examples of men and women who are 
able to work in different communities and difficult situations in 
order to bring their expertise, particularly in that area which 
requires bilingual expertise which is the perfect example of what 
we have in our services, and make it work in a way which will 
ensure peace in that African country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be a tragedy if the official opposition were to have 
its way and, for the reasons given by the last speaker in talking 
about the inability of us to survive and provide the services 
necessary to keep those troops there, we were to withdraw from 
that essential function. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of far greater import is the debate over the issue of whether we 
should be prepared to stand and commit troops to Kosovo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will share with the Canadian public and members of the House 
an experience which I had in January this year which makes me 
believe it is not only our duty and obligation but it is common 
sense for us to make available our forces for that operation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will address at the end of my comments the observations of the 
hon. member who preceded me that we do not have the capacity to 
make the commitment I would ask our troops to make. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I happened to be in Vienna at the OSCE parliamentary assembly in 
January this year.  A group of us came together.  The chairman of 
the Russian Duma, a member of the U.S. Congress, a French member 
of parliament, I and other members of parliaments from around the 
world.  We crafted a resolution on Kosovo in which we sought to 
bring both sides together.  We criticized both sides for their 
excesses and asked that both sides come together to achieve a 
peaceful solution to the dispute there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we were leaving Vienna 45 innocent Kosovar civilians were 
taken out by the Serbian police in charge of that country and 
shot point blank, massacred.  I realized then that all the talk, 
all the words in all the parliaments of the world in the end 
cannot change a situation if we are not willing to back up at 
some point our words with some force and some action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is where we are at tonight.  That is what we have to 
determine in this House.  Are we, as representatives of the 
Canadian people, willing to commit our troops, part of ourselves, 
to the process of trying to bring peace to Kosovo? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would not be where we are in the process of trying to bring 
peace to that region if Mr. Milosevic had not been told that 
there will be an employment of force.  We need the presence of 
troops.  We need the threat of troops to kickstart the 
Rambouillet process.  That is now working.  We need the presence 
of troops ultimately to ensure that process will work.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen before Mr. Milosevic and his lack of respect of 
international engagements.  Nothing short of the presence of an 
enforceable mechanism to make sure that he will adhere to his 
responsibilities, if he enters into a political arrangement, will 
make any sense in that arena.  We have learned that through 
bitter experience in the Bosnian theatre and we are learning that 
today in Kosovo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are Canadian troops needed for that?  The Reform Party may well 
take the position that everything I have said is correct but that 
there should not be Canadian troops there.  It is true that we 
need a larger presence of European troops.  This is a European 
problem and Europeans should be in a position to deal with these 
issues themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, there are two features we must bear in mind.  We as 
Canadians have a specific responsibility in peacekeeping because 
we have contributed to the United Nations role in peacekeeping 
and we have made a specific and an enormous worldwide 
contribution to that area.  When we look at the contribution we 
have made in Bosnia we recognize that this is exactly where 
Canadians can make a difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that a force in Kosovo will not be able to make the 
difference that it makes with Canadian troops there.  I have had 
the opportunity and privilege to visit our troops in Bosnia.  Our 
troops are serving there with great pride, with enormous 
professionalism and with great expertise.  With all deference to 
the member who spoke before me, they are doing so knowing they 
are equipped to do their job, are able to do their job, are 
trained to do their job and are proud to do their job.  The 
Canadian people are proud of the job they are doing there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian troops will make a difference in the event that troops 
are required in Kosovo.  I urge our government to ensure, if and 
when the call is made under the UN mandate and through a NATO 
operation to provide troops to make sure that peace will come in 
Kosovo so normal men and women can survive and live decent lives 
without being threatened with arbitrary execution or being 
expelled from their homes, that we will be standing with our 
allies and with, I hope, as in Bosnia, not only NATO allies but 
Russian troops and troops from other parts of the world who will 
join us to try to bring peace to this troubled region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have participated in many of these debates on similar subjects 
about whether we should commit our forces to the betterment of 
humanity and to the advancement of the Canadian goals of 
tolerance and of making a better world.  In each one of these 
debates the Reform Party has taken the same position: “Oh, yes, 
we think this is a good idea but we are not equipped.  We should 
not be there.  Our men and women should not be exposed to this 
because they are not equipped”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do Reform Party members go and talk to our men and women?  Have 
they been to Bosnia as we have and talked to them?  Have they 
consulted our troops?  The last member was honest enough to 
constantly say “I know that our troops would like to do this but 
we do not think they should do it”.  He is a greater expert in 
the knowledge and understanding of what our troops are able to do 
and what they would like to do than themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let him consult our troops or, even better, let him and his 
colleagues come with me and my colleagues to meetings of the OSCE 
general assembly, for example, in which the Reform Party refuses 
to participate.  They will not come and talk to colleagues from 
Albania, Kosovo, Russia and other countries.  They do not believe 
in that.  No, they do not deign to travel.  It is not worthy of 
them to be involved in debates with the other members of the 
world community so that they could have a better understanding of 
what is taking place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They were not there in Copenhagen where you and I were, Mr. 
Speaker, when we debated the Kosovo issue this year in the OSCE 
parliamentary assembly.  There was no Reform Party member there 
because they chose not to come.  They do not wish to be 
associated with discussions of these issues. 
They do not wish to taint their debate in this House with any 
sense of knowledge or understanding of these issues.  They choose 
to sit here wrapped in a blanket of ignorance that enables them 
to take the position they are taking in the House tonight.  I 
think that is most unfortunate.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Let them come out of that eggshell they are in.  Let them come 
with us, meet the people, come to the OSCE this summer, come to 
St. Petersburg, meet colleagues from other parliaments around the 
world, get an understanding of the problems that other people 
have to deal with, and we will be able to deal with those 
together as we could as Canadians, as our troops will be dealing 
with when they are there on the ground with their Canadian values 
and their Canadian sense of how to make things work for a better 
world and for better conditions for people to live in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I read with great interest an article which the member of 
parliament for Red Deer, who is the spokesperson for the Reform 
Party, wrote in the </I>National Post<I> recently in which he 
accused the government of a failure of being willing to take a 
strong stand on issues.  The Minister of Foreign Affairs, he 
wrote, “is interested in soft power, will do nothing, is 
cowardly, cavilling, unwilling to take a stand”.  The world in 
his view was a Manichaean one, one of darkness and of light, and 
we in the Liberal Party were unwilling to ever take a stand on 
these issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where are we tonight in this debate when members of the Reform 
Party faced with a true, articulated and clear issue of darkness 
are unwilling to take a stand?  They are the ones who are 
unwilling to deal with this.  They are the ones that are of soft 
power because they are soft on understanding the nature of the 
way in which the world operates.  They will not participate in it 
in a way which enables them to be a real player. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to leave members of the House with this thought. If 
we as Canadians are to play the role in the security council, 
which we have just accepted this year for the next two years, the 
best thing we can do is contribute to the peacekeeping conditions 
in which the United Nations and in which other international 
institutions are able to keep the peace.  If we do not contain 
situations such as Kosovo and situations such as prevail in the 
Central African Republic, conditions will prevail in the world 
which will in turn come and overwhelm us in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is for that reason we must go forward in this debate.  It is 
that reason we must adopt the position of enabling our troops to 
be available in the sense of availing the world community of a 
chance to make peace for the sake of the people who live in 
Kosovo, all the people of Europe, and ultimately the people of 
the world if we are to have a better life for all of us. 
<P><A NAME="LINK203"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
earlier I listened to all the speeches made by members of the 
House. I particularly admired the speeches of two members of our 
party, the hon. member for Red Deer and the hon. member for 
Calgary Northeast.  They have thrown light on this issue.  They 
brought to the attention of the House very good issues and I 
really appreciated listening to those issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just now I listened to the hon. member from the government side. 
He is the chairman of the foreign affairs and international trade 
committee and I had the opportunity to work with him.  I highly 
appreciate his knowledge and his experience.  He was bragging 
about the Liberal government's achievements and the direction it 
is giving us on this issue.  He was almost name calling with 
regard to the official opposition's foreign critic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Putting that aside, I would like to find out if the hon. member 
could throw some light on what diplomatic initiatives the Liberal 
government has taken since we had a take note debate in the House 
on October 7, 1998.  What preventive measures has his government 
taken in Kosovo or the Central African Republic? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2310"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT110"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to know why his party has not given any 
briefing about the situation in Kosovo and the Central African 
Republic to members of parliament.  We had no briefing and I 
would like to find out why not.  If the hon. member is so proud 
of the government's record and if he is so proud of the $7.8 
billion cuts made to the defence forces, why is he pleading that 
we should send them whenever we get a 911 call from any country 
in the world? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to find out why briefings were not given to members 
of parliament.  Also I would like to know why this issue is not 
put for a vote in the House.  If the member is so clear in his 
ideas, why is there a take note debate and why is there is no 
vote? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member bragged about peacekeeping initiatives.  When we 
send forces to the Central African Republic and Kosovo what will 
they keep there?  Will it be peace?  Which peace?  Is peace 
existing there?  Did we make peace first? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to find out from the member how can he keep 
something which does not exist there.  It is common sense that 
one can keep something when something exists.  First we have to 
make peace.  Then we can keep peace.  There is no peace.  I would 
like to ask the hon. member for answers to these questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Graham:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
his questions.  He says we cannot keep peace where there is no 
peace, but in fact the presence of the forces in the Central 
African Republic is establishing at this particular point an 
important sense of stability in that country to enable democratic 
elections which if we withdraw at this time will make it 
impossible.  The member will probably agree with me that it would 
be very foolish for us to withdraw at this crucial time when we 
can keep those troops there until such time as the elections can 
be held. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Central African Republic is a special case.  I appreciate 
that his comments are more directed toward the problem of Kosovo 
because that is the more difficult one and the one which will 
require the greater number of troops.  It is precisely the threat 
of the use of force in Kosovo which is enabling us to get to the 
point where we may have peace in that region.  We may establish a 
humanitarian regime for people in which to live. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest to the member that he would have to agree. 
Whether or not, as his party seems to be saying in the House 
tonight, Canadians should be involved, would he intellectually 
say nobody should be involved?  Would he say the United States 
should not be involved or the Europeans should not be involved? 
In fact the view of his party is that it would be best if 
everybody stood back and let this whole thing just blow up. 
Should we let the Albanians and the Serbs go to war with one 
another, spilling over into other regions, spilling over into 
Bosnia where we have our own troops that would be at risk? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I took it from the position of his party in the House tonight 
that I do not think he would go that far.  I think he would say 
some force is necessary but let it not be us that provides the 
force, which I do not think is an appropriate response in these 
circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for votes in the House in take note debates, I cannot speak 
to that.  That is an agreement the leaders of the House have 
taken over the years.  It may well be that at some point a vote 
in the House would be appropriate for these debates.  At the 
moment these are called take note debates.  They give an 
opportunity for the members to share views as we are able to do 
tonight in a way that is helpful to the government to understand 
issues without necessarily requiring a vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for our party, which he says should be giving a briefing to 
his party, I do not know whether his party would really want to 
have a briefing from our party.  If that is what he would like, I 
am sure I would be willing to share with him the views of the 
minister if he had attended the foreign affairs committee meeting 
this afternoon where the minister came before the committee and 
was with us over two hours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We discussed this issue and the government has always tried to 
make documents and information available to every member of the 
House.  Every one of us would like to have more information.  I 
share with him the desire to have more information, but I do not 
think we can say that the government side or the government as 
such is keeping information from members of the House.  I wish 
that he had had an opportunity to be with us.  His colleagues 
were there in the foreign affairs committee this afternoon where 
we had a discussion of this matter with the foreign minister. 
Finally, what are the diplomatic initiatives which Canada has 
taken?  Canada takes an active role in the OSCE, the Organization 
for Security and Co-operation in Europe, an organization which 
has been directly involved in the Kosovo issue.  It is perhaps 
the most significant organization involved in Kosovo. Canada has 
played an important role in the OSCE. I know from my own work 
there that there are many European and other governments which 
would like to see Canada play an even larger role.  But we are 
not a European country.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We are a North American country.  We have limited resources. 
But within those resources we play a very important role and we 
have provided observers in Kosovo.  We have provided police in 
Kosovo. In the course of dealing with this situation we have 
provided an enormous amount of energy on behalf of the department 
and on behalf of the minister to try to bring the sides together, 
to persuade the KLA, the armed wing of the Kosovars, to moderate 
their demands and to persuade the Serbian government of Mr. 
Milosevic to behave in a civilized way in a part of a country 
where they are supposed to be managing their own citizens and not 
treat it as an occupying army. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been active in that and I am surprised to hear the 
member suggest that we have not, because what is curious is that 
when we do get active in these files we get criticized for 
spending our time and energy on them, and our money on them, from 
the party on the other side which does not wish to spend any 
money, but then when nothing is done it says to us we are doing 
nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A great deal is being done by this government in working on this 
file.  A great deal has been done by our ambassador at the OSCE. 
A great deal is being done by all our diplomatic corps in 
supporting our NATO allies and other in the Rambouillet process 
and I am surprised that the member would seek to use this 
partisan moment to criticize what we are trying to do in this 
very important matter. 
<P><A NAME="LINK204"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise on behalf of the people of Surrey Central to participate in 
this take note debate concerning the situation in Kosovo and the 
situation in the Central African Republic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This debate was arranged at very short notice and without any 
briefing to members of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Minutes ago I asked a question.  I did not get the answer.  I 
wanted to ask the question to any other member in the House to 
find out if anyone can explain or highlight the diplomatic 
initiative or the preventive measures this government has taken 
to address the situation in Kosovo or in the Central African 
Republic, particularly in Kosovo since we had a debate in the 
House on October 7.  From then until now what initiatives have 
they taken?  I did not get an answer to that question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should have been pursuing initiatives long ago, 
at least when we saw the signs of the problem occurring.  But it 
failed to take any initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we know that plan A has failed.  Plan A is the diplomatic 
initiative or preventive measures. Even though the government did 
not pursue it aggressively, we are asked to go to plan B.  Plan B 
is military action.  I call it the bitter medicine for 
peacekeeping. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the foreign affairs minister to look into the 
possibilities of peacemaking missions rather than peacekeeping 
missions in the long run. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Central African Republic is the poorest of the poor 
countries. I lived in west Africa.  I was a university professor 
in Liberia, west Africa. I have visited many countries in west 
Africa.  What I saw in the bloody civil wars were 10-year old, 
12-year old children with AK-47s.  I am talking the real guns 
which can kill, not toys.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point is those guns are not made in those countries. Some 
countries in the weapons trade have manufactured those guns and 
then sold them to the poor people in those countries. That is how 
they get the guns.  I wonder what action the United Nations, the 
international community and, for that matter, Canada have taken 
to prevent infiltration of those war causing weapons, 
particularly in poverty ridden countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People have problems putting food on the table in the evening. 
Their families are starving but they get guns to fight.  How can 
they afford to buy those weapons?  What have we done to stop the 
weapons trade? Absolutely nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some countries sell weapons to those countries and then they 
send in peacekeeping missions.  How appalling this situation is. 
We need to find sustainable, long term and real solutions to 
these civil and tribal wars. We should help promote democracy and 
education in those countries.  A democratic power in any country 
should lead to justice.  Justice should lead to love.  People 
should love each other when they get justice because they are 
satisfied.  No one has worked on these things. When power leads 
to justice and justice leads to love that is how we get rid of 
hatred, poverty, ignorance and bloody civil wars which we face 
every now and then.  It is a sad story. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give the House an analogy.  When a pressure cooker is 
heated steam is produced.  To contain that steam we put weight on 
the pressure cooker. Here we try to put military pressure to 
contain that steam.  People of these countries are already deeply 
divided based on their ethnic backgrounds or on their tribal 
origins.  If we do not want that steam have we ever taken any 
action to remove the heat from under the pressure cooker?  No, I 
do not think so.  Have we ever resolved an issue by solving the 
problem before it explodes?  No, we have not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In most African countries, including central Africa, ethnic and 
tribal problems lead to these bloody civil wars.  Did any member 
of the international community do anything to stop the branding 
of the people based on their ethnic origin, based on the tribes 
they belong to?  That is a root cause of the civil war and tribal 
wars in those countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In African countries when people meet and greet each other 
either they recognize what tribes they belong to or they ask them 
what their tribe is, whether it is Loma or Mandingo or whatever. 
What education has been given to them to recognize the similarity 
among them rather than dwelling on the differences among them? No 
one has done anything.  These people have similarities.  No one 
has made them recognize the similarities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What can we expect from the Canadian government?  There are no 
efforts to do that even in our country.  This government 
encourages the concept of hyphenated Canadians.  With the 
hyphenation concept we divide people, not unite them. 
Unfortunately this government has done absolutely nothing on 
that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our government, I am sorry to say, lacks a proactive role.  It 
reacts to a situation but does not take a proactive role.  This 
government does very little to prevent conflicts in the world. 
But it is always on the front line making decisions to send our 
troops without worrying about what situation they are in or 
whether they have enough equipment and facilities, whether they 
have consulted elected officials of the House of Commons.  The 
decision is made before that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We try to resolve political problems by providing foreign aid or 
by sending military personnel.  These are the two solutions we 
have to resolve these problems anywhere in the world. We either 
send foreign aid dollars or we send the military.  That is not 
appropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government needs a broader agenda for peacekeeping and 
peacemaking issues.  Repeatedly there have been serious 
situations in countries like Rwanda, Nigeria, Bosnia, Haiti, 
Iraq, Sierra Leone, Liberia and the list goes on. Unfortunately 
this situation will happen again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sorry the United Nations has the inability to respond in a 
timely fashion.  I recognize there is a vacuum and we have to 
show leadership.  Britain, France, Russia and the United States, 
which was kept busy for one year by Monica, cannot do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are in a strong position as a nation to be mediators in the 
world.  We belong to NATO.  We belong to the security council. We 
are a member of the G-8 countries.  We have sent many 
peacekeeping missions around the world.  We are in a perfect 
position to lead.  But this government does not have leading 
capabilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government is in a better position to lead if it wanted to. 
We can take peacemaking initiatives in the world.  But 
unfortunately this government lacks those initiatives.  There is 
no leadership.  Here is another vacuum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very important issue but there is also another 
important issue.  If we are planning to take any military action 
and if we are committing our military support to NATO that means 
we are committing men and women of the Canadian forces.  Many 
questions deserve answers before we should commit anyone or 
anything anywhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main question arises here as to whether we are well 
equipped.  Obviously the answer is no.  Based on what we have 
been hearing in the last few months, the answer is no.  The 
defence minister asked for $700 million but he received only $325 
million in the 1999 budget.  Yesterday the minister received less 
than half the money he wanted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also learned that the Canadian forces have 35 year old Sea 
King helicopters, decades old tanks, 100 useless tactical 
helicopters, 20 to 45 year old jets and we are expecting to 
participate in the air attacks with the equipment we have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government has cut $7.8 billion in the defence budget since 
taking office in 1993.  Our defence forces are starving.  The 
minister allowed our troops to be inoculated with expired 
vaccine. Here is the funny part. He allowed our troops to be 
inoculated with expired vaccine and he is so irresponsible and so 
uncaring that he inoculated himself with the expired vaccine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My constituents and all Canadians need answers to many 
questions.  Canadians are asking why we are choosing a military 
situation over a diplomatic situation.  I do not have any 
answers.  What other possible solutions could we pursue?  What 
are the possibilities of finding a long term solution to this 
bloody civil war?  How are we dealing with the hatred in the 
minds of those ethic people?

</I></B></P><P align=left>We can send our troops on a peacekeeping mission.  They can keep 
discipline, they can scare people or they can kill people. But 
how can they kill the hatred in the minds of the people which is 
the root cause of these bloody civil wars?  That is most 
important. That is the root cause of the problem.  Since I have 
been here the Liberals have never addressed the root cause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How much involvement are we asking from the European Community 
or other affected and related countries in dealing with this 
issue which is in their backyard?  What strategy do we have to 
deal with the security situation in that region?  What 
participation do we have from the neighbouring countries? 
Canadians want to know whether we will be creating more victims 
by bombing in that area.  What about those victims we will be 
creating?  Are we creating more victims of the war by bombing? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the game plan?  We on this side of the House do not know 
what the game plan is.  We do not know what equipment we will be 
using, how many people are going, for how long, what will be the 
cost and how much will be our share.  We do not know those 
things. Canadians would like to know how much it will cost, who 
is paying, what is our share, and whether the government assessed 
the degree of risk before it committed the men and women of the 
Canadian defence forces.  What is the degree of risk?  Do they 
have enough equipment and facilities? They have old equipment and 
absolutely no facilities.  They were exchanging helmets on 
previous missions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am looking forward to those answers but I doubt we will get 
them from this government.  We will only get answers after our 
tax dollars have been spent and our troops have had to take the 
great risks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For how long are we going to commit our military forces?  We had 
a bad experience in Cyprus.  We were stuck there for 29 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can the government members throw some light on that?  No they 
cannot because the Liberal backbenchers and even the cabinet 
ministers are insignificant under the tyranny and dictatorship of 
the current Prime Minister. The very few Liberal backbenchers who 
are here tonight are pretending to debate in this House.  They 
only know what they are told to say by the foreign minister, the 
defence minister or the Prime Minister.  Even the minister feels 
like the last one to know.  The Prime Minister takes orders from 
President Bill Clinton or others.  They tell him when and where 
they need our troops.  Do we simply have a take note emergency 
debate and then decide that because it is a humanitarian issue we 
have to show support for our allies? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need answers to all these questions before we decide what we 
should do.  This government is the root cause.  It is causing our 
armed forces personnel to jump without knowing where they are 
jumping to.  An eleventh hour take note debate is not an 
appropriate way to deal with the important and sad situations in 
Kosovo and the Central African Republic but it is the only option 
given by the Liberal government to the members of this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will unfortunately be dealing with these peace initiatives in 
the future.  We expect the government will come up with some 
strategy to educate Canadians, to let them know what we are 
doing, why we are doing it and where we are going from here.  We 
can go to plan B because plan A has not succeeded. We did not 
take the aggressive initiatives for plan A so we are going to 
plan B which is military action.  That is bitter medicine and we 
have to use it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could understand doing that in order to put pressure on the 
conflicting parties so they would come together in an agreement. 
But if we really want our forces to go there, I would be 
skeptical.  Like other members of the opposition, I do not have 
full information.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We intend to support our allies and the brave men and women of 
our armed forces but we need answers to those questions.  We need 
a good briefing and then a good logical debate in this House. 
Otherwise, whatever we decide has no effect because the decision 
has already been made by this government.  The Liberals do not 
have the courage to put this issue to a vote in the House.  They 
do not have the courage to educate Canadians on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, let me wish good luck to our brave men and women 
of the armed forces.
