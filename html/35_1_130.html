	<B>Mr. Julian Reed (Halton-Peel, Lib.)</B> moved for leave to 
introduce Bill C-291, an act respecting a national year of the 
grandparent.
<P>
	He said: Madam Speaker, the bill is designed to declare the 
year 1995 as the year of the grandparent to celebrate the value of 
grandparents in the Canadian family. Many of us who have had 
the privilege of having grandparents realize the pillars they are 
to children and grandchildren growing up.
<P>
	We also realize that grandparents experience some 
difficulties in modern day life. They concern access to 
grandchildren when a divorce occurs and so on. It seems to me 
that 1995 could be correctly utilized as the year to raise the 
consciousness of all of us on the value they provide to the 
Canadian family.

<P>
	I am honoured to present the bill to the House. I certainly hope

	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, pursuant to Standing Order 36 I rise today to 
present a petition from constituents of 
Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt. To date I have presented 
898 signatures to a petition regarding further legislation on gun 
control.
<P>
	There are legitimate reasons for people to own guns, 
including hunting, collecting and target shooting. Some people 
have actually distinguished themselves in Canada for their 
expertise in this particular area.
<P>
	The petitioners are asking the Government of Canada to get 
tough on criminals and not to get tougher on law-abiding gun 
owners. Therefore they oppose any further legislation for 
firearms acquisition and possession. They call on the 
government to provide strict guidelines and mandatory 
sentencing for the use or possession of a firearm in the 
commission of a crime, and I agree with the petitioners.

	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I have 
the honour to table a petition signed by hundreds of residents 
from my riding of Longueuil. The petitioners disagree with the 
new training standards used by Canada Employment Centres 
and ask the Parliament to revise them and make sure they remain 
the way they were.
<P>
	We disagree strongly with the new standards which impose: 
an increase in compulsory attendance at training from 24 to 30 
hours; a reduction of credits given per training course from 25 to 
22 hours; a reduction in the number of days you can miss from 
one and a quarter days to one day per five weeks; and the loss of 
school or school-related activities which were useful to relieve 
boredom and facilitate the adjustment to student and family life.

	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (St. Boniface, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, this petition is about unnecessary violence and abuse 
on radio, television and in other forms of the media.
<P>
	These petitioners have great concerns as to the impact on the 
Canadian population of abuse and violence in the media. They 
request that the CRTC regulate all forms of unnecessary abuse 
and violence. Parents point out that often what occurs there is 
counterproductive to what they are trying to do in raising their 
families. They point out that there have been some advances 
made and the CRTC is to be commended for some of the steps it 
has taken.
<P>

	Not only do they want this to go on, they want more progress. 
They believe it is necessary for their children.

	<B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden, NDP):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to stand in the House today, pursuant to 
Standing Order 36, to present a petition on behalf of constituents 
from Regina-Lumsden. This petition is signed as well by 
people from Saskatoon, Balcarres, Watrous, Esterhazy, 
Langenburg, Churchbridge, Carnduff, Kisbey and Carievale in 
Saskatchewan.
<P>
	The passage of the drug patent legislation Bill C-91 has 
caused undue hardship on the consumers of prescription drugs, 
the sick and the elderly. Since this bill was passed the cost of 
prescription drugs has increased over 100 per cent, at the rate of 
12 per cent per year since 1987. The petitioners are calling upon 
the government which in opposition supported the repeal of Bill 
C-91 to repeal the drug patent legislation now that it is in 
government.
<P>
	Bill C-91 is creating a great deal of hardship not only on 
individual users of prescription drugs, but on health care plans 
and governments across the country. Health care plans spend 
about 17 per cent of their money on prescription drugs and 
hospitals.

<BLOCKQUOTE>What is the number of charges that were laid under section 85 of the Criminal Code 
in 1991, 1992 and 1993 that were subsequently withdrawn without prosecution?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Mr. Russell MacLellan (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada):</B> The 
exact numbers of charges laid or withdrawn in any specific year 
are not available because the statistical information is not 
compiled on a Canada-wide basis. The Minister of Justice has 
asked for a survey and study of the application of section 85. 
These will examine the frequency with which the section 85 
offence is charged, as well as the disposition of those charges. 
When completed, this information will be released by the 
minister.

	The hon. member for Laval East.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):</B> I rise today to speak 
on the bill to implement the Agreement Establishing the World 
Trade Organization. I wish to deal more precisely with the 
amendment presented by the Official Opposition, which is 
aimed at adding new clauses, namely clauses 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 and 
3.4, on page 3 of Bill C-57.
<P>
	First, clause 3.1 proposes to establish a process for 
consultation with the provinces regarding three specific issues. 
It is important for us that the Canadian government establish, 
before the agreement comes into force, such a 
federal-provincial mechanism to implement the agreement. 
This is the first issue about which provinces should be consulted 
wherever the implementation of the agreement relates to a 
matter within provincial legislative jurisdiction. For example, 
the federal government should be obliged to consult the 
provinces on matters relating to copyright, agriculture, 
environment and labour. Sovereignists are not the only ones 
demanding such measures.
<P>
<B>(1100) </B>
<P>
	Since 1988, the provinces have demanded to be consulted in 
connection with the Uruguay Round trade negotiations. If we 
take a close look at what is happening next door in the United 
States, we see that such measures have already been introduced. 
In the Statement of Administrative Actions, the U.S. 
government statement on the implementation of the GATT 
agreement, it says, and I quote: ``these consultations'', and this 
refers to consultations with the American States, ``will begin 
immediately upon enactment of the implementing bill''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8214"> 8214 </A></B>
<P>
	In the bill now before Congress in the United States, there 
is one specific section on the consultation process between the 
U.S. federal government and the States. Section 102 of the bill, 
part B, under the heading: ``The relationship of the agreement 
to United States law and state law'', explains how consultations 
between the States and the central government are to proceed. 
If the Canadian government refuses to support the Official 
Opposition on amendment 3.1, this would mean that my federal 
colleagues have an even more centralist vision than the U.S. 
government and that they consider the provinces to have less 
power than the American States.
<P>
	If that should be the case, members who vote against our 
amendment will have to tell the Prime Minister of Canada to 
keep quiet, when he says Canada is the most decentralized 
country in the world. A federal government that would refuse to 
undertake to consult the provinces on matters over which they 
have jurisdiction is centralist in the extreme.
<P>
	The second point on which we believe consultation with the 
provinces is important is dispute resolution under the 
agreement. Without this amendment, Bill C-57 puts absolutely 
no obligation on the federal government to consult the 
provinces, even when the disputes affect them directly. In recent 
disputes about magnesium, softwood lumber and beer, to name 
only a few, the federal government was under no obligation to 
consult the provinces. This amendment is therefore essential if 
we are to respect the jurisdictions of the provinces.
<P>
	In their bill, the Americans also provide that the federal 
government shall consult the States when trade disputes are 
reported to the World Trade Organization. Clause 102, Part C, 
paragraph iii), clearly states that every state of the union should 
be actively involved at every stage of consultation and at each 
subsequent stage of any trade dispute resolution process.
<P>
	Third, we want the provinces to be consulted on major 
economic issues. Clause 145(4) of Bill C-57 states that the 
territory of Canada may be divided into two or more regional 
markets. This entails developing specifically regional or 
provincial policies, hence the need for a consultative 
mechanism between the two levels of government, to harmonize 
our policies in view of our international commitments.
<P>
	Major international fields may have a substantial impact on 
Canada. Take the monetary policy, employment development or 
loans to developing countries for example. The provinces are 
greatly affected by what happens in these areas. For all these 
reasons, the government must consult them.
<P>
	Let us now move on to paragraph 3.2. This Bloc Quebecois 
proposal is to ensure that the Governor in Council and the 
Minister of International Trade will obtain prior agreement of 
the provinces before taking one or the other of the following 
actions.
<P>
	First, the federal government would not be allowed to change 
allocation mechanisms for tariff quotas without prior agreement 
of the provinces. We all know that, as a result of the Uruguay 
Round, import quotas on dairy products, poultry and eggs were 
eliminated.
<P>
	Import quotas were replaced with tariff quotas, which will 
make the quantity that can be imported increase slightly. What 
the agreement entitles us to do is to allow a specific volume of 
imported goods tariff-free in accordance with tariff quotas and 
to jack up the tariff on the rest.
<P>
<B>(1105) </B>
<P>
	Bill C-57, however, provides that the minister has 
discretionary power to decide who can import these products 
within tariff quotas. In order to avoid log rolling or an apparent 
conflict of interest on the part of the government, we propose 
that this decision be made jointly by the minister and the 
provinces.
<P>
	The second type of action requiring provincial consent has to 
do with the agreements negotiated with some trade partners to 
give them guaranteed access to part of the Canadian market.
<P>
	While the government is committed to opening up our 
economic borders under trade liberalization agreements, a new 
protectionist trend is emerging. Canada is currently negotiating 
quasi-formal agreements with some countries, which would 
receive special access to Canadian markets in return for 
guaranteed access to their markets for some Canadian products. 
For example, Canada could promise a country that it will buy a 
certain quantity of their butter during the next year in return for 
their commitment to buy a certain quantity of Canadian beef in 
the next 12 months.
<P>
	Such agreements could have considerable regional impact in 
Canada. The production of certain goods is often concentrated in 
a single region. A good agreement for all of Canada could have a 
disastrous effect in one province in particular. It is therefore 
imperative that the provinces have their say on this.
<P>
	Let us move on to Clause 3.3. The Bloc Quebecois proposes 
that, in respect of subsidized exports, the federal government be 
very vigilant and have regard at all times to actions taken in the 
relevant areas by foreign competitors. The GATT agreement 
provides that export subsidies should be reduced by 36 per cent 
over a six-year period. In addition, the volume of subsidized 
exports is also to be cut by 21 per cent.
<P>
	Canada-that is why we are proposing this 
amendment-must ensure that its trade partners periodically 
reduce their subsidies to the products covered by these 
regulations.
<P>
	This amendment is especially important since these 
regulations already favour both the EEC and the United States. 
Because American and European exports are already more 
heavily subsidized, reducing the current subsidy rate will main-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8215"> 8215 </A></B>
<P>
tain their export subsidies at higher  levels than ours. The 
poorest countries on earth will be hit even harder than us by 
these measures, since they often do not subsidize their exports.
<P>
	This measure threatens the access of developing countries to 
our markets. We should at least make sure that the wealthiest 
trade partners honour their commitment to lower the level and 
volume of their subsidies, in order not to reduce even further our 
competitiveness on international markets.
<P>
	Furthermore, under section 424 of the Uruguay Round 
Agreement Act in the United States, the U.S. government will 
require the President to submit a report to Congress in which 
Canada's actions will be reported in order to see whether Canada 
is complying with the Uruguay Round and NAFTA 
commitments concerning dairy and poultry products. Why 
would Canada refuse for its part to anticipate what might 
happen?
<P>
	Fourth and last, we propose adding to clause 3.4 guarantees so 
that the minister can ensure that the discretionary tariffs he 
establishes in case of shortages for some agricultural products 
set the price no lower than the Canadian market price. This is an 
important addition because it seeks to prevent importers from 
claiming a false shortage if they know that the minister will 
impose tariffs that are low enough to let them sell their imported 
products at a lower price than Canadian producers.
<P>
	In conclusion, I would like to return to the spirit of clauses 3.1 
and 3.2 and repeat that the amendments proposed by the Bloc 
Quebecois are not simply an expression of Quebec sovereignist 
rhetoric. We want every Canadian province to be consulted by 
the federal government. We are just demanding the same kind of 
measure that the United States is about to vote on.
<P>
	Canadian parliamentarians today have an opportunity to show 
that Canada is a flexible country. That is how the amendment 
now being debated should be seen.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise today to discuss Motion No. 2, which I would like 
to read again for the benefit of our listeners:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``3.1 Notwithstanding any provision of this Act or the Agreement, the 
Minister of International Trade shall each year lay before the House of 
Commons a report taking into account the priorities identified by the committee 
of the House of Commons that normally considers matters relating to external 
affairs concerning''</BLOCKQUOTE>

Affairs and International Trade.

<BLOCKQUOTE>(b) the trade obligations and commitments undertaken at the international level by 
the trading partners of major importance to Canada, especially the United States; 
and</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(c) the impact of the Agreement on Canadian workers and companies''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The motion aims at simplifying and facilitating the process 
for those who would like to address complaints, comments or 
recommendations to the government. It will allow them to go to 
a specific body and place where they will get proper attention.
<P>
	It has often been noted in the past that, when people make 
representations to their member of Parliament, to ministers or to 
senior civil servants, these officials do not follow up on the 
recommendations made to them.
<P>
	I believe it is very important to have a place where people can 
make claims and complaints if, for example, their rights have 
been violated as regards imports, or if changes could result in 
problems for some industries or for employment.
<P>
	We think that the responsible committee of the House of 
Commons could be a permanent forum which would listen to all 
those who have complaints, so that appropriate 
recommendations can be made to the minister, followed by the 
required adjustments.
<P>
	It is very important that Canadians can have access to a 
standing committee of the House and that this committee be 
made known to the public. Indeed, those who wish to complain 
have to know that the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs 
and International Trade is responsible for receiving their 
recommendations and complaints so that we can adjust as fast as 
possible to major changes in the world.
<P>
	In 1985, I had the privilege to sit on the committee chaired by 
Mr. Hnatyshyn, the current Governor General, that was 
reviewing the reform of Parliament and Parliamentary 
institutions. At that time, we asked Mr. McGrath to undertake an 
in-depth study on the role of Parliament. In 1985, he stated in 
his report: ``On the eve of international free trade in the 
economic arena, Canada must have the parliamentary structures 
needed to become increasingly competitive at the national and 
international level''.
<P>
<B>(1115) </B>
<P>
	Parliamentarians have been examining this issue for some 
time now. In 1985, Gulf Canada carried out quite a detailed 
study on the relationship between Parliament and big 
corporations as well as the population as a whole. I have made 
copies of the Gulf Canada report, but among other things, 
business people stressed the need to know their MPs well. So, 
businesses and groups tell their representatives that it is rather 
important that they maintain a good relationship with the 
members of Parliament who represent them.
<P>
	People approach their MPs, but often the poor guy does not 
even know how to reach the right person to ensure that things are 
progressing well. This is a very unstructured way of doing 
things, which prevents us, first, from understanding our constit-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8216"> 8216 </A></B>
<P>
uents' needs and working on them and, second, from solving 
problems quickly. This is an important concern.
<P>
	This 1985 Gulf Canada report also says that, with time, more 
and more citizens are trying to make themselves heard by the 
government. This is nothing new. It has always been difficult for 
citizens, businesses and groups to know to whom they should 
address their complaints to get their problems solved. That is 
why this motion provides for the Committee on External Affairs 
and International Trade to act as a forum, pursuant to Bill C-57 
concerning the new World Trade Organization, to receive those 
complaints and to make the necessary recommendations to the 
minister so that he can respond quickly.
<P>
	Opening international trade will bring about very important 
changes. Surely, in some industries, it will directly affect 
employment and businesses. Some adjustments should be made 
swiftly.
<P>
	No structure was put in place to hear the claims of businesses, 
individuals and groups. We think, as this motion says, that the 
Committee on External Affairs of the House of Commons could 
and should be the place to deal with these claims so that we can 
adjust as quickly as possible to the important changes and 
economic disruption expected in the years to come.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> 
Madam Speaker, the purpose of the amendments brought 
forward by New Democrats today is to commit the government 
to reporting to Parliament regularly on its activities in the World 
Trade Organization and especially on the progress toward the 
development of a social clause to the WTO. In this way we can 
keep the momentum going for a social clause by ensuring that 
the public spotlight is kept on the government's policy on this 
important issue.
<P>
	A social clause is needed so that the WTO can address not 
only classic trade disputes between nations but also the problem 
of what has become known as social dumping, that is a nation's 
competitive advantage that results from unregulated labour 
markets and lack of environmental protection regulations.
<P>
	During the Marrakech conference where the Uruguay round 
of the GATT negotiations drew to a close, expectations were 
high that the final text of the agreement would include a social 
clause.
<P>
<B>(1120 ) </B>
<P>
	Although the Americans and the French were pushing hard for 
one, nothing came of those negotiations. The Minister for 
International Trade was quoted in the press at the time as saying 
that he was lukewarm to the idea.
<P>
	The purpose of the amendment is to get a categorical 
commitment from the government to be actively involved in the 
development of a social clause in the WTO agreement.
<P>
	The idea of a social clause is one which enjoys wide support 
around the world as a necessary counterweight to the 
liberalization of investment. As a constitution for the new world 
order of the global marketplace, the WTO agreement as it stands 
is remarkably one sided in its defence of the rights of investors 
and silent on the rights of workers. It pretends that labour, social 
security and the environment are not trade issues.
<P>
	It is eloquent about the multinationals' right to intellectual 
property and to the free movement of capital but says nothing 
about the workers' rights to form trade unions or to have a safe 
workplace. It speaks loudly about level playing fields but is 
silent about the most important playing field of all, the one 
between the employer and the employee.
<P>
	A social clause is needed to strike a balance between the 
market efficiencies of liberal trade and investment practices and 
the social solidarity of all communities that want basic human 
rights and decent employment practices enforced everywhere 
where capital is free to come and go.
<P>
	The multinationals can and do now operate outside the 
regulatory reach of individual states. We must in partnership 
with our trading partners establish some way of restoring the 
abilities of communities to set the ground rules for the 
marketplace. An unregulated global market effectively allows 
the multinationals to hold an auction to see which countries will 
bid the cheapest and least regulated labour and the most lax 
environmental standards in order to get their investment.
<P>
	If we do not establish some basic rules about the labour 
markets and environmental protection, globalization will 
certainly remain what many observers have called a race to the 
bottom.
<P>
	This is the view of the International Labour Organization 
secretariat which earlier this month recommended to the 
governing body of the ILO that there should be a social clause to 
the WTO. This is also the view of the joint committee that 
recently reviewed Canada's foreign policy. Its report included a 
recommendation that there should be a co-ordination of 
international labour and social standards.
<P>
	I look forward to hearing the views of the members of the 
committee who can support this amendment as a way of putting 
their recommendation into action.
<P>
	During the recent visit of Team Canada to China and the Prime 
Minister's attendance at the APEC conference in Indonesia, the 
Prime Minister claimed that the best way to address the problem 
of human rights abuses in China, Indonesia and elsewhere was to 
engage in trade to open up these societies. There is nothing in 
the WTO that prevents countries from joining the WTO, trading 
with member states and continuing to abuse human  rights, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8217"> 8217 </A></B>
<P>
denying workers the right to join independent unions, or 
allowing child labour.
<P>
	Support for a social clause which would link trade benefits to 
basic human and social rights is the only way for us to begin a 
true commitment to using trade as a way of improving human 
rights situations in many countries. Without such a clause, the 
WTO legislates a turkey shoot where the multinationals and 
their allies in some developing countries can exploit the most 
vulnerable.
<P>
	Support for a social clause is the obvious response to 
globalization by anyone who is not hypnotized by the 
neo-Liberal rhetoric that the development of world markets 
unfettered by democratic control is the inevitable and 
unstoppable result of new technology.
<P>
	The new technologies in telecommunications and in 
information technology certainly make it possible for capital to 
move instantly around the globe or for technologies to be 
transferred between states very easily. It does not mean that it is 
necessary for us to let the elites in the multinationals use that 
technology without any obligations to the communities where 
they operate.
<P>
	Globalization as it is now occurring with multinationals 
glorying in their freedom from democratic responsibility is not 
an impersonal force of technological innovation. It results from 
the deliberate choice of governments to liberalize trade and 
investment policies, to hand over to the multinationals a carte 
blanche to design a world order that suits their wants and 
interests. We should not let the free market rhetoric blind us to 
the fact that we can choose to win back some measure of our 
ability to impose some community standards on the trade and 
investment practices of the multinationals.
<P>
<B>(1125) </B>
<P>
	The idea of a social clause to the World Trade Organization 
has been opposed by some governments of developing countries 
as a baldly protectionist measure to deprive developing 
countries of their competitive advantage in low labour costs and 
general lack of regulation.
<P>
	If it is protectionist to protect children from exploitation as 
virtual slaves, to protect workers who do not enjoy the basic 
human rights of forming unions or having a safe place to work or 
to protect the environment from rapacious multinationals then 
we have no embarrassment in saying that we are protectionists. 
We have to resist the way that the rhetoric of free trade has 
perverted the word protection so that any public intervention to 
protect any public good whatsoever is deemed to be a threat to 
prosperity.
<P>
	A social clause to the WTO however would not even fall under 
the conventional definition of protectionism as regulations that 
unfairly restrict the legitimate economic opportunities of 
another country. The proposals that have been made by 
supporters of a social clause, like the ILO, France and the United 
States, simply call for a set of minimum standards of the rights 
of workers to form unions. The effect of such a clause would not 
only be to  respect the rights of workers around the world but 
also to bring economic benefit to the entire world economy.
<P>
	It is astounding that advocates of market liberalization 
trumpet the growth that supposedly results from open world 
markets during a time when liberalization has led in the 
developed countries to chronic high unemployment and falling 
income for workers.
<P>
	The introduction of a social clause would be an important step 
forward in raising global demand, thereby stimulating 
investment and consumption. The advocates of the 
liberalization of world markets assumes that as developing 
countries become more prosperous internal social pressures are 
generated from a maturing and self-confident workplace to 
insist on higher wages and better working conditions as 
happened in the industrialized countries.
<P>
	This assumption fails to recognize that the vast pool of 
unemployed workers in rural sectors in the economies of east 
and south Asia for example creates a huge drag on the ability of 
wages to rise at a reasonable level. Moreover it ignores the fact 
that workers in many developing countries do not enjoy the 
basic democratic right to form unions that would allow them to 
improve their condition. An essential ingredient to raising 
global demand is therefore to intervene in the world labour 
markets and to let natural economic forces raise wages. We can 
thus begin a process of transforming globalization from a race to 
the bottom into an upward spiral in the living standards of all 
people around the world.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise to discuss the amendment to Bill 
C-57 proposed by the hon. member for Laval Est. I respect the 
hon. member's dedication to federalism and the learning and 
thoughtfulness that she brings to this task.
<P>
	Allow me to make a general comment in starting that it is 
necessary in approaching the matters of amendments to 
substantive bills to exercise a prudent economy in drafting and 
at all times to consider criteria of relevance so that the main 
purpose and thrust of the bill be not deflected.
<P>
	The opening paragraph of amendment 3.1(a) is one that is of 
course very dear to the heart of the present government. The 
Prime Minister of Canada has led a very successful delegation to 
China with the full co-operation and presence of nine of the ten 
provincial premiers.
<P>
<B>(1130 ) </B>
<P>
	The intention of the government is to proceed in full vigour 
with ideas of co-operative federalism as developed by Prime 
Minister Lester Pearson and carried on by his successors. We 
want to work with the provinces because we recognize that the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8218"> 8218 </A></B>
<P>
common problems of the world community entering the 21st 
century require a co-operative path in Canada of all the players.
<P>
	We recognize a certain ambiguity in 3.1(a) but we have no 
particular problems with that. I simply mention that what is 
within provincial jurisdiction is by no means clear. There are no 
watertight compartments. The Canadian rule under the Labour 
Conventions decision of 1937, much criticized incidentally, is 
followed by no federal state other than Germany.
<P>
	In general, the view in federalism is that once an international 
agreement is entered into the legislative power to implement the 
agreement follows. That is not the Canadian position. I would 
stress that all Canadian governments, particularly the present 
one, have been very respectful of provincial interests and very 
anxious to ensure co-operation.
<P>
	Some of the suggestions here seem to go well beyond the 
scope of an amendment and what good federalism requires or 
even sensibly suggests. Is it suggested, for example-I looked 
to see if there was any ambiguity as between the French and 
English texts-that the issue of trade dispute resolution, the 
machinery and processes, to which both the French and the 
English texts of article 3.1(b) are directed is a matter that should 
be discussed-now that the agreement is there-between 
federal and provincial governments?
<P>
	It is a well known Canadian position that we support 
compulsory third party settlement of disputes. We have 
constantly raised the necessity for implementing the 
jurisdiction of the international court as final arbiter. Our 
problem with many international agreements, including 
NAFTA, is that this is not something with which the United 
States is happy. The solution for the United States is to 
understand the World Court better and to learn to adjust its 
claims better to the processes of decision making there.
<P>
	On these issues, Canada obviously will continue to study the 
matter and continue to raise new issues of dispute resolution. I 
wonder at this stage what is useful in retaining this as another 
matter for extended federal-provincial discussion. You could 
drive a Sherman tank through the proposition ``any economic 
matter of major international significance''. I wonder whether it 
sensibly belongs in an amendment.
<P>
	It seems to me that what the hon. member for Laval East is 
proposing reaches other areas of continuing concern for the 
government of federal-provincial relations including 
federal-provincial economic relations. The Constitution is not a 
static institution even though the amending powers may not 
work. There are enormous possibilities for creative adaptation 
of machinery by custom and convention.
<P>
	I would have thought these matters were probably better 
addressed through another arena and perhaps another minister. 
The Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs is concerned with 
studying the issue of continuing federal-provincial economic 
consultation and co-operation.
<P>
	I wonder whether 3.1(c) is a useful amendment to Bill C-57. I 
look at 3.2 and 3.4 and wonder again. Article 3.4 opens a 
Pandora's box. In essence you are getting into asking the 
minister to take measures that may run in direct conflict with the 
international agreements. In any case it is not a matter to be 
reached by indirection in the interstices of what purports to be 
an amendment. I would suggest again some prudent economy 
there.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solomon:</B> What's wrong with giving in?
<P>
<B>(1135 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. McWhinney:</B> I hope the hon. member is listening to the 
debate. Good. The truth will make you free. It is an important 
point to remember.
<P>
	Let us come back to this again. I heard so much tired ideology, 
19th century ideas, on trade and commerce that take no account 
of the fact that we are into the 21st century, that I deliberately 
eliminated the amendment of the hon. member opposite from 
my discussion. I am referring instead to the member for Laval 
East because there are matters of federalism that are of special 
concern to the government, and we are with them in trying to 
improve the mechanisms.
<P>
	My suggestion is to cut down the scope of this amendment and 
direct it generally to the issue of federal-provincial 
jurisdictional matters. You will find a continuing governmental 
concern with attending to that. It may well be the time has come 
to re-examine the Labour Conventions decision. That is not a 
matter the government would approach unilaterally. It is a 
matter on which we can make subtle arrangements, much as the 
German federation did, and we will do so also.
<P>
	On the other matters, you have gone beyond the scope of an 
amendment directed to federal matters. You are really directing 
attention to the need for some improved federal-provincial 
economic consultative mechanism. That is well within the 
mandate of the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs. In fact we 
know it is part of the continuing constitutional revision he is 
undertaking.
<P>
	That is the main substance of my remarks. I compliment the 
hon. member for Laval East for the thoughtful intervention. The 
thrust of it is one that the government takes very much to heart. I 
would think again that probably the main thrust is in article 
3.1(a) and that the other matters could be raised at another time 
in another arena in a substantive discussion of 
federal-provincial relations.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to speak at report stage of Bill C-57, specifically 
to Motion No. 1.
<P>
	It is important to me and my party that the World Trade 
Organization be allowed to get up and running very quickly. 
Canada has a number of disputes we would like to see moved to 
the international stage such as the wheat dispute and the 
constant steel disputes between Canada and the United States. It 
very important to move these on very quickly.
<P>
	Motion No. 1 never really tries to accomplish this. It goes 
against the spirit of the trade agreement, especially the fourth 
part of that section which proposes the imposition of new tariffs 
at a time when we are seeking to reduce all tariffs worldwide.
<P>
	In addition, constant provincial consultation will tie the hands 
of the federal government in trade disputes and international 
economic matters. Canada should speak with one voice in 
international forums.
<P>
	The second part would tie the federal government's hands in 
allocating tariff quota for supply managed sectors. I am sure that 
is not what is intended in Motion No. 1, but that could be a 
result.
<P>
	I would like to deal with Motion No. 2 which is in the group 
we are debating this morning. This motion asks for a yearly 
report to the House of Commons outlining trade implementation 
and the major trade obligations undertaken by Canada and the 
impact on Canadian workers and companies.
<P>
	Those kind of assessments are being done on an ongoing 
basis. The government should not commit itself to studying the 
impact of trade agreements on workers and companies on a 
yearly basis. These studies are carried out all the time by the 
industries and workers groups and the parties involved should 
be the ones that assess the impact. They would also be a little bit 
more effective in studying the impact on their groups rather than 
having the government do it for them.
<P>
<B>(1140) </B>
<P>
	I oppose Motion No. 6. It would create unnecessary delays. 
International relations are the responsibility of the federal 
government. A House committee can ask the government to 
justify its actions, including calling ministers and departmental 
officials before a standing committee at any time. This is an 
ambiguous motion, one that would be really designed to make 
more work. That option is already there, let us use it.
<P>
	Regarding Motion No. 7, the House already has the power to 
ask the minister for reports when it deems necessary. Regarding 
the social clause that is being proposed by the NDP, this has 
already been rejected by the parties that negotiated the GATT 
agreement for the last seven years and to try and move it back in 
now would be a mistake.
<P>
	In addition to that, labour and environmental standards that 
the members down the line here have suggested would actually 
have a detrimental effect on the very people they are suggesting 
to help. If people in underdeveloped countries have to conform 
to a minimum wage standard and strict environmental standards 
like Canada has, how can they compete in the world 
marketplace? It is not necessary. It was recognized that it is not 
necessary in the discussions that led up to the signing of the 
GATT. In addition it is a matter that is going to be discussed on 
an ongoing basis in the second round of the GATT negotiations 
to see if there is any necessity for it.
<P>
	I oppose the motions being proposed and urge the House to 
move quickly to implement the GATT agreement through the 
World Trade Organization and try to resolve a lot of outstanding 
issues very quickly with the weight of all 120 member countries 
behind us.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Malpeque, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
want to speak to Motion No. 1, especially clause 3.4. Clause 3.4 
of Motion No. 1 indicates that in the case where imports exceed 
the established tariff rate levels, the minister shall impose tariffs 
to ensure that such products are not permitted at prices lower 
than those in the domestic market.
<P>
	The concern that is being raised in Bill C-57 is the proposal 
that would allow supplemental imports of supply managed 
commodities as ``within accessed commitment'', which means 
they would enter Canada at low or no tariff.
<P>
	In talking to people in the industry about section 3.4, they 
have indicated that they think the section is far too restrictive in 
that it provides the minister with little or no discretionary 
power.
<P>
	It is important to understand that in supply managed 
industries some commodities require from time to time to 
import and require supplementary quotas. The problem is how 
do you do that in such a way so as not to allow the industry to use 
the supplemental quotas as a lever with which to either 
manipulate prices or to break the supply management system?
<P>
	Let me give the House an example. A cheese manufacturer 
who makes frozen pizzas, when asked for future milk demands, 
understates them. Later when the cheese manufacturer needed 
milk to manufacture cheese for pizza he would indicate that 
market demand has all of a sudden increased. Milk could not be 
sourced in Canada because no one would be prepared to produce 
that unexpected demand in that short a time. The manufacturer 
then could apply for and be granted a tariff free supplemental 
import permit. Other manufacturers would learn of this 
advantage and either try and beat the system themselves, as the 
original applicant had done, or pressure domestic producers for 
a lower price to match that of the non-tariff imports so that they 
could compete.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8220"> 8220 </A></B>
<P>
	That kind of situation could happen if supplemental quotas 
are granted without restriction. This amendment has restricted 
the discretion of the minister to the point that it would be 
unworkable.
<P>
<B>(1145 ) </B>
<P>
	The supplemental quota is an extremely important area, 
especially as a result of the new arrangements under the GATT 
in which we are moving from import controls to tariff level 
controls.
<P>
	The government has assured us that supplemental quotas can 
be granted in such a way so as not to undermine the supply 
management system.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Penson:</B> It needs to be undermined.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Easter:</B> I hear the member opposite. The government 
made a commitment, might I say, to support the supply 
management system. In the legislation we are trying to ensure 
we support the supply management system to the extent the 
agreement that we signed implied. We trying to ensure through 
the supplemental quota provisions that the industry cannot use 
those supplemental quotas in such a way as to break the system.
<P>
	In conclusion I indicate again that the system has certainly 
changed substantially as a result of the GATT negotiations. The 
World Trade Organization in Bill C-57 will try to implement 
those changes into domestic law. As a government we certainly 
recognize a legitimate concern under supplemental quotas, but 
we have indicated that those concerns will be addressed if not 
through this legislation then by some other means.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden, NDP):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise in the House to speak on Bill C-57.
<P>
	I want to make a comment in response to the Liberal member 
for Vancouver Quadra. He made some comments with respect to 
the bill. He indicated that some of the amendments before the 
House would actually force the minister to stand up for 
Canadians. The member is opposed to that. He wants the bill and 
these types of laws implemented on an international basis so that 
ministers of our government and our people will not stand up for 
Canadians whether it be in supply management, the steel 
production area or any other manufacturing sector.
<P>
	I want the House of Commons and the people of Canada to 
understand that the Liberal member from Quadra who 
represents the Liberal government in the debate does not want to 
restrict the minister to making any commitments or standing up 
and fighting for Canadians across the country when it has to 
happen. I find that very shameful.
<P>
	I want to make some remarks with respect to the bill on behalf 
of steel producers of Canada. A steel producer in my 
constituency, IPSCO, is one of the larger producers or 
manufacturers of pipe and steel in North America. It actually 
has some operations in the United  States as well, as do many 
Canadian steel producers. This industry is quite concerned 
about Bill C-57 as it is presented before the House today 
because there are no equal legislative footings in the act which 
would support it in cases respecting anti-dumping.
<P>
	For example, in the United States there is detailed drafting of 
legislation and a law in effect which support American 
anti-dumping processes. Bill C-57 does not provide an 
equitable amount of protection for Canadian steel producers. 
The technical wording of Bill C-57 as it applies to 
anti-dumping should be revised in the view of the Canadian 
steel producers to mirror as strictly as possible U.S. 
implementing legislation.
<P>
	The steel industry in Canada is quite important to the 
Canadian economy. In 1993 there were $8.6 billion in sales. It is 
a fully competitive operation, having dramatically raised 
productivity in Canada over the number of years it has been in 
existence. We have over $3 billion in exports from Canada 
mostly to the United States. The Canadian Steel Producers 
Association employs 33,000 employees, not counting all those 
who work in downstream operations such as distribution, 
fabrication and wire production.
<P>
<B>(1150) </B>
<P>
	Trade is increasingly important to the Canadian Steel 
Producers Association and in particular to our country. Trade in 
all goods and services increases economic growth which on its 
own is good for the steel industry. Trade in steel is becoming 
increasingly important to Canadian steel producers. It is 
reflected in the sense that they are concerned about some of the 
NAFTA and some of the American legislation which is 
protectionist. They have undertaken to initiate businesses in the 
United States to get around some of this, thereby costing 
Canadians jobs in the end. The volume of steel shipped from 
Canada for export has risen from 30 per cent in 1983 to nearly 40 
per cent in the last year.
<P>
	With respect to Bill C-57 I would like to talk about the sort of 
proposals the government might consider implementing to 
ensure that steel producers are not at a disadvantage with respect 
to American producers. There have been anti-dumping actions 
between Canada and the United States over the past two years. 
They have been involved with 11 different anti-dumping cases, 
9 of which involved trade between Canada and the United 
States.
<P>
	We believe such actions have no place in the free trade area. It 
would be to our mutual advantage to stop anti-dumping actions 
between our two countries. A NAFTA working group has been 
established to look at alternatives to the present anti-dumping 
regime in North America and has a deadline of December 1995. 
We want this effort to succeed so that steel can be traded within 
NAFTA on a basis of price, quality and service, not lawsuits.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8221"> 8221 </A></B>
<P>
	So far lawsuits still play an important role. There is a major 
imbalance between the way American and Canadian 
anti-dumping processes work. This puts Canadian firms at a 
disadvantage. It weakens the bargaining leverage of the 
Canadian government in negotiating change. Bill C-57 does not 
address this particular issue. That is what I am calling upon the 
government to do today.
<P>
	For example, data requirements under the U.S. system are so 
onerous as to be a barrier in trade to themselves regardless of the 
outcome of a case. If dumping is found, the Canadian system 
allows the company either to adjust prices to eliminate any 
unfair trade practice or pay a known duty. The American system 
does not allow an exporter to simply adjust his price. He has to 
pay the duty deposit. Moreover, the exact amount of the duty is 
unknown until months or years after the sale has been made. The 
Canadian exporter thus faces uncertainty and financial risk by 
continuing to export. Anti-dumping actions between Canada 
and the U.S. should be stopped, but as long as they continue 
Canada should do nothing to diminish its leverage to negotiate 
change.
<P>
	Unlike the American implementation of legislation the 
Canadian bill provides no guidelines on what would be 
acceptable evidence. Without guidelines it would be very 
difficult for a Canadian company to know how to demonstrate 
foreseen and imminent threat of injury. American companies 
will have an easier task under their legislation, even though the 
same principle of the WTO is being implemented.
<P>
	The U.S. implementing legislation also provides that if 
dumping diminishes in reaction to the filing of a complaint, the 
International Trade Commission may discount evidence after 
the filing in its assessment of injury. This makes it easier for an 
injury charge to stick. There is no comparable provision in Bill 
C-57. Again the legislative support for Canadian producers will 
be weaker than that for American producers.
<P>
	We have the member for Vancouver Quadra saying: ``We 
don't want the minister to be in charge of providing some 
support for Canadian producers; we want the American and the 
international fields to be speaking for our producers''. We all 
know they will not be supporting or speaking for our steel 
producers.
<P>
	With the U.S. legislation spelling out in detail options for 
interpretation for its responsible agency, it will be easier for 
American companies to get injury findings and for those 
findings to be defended in any process of review and appeal. 
There is also a concern in the steel production area with respect 
to assessing the threat of injury at the time of sunset review, 
which is after five years.
<P>
<B>(1155 ) </B>
<P>
	Bill C-57 does not say anything about how the threat of injury 
should be interpreted at the time of review of an anti-dumping 
action, but the American implementing legislation does. It 
states that the International Trade  Commission, in determining 
whether the threat of injury meets the WTO criteria of clearly 
foreseen and imminent, may consider that the effects of 
revocation or termination may not be imminent but may 
manifest themselves over a longer period of time. And it may 
consider indirect effects including whether the imports would 
potentially inhibit a domestic producer from developing 
improved versions of the product.
<P>
	In short, if we compare the wording of the U.S. and Canadian 
legislation to implement the sunset requirement of the WTO, it 
will clearly be much easier for American than for Canadian 
companies to prove the need for a continuation of anti-dumping 
action. It will also be easier for such a finding to be defended on 
appeal because of the latitude of interpretation spelled out in the 
American legislation.
<P>
	There are other things that are quite important to the industry. 
I want to summarize by saying that the detailed drafting of the 
legislation should not be allowed to widen the gap between 
Canadian and American anti-dumping processes which already 
puts Canadian companies at a disadvantage with respect to their 
primary market and weakens the leverage of the Canadian 
government negotiating alternatives to anti-dumping under 
NAFTA.
<P>
	The technical wording of Bill C-57 as it applies to 
anti-dumping should be revised to mirror as strictly as possible 
the implementing legislation of the United States. That is what 
we in the New Democratic Party caucus are calling for. That is 
what the steel producers of Canada and their association are 
calling upon the government to implement. We are asking that it 
happen by supporting the motions we have put before the House.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philippe Paré (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> I am pleased to 
support the motion of my colleague from Laval East.
<P>
	It is important to the Bloc Quebecois that the Minister of 
International Trade establish a mandatory process to consult 
with the provinces regarding the implementation of the 
Agreement wherever it relates to a matter within provincial 
jurisdiction, any matter relating to trade dispute resolution and 
any economic matter of major national or international 
significance.
<P>
	I will go over each of these elements. Regarding the 
implementation of the Agreement, a federal-provincial 
consultation process is required because the federal government 
cannot interfere in areas within provincial jurisdiction as it 
pleases and also because it is necessary to harmonize provincial 
policies with international obligations. What the Bloc is 
requesting is not excessive or extravagant since our American 
neighbours have already made provision for such a mechanism. 
Indeed, the Trade and Tariff Act of 1984 provides for the 
establishment of a consultation process between the federal 
government and the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8222"> 8222 </A></B>
<P>
states regarding the implementation of any trade agreement 
affecting these states.
<P>
	The provinces are not involved either in the dispute 
settlement mechanism described in this bill. Yet, it is essential 
that the provinces be involved in a formal consultation process 
for the development of the Canadian position, especially 
regarding matters within provincial jurisdiction. How can the 
federal government prepare itself adequately in disputes over 
things like beer, magnesium and lumber? Again, let us not forget 
that, in the same legislation that I mentioned moments ago 
regarding the implementation of trade agreements, the United 
States have made provision for the establishment of a 
consultation process for the settlement of disputes affecting 
American states. Canada could do the same thing.
<P>
	Finally, it is also imperative that the federal government do 
not act alone with regard to economic matters of major 
significance. These matters have a direct impact on the lives of 
all Canadians and on the social and economic development of 
every province. Thus, provincial governments must be 
consulted on such matters as employment enhancement, 
monetary policies, etc.
<P>
	The second major point is the need for agreement with the 
provinces on tariff rate quotas and selection mechanisms for 
access to Canadian market. The import quotas set to protect our 
supply management programs have been abolished by the GATT 
agreements. They have been replaced by tariff quotas. This 
affects four agricultural areas: dairy products, eggs, poultry and 
turkeys.
<P>
	Under the Canadian legislation implementing the Uruguay 
Round agreements, tariff quota mechanisms and their allocation 
are in the minister's hands. The Bloc Quebecois believes it is 
imperative to limit that power and to make it incumbent on the 
minister to get the agreement of the provinces for any change in 
these tariff quota allocation mechanisms.
<P>
<B>(1200) </B>
<P>
	But there is something more important. Because of the impact 
on regional economies, it is important that the provinces be 
involved in allocation. As with the tariff quota allocation, we do 
not see how the mechanisms for selecting our trade partners to 
be given access to the Canadian market can be concentrated in 
the hands of the minister only.
<P>
	It is imperative that the provinces be involved in this selection 
process, because of the direct and indirect impact it can have on 
regional economies. As for the subsidized exports, our 
amendment seeks to give Canadian industries more flexibility 
for the phasing out of our export subsidies in compliance with 
our GATT commitments.
<P>
	That flexibility is needed to maintain the competitiveness of 
our businesses on the international market, should their trade 
partners not comply with these same commitments. Again, we 
have to insist on the need for a parliamentary follow-up.
<P>
	This bill gives the minister the authority to levy duties on 
farm products imported outside tariff rate quotas, so that prices 
will not be lower than prices on the Canadian market when we 
are experiencing shortages. We all know that shortages are not 
always real, but can be engineered.
<P>
	I am pleased to speak to this amendment moved by my 
colleague for Longueuil providing for a parliamentary 
follow-up mechanism. For the sake of openness, it is imperative 
that we set up such a mechanism to monitor the implementation 
of the agreement in Canada, trade commitments undertaken by 
Canada's trading partners, and the impact of the agreement on 
Canadian workers and companies.
<P>
	Canada already has a mechanism to monitor U.S. trade 
practices, especially trade barriers against Canadian goods. 
That process is open to the public, but no report is tabled in the 
House. This amendment involves a control of the bureaucratic 
system by the Parliament of Canada in order to inform the 
Canadian public as fully as possible, and promote public debate 
on major issues affecting the Canadian economy.
<P>
	This same concern about openness can already be seen in the 
United States. The American version of our Bill C-57 provides 
for an annual review of trade policies by Congress. It is essential 
that Canadian elected representatives be informed of the status 
of commitments undertaken by our trading partners under the 
Uruguay Round. For example, Parliament should get 
information on reductions in internal and export subsidies in the 
United States, the opening-up of U.S. borders to Canadian 
exports, etc.
<P>
	More importantly, Parliament should be apprised of 
developments in trade disputes between Canada and the United 
States concerning, for example, wheat, beer, yoghurt and ice 
cream. Our American neighbours are prepared, with the number 
of consultation processes I mentioned earlier, to settle those 
disputes. Canada is not in the same state of readiness, and that is 
why we should implement similar mechanisms immediately.
<P>
	Since the Liberal Party promised labour adjustment measures 
in its red book, members opposite should not reject this 
amendment which provides that the minister should inform the 
House of new developments in this area.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
like my colleagues who already spoke on the various 
amendments now before us, I am pleased to give my views on 
amendments 1, 2, 6 and 7. With your permission, I would like to 
start with amendments 6 and 7, proposed by the hon. member 
from the NDP.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8223"> 8223 </A></B>
<P>
	With respect to amendment 6, I must first say that we 
subscribe to some of the principles underlying the amendment 
itself. However, we believe that certain provisions of this 
amendment will make the World Trade Organization's 
decision-making process much more cumbersome.
<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
	Consequently, we have some difficulty supporting this 
amendment. We agree particularly on the principle that the 
changes to be made to provincial legislation must be considered, 
along with the provincial areas of jurisdiction affected by 
implementing the Uruguay Round agreement.
<P>
	I would like to point out to my colleague that we presented an 
amendment which will require the government to take into 
account the provisions concerning provincial areas of 
jurisdiction. So I respectfully invite him to support our 
amendment instead of his, because his amendment will make the 
World Trade Organization's decision-making process 
considerably more cumbersome, as I said earlier.
<P>
	As for amendment 7, requiring the minister to report twice a 
year on the state of negotiations on the labour, social and 
environmental aspects of trade relations, we agree on this 
principle, of course. However, I repeat that we proposed an 
amendment which addresses this concern. I regret to inform the 
hon. member that, during the work of the Standing Committee 
on Foreign Affairs and International trade, our colleagues on the 
government side were not very receptive to the idea of having 
only one annual report on the implementation of the Uruguay 
Round agreements by our main partners, particularly the United 
States.
<P>
	I see that the amendment moved by the hon. member of the 
New Democratic Party, which suggests not only one report but 
two of them, has even less chance of being approved by 
members on the government side. Consequently, I would invite 
him, so that we can be sure that this point will be accepted, to 
support our amendment, which seeks only one report every year.
<P>
	Before I go any further, may I draw your attention to the fact 
that, once again, we do have not a quorum. On the government 
side, we only have the parliamentary secretary to the Minister of 
International Trade. So, Madam Speaker, I would ask you to rule 
on the quorum.
<P>
	<I>And the count having be taken:</I>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Since we have a 
quorum, the hon. member may continue.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bergeron:</B> Madam Speaker, I am impressed with how 
diligently you have applied the Standing Orders.
<P>
	I am surprised to hear our colleagues from the Reform Party 
constantly repeat that we should have Bill C-57 adopted as soon 
as possible in order for the Uruguay Round Agreement to be 
implemented at the earliest possible time. I think nothing should 
stand in our moving  as quickly as we can, even though obvious 
and significant improvements must be made to the bill tabled.
<P>
	My colleague, the hon. member for Regina-Lumsden, is 
concerned with the expectations of the steel industry. I can 
assure him that today's Order Paper also contains an amendment 
which will likely meet these expectations.
<P>
	I mentioned earlier that we intended to oppose amendments 
Nos. 6 and 7, mainly because we wanted to submit concurrent or 
similar ones which, according to us, would be simpler and easier 
to implement. With your permission, I will go back to these 
amendments.
<P>
<B>(1210) </B>
<P>
	I think our colleague, the hon. member for Laval East, did 
very well in introducing her amendment. I shall not elaborate 
further on that one.
<P>
	However, I would like to add a few comments on the 
amendment also brilliantly introduced by my colleague from 
Longueuil. The hon. member for Louis-Hébert mentioned a few 
things with regard to these two amendments and I would like to 
shed new information on the subject.
<P>
	I would like to remind the hon. members in this House that the 
purpose of the amendment was that Parliament be informed each 
year about the implementation of the Agreement in Canada, the 
fulfilment of our international obligations and the impact of the 
Agreement on Canadian and Quebec workers, according to 
priorities previously set by the Standing Committee on Foreign 
Affairs and International Trade.
<P>
	It must be understood that the Uruguay Round Agreement is 
anything but a simple agreement between technocrats. It is the 
result of eight years of very complex negotiations which meant 
that the various participating governments and States had to 
make a number of political choices.
<P>
	The effects of this Agreement are numerous and they affect a 
great many different areas. The Americans are ready, and we see 
this in the bill that is now before Congress-to challenge our 
tariff measures and compare them with the provisions of the 
international treaties we have signed, and I am referring to the 
Uruguay Round agreement and NAFTA. They have set up a 
consultation process to collect information that will be used to 
challenge our measures, for instance. We must be prepared. We 
must have the information we need to prepare on defence. In this 
respect, I note that section 424 of the U.S. bill to implement the 
Uruguay Round agreement reads as follows:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``The President, not later than six months after the date of 
entering into force of the WTO agreement with respect to the 
United States, shall submit a report to the Congress on the extent 
to which Canada is complying with its obligation under the 
Uruguay round agreement with respect to dairy and poultry 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8224"> 8224 </A></B>
<P>
products and with its  related obligations under the North 
American Free Trade Agreement''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This translates more or less as follows: ``The President, not 
later than six months after the date of entering into force of the 
WTO agreement with respect to the United States, shall submit a 
report to the Congress on the extent to which Canada is 
complying with its obligation under the Uruguay Round 
agreement with respect to dairy and poultry products and with 
its related obligations under the North American Free Trade 
Agreement''.
<P>
	If the United States makes provision in its legislation for 
verifying Canada's compliance with the Uruguay Round 
agreement, we can drop any reluctance we might have about 
including provisions in our own legislation provisions 
authorizing Parliament to report on how our principal trading 
partners, and mainly the United States, are complying with the 
Uruguay Round agreement.
<P>
	The amendment in question also refers to the impact on 
workers and companies, and I would like to expand on this 
aspect. Paragraph <I>(c)</I> of the amendment proposed in motion No. 
2 reads as follows: ``the impact of the Agreement on Canadian 
workers and companies''.
<P>
	The report to be submitted by the government should indicate 
the impact the Agreement has on Canadian workers and 
companies. This is important and reflects concerns raised by our 
colleagues in their amendments.
<P>
	I may recall that this provision in the amendment is entirely in 
line with a promise in the Liberal Party's red book that the 
government would assist individuals and firms in 
labour-intensive sectors of the Canadian economy, such as 
furniture manufacturing and textiles, to deal with restructuring. 
As you know, there is a significant concentration of these 
sectors in Quebec, and especially in Montreal.
<P>
	With this amendment, the government has an opportunity to 
meet one of their commitments in the red book which was to 
consider the impact of the Uruguay Round agreement on 
individuals and firms, so that subsequently, it can assist 
individuals and firms to deal with restructuring.
<P>
<B>(1215) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mac Harb (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
International Trade, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will speak to 
Motions Nos. 1, 2, 6 and 7, starting with motion No. 1.
<P>
	We believe the amendment suggested entails many problems 
and should be rejected. The first problem with subclause 3.1 is 
that we already have an efficient process for consultation 
between the federal and provincial governments regarding 
external trade when the provinces' interests are concerned. The 
provinces were very well served by these instruments in the 
implementation of international agreements or the resolution of 
disputes ensuing from this agreement.
<P>
	As for subclause 3.2, by requiring the Governor in Council to 
ask the provinces' consent before doing any of the things 
mentioned, it would change the current rules under the 
Constitution. It will give the provinces a veto in international 
matters.
<P>
	As for subclause 3.3, Canada cannot subject the 
implementation of its international commitments to the 
behaviour of its trading partners. If it considers that they are not 
respecting their obligations, Canada can then resort to the 
dispute resolution mechanism, which is usually successful. 
Canada cannot simply decide not to respect its obligations. It is 
still in Canada's interest to obey the rule of law, not to go against 
it.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Paragraph 3.4, the proposal would be contrary to what was 
negotiated in the agreement, specifically paragraph 4.2 of the 
agriculture agreement. A central part of the agriculture 
agreement is the elimination of measures such as variable 
levies. The effect of this amendment would be to introduce such 
measures. The government appreciates the interest on the issue 
of supplementary import of an agriculture product in cases of 
shortage in the domestic market. However, these matters are 
currently the subject of consultation with all domestic 
stakeholders.
<P>
	We also recommend rejection of Motion No. 2. Committees of 
the House are always free to request reports from ministers, 
imposing the statutory obligation. At this point to produce a 
report would I presume tie Parliament's hands in the future. I 
suggest it would be a lot more prudent to request such a report as 
the need arises. Preparation of such a report, I have no doubt in 
my mind and in the minds of my colleagues, will cost a 
significant amount of resources both financially and otherwise.
<P>
	Concerning paragraph (b), this refers to all trade obligations 
and commitments of Canada's principal trading partners and 
therefore goes beyond the scope of the bill before the House. 
Concerning paragraph (c), the impact of the agreement on 
Canadian workers and companies as a matter of economic 
analysis, there are methodological problems with isolating the 
effect of the agreement from other elements affecting Canadian 
companies and workers.
<P>
<B>(1220 ) </B>
<P>
	Concerning Motion No. 6, we recommend the rejection of this 
motion for the following reasons.
<P>
	The consultation requirement contained in paragraph 2.1 
would be very onerous and unworkable. The World Trade 
General Council will meet frequently and take numerous 
decisions that directly or indirectly affect Canadian interests, 
rights and obligations. The requirement for the minister to 
consult 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8225"> 8225 </A></B>
<P>
with the committee prior to each such decision would require 
frequent meetings with the committee on a plethora of details 
and highly technical issues. Moreover, the agenda of the council 
is often fixed very shortly before its  meeting and a prior 
consultation requirement would hamstring Canada's ability to 
respond quickly and flexibly to new developments in a manner 
that takes account of the position of other World Trade 
Organization members and that effectively advances Canadian 
interests.
<P>
	The reporting requirement in paragraphs 2.2 to 2.4 is also 
unworkable and would have significant resource implications. 
Some of the information requested is contained in the GATT 
reports. Other information is restricted under GATT practice 
and therefore its public release is not permitted. Canada is 
currently working in the World Trade Organization preparatory 
committee to have such documents derestricted on a more 
expedited timetable. These World Trade Organization reports 
and documents could be made available to a committee of the 
House.
<P>
	Finally, we also recommend the rejection of Motion No. 7 
because the reporting requirement is onerous and would entail 
significant resource implications. The minister could in any 
case report on ongoing negotiations from time to time as 
appropriate or as requested by a committee.
<P>
	My colleagues from the New Democratic Party suggest that 
we introduce an amendment that would deal with the social 
clause. This suggestion is too late to even be considered. Our 
answer to that would be that the best social clause this or any 
other government could offer would be a job.
<P>
	To that extent, I would suggest that Motions Nos. 1, 2, 6 and 7 
all be rejected.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to say very briefly that we are stressing in 
this motion the necessity for the federal government to consult 
provinces and establish mechanisms before taking position in 
sectors which are, formally and constitutionally, within 
provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	In agriculture, for example, we have seen during the last 
negotiations the impact that it could have on the marketing of 
eggs, poultry and other products. We believe that the federal 
should not only consult the provinces but also create a formal 
mechanism so that, in sectors such as agriculture, culture, and 
natural resources, provinces are not only consulted but have a 
say on the position taken by Canada in this international forum.
<P>
	This supposes that negotiations will go on with the provinces. 
We are told that provinces will be fully consulted; we fail to see 
how the government can oppose the amendment we are 
proposing.
<P>
	Let us take the American government, for instance. Liberals 
are of the opinion, and so am I, that the American federation is 
much more centralized than Canada. Yet, in Part E of the 
Statement of Administrative Action, the American equivalent of 
Bill C-57, which deals with the Uruguay Round Agreement Act, 
sections 102B and 102C provide that the US federal government 
must not only inform but establish a process to consult the states 
regarding the general implementation of the Uruguay Round as 
well as the positions to be adopted during the settlement of 
commercial disputes.
<P>
<B>(1225) </B>
<P>
	In the case of lumber, for example, Quebec had to bear the 
burden of tariffs which were in no way warranted. The problem 
existed only in British Columbia. Yet Quebec had to pay the 
price although, strangely enough, New Brunswick was exempt. 
Why two different treatments, one for Quebec and one for New 
Brunswick, when the problem was in British Columbia?
<P>
	If there was a compulsory system like the one we propose, 
first, we would not come to a point where some provinces, like 
Quebec, are penalized. Second, the government would have to 
stop pretending that it is consulting provinces, because there 
would be mandatory consulting mechanisms which would have 
to produce results. That means that the position of Canada would 
be arrived at after due consideration of the powers granted to 
provinces by the Constitution of Canada.
<P>
	We are only asking that the government abide by the 
Constitution and recognize provincial jurisdictions at the 
international level. We are asking for an extension of the rights 
of the provinces to the international level in the area of trade 
agreements and, as long as Quebec remains in confederation, we 
want Canada to respect provincial rights. If the United States 
can do it, what prevents Canada from doing the same?
<P>
	These are the comments I wanted to make, Mr. Speaker.

this motion amending Bill C-57.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8227"> 8227 </A></B>
<P>
	This amendment writes into Canadian law precisely the same 
measures that have been written by Congress into American law 
regarding the implementation of the World Trade Organization 
agreement in the United States. Congress has feared that the 
WTO will seriously compromise American sovereignty.
<P>
	We have heard many of the newly elected American 
politicians talking about their desire to remain an independent 
and sovereign nation capable of making their own economic 
decisions for Americans. This sort of statement is something we 
should be hearing from the front benches of our own government 
and from the other members in this Chamber who wish to ensure 
that all Canadians, regardless of their profession, vocation or 
status in life have an opportunity to succeed with the support of 
their government in their endeavours.
<P>
	As I indicated, Congress fears that the WTO will seriously 
compromise American sovereignty, It has therefore included 
several clear statements in its legislation to ensure that 
American law will prevail over any WTO decision. In looking at 
the American legislation which defines the relationship of the 
agreement to United States law and state law, in section 
102(a)(1) I read this:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>United States law to prevail in conflict. No provision of any of the Uruguay 
round agreements, nor the application of any such provision to any person or 
circumstance that is inconsistent with any law of the United States shall have 
effect.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Incredible. Section 102(a)(2) states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Construction. Nothing in this act shall be construed</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(A) to amend or modify any law of the United States including any law relating to:</BLOCKQUOTE>
(i) the protection of human animal plant life or health;
<P>
(ii) the protection of the environment; or
<P>
(iii) worker safety; or
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(B) to limit any authority conferred under any law of the United States, including 
section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The United States is one of the largest if not the largest trading 
nation in the world. Again the Americans are ensuring that the 
agreements they are reaching on the international stage protect 
the interests of the people within their borders. Surely we in 
Canada deserve to be negotiating and agreeing to no less.
<P>
<B>(1235) </B>
<P>
	We are familiar with the behaviour of the Americans under the 
North American free trade agreement especially with regard to 
durum wheat which I am very familiar with and softwood 
lumber which all members of my caucus are familiar with. We 
can assume that the Americans mean business when they say 
they will not let any international agreement stop them from 
harassing the trade of their trading partners if they feel it is in 
their interests.
<P>
	It is not that I am trying to say we can learn a lesson from the 
Americans in this regard. The Americans will defend 
themselves right or wrong. We know from durum wheat, 
softwood lumber and other matters that even when they are 
wrong they will take every measure they can to ensure that their 
interests are protected and the people whose interests need 
protecting are supported.
<P>
	Even in our own case where we know we are right on durum 
right we caved in. On the Crow benefit, transporting grain to 
port for sale in the international marketplace, we know we are 
right to maintain that benefit for our producers. Even before the 
agreement is signed here in Canada or the legislation 
implementing the agreement in Canada is concluded, the Liberal 
government across the way is giving away the Crow benefit.
<P>
	The government is negotiating right now on the prairies how 
to change that benefit for Canadian producers. The people who 
are best served by that benefit are being let down by this 
government in the absence of even an agreement through this 
legislation to proceed, whereas our trading partner is going to 
every length it possibly can to protect its producers even though 
it is wrong. This is unbelievable.
<P>
	Canadians have to take note of what is happening not only 
through this debate but through this whole WTO practice. As we 
know, in such circumstances we believe it is not only right but 
also proper for Canada to arm itself with the same legal weapons 
containing the effects of the WTO agreement until such time as 
the Americans will demonstrate goodwill in making a rules 
based trading system work.
<P>
	The member for Winnipeg Transcona, our party's trade critic, 
has done a tremendous amount of work on this legislation and 
has carefully thought through many of the provisions. As a 
result he has written a letter a portion of which I would like to 
read into today's record of <I>Hansard</I> and for the benefit of all 
those who are watching. This letter appeared in the Washington 
<I>Post</I> on November 6. I quote the last two paragraphs of his letter:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The apparent failure of a rules-based trading regime is rich in irony. 
Canadians and Americans, like others around the world, have been asked by the 
multinationals and their allies in governments to sacrifice considerable national 
sovereignty over investment policy and social, labour and environmental 
standards in exchange for this rules-based regime. If it becomes evident that the 
rules do not work as a result of either American ideological arrogance or 
American self-interest masquerading as ideology, informed voters around the 
world may feel that there has been a breach of the contracts their country has 
entered into through the various trade liberalization agreements. Such voters 
may demand that their governments try to take back some of that lost 
sovereignty, until such times as a real global community can be established as an 
alternative to the moral anarchy of the current ``globalization''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In this sense, any American sabotage of a rules-based regime may be the great hope 
for those opposed to globalization on the terms set out by the multinationals. America 
may yet be the  undoing of free trade, either by harassing others into despair about its 
sincerity, or by exiting such agreements themselves if they prove to be too effective in 
cases where fair trade conflicts with American self-interest.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
	It is very clear here that the Americans in attempting to 
protect their own economic interests are taking steps that could, 
if they scuttle the agreement in the United States, benefit 
Canadian interests in ensuring that those engaged in our 
economy receive a fair shake for what they are doing.
<P>
	The amendment in front of us today does nothing less than 
ensure that our legislation is exactly the same or carries exactly 
the same interests forward as what the Americans are doing in 
theirs.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it is my pleasure to stand in this House and support the New 
Democratic Party motion on Bill C-57 to provide the businesses 
and people of Canada with the same rights under the WTO as the 
Americans have.
<P>
	I want to start my remarks by sharing with the House and the 
people of Canada the fact that I had an opportunity to meet with 
a number of U.S. senators and congressmen last spring. The 
purpose of the meetings were to discuss certain issues relating to 
Canada and the U.S. with respect to steel production, steel trade, 
exports and imports, as well as the question of the durum wheat 
export problems that the Americans perceive to be having with 
Canada.
<P>
	This is what I concluded during the course of our discussions. 
We met with about 16 or 17 senators and congressmen from the 
United States. They are not free traders. They are not people 
who respect international agreements if the international 
agreements and free trade threaten their industries or jobs in 
their country or threaten markets which they have captured 
during the course of doing business.
<P>
	We should not be discarding or brushing off Americans as 
incompetent business people. Americans usually undertake 
business to make money. They undertake business around the 
world to make money around the world. They do not give other 
countries concessions such as: ``We will do a little business with 
your country and you can do a little business with our country 
and make a lot of money off us at the expense of jobs in the 
United States, at the expense of United States industry''.
<P>
	Americans are not stupid people and neither are their business 
people. They know full well when they see a business 
opportunity they will take full advantage of that business 
opportunity to maximize their profits and returns for their 
people.
<P>
	From this visit with these American senators and 
congressmen I also concluded that they view trade with Canada 
as important, but they view protecting their own industries and 
their own jobs to be of greater importance. In view of that they 
have laws which the member for  The Battlefords-Meadow 
Lake has already outlined. They have clauses in their legislation 
to protect their industry. Under Bill C-57 we do not have the 
same protection with respect to the WTO for our own industry, 
businesses and producers.
<P>
	Earlier in the day I spoke about the importance of the steel 
producers in Canada and the problems they are having with the 
Americans. Now even under the North American free trade 
agreement the Americans are able to say to the steel producers in 
Canada: ``We appreciate your competition, but you are hurting 
jobs in the United States. Therefore we are going to undertake to 
countervail and create a little bit of a problem for your 
industry''.
<P>
	There are mechanisms in the agreements, but whenever they 
do this it causes a great deal of expense to the steel producers in 
Canada because they have to comply with all the American laws 
that protect the American industry. It costs them money for 
lawyers. It costs them money for analyses. It costs them money 
to produce an argument in support of their position with respect 
to exporting steel form Canada to the United States.
<P>
	By the way, Canadian producers do not dump steel in the 
United States; they produce steel for contracts they have 
received in the United States of America. They produce the steel 
ready made. It is already pre-sold once it is there, but the 
Americans still do not like this process.

<P>
	Bill C-57 is about 200 pages in length and is a fairly 
substantial bill. I know all five members of the House who are 
left here right now seem to be concerned about the bill and 
seeing it passed in its entirety. New Democrats on the other hand 
are quite concerned that the bill provide the same protection to 
its producers and manufacturers in Canada as the American 
legislation provides to their producers and manufacturers. That 
is all New Democrats are asking for.
<P>
	We are asking for fairness. We are asking for equity. We are 
asking that the Government of Canada stand up on behalf of 
Canadian manufacturers, workers and others in the international 
market. The international market and other countries will be 
standing up for themselves. Unless Canadians feel it is a priority 
to protect and promote our own industry we have a real serious 
problem.
<P>
	Therefore in this motion we are asking the government to do 
what other countries have done for their people. We are not 
asking for anything more. We are not asking even to be 
provocative. We are just saying that we should do what others 
have done. Let us do what the government is obliged to do, that 
is to protect Canadians in the event of trade agreements.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> Do the right thing.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Solomon:</B> As my colleague from The 
Battlefords-Meadowlake has said, let us do the right thing for 
producers, business people, farmers and the working people of 
Canada.
<P>
	In summary, the American legislation protects its industries 
and its jobs. All we are asking in the amendment to Bill C-57 
that we have put before the House is for the government to do the 
same; no more or no less but just to do the same so we can stand 
proudly as parliamentarians and say that we are aware of the 
challenges facing our producers, our workers and our industries 
and we are prepared to stand four-square behind them in making 
sure they are not at a disadvantage in the international 
marketplace.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mac Harb (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for 
International Trade, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not understand 
why my colleagues are so anti-American in their approach to the 
legislation. We are talking about the World Trade Organization 
implementing legislation in terms of Canada and Canada's 
obligation to the international community. Since they 
mentioned section 102(a)(1) of the American implementing 
legislation I should like to suggest to my colleague that this 
action only reflects a congressional view that necessary changes 
in federal statutes should be specifically enacted rather than 
provided for in blanket pre-emption of the federal statute by the 
agreement.
<P>
	Canada's legal regime is similar in that respect. Actually 
under our Canadian domestic law Canadian legislators have 
precedence over our international obligation in case of conflict 
unless specifically provided otherwise in the legislation. This is 
as a result of basic Canadian constitutional law.
<P>
	The section which was quoted, section 102(a)(1), does not 
reflect U.S. intentions to apply domestic law in contravention to 
its World Trade Organization obligations or have recourse to its 
domestic legislation to unilaterally enforce World Trade 
Organization obligations against other countries.
<P>
	Irrespective of this section the U.S. will be bound by its World 
Trade Organization obligations under international law. Those 
obligations could be enforced under the dispute settlement 
mechanism if need be. This provision of the U.S. implementing 
legislation does not represent any threat to Canada.
<P>
	We are recommending rejection of the motion as proposed. 
Subparagraph 8.2, depending upon its interpretation, could have 
important constitutional implications. The bill does not intend 
in any way to introduce legislation which would impact on 
provincial legislation. The paragraph could be seen as an 
intrusion by Parliament into provincial jurisdiction. In 
subparagraphs 8.3 and 8.6 there is no need for these proposals.
<P>
<B>(1250) </B>
<P>
	Under Canadian constitutional law our international 
obligations become part of Canadian law only to the  extent of 
their implementation by Parliament. No international 
agreement can prevail over Canadian law unless Parliament 
specifically legislates to that effect. There is nothing in the bill 
that gives precedence to the agreement. Therefore our basic 
constitutional law will continue to apply.
<P>
	Subparagraph 8.4 is contrary to our international obligations. 
The sole purpose of the bill is to approve the World Trade 
Organization agreement and to implement obligations under the 
agreement. It is necessary to amend and modify existing 
Canadian statutes to implement those obligations and to allow 
Canada to become a full member of the World Trade 
Organization.
<P>
	Subparagraph 8.5 proposes to introduce a federal-provincial 
consultative mechanism for the purpose of implementing the 
agreement. This mechanism is already in place and is very 
efficient. Therefore we see no need to legislate on the matter.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
also would like to speak on motion No. 3 and point out that the 
Bloc Quebecois will vote against the motion presented by our 
colleague from the New Democratic Party, not because we are 
opposed to its subject matter, on the contrary. A number of 
principles contained in the motion are quite laudable and we are 
in total agreement with them.
<P>
	Obviously, it goes without saying that we support the 
protection of human or animal life, the protection of the 
environment and worker safety.
<P>
	We are also in total agreement with clause 8(2) which deals 
with the application of the agreement to the laws of the 
provinces and territories in Canada.
<P>
	We are opposed to this proposed amendment, and regrettably 
so, because we in the Bloc Quebecois have also been faced with 
having a similar amendment rejected by the government. During 
the clause by clause study of the bill, we attempted to present 
two amendment proposals to the Standing Committee on 
Foreign Affairs and International Trade, but we eventually 
withdrew them. With our proposed amendments, we wanted to 
make the implementation of the agreement conditional on a 
number of points. There were a few problems, consequently we 
withdrew our proposals and worded the amendments differently 
so as not to make the approval of the agreement conditional.
<P>
	The amendment presented by the New Democratic Party 
makes the approval of the agreement conditional on a number of 
things. Obviously, for our part, we would see no problem in 
making it conditional on the protection of human or animal life, 
the protection of the environment or worker safety.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8230"> 8230 </A></B>
<P>
	Rather, the problem is that the approval of the agreement is 
made conditional. It means that we are willing to renege on the 
word given on the international scene, which will not 
necessarily endear us to our trading partners. On the other hand, 
clause 8(6) states: ``No law of Canada may be declared invalid 
on the ground that the law or its application or enforcement in 
a particular circumstance is inconsistent with any provision of 
the Agreement''.
<P>
	The effect of this provision of the proposed amendment is to 
render Bill C-57 completely null and void. This is basically why 
we are opposed to this amendment.
<P>
	I say it again, we are doing so with great regret since the 
underlying principles are laudable and we are in total agreement 
with them. We will have to vote against this amendment and we 
most sincerely regret it.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
to oppose Motion No. 3. I believe the trade agreement must be 
allowed to overrule protectionist domestic laws both here and in 
the United States. We must act within the spirit of the agreement 
that was signed by the 120 member countries after seven long 
years of negotiations in the GATT Uruguay round.
<P>
	If we adopted the amendment proposed by the NDP we would 
not be achieving the move to free trade which benefits a lot of 
us, and particularly those in agriculture who did not have rules 
regarding trade in agriculture under the GATT. They are now 
being brought under it for the first time. I believe protectionist 
laws may be developed in some provinces that would handcuff 
the ability of the federal government to work within the World 
Trade Organization and the GATT.
<P>
	I believe it should be defeated and therefore oppose the 
motion.

<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise and speak to these 
amendments before us in relation to Bill C-57, the bill under 
debate today.
<P>
	I found it very interesting in the remarks just preceding the 
reading of the motion that we are debating now concerning the 
previous amendments that have been dealt with by the House 
that both speakers from the Reform Party and from the 
government indicated the inability to support a motion 
protecting the interests of Canadian producers by saying that the 
agreement has been signed and we cannot go back and 
renegotiate.
<P>
	The amendments that have been brought forward were 
identical to what the United States Congress is implementing 
today. The Americans are not asking that we go back to the table 
and renegotiate the entire Uruguay round. They are just acting in 
the interests of the people they represent.
<P>
	For this government and the Reform Party to side by each 
against the interests of Canadian producers, manufacturers, 
ordinary working people, people who care about the 
environment, people who care about whether or not children 
work or go to school is unbelievable. I find it completely 
unbelievable.
<P>
	The government has an opportunity with the two amendments 
in front of us now grouped for debate to redeem itself somewhat. 
The motions in front of us once again point to the need to ensure 
that Canadian legislation represents the same type of interest 
that the American legislation is representing.
<P>
	First, we have Motion No. 4 implementing in Canadian 
legislation section 425 of the American legislation dealing with 
the study of the milk marketing order system. Mr. Speaker, you 
have read into the record the motion that is in front of us calling 
on the minister to conduct a study to determine the effects of the 
Uruguay round on the milk marketing system.
<P>
	We could probably choose to do a study on a number of 
matters within the Uruguay round agreement but certainly the 
milk study is one that is very important to our producers. We 
have not yet seen the interpretive papers that this government 
examined during the negotiations which tell us how the milk 
marketing changes will affect producers throughout Canada.
<P>
	In order to be fair to this system, to the agreement and to the 
government that has accepted the changes at GATT, we are 
simply asking that in six months time this government in 
fairness to the milk producers of Canada go back over the 
previous six months, take a look at what  has happened since the 
implementation of the agreement and find out if the interpretive 
papers it looked at previously are in line with what was supposed 
to be happening in the industry.
<P>
	I said: ``Mr. Speaker, you read the motion out in front of us 
today''. Let me read to members section 425 of the American 
legislation and they can tell me if it is at all similar to the 
amendment in front of us:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>425. The Secretary of Agriculture shall conduct a study to determine the 
effects of the Uruguay round agreements on the federal milk marketing order 
system. Not later than 6 months after the date of entry into force of the WTO 
agreement with respect to the United States, the Secretary of Agriculture shall 
report to the Congress on the results of the study.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The government should not tell us that we have to renegotiate 
the entire Uruguay round in order to protect the interests of our 
milk producers in this country.
<P>
	Second, let us take a look at Motion No. 5 in front of us 
grouped for debate today. Mr. Speaker, you spent some time 
reading that motion into the record.
<P>
<B>(1305 ) </B>
<P>
	Let us take a look at section 124 of the American legislation 
that instructs the United States trade representative to present an 
annual report on the WTO to Congress. Let me read for the 
record the American legislation that is in front of us, section 
124.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Not later than March 1 of each year beginning in 1996, the Trade 
Representative shall submit to the Congress a report describing for the 
preceding financial year of the WTO</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(1) the major activities and work programs of the WTO, including the 
functions and the activities of the committees established under article IV of the 
WTO Agreement, and the expenditures made by the WTO in connection with 
these activities and programs;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(2) the percentage of budgetary assessments by the WTO that were accounted 
for by each WTO member country, including the United States;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(3) the total number of personnel employed or retained by the Secretariat of 
the WTO and the number of professional administrative and support staff of the 
WTO;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(4) for each personnel category described in paragraph (3), the number of 
citizens of each country, and the average salary of the personnel, in that 
category;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(5) each report-</BLOCKQUOTE>
I cannot read the word there. I will have to look at what we are 
presenting to Canadians.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-issued by the panel or the Appellate Body in a dispute settlement 
proceeding regarding Federal or State law, and any efforts by the Trade 
Representative to provide for implementation of the recommendation contained 
in a report that is adverse to the United States;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8232"> 8232 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(6) each proceeding before the panel or the Appellate Body that was initiated during 
the fiscal year regarding Federal or State law, the status of the proceeding, and the 
matter at issue;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(7) the status of consultations with any State whose law was the subject of a

Body; and,</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(8) any progress achieved in increasing the transparency of proceedings of 
the Ministerial Conference and the General Council, and of dispute settlement 
proceedings conducted pursuant to the Dispute Settlement Understanding.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Sound familiar? The Canadian bill, C-57, contains no such 
provision. We are asking today that Canada ensure that we have 
a report on the activities of the WTO in front of us just as the 
Americans will have by legislative authority. It is the only fair 
and equitable way to deal with this international crisis 
confronting us in trade.
<P>
	I would, even if the Americans had not put this legislation in 
front of them asking for an annual report, be asking that the 
Canadian people and the Canadian Parliament receive no less. 
We are entering into an agreement on a world stage. We then just 
allow that agreement to carry on without any kind of responsive 
action to the people of Canada and to this Parliament. It would 
be most unfortunate if we allowed it to happen.
<P>
	Let us ensure that we the Canadian people, producers, and 
parliamentarians have an understanding every year of what is 
happening on our behalf in the global marketplace and that we 
are with that information able to respond in appropriate manner.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to rise in the House this afternoon in support of this 
motion put forward by my New Democratic Party colleague, the 
member for The Battlefords-Meadow Lake.
<P>
	All we are asking in this motion is that the government be 
responsible, accountable, fair, and to introduce equity with 
respect to these international trade agreements. Accountability 
is very important to the people of this country. The government 
was elected on the basis of trust, on the basis that it would stand 
up for Canadians in Canada and stand up for Canada outside 
Canada.
<P>
	What we see here is a government that is not being fully 
accountable in Bill C-57. That is why we are moving this motion 
to ensure there is an accountability process so the government 
can review this particular bill and this particular trade 
agreement, the WTO, and report back to us in a regular and a 
timely fashion.
<P>
<B>(1310 ) </B>
<P>
	It is a natural course of doing business. As a business person, 
you never undertake a business plan, or in this case a 
government plan, without having some mechanism from which 
you can assess whether the program is working or not, or 
whether your business plan is functioning properly and working 
well. There has to be a regular review process. All we are asking 
is for the government to be accountable to the people of Canada 
and to the businesses of Canada by undertaking a regular  review 
and reporting back to Parliament; nothing more, nothing less.
<P>
	The government has the responsibility to the Canadian people 
to be accountable for the actions it takes and to be accountable 
for the treaties it enters into with other countries. It has to be 
responsible in its actions. All we are asking is for the 
government to take responsibility and to account for its actions 
on a regular basis.
<P>
	We are asking for fairness, the third point in my remarks. We 
are asking the government to treat its own people in a fair way. 
Some people may debate whether the Americans in their 
legislation are being fair internationally, and we believe that 
they are not, but they are being very fair to the people that they 
govern. They are being fair because they are saying if an 
international agreement is unfair to their working people, their 
industries, or their manufacturing sector, they will implement 
and take action to protect their people.
<P>
	Some people may view this as protectionism. Some people 
say why should we as Canadians play the same game? It is a 
mugs' game when you start putting a defence of one sector over 
another or defending one situation with respect to international 
agreements when other countries are not doing that. It starts 
bidding up or bidding down the intricacies and the processes that 
are involved that have made this agreement work in the first 
place.
<P>
	The government has to be fair to its own country, its own 
persons and its own industries and producers and manufacturers, 
by saying that in the event there is unfairness to Canadians, the 
government will have legislation which will protect the interests 
of Canadians to make it fair.
<P>
	With respect to equity, we need an amendment in Bill C-57 
which is equitable for everybody. We cannot insist on other 
countries doing what we are doing, but with respect to these 
amendments, we can inject some equity into the system.
<P>
	I end my remarks by responding to a comment that was made 
by a Reform member a few moments ago. He talked about how 
this Bill C-57, without amendment, would ensure that we have a 
free trade agreement. I have a book here written by John Ralston 
Saul called <I>The Doubter's Companion</I>. It is a dictionary of 
aggressive common sense. It defines the word free as the most 
over used term in modern politics, evoked by everyone to mean 
anything.
<P>
	Samuel Johnson once spoke of patriotism as the last refuge of 
scoundrels. Evocations of what is free and of freedom have now 
overtaken patriotism. This has led to a limitless series of 
oxymorons which have somehow become respectable: Free air 
miles, free trade, the twinning of free men and free markets 
when history demonstrates clearly that free markets do best 
under sophisticated dictatorships and chafe under limitations 
imposed by democracy. Another oxymoron with respect to the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8233"> 8233 </A></B>
<P>
word free is not only free trade but free love, free  glasses at gas 
stations, free offers, and in general a free ride.
<P>
	Of course parliamentarians here may be more aware of the 
oxymoron that we see almost firsthand in some of the actions we 
are taking as a Parliament now to rebuild our country after nine 
years of Conservative rule. The most widely used oxymoron in 
the entire country is Progressive Conservative. It does not make 
any sense. They are two opposites.
<P>
	The problem with this word free is that it has two 
contradictory meanings, as Mr. Saul goes on to say. One refers to 
political freedom, or liberty, and has an ethical value; the other 
refers to an imaginary state of being in which there is no effort 
and no cost. Freedom is thus confused with the gambler's idea 
that you can get something for nothing, and that is why 
Johnson's scoundrels are attracted to it. I maintain that Bill 
C-57 as proposed, without amendment, will injure Canadians 
and industry. That is why New Democrats are putting forward 
these amendments, to ensure that Canadians' interests are 
protected at the international level so we can continue to build a 
strong country from sea to sea.
<P>
<B>(1315) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mac Harb (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for 
International Trade, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my colleagues in the 
NDP sound like a broken record attacking the Americans and 
requesting that we do the same things the Americans are doing. 
It reminds me of somebody who cannot go to bed at night for 
worrying that someone else might be having a good time.
<P>
	The bill before us deals specifically with an agreement that 
was reached by 123 countries around the globe, nothing more, 
nothing less. The provinces have been consulted on the matter 
throughout the debate on the agreement, for the past six and a 
half years.
<P>
	I do not understand the NDP members. The premier of the 
NDP government in Ontario just came back from a trip to China. 
He supports the notion of the World Trade Organization and the 
GATT implementing legislation. The NDP premier from B.C. 
was on the same trip. He came back very happy and very excited 
about the notion of opening new markets around the globe.
<P>
	I do not know what the problem is with my colleagues in the 
NDP. Every time we use the word free, they jump.
<P>
	For Canada, which has the largest and longest border of 
almost any country on the globe, trade is very important. Trade 
means jobs. For every $1 billion in trade at least 9,000 to 10,000 
jobs are created. The NDP should be grateful that we have a 
government that cares, that we have a Prime Minister who cares. 
He led one of the largest business delegations in the history of 
Canada and came back with some good results.
<P>
	I suggest that my colleagues from the NDP stand up and 
congratulate the Prime Minister and the government for a job 
well done. For the first time ever in the history of the country we 
had a united team that went on a mission in order to promote 
Canada's interest.
<P>
	We would recommend the rejection of Motion No. 4 as 
proposed by my colleague from the New Democratic Party for 
the following reasons. The agreement does not require such a 
study as is proposed. The government already has such authority 
in any event. Therefore the amendment is unnecessary and 
redundant.
<P>
	Furthermore a report entitled ``Impact of the GATT 
Agreement on Canadian Agriculture and Agri-Food'' was 
released on June 22, 1994. This report prepared jointly by 
provincial and federal agriculture officials examined the effect 
of the Uruguay round on all agriculture sectors, including the 
Canadian milk marketing system. The report concluded that the 
effect of the Uruguay round on the dairy industry will be 
minimal. There will be no domestic price impact over the 
transition period on industrial milk. Production may decline 0 to 
2 per cent by the year 2000 as a result of new minimum access 
commitment for butter.
<P>
	For the same reasons we are recommending rejection of 
Motion No. 5. This amendment mandates a very specific and 
onerous reporting requirement that would have important 
resource implications.
<P>
<B>(1320) </B>
<P>
	The information on the activities of the World Trade 
Organization mandated in paragraph 12.1(a) to (d) is contained 
in the GATT annual report. The minister could undertake to 
table the World Trade Organization annual report in the House if 
it is necessary.
<P>
	For the reasons I listed we are recommending that Motions 
Nos. 4 and 5 be rejected.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I too 
welcome this opportunity to speak on the two motions put forth 
by our hon. colleague from The Battlefords-Meadow Lake. On 
Motion No. 4, to subject the effects of the agreement on the milk 
marketing system to parliamentary review, I would just like to 
remind our colleagues from the New Democratic Party that we 
presented a motion this morning, Motion No. 2, in which 
reference was made to a report to be laid before the House of 
Commons each year, concerning, in a more general sense, the 
implementation of the Uruguay Round Agreement by our major 
partners, especially the United States.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8234"> 8234 </A></B>
<P>

the same lines, yet has a much narrower scope than Motion No. 
2 that we presented this morning. Motion No. 4 stresses the 
importance of parliamentary review and, in that sense, I think 
that we can support, endorse this position, although, as I said 
earlier, the motion we tabled this morning, on which recorded 
division will be taken later on, has a much broader scope, while 
at the same time addressing our colleagues' concerns, concerns 
that are evident from Motion No. 4.
<P>
	Let me remind you that-and I think it is important to mention 
this, for the benefit of our colleagues from the government party 
of course, who gave us the impression this morning of being 
opposed our motion to amend No. 2-it is important to bear in 
mind that Motion No. 2 which we presented this morning had 
been suggested to us by the Union des producteurs agricoles and 
the Canadian Federation of Agriculture at one of the public 
hearings held by the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and 
International Trade.
<P>
	Both organizations testified before the Standing Committee 
on Foreign Affairs and International Trade to ask that Bill C-57 
include a provision requiring that a report be tabled each year on 
the implementation of the agreement in Canada, of course, but 
also by our major trading partners. Such a provision was part of 
the proposal we put forth this morning.
<P>
	Despite the expectations expressed by the Quebec farmers' 
union and the Canadian Federation of Agriculture, the 
government party apparently decided to oppose this proposed 
amendment. I therefore urge our colleagues from the New 
Democratic Party to strongly support this proposed amendment, 
which is consistent with what they are proposing in Motion No. 
4 but whose scope is much broader.
<P>
	As for Motion No. 5, which is aimed at ensuring in a way that 
the World Trade Organization operates in an open manner and 
that the Canadian government publishes studies on the 
implementation of the agreement, we always come back to this 
aspect of the problem: we think that Canada does not have to 
conform to provisions 12.1 (<I>a</I>) through (<I>d</I>). In our opinion, 
Canada must insist that the World Trade Organization should 
produce a comprehensive and relevant annual report.
<P>
	However-this is always a problem we have with the broad 
motions proposed by our colleagues from the New Democratic 
Party since this morning-we clearly are in complete agreement 
with some of the paragraphs, namely (<I>e</I>), (<I>f</I>) and (<I>g</I>).
<P>
<B>(1325) </B>
<P>
	These paragraphs provide for consultations with the 
provinces provisions, under the Agreement, that affect areas of 
exclusive provincial jurisdiction. It is very important to point 
out that the federal government, which claims to believe in 
co-operative federalism, must not hesitate to include in the 
agreement specific  provisions calling for consultations with the 
provinces on issues of particular interest to them.
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary said earlier: Yes, but we did 
consult with the provinces. If so, why are they so reluctant to put 
in the bill a provision specifically requiring such consultation 
with the provinces? In no way would it make the process more 
cumbersome. Despite what he said, it would not give the 
provinces a veto. It would simply give the provinces an 
opportunity to convey their concerns to the federal government 
on issues that concern them. I think that is quite legitimate.
<P>
	That being said, of course paragraphs (e), (f) and (g) of 
Motion No. 5 now before us refer to this taking into 
consideration of provincial jurisdiction and of particular 
concerns of the provinces.
<P>
	If these paragraphs were separate from the rest of the 
amendment, we could vote for such an amendment, but given 
paragraphs 12.1(a) to (d), which we believe are wrong for 
Canada, we must oppose this amendment, again, with regret.
<P>
	As for 12.1(h), we find it totally unacceptable because we do 
not really see how it could be applied right now.
<P>
	I think that it is also important to say something about clause 
12.2. Of course, we agree with the principle behind this clause, 
namely periodic review, but that being said, we would not want 
people to think that we on this side of the House have cold feet or 
are afraid of international trade agreements. For this reason, we 
could not legitimately give our full and complete support to that 
clause.
<P>
	In view of what I just said, and although we could very well 
have agreed to paragraphs 12.1(e), (f) and (g) without any 
problem, we must oppose this amendment.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
to speak in opposition to Motion No. 4.
<P>
	Why single out milk marketing? Dozens if not hundreds of 
industry groups would like to have government fund their 
studies. In fact we are dealing with Motion No. 5 here as well as 
the two tie together.
<P>
	Motion No. 5 asks for an annual report from the World Trade 
Organization. Those reports already exist under GATT. In a 
moment I want to read an article in today's <I>Globe and Mail</I> that 
deals specifically with the biannual reports from the GATT.
<P>
	These reports exist. The minister can be asked to table them in 
the House. Why cause extra work? It is more bureaucracy. It is 
something that the NDP sort of like, I understand.
<P>
	I want to read a quote from today's <I>Globe and Mail</I> regarding 
Canada's involvement in the GATT. It states: ``Canada's trade 
policy and practices receive generally high marks from the 
members at the GATT council during a two day discussion of a 
biannual report but the council criticized Canada's tariff system 
and interprovincial trade barriers''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8235"> 8235 </A></B>
<P>
	The party that wants to have a review of the milk marketing 
board might be quite surprised with the outcome.
<P>
<B>(1330) </B>
<P>
	Members opposite would be well advised to listen. The people 
at the GATT meeting today are the people who are making the 
report reviewing Canada's interprovincial trade barriers and our 
present milk marketing system. They are saying that the council 
criticized the complexity of Canada's tariff system and 
questioned the exceedingly high tariff rate quotas in the 
agriculture sector-and they are referring specifically to supply 
management-with an average of 205 per cent which will only 
go down to 174 per cent in the year 2000.
<P>
	They are critical of this. I am quite surprised they are asking 
for a review because a review would not be very kind to the 
supply management sector. It is an area that Canada is very weak 
in. Our position is that we have taken a minimum reduction in 
tariff in the supply management sector of 15 per cent. I think it is 
recognized worldwide that we have a problem that has to be 
cleaned up. If we talk about free trade, let us practise it here at 
home.
<P>
	In addition, members talk about the need to clean up 
interprovincial trade barriers. The three provincial governments 
in the country with NDP governments are the ones that are 
co-operating the very least in trying to get Canada's house in 
order in terms of cleaning up our problems at home, the trade 
barriers.
<P>
	We have more barriers to trade internally in Canada than in all 
the European Union. That is a disgrace. How can we compete 
internationally when we cannot even compete at home? Let 
them put their money where their mouths are and co-operate to 
try to get trade barriers reduced internally to give our businesses 
a chance to compete without one hand being tied behind their 
backs. Let us put Canada on the same level nationally as we do 
internationally in these trade agreements.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Philippe Paré (Louis-Hébert, BQ)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Motion No. 8</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-57, in Clause 58, be amended by replacing lines 4 to 8, on page 
25, with the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``(a) to fix the performer's performance in any existing or future medium by means 
of which sounds may be reproduced,''</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, as you know, Bill C-57 amends some 30 
Canadian acts, including the Copyright Act.
<P>
	We must first point out the archaic character of the Copyright 
Act. Bill C-57, An Act to implement the Agreement 
Establishing the World Trade Organization, includes a few 
amendments to the Canadian Copyright Act.
<P>
	Among those changes, the one in clause 58 illustrates the 
archaic character of this act which is meant to protect creative 
artists and performers.
<P>
<B>(1335) </B>
<P>
	Indeed, Clause 58(a) gives a performer the sole right ``to fix 
the performer's performance, or any substantial part thereof, by 
means of a record, perforated roll or other contrivance by means 
of which sounds may be mechanically reproduced''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8236"> 8236 </A></B>
<P>
	The wording of this change takes us back to the days of 
mechanical pianos. How, in 1994, can the government amend 
the Copyright Act and completely ignore the technological 
progress of the last few decades? This certainly does not make 
the government look like it is aware of the future challenges 
that await us. Yet, the government received numerous 
reminders.
<P>
	I want to quote a few paragraphs from the brief submitted by 
the Union des artistes to the Standing Committee of Foreign 
Affairs and International Trade:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>For almost eight years now, the Union des artistes and the Coalition of 
Creators and Copyright Owners have been asking for the rights regarding the 
fixation, the reproduction and the communication to the public of their 
performances in musical, literary, dramatic and choreographic works, known 
as neighbouring rights. Meanwhile, Bill C-57 recognizes the exclusive right 
of our people to fix the performance, or any substantial part thereof, by means 
of a record, perforated roll or other contrivance by means of which sounds 
may be mechanically reproduced. If Canada recognizes, in 1994, our 
exclusive right to the fixation of a sound performance by means of a 
perforated roll, how long will we have to wait for the recognition of our rights 
on performances fixed or reproduced by using optical discs, compact discs 
like CD-ROMs and other modern supports?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Clause 58 of Bill C-57 is not only totally disconnected from 
today's reality: It also creates a great danger for the future.
<P>
	This government does not seem to realize that when Canada 
signs a commercial treaty such as the one resulting from the 
Uruguay Round of negotiations, it waives part of its 
sovereignty. This is true not only in the case of trade 
agreements, but also in the defence sector. Just think of the 
North Atlantic Treaty or NORAD.
<P>
	So, it is essential for the government to recognize that section 
58 limits its own future jurisdiction and that every measure must 
be taken, now and in the future, to minimize any negative 
impact.
<P>
	We fear that, as soon as it is passed, this bill could in fact limit 
the performers' rights to the only rights recognized in this bill. 
This leads one to fear that restrictions set here and there in 
commercial agreements could be seen as absolute restrictions 
when the time comes to review our own national legislation in 
this area. This is why our amendment is crucial.
<P>
	Members will recall that the Uruguay Round Agreement only 
dates back to December 15, 1994. When the government 
introduced Bill C-57, the Parliamentary Secretary to the 
minister of International Trade admitted that only 13 of the 
hundred or so countries which signed the agreement had already 
introduced their implementation legislation.
<P>
	Since this bill was introduced, the race has begun. The 
Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade 
is in a hurry. The number of witnesses has been limited and 
committee members are rushed off their feet. We have to cut 
corners, because an international agreement was signed.
<P>
	Let us draw a parallel between the position of the Liberal and 
Conservative governments concerning the protection of the 
creative and performing artists' rights.
<P>
	I would like to quote from the brief submitted by the Union 
des artistes:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works 
was concluded in 1886. Canada's Copyright Act, which was passed in 1926, 
forty years later, was not reviewed by Parliament until 1988.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>As for the Rome Copyright Convention on the protection of performing 
artists, producers of recordings and broadcasting agencies, it was concluded 
in 1961 and is already obsolete because it applies only to sound productions.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Thirty-three years later, Canada has yet to sign the convention and adjust 
its own legislation to meet the minimum provisions of the convention. As a 
result, Canada, which takes pride in being one of the most progressive 
countries in the world, lags far behind in defending and promoting the 
interests of its creative artists.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Germany, France and Japan all signed the Rome Convention. In addition, 
these fellow members of the G-7 group, realized it was important to adjust their 
respective legislations to the current realities of artistic creation. Germany and 
France have passed legislation dealing with neighbouring rights. They also 
recognized the need for royalties on private copies, which is the case in Japan.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Meanwhile, Canada is proceeding in a haphazard way, through its legislation 
to implement trade treaties, to change its own copyright legislation.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1340) </B>
<P>
	That is not the only paradox. I have another example. On 
November 14, Liberal majority members tabled in this House 
the report of the Special Joint Committee Reviewing Canadian 
Foreign Policy. Against the wishes of the Official Opposition, 
majority members made culture, a jurisdiction shared by the 
federal government and the provinces, the flagship of foreign 
policy. How can the government claim that culture, the result of 
the work of performing artists and creators, is central to its 
foreign policy, when it refuses to do what is necessary to 
promote and protect the work of those who create culture?
<P>
	The cultural sector is an important one. The present 
government's failure to proceed with its review of the Copyright 
Act can only be explained by its failure to recognize a basic fact 
of our economic life. The government seems to be ignorant of 
the fact that in 1991, the cultural sector was responsible for jobs 
employing more than 300,000 Canadians and Quebecers, 
putting it ahead of the forestry, mining and insurance sectors in 
this respect.
<P>
	It is almost miraculous that the cultural sector should play 
such an important role in our economy, no thanks to the federal 
government's reluctance to invest in this sector, which may have 
serious consequences. According to the Union des artistes, and I 
quote: ``This minimalist and timid approach may jeopardize 
creative activity in this country. At a time when digital 
conversion has removed former distinctions between sound and  
audio-visual productions, at a time when direct broadcast 
satellites and the information highway are about to redefine the 
relationship between the consumer, the user and artistic 
productions, Canada still protects its creators and defends its 
culture by 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8237"> 8237 </A></B>
<P>
means of incidental measures consequential on its ratification of 
international trade treaties''.
<P>
	This questionable approach on the part of the government can 
only be explained by the tremendous impact of lobbying by big 
producers and broadcasters. I would urge hon. members to vote 
in favour of this motion presented by the Official Opposition, 
whose purpose is simply to provide a minimum amount of 
protection for our performing artists and creators. Remember 
that this class of cultural workers has an average income of less 
than $10,000!
<P>
	Remember also that our creators and performing artists need 
financial independence. They need freedom and pride to 
continue to work at their art. The dignity of work, a favourite 
phrase of the Prime Minister, should also apply to this class of 
Canadians and Quebecers. We must also protect the integrity of 
the work done by our creative artists. The Copyright Act must be 
improved, but meanwhile, we could make do with the 
amendment I am proposing to Bill C-57, and I would ask hon. 
members to support that amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bergeron:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order. We are not 
surprised that our colleagues in the governing party have 
difficulty understanding our arguments and our amendments, 
since once again, I submit to you that we do not have a quorum.
<P>
	<I>And the count having been taken</I>:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> We now have quorum and 
are resuming debate on Motion No. 8.
<P>
<B>(1345 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it is my pleasure to speak once again on the amendments to Bill 
C-57. Before getting into my specific remarks on this motion I 
want to say a couple of things.
<P>
	The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for International 
Trade in his remarks earlier on this bill made some inference 
that the New Democratic Party provincial governments across 
this country were not in favour of trading with other nations. I 
want to correct the record.
<P>
	I want to inform the parliamentary secretary that coming from 
Saskatchewan as I do, I know firsthand how important trade is to 
the farmers of Saskatchewan, the potash producers of 
Saskatchewan, the steel producers of Saskatchewan, the 
uranium miners of Saskatchewan and all the other people in our 
province who rely quite heavily on trade, including those who 
produce natural gas, oil, coal and other resources. The New 
Democratic Party government of Roy Romanow is not only on 
record supporting trade, but has instituted very aggressive  
trading policies with other nations with respect to the resources 
of Canada and the resources of Saskatchewan.
<P>
	I am sure the parliamentary secretary made an oversight or 
had a sudden collapse of memory when he made reference to 
NDP governments and their support of trade. I am sure he would 
want to stand and correct that at some point after my remarks.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harb:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order, precisely what I 
said is that the NDP government in Ontario-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. Clearly, that is not 
a point of order. I concede it may be a matter of great debate for 
the House but we are seized with Motion No. 8.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solomon:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am somewhat puzzled to see 
that not only does the parliamentary secretary not have a great 
deal of knowledge about Saskatchewan and its many resources, 
but he does not seem to have a great deal of knowledge of the 
rules of the House either.
<P>
	I will continue my preface by saying that the New Democratic 
Party government in Saskatchewan has been leading in many 
areas. For example, Allan Blakeney's NDP government from 
1971 to 1982 had 11 consecutive balanced budgets, the only 
provincial government or jurisdiction in this country to do so. 
As a matter of fact that government was the last one to have a 
provincial balanced budget. The only reason it did not continue 
on was that in 1982 a Conservative government under Grant 
Devine was elected, supported by the Liberals. It proceeded to 
almost bankrupt the province in the nine years that followed.
<P>
	At the same time as those balanced budgets we also had a 
prescription drug plan for all of our citizens. We had a dental 
plan for all of our children 18 years of age and under. We also 
had the lowest provincial tax regime in the entire nation.
<P>
	I know the parliamentary secretary is salivating at this 
information. He is becoming quite educated with respect to 
Saskatchewan now that he has had the correct information put 
before him. I am sure he will look forward to visiting our 
province some day and meeting with Premier Romanow, who by 
the way was elected in 1991 after nine years of Conservative 
government. With respect to Bill C-57, I can assure the House 
that he has concerns as we do in this caucus with respect to these 
amendments.
<P>
	Since 1991 we have undertaken to go from a $1 billion annual 
deficit to the point where now after three years we are on the 
verge of being the first jurisdiction provincially or federally in 
Canada to introduce a balanced budget. I want members of this 
House to know that. That is under an NDP government.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8238"> 8238 </A></B>
<P>
	The second point I want to make is in relation to the Reform 
member from Peace River. He made some comment about Bill 
C-57 and the amendments thereto and how he supports Bill 
C-57, which does not protect the interests of Canadians. He 
believes it should proceed because he believes in competition.
<P>
	John Ralston Saul is the author of <I>The Doubter's Companion</I>, 
a book which members should pay some attention to. It is a 
dictionary of aggressive common sense in which Reformers are 
very interested. He defines competition as an event in which 
there are more losers than winners. Otherwise, it is not a 
competition.
<P>
<B>(1350 ) </B>
<P>
	A society based on competition is therefore primarily a 
society of losers. Competition is of course a very good thing, he 
says. We cannot live in a complex society without it. On the 
other hand, if the principal relationship between citizens is 
based on competition what has society and for that matter, 
civilization been reduced to?
<P>
	The purpose of competition is to establish which is the best. 
The best may be defined as any number of things: the fastest, the 
cheapest, the largest quantities. It may even be the highest 
quality. Unfortunately the more competition is unleashed the 
more it tends to eliminate quality as something too complex to 
be competitive.
<P>
	Finally he says that the point of competition, if it is left to set 
its own standards is that only the winners benefit. This is as true 
in economics as it is in sport. A society which treats competition 
as a religious value will gradually reduce most of the population 
to the role of spectators.
<P>
	Democracy is impossible in such a situation and so is middle 
class stability. That is why the return to increasingly 
unregulated competition over the last two decades has led to 
growing instability and an increasing gap between an ever richer 
elite and an ever larger poor population.
<P>
	In final summary, competition in a middle class society must 
include the cost of middle class infrastructure. Hundreds of 
other factors create hundreds of other levels of competition. 
That is why in serious competition such as hockey or football 
there are strict regulations controlling time, movement, 
numbers, dress and language. Unregulated competition is a 
naive metaphor for anarchy.
<P>
	What I want to say, thanks to Mr. Saul, is that the Reform 
Party wants competition in its purest form. If we have 
competition in its purest form, which I am not opposed to in a 
purest form society, we will have in essence anarchy. That is 
why we have Bill C-57 which establishes in continuity with the 
WTO some regulations on the playing field we are operating on 
on this globe.
<P>
	I am saying that the government has to ensure that the playing 
field rules have fairness, equity and justice for Canadians as 
other countries are undertaking to provide for their own citizens.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I just want 
to support my colleague from Louis-Hébert, who made an 
excellent speech. He explained very well his reasons for 
presenting this motion, which requires considering not only 
products made in the past but also those to come in the future. I 
find it rather strange that the government did not consider what 
may be coming down the road.
<P>
	We know that technology is changing very rapidly and I do not 
see how the government overlooked this item. Fortunately, the 
parliamentary secretary is not looking at me any more, but he 
should be here to listen to me because it is quite important for 
him to hear-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. I appreciate the 
long experience which the member for Longueuil has, but I want 
to remind him that we must not comment on the absence of 
anyone in this House. I will therefore ask the member to stick to 
his speech.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leblanc (Longueuil):</B> Mr. Speaker, you are quite right. It 
was so important for me that I could not help saying it.
<P>
	As you know, technology is changing very fast. The compact 
disks which we see today, that have just come on the market, 
may be obsolete in a year or two or three. If we do not consider 
future products, we are likely to have big problems.
<P>
	For example, some experts say that technology will develop 
more quickly in the next ten years than it did in the past fifty. 
Just imagine how many products and machines will be invented. 
All kinds of inventions will be made just in the next ten years. So 
I think it would be a serious mistake not to recognize the motion 
from the member for Louis-Hébert, which says that future 
products must also be considered.
<P>
<B>(1355) </B>
<P>
	That is why I wanted to reinforce the very good explanation 
given by the member for Louis-Hébert, but I still hope that the 
members here in this Chamber will inform those outside that 
this motion is really important.
<P>
	I repeat, it is Motion No. 8, which says that future products 
and not just present products must be considered. I know that the 
hon. member near me has understood very well what I just said 
and that he will hasten to repeat it to his Liberal friends so that 
this motion passes, because I think it is very important for the 
future.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, Bill 
C-57 to implement the agreement establishing the World Trade 
Organization includes approximately 20 clauses dealing with 
copyright. Most of these clauses are designed to ensure that the 
<P>

<B><A NAME="8239"> 8239 </A></B>
<P>
Canadian Copyright Act is in  conformity with the Trade Related 
Aspects of International Property Right, the document that sets 
the WTO copyright rules.
<P>
	On the whole, as necessary as they may be, these are 
nonetheless minor changes. They do however put into 
perspective the resistance to change and indifference of the 
Canadian government in terms of intellectual property, as 
evidenced by Clause 58, lines 5 to 8, on page 25 of Bill C-57. 
This clause establishes a new right, namely that of authorizing 
without consent the fixation and reproduction of the performer's 
performance. The wording of this provision is prima facie proof 
of how deeply anachronistic and antiquated the Canadian 
Copyright Act.
<P>
	In poetic terms, one could say that in the beginning, there 
were the natural sounds of the elements: the crash of the sea, the 
whistling wind, the murmuring breeze, the rumble of falling 
rocks and the crackling of the fire. Then came the natural sounds 
of human and animal communication: bird songs, monkey 
grunts, a child's cry, the murmur of love, the African tam-tam. 
Less than a century ago, all sounds had to be heard live.
<P>
	Through an evolutionary and creative process, the air is now 
filled with sounds recorded on records, tapes, CDs, videos, 
CD-ROMs. Unfortunately, it would seem that the Canadian 
Copyright Act remains frozen in time, around 1878 to be more 
precise, the year that Thomas Edison invented perforated roll 
recording.
<P>
	Clause 58 of Bill C-57 is a clear, not to say glaring, example. 
It reads: ``to fix the performer's performance, or any substantial 
part thereof, by means of a record, perforated roll or other 
contrivance by means of which sounds may be mechanically 
reproduced-''
<P>
	When he invented the phonograph, Thomas Edison thought 
that sounds could be fixed permanently to be reproduced.

	<B>Mr. Bernie Collins (Souris-Moose Mountain, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in September an agreement was signed by the 
Government of Canada, Saskatchewan Wetlands Conservation 
Corporation, Ducks Unlimited Canada and Wetlands for the 
Americas to work with one another and other organizations and 
individuals. They will maintain and enhance the Last Mountain 
Lake Western Hemisphere Shorebird Reserve Network Regional 
Site as a critical habitat for shorebirds.
<P>
	Last Mountain Lake is the 25th site to be dedicated as a 
shorebird reserve in the western hemisphere and the third site in 
Canada. The two other sites are the Bay of Fundy in Atlantic 
Canada and Quill Lakes, Saskatchewan.
<P>
	This action will contribute to the maintenance of the

the internationally significant natural resources Canada 
possesses to protect for future generations.

Canadian peacekeepers are now surrounded by Serb rebel forces 
in Bosnia. It is not the first time Canadian troops find 
themselves in a difficult situation because of hostile acts by 
fighters in the former Yugoslavia.
<P>
	Nevertheless, the illegal actions of Serb forces against 
international peacekeeping forces in Bosnia worry all 
Quebecers and Canadians. The Bosnian population is literally 
torn apart by the fighting that goes on, but it could suffer even 
more this winter without the presence of the peacekeepers.
<P>
	Our soldiers are carrying out their humanitarian duties in the 
former Yugoslavia with courage and dignity, and the members

Speaker, Campaign 2000 released disturbing statistics today. 
The number of poor children in Canada has increased to almost 
1.3 million, an increase of 35 per cent since 1989. Campaign 
2000 is a partnership of 51 organizations across Canada 
dedicated to promoting support for the all-party House of 
Commons resolution to eradicate child poverty by the year 
2000.
<P>
	Campaign 2000 reports that Canadian children today are more 
likely to be poor, to be dependent on social assistance, to use a 
food bank and to live in families where parents are unemployed.
<P>
	As a society we must no longer tolerate this horrible plight 
faced by many Canadian children. As members of Parliament we 
must tackle the problem of child poverty.
<P>
	I urge the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Human 
Resources Development to allocate more resources toward 
improving the dismal situation of child poverty. We must not 
sacrifice future generations in our attempts to reduce the debts 
of current generations.

appointment as Governor General of Canada.
<P>
	As a New Brunswicker and an Atlantic Canadian I must admit 
I am very proud of this appointment. I congratulate the Prime 
Minister on this wise and popular choice. Romeo LeBlanc is 
well respected in his home province of New Brunswick, in 
Atlantic Canada and indeed in all of Canada.
<P>
	Romeo LeBlanc's appointment as the first Governor General 
from Atlantic Canada demonstrates the high esteem the 
government has for Atlantic Canadians and goes a long way in 
dispelling the many slurs recently heard against Atlantic 
Canadians.

Mr. Speaker, I rise out of concern with the continued attempts by 
members of the Reform Party to portray immigrants and 
refugees as criminals.
<P>
<B>(1405 ) </B>
<P>
	As reported in a recent article in the <I>Montreal Gazette</I>, ``A 
Reform MP asserted that almost 25 per cent of refugee claimants 
have criminal records, when in fact all reliable figures place the 
rate at less than 2 per cent''.
<P>
	By making statements like these, Reform members not only 
imply an inability to grasp the concept of decimal points but also 
imply an overzealous desire to paint refugees in a negative 
manner regardless of the facts.
<P>
	It is disappointing that neither the member concerned nor his 
party has come clean and apologized for their mistake. In the 
name of integrity and honesty, I ask the leader of the Reform 
Party to apologize to the House for misleading Canadians.

education system, under the pretext of reducing government 
spending.
<P>
	After trying to dismantle the Royal Military College in 
Saint-Jean, the government is now going after universities in 
Quebec and Canada. In this regard, the Quebec federation of 
university professors is concerned about social reform trends 
affecting the financing of post-secondary education.
<P>
	The Minister of Human Resources Development is trying to 
make the people believe that his reform will benefit learning. On 
the contrary, the minister is sabotaging higher education at a 
time when, in an increasingly competitive international market, 
economic competitiveness clearly depends on the quality of 
human resources.

electronic democracy or initiative or referendum or recall, 
Liberal members enthusiastically demonstrate their opposition

of society is a cornerstone of a compassionate nation. In 
particular the House will agree with me that wife abuse should 
not and cannot be condoned in any form.
<P>
	A victim of wife abuse should not be penalized further, as is 
the case of my constituent June Ann Sullivan Robinson. She has 
been ordered to leave Canada because her husband has 
withdrawn his sponsorship as a result of her complaints of wife 
abuse over a period of three years. He has since been convicted.
<P>
	Ms. Robinson is a self-supporting woman with strong family 
ties in Canada. Her request to immigration officials to continue 
processing her application under humanitarian and 
compassionate grounds has been denied.
<P>
	I am very concerned about the precedent set by this ruling. It 
sends a message that wife abuse is fair game for a sponsoring 
husband. I urge the minister to reconsider this policy in view of 
its far-reaching consequences.

of London was immense for such a short life.

Jim Ashton was elected president of the London Labour Council 
in October of 1988 and was re-elected to that position just prior 
to his death.
<P>
	He was more than a union leader. He was a community and 
social activist who spoke his mind and stood his ground. He is 
survived by his wife Lucy and daughters Amanda, Jessica and

LeBlanc is very qualified for the position.

the Atlantic provinces, for New Brunswick and for all Acadians

governor general is a native of Atlantic Canada.
<P>
	After 127 years of Canadian history, after the deportations of 
1755, we are truly pleased, in this year of the World Congress of 
Acadians, by this historic appointment. This is the crowning 
achievement of the long and perilous road already covered and

	These new revelations demonstrate once again that the 
government must appoint, as soon as possible, a real 
commission of inquiry. If the Minister of National Defence 
really wants to shed light on the behaviour of Canadian military 
personnel in Somalia, he must take such action as quickly as 
possible, rather than wait for the conclusion of the current

Reform Party that has the plan to deal with the country's deficit 
and debt.
<P>
	In the presentation to the finance committee today, the 
Reform Party outlined $10 billion in specific expenditure 
reductions. This is the first phase of an updated zero in three 
plan to eliminate the deficit in three years. The presentation 
pointed out the absolute necessity of going beyond the 
government's 3 per cent target if we are to preserve Canada's 
fiscal integrity.

billion to the debt bringing the total to an astronomical figure of

Mr. Speaker, in retaliation for NATO air raids on their positions, 
the Serb forces have taken peacekeepers hostage, including 55 
Canadians, in Visoko, all the while pursuing their offensive on 
the Muslim enclave of Bihac. In addition, some 1,200

<P>

found to finish off their offensive on Bihac without further 
disruption from NATO raids?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Michael Collenette (Minister of National

than in four or five days. It is too early to tell.
<P>

in general but our personnel in particular. As I said a moment

defended today at the NATO meeting, held in Brussels,

an unprecedented threat to Quebec's education system. The

through the abolition of Quebec's special abatement.
<P>
	In order to alleviate the legitimate concerns of Quebec's

<B>(1425 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
interesting. We have the finance committee travelling round the 
country. Virtually every group and organization has presented 
proposals for the federal budget. And after a year we still have 
no fiscal policy from the Government of Canada.
<P>
	Since the Minister of Finance appeared before the committee 
a month ago and admitted that his budget projections were all 
wrong, the Canadian dollar has lost over a cent in international 
markets and interest rates have risen steadily as a consequence.
<P>
	I have a supplementary question. Does the government have 
any proposal for dealing with the deteriorating financial 
situation other than raising interest rates?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the suggestion that 
we have no fiscal policy runs counter to the statement of the hon. 
member for Capilano-Howe Sound who gave the finance 
minister a 90 per cent mark.
<P>
	Of course the government has a fiscal policy. We had a fiscal 
policy of bringing the deficit down to 3 per cent of GDP. We had 
that before we were elected and we have that now. The Prime 
Minister has maintained it and the Minister of Finance has 
maintained it.
<P>
	That is our policy and we will do that in the third year of our 
mandate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
member for Capilano-Howe Sound gave the government good 
marks for realizing that all its fiscal assumptions during the 
campaign were wrong.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	My supplementary question is for the same minister. The 
reason for the lack of confidence in the financial market is 
clearly the government's fiscal policy.
<P>
	Does the minister admit that the goal of reducing the deficit to 
3 per cent of GNP is completely inadequate in a period of 
economic growth?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we have never said 
that our target of 3 per cent of GDP in the third year of our 
mandate was a final result. We have said that is an interim target 
on the way to a balanced budget.
<P>
	It is an interim target. It is achievable and we intend to get to 
that target of 3 per cent.

undertaking the social security reform exercise.
<P>
	There have been a number of technical papers put forward. 
Those papers have provided information that is very important 
to the way in which the social security reform is undertaken.
<P>
	In relation to that also we have been listening to Canadians 
across the country through the committee. They have let us

<P>
	This government has been asking for spending cut 
recommendations. Mr. Parizeau recently said that Canada's 
system of equalization payments is too generous and saps the 
initiative of Quebecers. Why does the government not hit two 
birds with one stone: Reduce the deficit by $3 billion and 
simultaneously stop sapping the initiatives of Quebecers?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the statements of the Premier of Quebec are very 
interesting.
<P>
	Yes, we probably could study his suggestion that we cut on 
transfer payments of that nature. However I think he has not 
thought it through completely. I could hit two birds and two 
home runs at the same time but I think that for the good of 
Quebecers it is better to keep equalization payments in place.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Auditor General in his report noted that welfare and

Does the Prime Minister recognize the opportunities for 
budgetary savings which arise from these facts?
<P>

before the report of the Auditor General, Mr. Speaker, we 
decided to have a reform to do that, to make sure that these 
moneys are used to create opportunities and training.
<P>
	The main goal is not to make money to reduce the deficit. If 
we can do it at the same time it would be perfect. The main goal 
is to use our money better and help people get training and get a 
job so that they will become productive. That is exactly what the 
Minister of Human Resources Development is doing at this

CN administrators enjoy the same benefits as he does, namely

the amount of taxpayers' money which is loaned in that fashion 
to these CN officers?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member is fully aware that yesterday we

The salary is set by order in council.

<P>
	As I suggested yesterday, the CEO of CN held a press

address them to the appropriate body, namely CN's board of

the minister not agree that any amount of money loaned to senior 
officials of CN or any Crown corporation accountable to his 
department should be declared, so that the shareholders of these 
corporations, namely Canadian taxpayers, are aware of such 
practices?

<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr.

occasions, the arrangements between the president of CN and 
the board is one that is subject to the controls that are internal to 
a crown corporation.

the fact that we have announced an inquiry which will be open

of justice for me to join in these kinds of discussions.

Canadian Armed Forces has made a public statement without 
authorization. The hon. member should know that as a condition 
of service if individuals have something to communicate they 
communicate it through their superior.
<P>
	I overlooked the rules last week because what Major 
Armstrong said was of such purport and seriousness that I 
believe he had the right as every Canadian citizen does to make 
this particular statement. Therefore, we called for an inquiry. 
We cannot have this matter tried on a daily basis in the 
newspapers, on television programs or here in the House of 
Commons. It has to go to the inquiry.
<P>
	As a result I have directed the Chief of Defence Staff to 
inform members of the armed forces of the sensitivity of this 
matter and remind them of their obligations as members of the 
armed forces in the interests of justice. Hon. members opposite

her husband has threatened to kill her as soon as she returns.

the minister wrote me the following, and I quote: ``I have

exceptional measures''. Why did the minister change his mind 
three days later?

	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and

was to stay the deportation so that a proper and full review may 
be conducted.

residents, most of whom are Inuit, to eat properly. Today, an 
Inuit in the far north pays twice as much for the same basket of 
groceries as we do here in the south, while his average income is 
much lower.
<P>
	Could the Minister of Indian Affairs explain why, despite the 
fact that $14 million is spent annually on subsidizing the 
distribution of food in the far north, a person who lives in that 
area always has to pay twice as much for his food as people in 
the south?
<P>

<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, once again I totally agree 
with my friend. He has a perception of my portfolio that I 
sometimes find lacking in other members of this House.
<P>
	He has pointed out the cost of food mail. A gallon of milk in 
Nunavut is $12. There is nutrition that does not exist. We have 
$14 million in food mail. I do not think it is enough and I for one 
will fight within my ministry and other ministries to improve 
that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solberg:</B> Increase spending.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> That's right, spend more.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Irwin:</B> Go and see for yourselves instead of sitting here 
making smart remarks. The issue is not so much 
self-government in Nunavut. It is bringing education, it is 
handling 14-year old children who have children, it is bringing 
nutrition, it is bringing the future and that is what we are 
committed to.

	<B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Okanagan Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Industry.
<P>
	Air Atlantic creditors vote on Monday to determine whether 
they will accept the company's restructuring proposal or be 
forced into bankruptcy. Apparently most of the creditors are in 
agreement with the restructuring proposal and have declared so. 
The sole exception is the Government of Canada that has not 
given its public indication of its position. Rejection of the 
restructuring proposal means the bankruptcy of the company.
<P>
	Will the Minister of Industry today please advise the House 
and through this House the employees and creditors of the 
position of the Government of Canada to the restructuring 
proposal.
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the question because it gives me an 
opportunity to make clear that first of all Industry Canada is 
really an insurer of certain of the debt which is involved in this 
transaction. The creditors themselves have a vote. Industry 
Canada will not be voting with respect to it.
<P>
	I have directed my officials to retain a neutral position on the 
proposal because I believe that it should be examined by the 
creditors with a view to its commercial viability. That is the test 
they should apply in their own best interests. If that test passes 
then we will be happy to see the airline continue on the basis of 
the proposal.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Okanagan Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I commend the Minister of Industry for his frank and 
forthright answer. I am very pleased indeed that the minister 
will take a neutral position.
<P>
	Does this mean that the creditors will have sole discretion as 
to their vote on the restructuring proposal without interference 
by a government official or a representative of the department?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, that is exactly the intention which I intended to convey 
by my first answer. There will be no interference from us. I 
expect the creditors to evaluate their own positions and vote 
accordingly.

Mr. Speaker, my question is directed to the Deputy Prime

has on occasion dealt with the public service job vacancies by 
not replacing them on the basis of attrition.
<P>
	My question has to do with the recent appointments to the 
Senate, apparent worthy appointments. I am just wondering if 
the Deputy Prime Minister would suggest to the Prime Minister 
that in the interest of saving costs around this place, perhaps the 
Senate should be treated the same way as the public service and 
that vacancies be treated as not filled by attrition.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, there is a slight 
problem with that logic. I think the member would certainly

some 42 of them. One was the recommendation for a partial 
co-insurance clause. That is something we will have to consider

	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today on a point of order following the Prime 
Minister's comments during question period yesterday on the 
results of the election of the Speaker.
<P>
	Standing Order 3(6) states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Clerk of the House shall, once all members wishing to do so have 
deposited their ballot papers, empty the box and count the ballots and being 
satisfied as to the accuracy of the count, shall destroy the ballots together with 
all records of the number of ballots cast for each candidate and the Clerk of 
the House shall in no way divulge the number of ballots cast for any 
candidate.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In reference to the hon. member for Ottawa-Vanier, the 
Prime Minister stated yesterday, and I quote from page 8170 of 
<I>Hansard</I>:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-Mr. Speaker, that it was by two votes he did not become the Speaker. A lot 
of people thought we had two great candidates and he lost by only two votes.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In so doing the Prime Minister left the impression that he was 
in possession of information that is supposed to be secret. By 
making these comments the Prime Minister has called the whole 
process into question. I merely want to ensure that the rules of 
the House were adhered to and that the Standing Orders were not 
compromised.
<P>
	I would therefore ask the Prime Minister if his comments 
were purely-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I take the point of order seriously.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister

Prime Minister asked me to transmit to the House that he was 
basically reflecting on the fact there were two votes. I think 
everybody who watched the votes in the House that day realized 
there were actually two votes.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I do not want to get into a debate on the 
particular matter. Is the hon. member rising on the same point of 
order?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Mr. Speaker, even in your own response 
which is also recorded in <I>Hansard</I> you said-and I am not 
quoting exactly-that this was the first time you realized how 
many votes you won by.
<P>
	Obviously the Prime Minister needs to do some explaining in 
the House.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order. Of course I should not have intervened 
like that. What really surprised me is that I have not met a

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="REVIEWINGCANADA'SFOREIGNPOLICY-SPEAKER'SRULING">REVIEWING CANADA'S FOREIGN POLICY-SPEAKER'S RULING</A></H4>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order! I am now ready to rule on the point of 
order raised by the hon. member for Roberval on November 16, 
1994, concerning the format of the Report of the Special Joint 
Committee Reviewing Canada's Foreign Policy.
<P>
	I would like to thank the hon. member for his intervention, 
and to thank the former member for Ottawa-Vanier and co-chair 
of the special joint committee, the chief government whip, the 
member for Kindersley-Lloydminster and the Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Government House Leader for their 
contributions to this discussion.
<P>
	In his submission, the hon. member for Roberval requested 
that the report of special joint committee be ruled out of order 
for a number of reasons. First he noted that Standing Order 108 
provides that dissenting opinions be appended after the 
signature of the Chair and argued that printing dissenting 
opinions in a second document breached the provisions of the 
Standing Order.
<P>
	Further, he argued that, although the committee had agreed to 
append dissenting opinions to its report, no decision was taken 
by the committee to print the report in the format in which it was 
tabled. He therefore went on to request that the report be 
reprinted in a single volume.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The House has a relatively recent practice of allowing 
committees to include dissenting opinions in the reports. In 
1991 Standing Order 108 was amended to permit standing 
committees to ``report from time to time and to print a brief 
appendix to any report after the signature of the chairman 
containing such opinions or recommendations dissenting from 
the report or supplementary to it as may be proposed by 
committee members''.
<P>
<B>(1510 ) </B>
<P>
	Also in 1991, Standing Order 35(2) was added to permit a 
representative of the official opposition to give a succinct 
explanation of such dissenting opinions when the committee 
report is tabled. These changes made explicit the House practice 
with regard to dissenting opinions in the committee reports.
<P>
	As the hon. Parliamentary Secretary to the Government 
House Leader noted, a close reading of these standing orders 
reveals that the provisions of the rules refer only to standing 
committees of the House.
<P>
	A review of the 20 reports tabled with dissenting opinions 
since these rules were adopted in 1991 reveals that four have 
been from special committees. Three of these four reports were 
presented in the House and on these three occasions a 
representative of the official opposition rose to comment, 
pursuant to Standing Order 35(2).
<P>
	It appears that it has become our practice to apply Standing 
Order 108 to special committees and there has been heretofore 
no challenge to such a practice. So, unless the House directs 
otherwise, the Chair does not intend to intervene on that point.
<P>
	The wording of Standing Order 108(1)(a) is very clear. First, 
it allows a committee to print opinions or recommendations that 
dissent from a report or are supplementary to it. It specifies that 
such an appendix is to be printed after the signature of the 
chairman. It specifies that such an appendix must be brief and 
brief means short and concise.
<P>
	The standing order does not allow for minority reports. 
Regardless of how the media or members themselves may label 
such dissent, the House has never recognized or permitted the 
tabling of minority reports. Speaker Lamoureux twice 
condemned the idea of minority reports, explaining to the House 
that what is presented to the House from a committee is a report 
from the committee, not a report from the majority.
<P>
	I would draw the attention of members to the rulings of July 
24, 1969 at pages 1397 to 1399 and March 16, 1972 at pages 194 
and 195 of the <I>Journals</I>.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	If members of this House or parties in this House wish to 
disseminate their views on a matter, they are free to find their 
own way of doing so. This Standing Order does not exist to 
provide a convenient vehicle for publicizing a different or 
alternate report on a subject matter.
<P>
	With the exception of the provisions of Standing Order 32(4) 
requiring that documents be table in both official languages, the 
rules of the House are silent on questions relating to the format 
of a committee report. These questions are largely left in the 
hands of the committee.
<P>
	In the past, committees have allowed their chairs 
considerable latitude as to the format and presentation of special 
cover reports to the House. Perhaps in this case we have 
discovered the limits to such latitude and the lesson for all is that 
committees 
<P>

<B><A NAME="8253"> 8253 </A></B>
<P>
themselves will have to decide these matters in advance of the 
printing of the report.
<P>
	Committees must be careful to assume their responsibilities 
in this regard: they cannot heedlessly go forward without 
deciding such specific matters as the relevance and brevity of 
dissenting opinions and the form in which these will be 
appended to the printed report.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	For example, the Special Joint Committee on Canada's 
Defence Policy presented a two-volume report some weeks ago 
with the dissenting opinions contained in volume one after the 
signatures of the co-chairs. This was in conformity with a very 
explicit motion adopted by the committee to include the 
dissenting opinions in volume one. But the publication of 
committee reports in more than one volume is a new 
phenomenon and this may have contributed to our present 
difficulty.
<P>
<B>(1515) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The Standing Joint Committee Reviewing Canada's Foreign 
Policy also adopted a motion to append dissenting opinions to 
the report, but the committee minutes reveal that the only 
motion specifically speaking to the question of format is one 
requiring that the report be printed in a bilingual tumble format. 
Futhermore, the motion authorizing the printing of dissenting 
opinions is phrased in general terms and this too may have 
contributed to the current imbroglio.
<P>
	The Chair concludes that the report as presented meets the 
spirit of the Standing Order and that it should be accepted as 
tabled. While supplies last, the report will continue to be 
distributed in its present two-volume format. However, I am of 
the opinion that the report does not meet the letter of the 
Standing Order. Therefore, should a reprint be required, I am 
instructing my officials to ensure that the dissenting opinions of 
the Official Opposition and Reform Party be printed after the 
signatures of the co-chairs in the same volume.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The terms of the standing orders which allow for the printing 
of dissenting opinions must be carefully observed and it is the 
duty of committees to ensure their observance. To avoid any 
future confusion, the Chair expects that all committees will 
ensure by means of explicit and carefully worded motions in 
keeping with the terms of Standing Order 108(1)(a) that their 
members are perfectly clear as to the format in which their 
reports will be presented to the House.
<P>
	I thank all members for their interventions and I hope that this 
clarification of Standing Order 108(1) will be useful to the 
committees of the House.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion and of the 
amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
continue my statement on the amendment moved by my 
colleague for Louis-Hébert to amend clause 58 of Bill C-57.
<P>
	Clause 58 of Bill C-57 is eloquent, not to say blatant, on this 
subject. I quote paragraph (<I>a</I>):
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(<I>a</I>) to fix the performer's performance, or any substantial part thereof, by 
means of a record, perforated roll or other contrivance by means of which 
sounds may be mechanically reproduced,</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In inventing the phonograph, Thomas Edison thought that 
sounds could be permanently recorded for reproduction. 
Personally, I think that the Canadian government thinks that the 
Copyright Act is and must remain permanently recorded on 
obsolete media.
<P>
	Here is a very small example illustrating how outdated 
Canada's Copyright Act is. The cultural community in Canada 
and Quebec is still waiting for a real review of this law passed in 
1926, which has been only slightly amended since 1988.
<P>
	Unfortunately, it is only because of economic imperatives 
arising from multilateral trade agreements to which Canada is a 
party that Canada is concerned about the cultural development 
of Canadians and Quebecers.
<P>
	The Union des artistes, which appeared before the Committee 
on Foreign Affairs and International Trade studying Bill C-57, 
is very explicit on this subject. I quote: ``At a time when digital 
technology is breaking down the old distinctions between 
various audio and audio-visual media; at a time when direct 
satellite transmissions and the information highway will 
redefine how our works are consumed and used, Canada is still 
protecting its creative artists and defending its culture with 
measures imposed on it because it signed international trade 
treaties».
<P>
<B>(1520) </B>
<P>
	Continuing on this route is unthinkable.
<P>
	The amendment presented by my colleague from 
Louis-Hébert would simply modernize and update an obsolete, 
antiquated law and at the same time give our artists a minimum 
of protection, and I do mean just a minimum.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8254"> 8254 </A></B>
<P>
	Let us hope that Quebecers will soon have an opportunity as 
well to rejuvenate their political system and adapt it to new 
realities and to get rid of the outdated structures of Canadian 
federalism.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mac Harb (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
International Trade, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we recommend that 
this amendment be rejected because we have problems with it.
<P>
	First, the new expression would be inconsistent with clauses 
2, which includes the definitions of ``plate'' and ``producer'', as 
well as 5.4 and 5.5, which refer to ``a record, perforated roll or 
other contrivance by means of which sounds may be 
mechanically reproduced''. Second, it would therefore be 
difficult to apply in a consistent manner these provisions, if we 
were to use the new expression contained in the motion.
<P>
	I should also point out that Canadian jurisprudence gives a 
rather wide interpretation to the current wording. Therefore, 
although the expression is somewhat archaic, it does include 
new technologies.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to have this opportunity to address the motion tabled by 
the hon. member for Louis-Hébert.
<P>
	It is strange and almost sad to amend the archaic and obsolete 
Copyright Act because we are forced to do so when dealing with 
a bill which indirectly affects it, as the hon. member for Laval 
East pointed out.
<P>
	If I were sitting here at the end of the Second World War and 
reviewing this bill to implement the Agreement establishing the 
World Trade Organization, I might feel comfortable with clause 
58(a), which reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(a) to fix the performer's performance, or any substantial part thereof, by means of a 
record, perforated roll or other contrivance by means of which sounds may be 
mechanically reproduced,</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Indeed, if I were debating this bill at the end of the Second 
World War, I might feel comfortable with this clause, although 
the perforated roll was already somewhat obsolete at the time.
<P>
	Now, more than half a century later, the government tables a 
bill to implement the agreement establishing the successor of 
the International Trade Organization, namely the World Trade 
Organization, and we still have an archaic and obsolete 
provision.
<P>
	In this era of high technology such as optical fibres and laser 
techniques, the government is talking about the perforated roll. 
The parliamentary secretary said that, according to existing 
precedents, new technologies are included in this clause of the 
bill.
<P>
<B>(1525) </B>
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I do not see why the government refuses to 
modernize the wording in the very simple way proposed by the 
hon. member for Louis-Hébert, a way that allows for any new 
technology. We know that technology changes very quickly. As I 
said earlier, today it is fibre optics and lasers, but what will it be 
tomorrow?  Will we have to change the legislation again to 
include new technology?
<P>
	I consider that we have to allow for any technological change 
that might apply in the future to sound reproduction, and even 
image reproduction, although the bill is rather vague on that. I 
suppose that the parliamentary secretary will tell us that it 
includes sound reproduced with picture.
<P>
	At the time of the Second World War, the reproduction of 
sound and picture was not all that common. There has been a 
tremendous technological evolution and the technological 
changes are not even considered by the legislation as presently 
drafted.
<P>
	The proposal of my colleague for Louis-Hébert is very 
simple. It is the result of submissions made to us by artists and 
creators, more specifically by the Union des artistes, which 
appeared-which took the time to appear-before the Standing 
Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade, to voice 
its concerns, concerns which are the bare minimum and quite far 
from what they would really like to see in a piece of legislation. I 
am glad that the Minister of Canadian Heritage is present. We 
are talking about amendments to the Copyright Act in an 
indirect fashion, through changes to Canadian legislation 
brought about by the signing of the Uruguay Round Agreement, 
or the creation of a Department of Canadian Heritage.
<P>
	When are we going to amend the Copyright Act to bring it up 
to date? The government does not have the political will to do 
so. Absolutely not. The old Copyright Act is being amended in a 
roundabout way through other legislation. It is absolutely 
unacceptable.
<P>
	Could it be that the present Minister of Canadian Heritage 
does not have the necessary clout with his colleagues to have the 
Copyright Act amended as it should be and as the artists are 
demanding? I am very sorry to see, following the speech by our 
colleague, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
International Trade, that our government colleagues intend to 
oppose this proposed amendment which, after all, is rather 
innocuous, but affects writers, authors and performers in a 
fundamental way. It is at their request that we are proposing this 
amendment which is, I could not stress it enough, very

<P>
	However, as I mentioned before, what they would like to see is 
a comprehensive review of the Copyright Act. But in the 
absence of real political will, in the absence of a minister who 
would truly stand up for them, in the absence of any reform of 
the Copyright Act, this piece of legislation should at least be 
adapted to today's reality.
<P>
	I hope that the government members will not prove to be 
close-minded, that they will not choose to oppose this 
amendment, otherwise we will have to conclude that they lack

<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Does the member for The 
Battlefords-Meadow Lake care to comment on this? It is clear 
to the House then that in fact we are changing, modifying the 
text to the motion?
<P>
<B>(1535 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> Yes, Mr. Speaker, that is as I understand it. We 
are changing the text of the motion in front of us today. It is with 
my full concurrence.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Finally now, if I could ask 
then, does the House give its unanimous consent to change the 
text of the motion?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Terrebonne, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, as 
my hon. colleague pointed out, it is indeed in the best tradition 
of goodwill displayed on Thursdays, and I thank my colleague 
from the NDP for his support and good work ensuring this 
change could be made.
<P>
	First, we are opposed to the original motion to amend that 
refers to restricting work done by children under the age of 16. 
The reason being that it could be somewhat prejudicial to certain 
persons. There are Liberal members who have told me: ``This is 
great, but if little boy or little girl work with me on the farm, that 
does not necessarily constitute exploitation of child labour''. If 
a paperboy or girl or anyone else has a craft, business or family 
activity, it is not necessarily exploitation.
<P>
	One of the reasons for changing the text before us is that we 
understand that some children may want to gain work 
experience in extremely favourable conditions or students may 
wish to work in the field, so to speak, to increase their chances of 
<P>

<B><A NAME="8256"> 8256 </A></B>
<P>
finding a better job later in their lives. But to restrict any work 
done or the importation of any components made by children 
under the age of 16 might, for one thing, make it obviously 
difficult to  enforce the legislation, as well as be prejudicial to 
children who want to learn, who are simply interested in 
experiment with a new job.
<P>
	I also move this amendment in a somewhat special context. 
As you know, National Child Day was celebrated last week. I 
was invited by a high school in my riding to attend a 
demonstration to remind international leaders of the 
commitments they made in writing only four years ago in New 
York at the UN international convention on children's rights.
<P>
	They told me about some of the promises that were made. 
They quoted seven of the 24 promises. I will tell you about some 
of them in a moment. None of the promises-which dealt with 
child malnutrition, exploitation and conscription-even came 
close to being kept. None of the almost 150 countries, including 
Canada, that signed these promises showed the will and rigour to 
implement them.
<P>
	The students at Paul-Arseneau high school who invited me 
asked me to mention it in this House. Since I was waiting for the 
opportunity-I also have a petition on this subject I should table 
in this House before long-with today's proposed amendment to 
this bill, I, as a member of Parliament, become the 
representative of these 1,200 students who have asked me and 
other parliamentarians who sign papers and make commitments 
to honour them. These promises were made four years ago.
<P>
	I will repeat to you some of what a 12- or 13-year-old student 
told me: ``Everyone knows that people sometimes forget things. 
It happens to us when we are taking exams. It can also happen to 
our government leaders. All of us here today-I remind you that 
there were 1,200 of them-want to help them remember. That is 
why we all signed a giant petition to remind the Prime Minister 
of Canada of the government's promises at the World Summit 
for Children that was held at the United Nations Headquarters in 
New York four years ago. All promises made should be kept. 
People should keep their word.'' And I think we are here to lead 
by example.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion and of the 
amendment.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8257"> 8257 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Terrebonne, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
is the first time that I have seen such a thing and I am somewhat 
surprised, I admit. I shall try to continue my speech without 
laughing too much about what just happened.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Many things here are out of date.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Sauvageau:</B> So I was saying-Someone whispered that 
not just the previous amendment was out of date, but I have 
respect for our traditions.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh!
<P>
	<B>Mr. Sauvageau:</B> I told you earlier that I would quote some of 
the 24 promises made in New York about respecting children's 
rights in the world. I have only three to quote so that you can 
understand why international conventions should have priority 
over wording that says ``under 16 years''. I shall read you 
commitment 18 made by Canada and about a hundred other 
countries that signed this international agreement. Article 18 
says that children's welfare requires political action at the 
highest level. I think that means us here. We are determined to 
take such action. However, it does not say when. But there was 
no political will to act on it.
<P>
	Commitment 19 says that this declaration is a solemn 
commitment to give high priority to children's rights, survival, 
protection and development. This would also ensure the welfare 
of all societies. I repeat, it mentions a solemn commitment to 
give high priority, but it does not say when. It still has not 
happened today.
<P>
	Commitment 20 is divided into several points. I will tell you 
about part of the seventh one, which refers to helping child 
refugees establish new roots in life. States would also strive to 
ensure the social protection of children who work and promise 
to abolish illegal child labour. Efforts would be made to prevent 
children from falling prey to the scourge of illicit drugs. This 
part also attaches the greatest importance to children's rights.
<P>
	Where my text would amend article 38 of the Child Labour 
Convention is in item 1. You do not have to look very far in the 
Convention to find where it states that State Parties shall adopt a 
national policy to effectively abolish child labour and to 
progressively raise the minimum age for admissions to 
employment or work at a level that would allow teenagers to 
reach their full physical and mental potential. Yes, children can 
work, but only in conditions where they will have hope and be 
able to physically and mentally develop. They should never be 
exploited.
<P>
	Earlier this week, we had some good news. We learned of the 
creation of the International Children Tribunal, and one of the 
two co-founders of this Tribunal said that she saw last summer a 
movie where children in chains were producing goods. We saw 
an excerpt of this movie on the news when the creation of the 
Tribunal was announced. We saw children in chains working to 
produce luxurious goods currently in use in Canada and the 
United States. So, we have to ask ourselves: Can our supposedly 
developed society allow countries to exploit  children and make 
them work in awful conditions to produce goods we will use?
<P>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
	So, I support this bill, with a minor change to the motion, 
because we should keep our words and fulfil our commitments.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to be able to speak on the motions 
amending Bill C-57 and in this case, Motion No. 9. We are 
happy to consent to the change made by the hon. member from 
the Bloc who spoke thoughtfully in support of not only his 
amendment but of the motion. I am very pleased to know of the 
growing support for the idea that has been put forward here.
<P>
	The purpose of the motion is to ensure that as Canada joins the 
World Trade Organization, it creatively addresses the problem 
of child labour, one of the most troubling aspects of the new 
international trading order.
<P>
	It amends the Export and Import Permits Act to allow the 
government to introduce regulations to restrict the importation 
of goods made in whole or in part by children, contrary to 
international guidelines.
<P>
	Many observers of the trend of globalization have noted that 
the more we leave the multinationals to seek out the lowest 
labour costs in the unregulated labour markets of developing 
countries, the more globalization tends to become a race to the 
bottom. Armies of young children around the developing world 
already find themselves at the very bottom. They work long 
hours at punishing work in atrocious conditions for a pittance. 
They are thereby deprived of an education which is their right 
under the UN charter.
<P>
	In many instances, such children are indentured into virtual 
slavery. The numbers of children involved and the conditions 
they face are staggering. It is estimated that 300,000 children 
work at hand knitting carpets in India while two-thirds of the 
workforce in Nepal's 600 factories producing rugs for export are 
children under the age of 15.
<P>
	According to the International Labour Organization half the 
children in Pakistan's carpet industry die of malnutrition and 
disease before they reach the age of 12. Girls 10 years of age 
work in China's special export zones in toy factories for $10 a 
month.
<P>
	In Indonesia, after relaxing its regulations on child labour in 
1987, some 2.8 million children are working in factories. The 
most revealing fact is that child labour has been growing in 
tandem with the liberalization of world trade.
<P>
	These children produce rugs, textiles, garments, shoes, toys 
and other light manufacturing products for export markets. The 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8258"> 8258 </A></B>
<P>
multinationals that manufacture, trade and retail the products of 
child labour often claim that they do not hire the children 
directly but they never  acknowledge that they knowingly 
subcontract out parts of the manufacturing process to employers 
that do.
<P>
	Child labour has become an integral part of the new world 
order of trade liberalization and gives the lie to any glorification 
of unregulated world trade as a force of progress. For the 
pathetic armies of children in the developing world, market 
liberalization means a regression to the brutal exploitation that 
we in the developed countries have not permitted for more than a 
century.
<P>
	Because it has become part of the fabric of the new 
international economy, child labour implicates all of us as 
consumers. On any visit to the local mall, unknowingly we are 
likely to buy for our own children clothes and toys made under 
conditions that would horrify us if we imagined our own 
children in their situation. Here is a case where we must let our 
basic human sympathy, our sense of solidarity with children 
around the world move us to act. Some have argued that when 
developed countries today restrict trade in goods made by child 
labour they are forgetting the role that child labour played in 
their own development and acting to deliberately restrict the 
development of new economies.
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
	We in the developed world have indeed had our own 
experience with child labour, which was as much a part of 
European and North American industrialization as it is now in 
many developed societies today. We must remember that 
government regulations prohibiting the use of child labour were 
among the earliest public interventions to tame a predatory 
industrial capitalism. The fact that the same predatory 
capitalism has returned with a vengeance, its leaders boasting of 
their ability to operate outside the regulatory reach of individual 
states, does not relieve us of our duty to protect the most 
vulnerable members of the global village.
<P>
	The multinationals like to talk about the need to establish a 
level playing field. Let us establish one between them and the 
children whom they now exploit. The elimination of child 
labour will be a long and arduous process that takes place on 
many fronts. The International Labour Organization has a 
program that has been in place for years to study and propose 
measures to address the problem. Canada should actively 
support this program.
<P>
	The ILO secretariat has also recommended that the WTO 
should adopt a social clause to enforce basic labour rights on 
member states, a strategy that would go a long way to 
eliminating child labour. This is why we proposed a separate 
amendment earlier today that the government chose not to 
support, that the government commit itself to such a policy of 
developing a social clause for the WTO.
<P>
	Some individual governments of developing countries are 
making efforts to introduce regulations to help children and 
some of these programs, such as the one in Hong Kong, have met 
with success. Many developing countries do not have the 
resources to police regulations on child labour, however well 
intended those regulations may be. That is why the developed 
countries like Canada have an obligation to help the 
governments of developing countries prevent multinationals 
from trading in goods made by children.
<P>
	That is why we are proposing this amendment today to Bill 
C-57. It would put the burden of proof on the large importers 
and retailers to establish that they have not imported goods 
made with child labour and apply the resources of the Canadian 
regulatory regime to police the problem.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this is 
an interesting motion, one that in spirit I would agree with but in 
practicality is going to be very difficult to deal with. That has 
been recognized by the countries that have been negotiating this 
GATT agreement for the past seven years. That is why it is not in 
the current GATT agreement.
<P>
	The intent of this amendment is certainly good. It is to end 
child exploitation, especially in third world countries. The 
difficulty is that a multilateral trade agreement is not the forum 
for this. Children's rights are protected under the International 
Convention on the Rights of the Child through the United 
Nations.
<P>
	Some of the difficulties were outlined by the member for the 
Battlefords-Meadow Lake when he said that individual 
countries do not have the resources to police this kind of 
intervention.
<P>
	I would like to pose a question for the member: Do we have 
the resources? In other words, on every article of clothing or 
textiles that come from some third world country, how would we 
prove that this is not made using child labour? It is very, very 
difficult. I think we have to work through the International 
Convention on the Rights of the Child and encourage these 
individual countries to stop the exploitation in those areas.
<P>
	Just another interesting little sidelight. It also raises some 
questions about practices that we have at home, practices that I 
think are actually quite good.
<P>
	I have a grain farm. We have four children who all worked on 
that grain farm prior to reaching the age of 16. They learned 
responsibility at a very early age. They learned how that 
business worked. There are literally hundreds of thousands of 
businesses in Canada that have children of the owners working 
and learning the system, learning how to conduct business in 
those businesses. Would that not also raise the question of our 
own practices at home? I do not think those are bad practices.
<P>
	I have to oppose this. The spirit of it is I think right, but we 
have to pursue it through the proper avenues.

<P>
<B>(1605 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mac Harb (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for 
International Trade, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we acknowledge the 
need for programs and initiatives to deal with child poverty. 
That is precisely what this government is doing with the 
initiative of the human resources ministry. There is something 
now before the public and we welcome their ideas. To agree to 
this proposed amendment would be almost like changing the 
game half way through or after it has already been played.
<P>
	First, we are raising the issue of relationship between the 
international trade regime and social and labour standards. The 
purpose of the bill is to implement the World Trade Organization 
agreement. There is nothing in the agreement that deals with this 
subject. It was not the object of any negotiation and no 
obligation needs to be implemented in this respect.
<P>
	The proposed amendment would represent a major departure 
from the position taken by Canada on several occasions. This 
issue should be addressed in multilateral negotiations rather 
than by taking unilateral actions. It is one of the areas that was 
identified truly in Marrakech as potential subject matter for 
future negotiations. Canada is now participating in discussions 
on this subject in the OECD as well with the ILO.
<P>
	Nevertheless, we agree with the spirit of the motion, but 
unfortunately, technically speaking we will not be able to accept 
it. We are recommending rejection of the motion.

	He said: Mr. Speaker, as we say: Last but not least. I do hope 
that the government will be more open-minded than it has been 
so far.
<P>
	I find it somewhat despicable that the government would 
oppose the previous amendment, which merely sought to ensure 
that Bill C-57 take into consideration Canada's international 
commitments in other sectors, particularly as regards the issue 
of children's law.
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	That being said, I want to discuss Motion No. 10, which we 
proposed and which is the result of representations made by 
Canadian steel producers who appeared before the Standing 
Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade late last 
Wednesday, to tell us about their concerns.
<P>
	Those concerns are essentially that, when comparing the 
Canadian and American bills to implement the Uruguay Round 
Agreement, the steel industry notes that the American bill is 
much more precise regarding the identification of the causes of 
dumping. Consequently, the association has come to the 
conclusion that, for its members to be able to compete with their 
American counterparts, the Canadian legislation also has to be 
more precise regarding the issue of dumping.
<P>
	The steel producers informed us of their findings. Mrs. Van 
Loon, the President of the Canadian Steel Producers 
Association, told us that, given the rather special relations 
between Canada and the United States regarding the steel trade, 
if the Americans were giving themselves a baseball bat in their 
legislation, as she put it, the least we could do was to give 
ourselves a baseball bat too, even if it is a smaller one.
<P>
	Consequently, we are asking that the Canadian legislation be 
amended so as to allow our industries to compete with their 
American competition.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8260"> 8260 </A></B>
<P>
	The next day, we were conducting a clause-by-clause review 
of the bill, which means that the Canadian steel industry only 
had a few hours to propose amendments or changes. I must say 
that they worked diligently and in a professional manner, since 
the next day, at dinner time, we had a series of very specific, 
comprehensive and to-the-point amendments concerning the 
steel industry's expectations.
<P>
	I gather that the amendments proposed by the steel industry 
were far too specific and well designed for the government party 
to accept them. We were told that the vision the Americans have 
of the Uruguay Round Agreement as reflected in their 
legislation is not right, that our vision of the Uruguay Round 
Agreement as reflected in our legislation is better and that, 
consequently, we cannot do the same thing as the Americans nor 
support their point of view.
<P>
	Allow me, Mr. Speaker, to say that I find this position rather 
too meek and legalistic, since we have to deal with a powerful 
and, if I may say so, intrusive trade partner, that is, the United 
States. We must be able to work along the same lines, with the 
same means, on a level playing field.
<P>
	Since our colleagues did not see fit to acknowledge the 
accuracy of the arguments presented by the steel industry at the 
committee stage, the steel industry agreed, in response to 
concerns expressed by our colleagues and in particular by the 
hon. member for Rosedale, to give more thought to another 
amendment which is far more precise, in fact, shorter, if I can 
say, far more general in the sense that it applies not only to the 
steel industry but also to several other industries, several other 
sectors of our economy.
<P>
	Our friends from the steel industry have begun consultations 
with parliamentarians from both sides of this House in order to 
make their expectations known. Not knowing if our colleagues 
from the government, the Reform Party or the New Democratic 
Party would bring forward the amendment proposed by the steel 
industry, we placed the amendment before us on the Order 
Paper. Motion No. 10 does not come from the Bloc Quebecois, 
but from Canada's steel industry. We are merely bringing this 
amendment forward on behalf of the industry because nobody 
else would.
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	Clause 185 of Bill C-57 deals with the way the Canadian 
International Trade Tribunal must evaluate complaints related 
to dumping. For this tribunal, it is imperative not only to prove 
that dumping has indeed taken place, but also that such dumping 
has caused injury to the Canadian industry.
<P>
	Moreover, the bill in its present form stipulates that the 
tribunal can determine injury only if the circumstances causing 
such injury are clearly imminent. We have to recognize that, on 
one hand, this is much too restrictive and, on the other hand, it is 
much too vague. The bill also stipulates that the Governor in 
Council may,  if he so wishes, make regulations to give the 
Canadian International Trade Tribunal detailed information on 
acceptable evidence and on the general interpretation of the new 
conditions with regard to dumping.
<P>
	As I was saying earlier, the Americans have gone a lot further 
in giving their tribunals much more detailed information on the 
interpretation of these new conditions and on the evidence that 
can be presented. This means that Canadian producers are 
clearly at a disadvantage compared to their American 
competitors because they have no indication as to how they must 
prove that they have been victims of dumping.
<P>
	It must also be understood that injury has to be determined 
before any anti-dumping measure can be taken. That is the 
whole point. Getting back to the Canadian steel industry, I think 
it is important to put it in context to show how important it is.
<P>
	The Canadian steel industry generates $8.6 billion worth of 
sales each year, including $3 billion worth of exports, and 
provides 33,000 jobs, including 10,000 to meet export market 
requirements. To show how important it is to have legislation 
similar to the United States, or to give us a level playing field, I 
will point out that 90 per cent of our steel exports go to the 
United States while more than 60 per cent of our steel imports 
come from there.
<P>
	Canada is the largest steel export market for the Americans. In 
the steel industry, the need for a level playing field in both 
countries is essential. What is more, our industry must be able to 
ward off blows, to get ready for any threat of dumping, as the 
Americans are doing. If the rules are too vague on this side of the 
border only, our industries will not be able to take advantage of 
the benefits resulting from agreements such as the GATT 
agreements.
<P>
	So, this amendment seeks essentially to ensure not that the 
Governor in Council be allowed to make regulations on what 
should be considered as dumping but more particularly that the 
Governor in Council be required, rather than leaving it up to 
him, to make the necessary regulations setting up guidelines to 
be followed by the courts when making determinations about 
dumping.
<P>
	This amendment also seeks to specify the kinds of evidence to 
be considered among the factors described in the regulations. 
Finally, those regulations will have to be made on the joint 
recommendation of the Minister of Finance, as provided in the 
bill, and the Minister of Industry so that the industry's 
competitiveness will be taken into account in decision-making. 
We all know that the Minister of Industry is often in a good 
position to understand the rapid changes in market conditions at 
that level.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8261"> 8261 </A></B>
<P>
	I urge my colleagues of all political parties to support this 
amendment which meets the expectations of the Canadian steel 
industry, and of thousands of workers in steel mills in Quebec 
and throughout the country.
<P>
	It is imperative that Parliament pass this amendment that does 
not take anything from the bill, nor detract from its substance 
and its importance. It will in fact make it more specific and give 
it more teeth for the sake not only of the steel industry, but also 
of many other industries in the Canadian economy.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	I know those issues are a matter of deep concern to our 
colleague for Hamilton East, who is also Deputy Prime Minister 
and Minister of the Environment. She was with us yesterday, 
when we met with the Minister for International Trade, 
members of the steel caucus, and spokesmen for the Canadian 
steel industry and unions in that industry. She seemed quite 
anxious that Parliament consider the amendment suggested by 
the Canadian steel industry.
<P>
	I hope the wisdom of the Deputy Prime Minister prevailed in 
discussions with her colleagues and that they will deem it useful 
and relevant to pass this amendment that is critical if Canadian 
industries, including the steel industry, are to compete 
successfully with our major trading partners and competitors, 
especially the United States.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I will make a very short intervention in this regard.
<P>
	For those members of the Chamber who were away on 
business or whatever this morning, or for those who are tuning 
in on their television sets to this debate for the first time this 
afternoon, I simply want to remind the House that earlier today 
the member for Regina-Lumsden on behalf of the New 
Democratic Party put on record the concerns of the 
Saskatchewan steel industry. I believe he quite nicely brought 
together the views of our caucus on behalf of the Saskatchewan 
steel industry and the steel industry in general with regard to the 
motion before us.
<P>
	I also want to respond to comments the parliamentary 
secretary made on the last motion dealing with child poverty and 
the exploitation of child labour. I can state his words fairly 
closely. He said that the government was not prepared to take 
unilateral action in this regard.
<P>
	I remind the parliamentary secretary that the government is 
already taking unilateral action with regard to the WTO and 
agreements reflecting on the GATT. The parliamentary 
secretary should recognize that as a government it seems 
prepared to take unilateral action to penalize western grain 
farmers but is not prepared to take unilateral action to protect 
children. I think that is just shameful.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mac Harb (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for 
International Trade, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my friend in the NDP 
has a tendency to bend the statement I made a bit. I said that the 
government was taking action and that the minister responsible 
for human resources was taking action on the whole question of 
child poverty.
<P>
	I said that we could not change the game halfway through. I 
suggested that the issue was not agreed to in Marrakech. What 
we signed did not include that issue. A future agreement or a 
future debate might take place around the issue. I think the hon. 
member would suggest that it would be unwise for us to take a 
unilateral action as a country and add a new amendment to our 
legislation; but for him to say that we are not concerned about 
child poverty is not fair and not warranted.
<P>
	I go back to some of the comments made concerning the 
whole notion of dumping and anti-dumping. The new 
disciplines on the treatment of dumped goods will not impair the 
Canadian ability to respond to exporters that dump goods into 
the Canadian market when such dumping threatens or causes 
injury to Canadian industry. The new discipline should however 
reduce the scope for the harassment of Canadian export interests 
resulting from unfair dumping duty actions by our trading 
partners.
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	I also add that our existing dumping action will be continued 
under the new system as if it had been made under that system. 
Any continuation of an injury finding will be made in 
accordance with the new anti-dumping agreement. It is not 
expected to put an increased burden on Canadian authorities. 
They already operate in a system which for the most part 
conforms to the new rules.
<P>
	There was a reference to the American legislation. I assure the 
House and Canadians that we are examining, have examined in 
the past and will continue to examine all moves and changes or 
proposed changes to the American legislation in terms of 
language or statement to ensure that they are consistent with the 
NAFTA as well as with the World Trade Organization 
agreement.
<P>
	Should Canadian interests be harmed for whatever reason by 
any provisions which are inconsistent with our right under the 
international trade agreement we will take appropriate action. 
Two wrongs do not make a right. If somebody has gone beyond 
the agreement in introducing changes to our laws and 
regulations to divert from the agreement does not mean that we 
should be doing the same. As a government and as a society we 
have to fulfil our commitment under the World Trade 
Organization agreement.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8262"> 8262 </A></B>
<P>
	The proposal suggested by the opposition member is 
inconsistent with the World Trade Organization. First, pursuant 
to article 3.7 of the agreement, implementation of article 6 of 
the act, the anti-dumping agreement, and article 15.7 of the 
World Trade Organization agreement on subsidies and 
countervailing measures, the specific factors listed in the 
motion are threat or injury factors. Adoption of the motion in 
our opinion would extend the application of these factors to 
injury and retardation in a manner inconsistent with the World 
Trade Organization specifically. Article 3.4 of the 
anti-dumping agreement and article 15.4 of the subsidy 
agreement require examination of a much larger list of factors 
in the broader determination of injury.
<P>
	Second, with respect to the threat of injury, a list of factors 
will be set out in regulations being prepared under the authority 
of the new subparagraph 97.1(1)(a) which allows for full 
consideration of the factors set out in the hon. member's motion.
<P>
	Third, the reference to the Minister of Industry in prescribing 
injury or causation factors should be deleted since he is nowhere 
else specifically mentioned in SIMA and the regulation making 
authority under SIMA is the responsibility of the Minister of 
Finance.
<P>
	For these reasons and what I clearly stated earlier we are 
recommending rejection of the motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we are 
being asked in Motion No. 10 to consider factors such as 
dumping, foreign subsidies and putting extra regulations into 
Bill C-57, an act to implement the World Trade Organization.
<P>
	I am afraid I am going to disappoint the member for Verchères 
who has asked us to support the motion. It is not that I am 
unsympathetic to the discussions he outlined about the steel 
industry or any other industry undergoing trade actions.
<P>
<B>(1630 ) </B>
<P>
	The bill calls for minimum compliance to try to move these 
disputes forward quickly to the World Trade Organization. It has 
better mechanisms to resolve these disputes than is currently 
available in the Canada-U.S. trade agreement for steel, for 
example. A lot of regulations have been built up over the last 
several years and we still had several dozen trade actions on 
steel alone last year. Surely that is not the best approach.
<P>
	The best approach is moving disputes to a forum such as the 
World Trade Organization where all factors will be taken into 
account by a panel that hears disputes. The panel will not just 
take into account things like unused production capacity, 
increases in exports and inventories. It will consider all relevant 
factors as it should.
<P>
	We should not try to build up a big regulation wall. The steel 
industry said at committee that it wants us to build a big 
regulation wall like the United States is doing with the ultimate 
goal of tearing it down at the World Trade Organization. We 
should not take the same kind of  action that the United States is 
taking. The World Trade Organization panel will consider the 
type of regulations that are being built up in the United States in 
its implementing regulations. The panel will take that into 
account when it hears these disputes.
<P>
	There is a process. It is a better process. We have to put our 
faith in it. It is going to work. Placing undue emphasis on the 
factors that were outlined just a few moments ago by the hon. 
member for Verchères might put undue emphasis on factors that 
would benefit things like supply management. It would also 
cause injury in some other sectors of our industries.
<P>
	That does not say we do not have some problems. I outlined 
them during discussion of Bill C-57 at second reading. Those 
problems are internal trade barriers, high debt and deficit, our 
inability to trade. The Western Grain Transportation Act needs 
revision. There are problems with the tariff rate quotas. I do not 
believe we should have them. There is the problem with the sale 
and allotment of quotas but that is for a different day. Those 
problems have to be worked out in the next few months.
<P>
	What is important is getting through the minimum 
compliance and have the World Trade Organization come into 
effect. Let us start hearing some of the disputes such as the 
wheat dispute that has been bubbling for the last year and the 
other disputes that have been talked about such as steel. Let us 
put the World Trade Organization to the test and it will come out 
with flying colours.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have been 
a member of the steel committee for several years. Recently, you 
had the opportunity to meet the people from the steel industry, at 
the steel committee, and also on two occasions at the Standing 
Committee on Foreign Affairs, where we had the opportunity to 
hear their claims.
<P>
	I want to tell you that what we are proposing in our motion is 
exactly what the steel industry is asking for.
<P>
	I cannot understand the government on this issue. It seems to 
be stubborn. I cannot understand it. Earlier, I heard the 
parliamentary secretary talk about this, and I still do not 
understand why he does not agree with the amendment that we 
are proposing, all the more so since I do not agree either with the 
Reform member who just spoke on the same subject regarding 
dumping.
<P>
	It is clear and obvious, and we heard that several times, 
including just last week or two weeks ago. The president of the 
Steel Producers Association came to the committee and clearly 
explained to us that, as for our protection mechanisms in 
dumping and steel trade between Canada and the United States, 
among others, the United States had regulations this thick, 
which she did put on the table before us, while we only had a few 
pages of regulations to protect us.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8263"> 8263 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	It is not I nor my colleague from Verchères who said that, it is 
the Canadian Steel Producers Association who said it several 
times. It is for these reasons that we have a lot of difficulty, this 
afternoon, understanding why the parliamentary secretary and 
the government did not amend this bill.
<P>
	The steel industry is very important, particularly for Quebec. 
In my riding and the riding of the hon. member for Verchères, 
there are many major industries producing steel pellets. Steel 
trade is very important in Quebec, and that is why we are very 
concerned by the government's lack of attention towards the 
steel producers who came several times to explain to us, in great 
detail, their claims.
<P>
	Once again I strongly hope the government will change its 
mind because, once this legislation is tabled and sanctioned, we 
will be facing major problems. That bill will have a negative 
impact on the steel industry which, it seems to me, is still quite 
dynamic and full of promises for the future of Quebec and the 
rest of Canada.
<P>
	That is all I wanted to add. I do not want to get into the 
specifics, but I urge the government to listen. It said it had 
reviewed the issue. On what basis? The parliamentary secretary 
said earlier that they had reviewed the question, but on what 
basis and on whose advice?
<P>
	We have heard the exact opposite and, once again, the 
government is not listening. I really wonder where we are 
headed. I think we will continue to sink further into a terrible 
deficit with that type of regulations that do not protect 
industries, that increase unemployment and add to the problems 
of Quebec businesses, particularly in the steel industry, one that 
I know very well.
<P>
	I beg the government to accept this motion.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Speller (Haldimand-Norfolk, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today to speak on this motion as a past chair of the steel 
caucus. This is a caucus of all members of the House who have 
joined together to support the Canadian steel industry. My 
colleague from Oakville is the present chair, having taken over 
yesterday. She will guide steel issues through the House with the 
co-operation of all members.
<P>
	The hon. member for Verchères, who put this motion forward, 
is a very active member of that committee and has taken almost 
word for word a proposal that was put forward by other members 
of the committee that represent steel industries.
<P>
	Let me speak briefly about the intent of the motion. The steel 
industry felt it was important for it to send a strong message to 
the Americans that the present situation in which anti-dumping 
and trade actions are brought against Canadian steel industries 
is not acceptable. If we are going to have fair, open and free 
trade, if we are going to belong to an organization like  the 
GATT, the World Trade Organization, the WTO, then we need to 
follow similar rules. The steel industry in North America is so 
integrated that we need to have similar rules on both sides of the 
border.
<P>
	The intent of this motion is to make sure that there are similar 
rules on both sides of the border.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	Yesterday we had the opportunity to speak with the Minister 
for International Trade. I want to thank the minister for coming 
to the committee. We discussed this very issue. Unfortunately 
he only saw this after he walked into the meeting and did not 
have the opportunity to look at it. It was his view that the intent 
of the motion could actually be handled by regulation.
<P>
	Unfortunately I did not have an opportunity to listen to the 
parliamentary secretary but I am sure that is what he meant when 
he responded to the hon. member. The minister gave us his 
commitment yesterday that he would look at this issue very 
seriously, make sure someone in his department would respond 
to our concerns and would work with the steel caucus so the 
intent of this motion is carried through. When Canadian steel 
companies or for that matter other industries want to do battle in 
trade disputes with companies in the United States they should 
have the same arsenal to work with.
<P>
	I agree with the hon. member that the arsenal is not balanced 
now. Not only steel producers but other producers will tell you 
that it takes a heck of a lot longer to deal with a dispute in the 
United States than it does one in Canada. When they go to the 
United States they have to take a truckload of documents with 
them. But when Americans come here to deal with a dispute they 
just have to carry a briefcase full of documents.
<P>
	If the values and the intent of the World Trade Organization is 
to bring down these sorts of barriers, then certainly industries, 
particularly the steel companies who employ thousands of 
workers in members' ridings across the country should have an 
opportunity to have fair trade.
<P>
	I know that is the intent of the motion by the member for 
Verchères. I support the intent of his motion. We will work with 
the minister and members of the steel caucus to make sure that 
that intent is put forward as strongly as we can, and to work to 
make sure that through regulation the intent is carried on.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, we are 
now on the last amendment presented by the Bloc Quebecois. 
The purpose of this amendment is to amend, improve and clarify 
the bill to implement the Agreement Establishing the World 
Trade Organization. Although the parliamentary secretary does 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8264"> 8264 </A></B>
<P>
not agree, I still believe that the hon. member for Verchères 
proposed an excellent amendment.
<P>
	The amendment is an attempt to provide the basis for certain 
rules on what constitutes injury, with respect to dumping. At the 
very least, what I have to say may expand the horizons of the 
parliamentary secretary. During the past few weeks, through the 
Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade, 
we were able to consult many Canadians and Quebecers.
<P>
	They admitted their concern about the lack of clear provisions 
in Bill C-57 with respect to dumping. A number of people said 
they were afraid that imported goods would be sold on the 
Canadian market at prices below those prevailing on national 
markets and, in some cases below cost.
<P>
	Bill C-57 already contains certain provisions on the 
evaluation of complaints about dumping by the Canadian 
International Trade Tribunal. An attempt is made to determine 
whether certain unlawful acts would harm the interests of 
Canadian and Quebec producers.
<P>
	However, the bill provides that the tribunal cannot recognize 
the existence of injury unless the circumstances causing injury 
are clearly perceived and imminent.
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	These provisions are not only extremely restrictive but also 
extremely vague. The bill contains no detailed instructions for 
determining what constitutes clearly perceived and imminent 
injury. It does not define the type of evidence that may be 
considered by the Canadian International Trade Tribunal.
<P>
	Furthermore, it is simply left up to the governor in council, on 
the advice of the Minister of Finance, to establish regulations, if 
necessary. If he feels like it, as the hon. member for Verchères 
said. We think it is important that the Minister of Industry, who 
is in the best position to know about the problems facing 
Canadian businesses, should also be able to make 
recommendations to the governor in council on factors to be 
considered in determining whether there is a case of dumping. 
More should be done, however.
<P>
	Our American neighbours have issued clear and detailed 
instructions on approaching tribunals with complaints about 
dumping and on the evidence to be considered by those 
tribunals.
<P>
	It is therefore imperative that Canada provide clear and 
specific guidelines on the factors that would be admissible as 
evidence before the tribunals. Without these guidelines, 
Canadians and Quebecers, when they lose the advantage as a 
result of unlawful acts-I am thinking of steel producers, for 
instance-will not know how to argue their case to obtain 
justice.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Bonnie Brown (Oakville-Milton, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am grateful for the opportunity to respond to the amendment put 
forward by the member for Vercheres. I appreciate his initiative. 
This has come upon us fairly quickly. He has responded very 
quickly to the  concerns of the steel industry by getting an 
amendment in by the deadline.
<P>
	I think his speed and his responsiveness demonstrates the 
commitment not just of this government but indeed of this 
Parliament to both the management and the workers in the steel 
industry.
<P>
	In the all-party steel caucus that support is obvious at every 
meeting. We sit around the table, people from all parties and 
management and labour, working together. It really is quite an 
exciting experience to be part of that particular group here 
where usually the setting is so highly partisan.
<P>
	I should point out that we did have the opportunity yesterday 
to speak with the minister. He pointed out to us the difference in 
the wants of the way we legislate and the way the Americans 
legislate. It is much more their style to put a lot of details into 
their legislation whereas it is more our style to keep things 
pretty clean and put the details into regulation.
<P>
	Yesterday the minister did not seem to be adverse to the idea 
of those concepts in the amendment in the regulations, however 
he pointed out to us that it was going to require as the 
parliamentary secretary pointed out the involvement of the 
Minister of Finance. He could not speak completely freely at 
that meeting knowing he had to get a cabinet colleague on side.
<P>
	I would like to inform the mover of this amendment and those 
who are supporting him that I happen to know that this issue has 
been brought forward to the Minister of Finance in the last 24 
hours by the Deputy Prime Minister. We now have three 
members of cabinet responding to the concerns of the steel 
industry as my colleague across the floor has responded today.
<P>
	Keeping in mind that those three members of cabinet will 
work together on it, I think I can assure him that the general 
intention of what it is he wants to achieve will probably come 
forward. However, the idea of this amendment does not seem to 
be true to the Canadian tradition of how we write legislation and 
therefore I will have to join the parliamentary secretary in 
voting against it.
<P>
	I would also like to assure the member that within the steel 
caucus we will continue to press to make sure that these things 
are achieved but in a more subtle way.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philippe Paré (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will 
be brief, first of all because the member for Verchères has 
explained quite well the theoretical and practical basis of his 
amendment as well as the need for it.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8265"> 8265 </A></B>
<P>
	I find somewhat deplorable that members opposite have 
completely ignored the public hearings that we held with 
representatives of different industries. It is as if those public 
hearings were absolutely useless. I think it is a waste of time. 
Not only have we wasted time, but if we added up all the 
consultations that this government has done in the last year, we 
would probably find that vast sums have been gobbled up 
practically for nothing since the government always ends up 
doing what he intended to do anyway.
<P>
	Members opposite recognize that the amendment is 
essentially good but they say they would prefer doing it by way 
of regulations. Let us not forget that regulations do not have the 
scope of an act; members opposite probably know that as well as 
we do. Actually, it is probably the reason why they are opposing 
this amendment to the act.
<P>
	People often say that they are all for virtue, but such an 
assertion is not enough to guarantee that virtue will prevail. I 
think that in a way it applies to anti-dumping. The fact that the 
Uruguay Round prohibits dumping is not a sufficient guarantee 
that it will not occur. Therefore Bill C-57 must provide for a 
means to face the problem when it arises because it will.
<P>
	We all know that dumping is an unfair trade practice. It can be 
so harmful to the industry against which it is used that it may 
make it disappear. In order to avoid such consequences, the 
GATT agreement prohibits dumping. However, it is incumbent 
upon the industry victim of dumping to prove that it has suffered 
a prejudice so serious that its future is threatened.
<P>
	The amendment we propose defines the factors for 
determining such prejudice, which is not provided for in this 
bill. In the absence of guidelines, the injured industry would be 
unable to present its case in an appropriate way. Nevertheless, 
the United States could be used as a model in that regard. 
Therefore I invite the government to support the amendment.
<P>

	The House proceeded to the consideration of Bill C-55, an act 
to establish a board having jurisdiction concerning disputes 
respecting surface rights in respect of land in the Yukon 
Territory and to amend other acts in relation thereto, as reported 
(without amendment) from the committee.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Brian Tobin (for the Minister of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development)</B> moved that the bill be concurred in.
<P>
	(Motion agreed to.)
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> When shall the bill be 
read the third time? By leave, now?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed
<P>
	<B>Mr. Tobin (for the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development)</B> moved that the bill be read the third time and 
passed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lyle Vanclief (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure 
to rise and address the House on third and final reading of Bill 
C-55, the Yukon Surface Rights Board Act.
<P>
	I begin by thanking hon. members for supporting this bill at 
second reading. My colleagues clearly see the need to proceed 
with this bill because it will bring positive and lasting change to 
the Yukon. We appreciate their contribution to second reading 
debate and ask the House to once again give positive 
consideration to this legislation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8266"> 8266 </A></B>
<P>
	Bill C-55 will establish a new surface rights regime in the 
Yukon, a regime that will serve and protect the interests of all 
residents of the territory. As well, this final piece of legislation 
is required to allow implementation of the Yukon First Nations 
land claim and self-government agreements to proceed.
<P>
	Clearly we only have one reasonable course of action. We 
must proceed with this bill as quickly as possible. We must live 
up to the crown's commitments to build new relationships with 
Yukon First Nations. In doing so we will open the doors for 
economic development, job creation and other social benefits 
for all residents of the Yukon.
<P>
	Yukoners are virtually unanimous in wanting this bill to pass 
quickly. The minister has received letters, for example, from the 
Yukon Chamber of Mines urging the government to pass this 
legislation. Yukoners want and need the certainty of the 
economic development opportunities that this bill and the land 
claims settlement will bring.
<P>
	Hon. members are aware that the surface rights board that will 
be established by Bill C-55 is a requirement of the Yukon 
umbrella final agreement. The creation of this board 
acknowledges the changing face of land ownership in the Yukon. 
It is an excellent example of foresight, planning and 
preparedness by government.
<P>
	As land claims in the Yukon are settled, large tracts of land 
will be confirmed as First Nations land. Other residents of the 
Yukon will also be able to more readily acquire land as private 
owners. The crown's current role as primary land owner in the 
territory will gradually be eliminated.
<P>
<B>(1700) </B>
<P>
	At the same time, the certainty of land and resource 
ownership that will result will rekindle interest in subsurface 
minerals, including minerals on privately held land. In support 
of resource development and resource development initiatives, 
a new mechanism of public government is needed. This will 
ensure that access rights are available to those who want and 
need to use the land.
<P>
	That mechanism is known as the Yukon surface rights board. 
It has been modelled on similar boards operating in Manitoba, 
Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia. This board will 
resolve disputes relating to both settlement and non-settlement 
lands throughout the Yukon. As has already been said, we 
anticipate that most of these disputes will involve access to land 
for exploring for or developing subsurface mineral resources.
<P>
	We want to emphasize that the Yukon surface rights board will 
have a range of known and definite powers for resolving 
disputes. These will include the power to issue access orders, to 
establish terms and conditions of access, and to award 
compensation for access or for damage resulting from access. 
However, Bill C-55 will require people to attempt to negotiate 
access in compensation agreements before bringing a dispute to 
the board. The  board will only be asked to resolve disputes 
where no such agreement was possible.
<P>
	Orders of the Yukon surface rights board will be enforceable 
through the Supreme Court of the Yukon Territory. Decisions 
may be appealed to the court on limited grounds, such as bias or 
lack of procedural fairness.
<P>
	We also want to stress that the board will take a balanced 
approach to its work. Bill C-55 ensures that all sectors of the 
Yukon society will have an opportunity to participate in the 
important decisions that need to be made.
<P>
	Under the terms of its land claims agreement, the Council for 
Yukon Indians will have the right to nominate one-half of the 
members of the surface rights board excluding the chairperson. 
Yukon Indians will also be guaranteed representation on any 
panel created by the board to deal with matters concerning 
settlement lands. This will give aboriginal people an important 
and effective role in decision making relating to surface rights.
<P>
	The remainder of the board's members will be nominated by 
the federal government. The minister intends to ensure that all 
interests in the Yukon are represented on the board. It will 
become a practical example of resource co-management that 
can be replicated in other jurisdictions.
<P>
	Bill C-55 was drafted with cost efficiency in mind. It 
provides a less costly and time consuming option than the courts 
for addressing issues of access and compensation. The 
requirement for negotiation and possibly mediation before 
bringing a dispute to the board is also intended as a cost saving 
measure.
<P>
	As hon. members are aware, this bill is based on extensive 
consultation with representatives of the Yukon First Nations, the 
territorial government, the mining industry and the Yukon 
general public. Many of these parties have been directly 
involved in drafting this legislation. Consequently, Bill C-55 is 
fair and responsible to everyone with a stake in the future of the 
Yukon.
<P>
	As a result of the unprecedented consultative process, we 
have been able to reach a general agreement on the principles of 
this bill. We have also reached consensus on almost all of its 
provisions.
<P>
	As I said at the outset, we have no reasonable alternative but 
to proceed with this bill. Parliament's endorsement of this 
legislation is critical to the process of settling land claims in the 
Yukon and bringing the fundamental democratic right of 
self-government to Yukon First Nations. It is vital that we 
uphold the crown's honour by fulfilling our obligation to Yukon 
First Nations under the land claims agreement.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8267"> 8267 </A></B>
<P>
	Bill C-55 is also sound, responsible and necessary legislation 
in its own right. It will bring decision making closer to the 
people affected. It will provide a known regime for obtaining 
access to private and public lands. This in turn will facilitate 
economic development and provide a level playing field for 
Yukon industry compared to other areas in Canada. This will 
ensure that resource development projects will go ahead after 
many years of delay and frustration.
<P>
	Bill C-55 will also give Yukon Indians the chance for a new 
partnership with governments and non-aboriginal Yukoners. 
This is a goal that is supported by all Canadians. I therefore urge 
my hon. colleagues to agree to send this legislation to the other 
place after which an order in council can be approved to 
proclaim this legislation into law.
<P>
<B>(1705) </B>
<P>
	Combined with the Yukon land claims and self-government 
legislation, Bill C-55 will help bring about positive changes that 
have been long envisaged in the Yukon.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ): </B>Mr. Speaker, I think 
it will not come as a surprise that, of course, we will support the 
bill, as we did for Bill C-33 and Bill C-34.
<P>
	In fact, I say that it would be illogical not to adopt the bill now 
before the House, Bill C-55, since it will give effect to bills 
C-33 and C-34. Knowing the Yukon's concerns and since, as the 
critic responsible for these matters, I kept up with them for the 
whole session, we will be totally logical with ourselves by 
supporting the bill.
<P>
	The bill is giving effect to Bill C-33 and Bill C-34. Before 
making a short description of these bills, I want to remind 
members that I went to the Yukon, this year. For me, it is the best 
way to deal with the issues and to see the way native peoples 
live.
<P>
	Most of the members who will speak on the bills now before 
the House will do so without having visited the communities 
concerned. For my part, if possible, I try to go to these places in 
order to better understand the feelings of the people there and 
also to become aware of their quality of life.
<P>
	I met some really remarkable people in the Yukon, very 
tolerant people who have also been very persevering. It was said 
repeatedly that these negotiations required 21 years of efforts 
before they could be concluded. Yet, we have to realize that the 
injustices do not go back only 21 years, but much further. When 
you become aware of the native way of doing things, of the way 
they see the world, you realize that from the very beginning, 
from the day the first Europeans came to the Yukon, aboriginal 
people accepted willingly to share their territory with them, but 
without relinquishing in any way their native rights, their rights 
as first occupants.
<P>
	When the economy developed and when aboriginal people 
realized that they were excluded from that development, they 
understood that it was necessary for them to have a say about 
economic development and resource management on their land.
<P>
	This is where we are today, after years, decades of injustice 
and after 21 years of negotiations. Bill C-55 will put into effect 
Bill C-33, which dealt with self-government. With that bill, and 
in some areas of activity, we were saying to aboriginal people: 
``Here, now, instead of designing and managing programs from 
Ottawa, we are letting you decide in areas like education, health, 
etc.'' I think we really have here a way to solve the major 
problems we find on reserves.
<P>
	It is an interesting solution, because for too long we have had 
a very paternalistic approach to their problems and we simply 
pushed them into a situation of extreme dependency. Often, 
there is no economic development because their land base is 
very limited, and the resources they have access to are also very 
limited. Therefore, they cannot flourish economically.
<P>
	The Auditor General revealed this week that close to 40 per 
cent of the native population is heavily dependant on either 
welfare or unemployment insurance. I visited reserves where 
the unemployment rate was around 80 per cent. It is painfully 
obvious that the way we deal with the native situation is 
outdated and does not work. What we have here is an example of 
how to help native communities help themselves.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	When they manage their own affairs, not only are they no 
longer dependent on the bureaucracy in Ottawa, but they are in 
tune with local concerns. You know that when it comes to 
education and health matters, the native way is often very 
different from ours. Their approach is much more holistic, more 
respectful of the environment they live in. I believe that it is 
important to ensure that powers which used to belong to Ottawa 
be transferred to native communities. Bill C-33, which was 
passed recently, gives native people authority over some 
specific activities. It is the way of the future.
<P>
	I referred to Bill C-33, which deals with self-government. 
Even though it is a different matter, it has something to do with 
the fact that one must ensure that the land which is given back to 
native people will contain enough resources to allow them to opt 
out of the Indian Act. As I mentioned before, this act keeps them 
in a state of extreme dependence. The land base arrived at in the 
agreement with the Yukon and the main stakeholders who have 
signed so far, will ensure that they will be able to become 
economically independent.
<P>
	We could point out the importance of the board. The board is 
very important for the very simple reason that it must settle 
disputes. In the Split Lake agreement, for example, the lack of a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8268"> 8268 </A></B>
<P>
board to settle disputes is rather obvious. What would happen 
without a board such as the  one proposed in this bill? The courts 
would systematically be called upon to settle disputes.
<P>
	We realize that there might be hundreds of disputes, that 
people are waiting for their cases to be resolved because we 
know how heavy the courts' backlog is. The board proposed 
today will clear some of the backlog by settling disputes 
concerning both rights and territories.
<P>
	We also at one point toyed with the idea of proposing 
amendments. However, after consulting with Yukon first 
nations, we concluded that it might be better not to define the 
rights and interests because they said that the nations could 
probably agree among themselves on what these rights and 
interests are.
<P>
	We also played with the notion of person because, as you 
know, the agreement before us covers four first nations out of 
14, if I am not mistaken. Another 10 or so are negotiating or 
close to a settlement. We were concerned at one point that the 
notion of person would only apply to signatory nations. 
However, after discussion, we realized that the term ``person'' 
had a broader meaning. As a result, the board will be able to 
settle disputes not only among the first nations that have signed 
the agreement and are subject to the act but also with the first 
nations that have not signed it yet.
<P>
	That is why today we will support the bill without 
amendments as such.
<P>
	Why do we support the bill? I think I have just given a few of 
the reasons: the Natives' desire to manage their own affairs 
along with the Canadian government's intention to stop placing 
Indians under its guardianship. I think that this government has 
announced its intentions, including a pilot project in Manitoba 
among other things. Let us say, however, that after almost 100 
years the government finally realized that the law was obsolete 
and did not achieve its objectives and that it was imperative to 
completely alter the way we deal with Natives.
<P>
	The government is willing to make these changes. Of course, 
Bloc Quebecois members also realized very quickly that 
changes were needed. One only has to visit some reserves a 
number of times to see that the system does not work. Avenues 
of resolution lie before us and the Bloc Quebecois will certainly 
agree that a new approach must be taken involving 
self-government and land claims.
<P>
<B>(1715) </B>
<P>
	As for respect for aboriginal cultures, if there is an issue that 
is truly fascinating, this is it. There are 635 communities living 
on reserves in Canada. I am limiting my comments to aboriginal 
people living on reserves, because you notice that many no 
longer do and this is the kind of unique dynamic that they have to 
deal with. There is the whole issue of the Metis, and the Inuit as 
well, because they too are very preoccupied with not being 
drowned by such concerns, by aboriginal concerns. In fact, they 
say so, every chance they get.
<P>
	Coming back to aboriginal communities, to the 635 of them. 
This is a really fascinating issue, because although they belong 
to first nations and often speak the same language-there are 
approximately 50 aboriginal languages you know-we notice 
that from one of these 635 communities to the other, these 
aboriginal people all have their own way of looking at things. 
And that is what makes aboriginal affairs such a great challenge. 
It is a fascinating issue.
<P>
	So, the agreement before us concerns aboriginal nations of the 
Yukon. Yukon has a rather unique history and the aboriginal 
people are proud of having shared in writing it with the 
Europeans. I can say, having travelled myself to that part of the 
country, that these people took me to see magnificent sites, 
including the Yukon River. It was beautiful at the time of year 
when I visited. Because of the glaciers, the river was completely 
transformed, taking shades of blue like I had never seen, except 
perhaps at sea or from a beach, watching colours change as the 
horizon becomes indistinct. But in the Yukon, the depth and 
colour of the river were really amazing. They are proud to say 
that they have shared this territory with others.
<P>
	I was taken to a mountain where the first Europeans 
supposedly went to see the midnight sun. I had never seen the 
midnight sun. I found it thrilling. I was taken to the Klondike, 
now Dawson City, and we are proud to see that there was a happy 
coexistence between Europeans-I was even given the 
opportunity to try to find gold. I was assured that I could find 
gold, but unfortunately I could not take the time to do it. I spent 
more time trying to fish on the river and perhaps I did not catch 
any fish, but I did not get any gold either. I met some wonderful 
people there and I tell you that the trip was quite what I 
expected, a realization that those people are extraordinary and 
live in a wonderful place.
<P>
	As I said at some length before, the inhabitants will have the 
resources needed for economic development. I think that with 
the areas granted and the degree of responsibility that these 
people will have-and they have been waiting to take control of 
their lives for a long time-I think that their future is now 
assured. They will have both the land base and sufficient 
economic resources to break from the tutelage of the Indian Act.
<P>
	They will also be able to ensure their identity as native people. 
Several examples to illustrate this point could be mentioned. Let 
us take a very specific one, housing. One need only go to the 
reserves to see how all the houses are alike. It is so because the 
houses and the housing development plans were designed in 
Ottawa, and also because the budgets were usually rather 
limited. So, the question was: How are we going to build 
adequate houses, but without any frills? The result was that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8269"> 8269 </A></B>
<P>
these houses were often all identical and that the aboriginal 
culture was not taken into consideration.
<P>
	It is important to them to ensure their development while also 
affirming their cultural identity. I think you will see a major 
change in the way native people will do things in the Yukon. I 
believe they will give us quite a demonstration. I am anxious to 
go back there and see how things will have changed in a few 
years. I hope that by then Quebec will be an independent 
country. However, it will still be possible to go to the Yukon 
because we have no intention of building a Berlin wall between 
Quebec and the rest of Canada. I will always be happy to visit the 
Yukon, look at the new way of doing things and see how these 
people will have taken control of their destiny and ensured that 
their culture is reflected in the decisions they will make.
<P>
	This legislation puts an end to the uncertainty regarding 
territorial rights, land titles, cutting rights as well as mining 
rights.
<P>
<B>(1720) </B>
<P>
	Indeed, there was a great deal of uncertainty before, but things 
will finally be settled.
<P>
	Negotiations lasted 21 years and surface rights had to be 
established to confirm ownership and rights over usable land. I 
briefly alluded to this earlier and I do not think it is necessary to 
go over that again.
<P>
	Bill C-55 proposes the establishment of a board having 
jurisdiction to settle disputes. I also mentioned that point earlier 
and I made a comparison with Split Lake, where no such board 
exists and where arbitration problems are mounting. If such a 
board was established there, a large number of disputes would 
be settled without having to go before the courts. This is an 
original idea that will also save a lot of money to a lot of people.
<P>
	Given the current state of public finances, it is very important 
to make good use of our money. I believe that this board will 
result in savings, considering the legal costs generated by all 
those endless disputes which would often end up in the Supreme 
Court. These people would rather settle things differently, more 
or less by consensus, which is the way democracy works. The 
board, through its membership, and I will come back to this later 
on, will solve these disputes.
<P>
	It will be a last resort and it will represent a true transfer of 
jurisdiction to the first nations.
<P>
	I want to say a little more on the housing and health issues, 
and also discuss infrastructures. We know that the government 
has spent a lot of money on infrastructure. I have personally 
visited several reserves and, as I mentioned yesterday in this 
House, I was stunned to see how dilapidated housing on the 
reserve is, but also that a large number of houses have no water 
system, no sewer and no running water. In Canada, we boast 
about our remarkable quality of life. But we tolerate these 
things, which only go to show that the Indian Act provides no 
solution at all. We boast about the remarkable quality of life in 
Canada, but the native people are living in what I consider Third 
World conditions.
<P>
	With this kind of bill, and bills like C-33, C-34 and C-55, 
people will be able to invest their own resources in whatever 
basic infrastructure projects that might meet their own needs. 
This is not only a step in the right direction, but also the way to 
nip the problem in the bud.
<P>
	I will now turn to the membership of the board, because I see 
that the private members' hour is coming up soon. The board 
will be made up of 3 to 11 members. What is original here is that 
the native people will have their say in the appointment of these 
board members. Since we are giving natives a land base and 
granting them self-government, it would be a bit silly to seize 
the very first opportunity we have to set up a board and appoint 
only white people. Of course, in Yukon, the majority of the 
board members will be natives. I think this is an adequate 
compromise. Half of the board members will be natives 
appointed by natives.
<P>
	It is equally important that the people making up the other 
part of the committee also come from the Yukon. Personally, I 
have a good knowledge of native affairs, but I would feel very 
uneasy if the minister or the government chose me to sit on the 
Yukon committee. It would be ill advised on my part to say that I 
know that community and that I want them to benefit from my 
great wisdom. I think that the days when Ottawa could impose 
its wisdom on the regions and on the native communities are 
over and I think that the bill before us reflects a desire to help the 
First Nations take their own destiny in hand. Therefore, there 
must be a native component in all of the various committees so 
that the policies and the plans of the First Nations are reflected 
in reality and that the natives are free to take the directions they 
want.
<P>
<B>(1725) </B>
<P>
	I would be remiss if, before concluding briefly, I did not also 
mention Quebec's experience. I believe that Quebec's 
experience, notably the James Bay Convention, somehow sets a 
standard. I say this every time the issue of self-government 
comes up, and I say it again: I believe that the James Bay 
Convention set a standard which truly serves as a model 
elsewhere in Canada.
<P>
	So I think it was very interesting in this regard. I would be 
remiss if, every time we have an opportunity to talk about 
self-government, I did not mention it, because that convention 
<P>

<B><A NAME="8270"> 8270 </A></B>
<P>
was signed in 1975. I am not saying the agreement is perfect 
since there are no perfect agreements. They often are the result 
of a fine compromise. But even if it is now being attacked by the 
Cree nations, as some colleagues of mine said this week, we 
must consider that in those days, at the time of the signature, 
people were very happy with that document. Today, many 
provisions of the James Bay Agreement apply even in Yukon and 
I think many parts of the James Bay Agreement served as a 
model for the regulations on self-government that were adopted 
here, after that legislation.
<P>
	There is wide consensus also in Yukon. Of course there are a 
great number of natives in Yukon, but there are also a great 
number of people of other nations who shared the territory with 
the native people. I say share, but I am being generous in saying 
that because, down deep, there was no sharing. It is more like the 
natives had to share part of their territory because the mining 
companies established themselves there. Perhaps these 
companies gave work to a few natives in the region, but we must 
admit the resources extracted from the Yukon territory did not 
really help finance the solution of the native issues in Yukon.
<P>
	Therefore we will remedy the inequities with a proper 
compromise. The consensus is wide enough, even in the Yukon. 
The Yukon government agrees on that, the Mining Association 
agrees on the proposals that are before us. People realize that 
there have been inequities for too long and that negotiations 
have taken place for 21 years. Finally, I want to say that the last 
page of paternalism in Yukon has been turned today, that we are 
putting an end today to an era that may have been useful at the 
time for some people, but surely not for the native people, and 
that a new era in which native people will take control of their 
destiny, in which there will be no dependence towards the 
federal government, is beginning.
<P>
	These people will now be able to tell their children and 
grandchildren:``That happened in 1994''. And if we consider 
their attitude during the negotiations, and their perseverance, 
for decades, from generation to generation, these people have 
been saying: this must be changed, and they persevered, so that 
today, we are turning over a new leaf, and as a result, aboriginal 
people, I am positive, will be much better off, as far as their 
culture, natural resources, territory and their relationship with 
non-aboriginal people in the Yukon are concerned. From this 
day onward, there will be no more dependency. They have 
started something new, and I am looking forward to seeing how 
things will evolve, and from now on we will see that we made the 
right decision in 1994.
<P>
	I want to congratulate all first nations who, I know, are 
listening to us today. Today is the culmination of all these 
negotiations, and of course the Bloc is delighted to have been a 
part of these discussions, and in concluding, I want to thank 
them for their cordial welcome, and I am so happy that we were 
with them throughout this process, and the Bloc Quebecois is 
pleased to say that they will support this bill.

	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.)</B> moved that Bill C-262, 
an act to provide for the settlement of labour disputes affecting 
the export of grain by arbitration and to amend the Public 
Service Staff Relations Act in consequence thereof, be read the 
second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to 
speak in support of my Bill C-262 respecting the Grain Export 
Protection Act. The bill deals with an issue that grain farmers in 
western Canada and in my constituency have been addressing 
and wanting to address for some time.
<P>
	For 11 days last January and February a labour dispute at the 
Vancouver ports disrupted the flow of Canadian grain to export 
markets. It is estimated that Canada's grain industry incurred 
losses of hundreds of millions of dollars.
<P>
	The federal government responded by introducing special 
back to work legislation, Bill C-10, to end the dispute and 
resume the flow of grain. Far from being an isolated case, it 
marked the 13th time that the workers were legislated back to 
work since the year 1966. Bill C-262 provides a permanent 
solution to this chronic problem by amending the Public Service 
Staff Relations Act to prevent labour disputes from disrupting 
the flow of grain from the farm to export.
<P>
	In cases where grain transportation is threatened by strikes or 
lockouts those actions are prevented. To settle such disputes the 
bill provides for a settlement mechanism known as final offer 
selection arbitration. The process is only utilized if the parties 
involved are unable to reach an agreement through the normal 
collective bargaining process.
<P>
	For those who are not familiar with final offer selection 
arbitration, let me quickly mention some of its key features. 
First, the trade union and the employer are requested to provide 
the minister with the name of a person they jointly recommend 
as the arbitrator.
<P>
	Second, the trade union and employer are required to submit 
to the arbitrator a list of matters agreed upon and a list of those 
matters still under dispute. For the disputed issues each party is 
required to submit a final offer for settlement. The arbitrator 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8271"> 8271 </A></B>
<P>
then settles either the final offer submitted by the trade union or 
the final offer submitted by the employer. The arbitrator is not 
permitted to split the difference. In the event that one  party does 
not submit a final offer the other side is automatically accepted. 
The arbitrator's decision in these matters is binding on both 
parties.
<P>
	Why was the final offer selection chosen? This dispute 
settlement mechanism used by the federal government in Bill 
C-10 was chosen to force the negotiating parties to make a 
greater effort at settling their differences by themselves. By 
compelling each party to submit a final best offer and by 
preventing the arbitrator from splitting the difference between 
the two, the mechanism creates a strong incentive for both 
parties to submit a credible, constructive and economically 
realistic offer for settlement. Any party that tables an 
unreasonable final offer would be taking a huge gamble the 
arbitrator would choose the other party's proposal. It is hoped 
that the existence of the process will encourage negotiating 
parties to reach agreements before it becomes necessary to have 
the arbitrator choose one offer or the other.
<P>
	Since 1966, as I have mentioned, the federal government has 
had to pass special back to work legislation in the areas of 
longshoring and grain handling 13 times. The cost of such 
disruptions to grain farmers and the grain industry is 
tremendous. The Western Wheat Growers Association 
estimated that the 11-day work stoppage which was ended by 
Bill C-10 of this year cost the grain industry some $35 million in 
demurrage, penalties and out of pocket expenses.
<P>
<B>(1735) </B>
<P>
	When the Minister of Human Resources Development spoke 
on Bill C-10 he stated that the strike was threatening some $500 
million worth of grain sales. That is not acceptable.
<P>
	The frequency of such work stoppages over the past 20 to 30 
years has also made foreign buyers question the reliability of 
Canada's grain supply. The most recent work stoppage at the 
west coast ports so concerned Japanese canola importers that 
they have begun offering Australian farmers minimum pricing 
contracts to encourage them to grow canola.
<P>
	Another reason Bill C-262 is necessary is the vulnerability of 
western grain farmers to work stoppages in these industries. To 
illustrate just how vulnerable grain farmers are, let us consider 
this example. In 1988, 30 per cent of the country's grain exports 
were halted by 69 grain handlers in Prince Rupert. As usual the 
federal government was compelled to legislate them back to 
work after a few days.
<P>
	One source of the problem is that Canada's transportation 
network has failed western grain farmers by limiting the options 
available to them in moving their grain to market. This is largely 
a result of the distorting effects government policies such as the 
WGTA subsidy, the Crow benefit, have had on the development 
of the nation's transportation structure.
<P>
	Another source of grain farmers' vulnerability is the 
composition and location of Canada's grain markets. 
Approximately 80 per cent of Canadian grain is exported and 
most foreign buyers prefer loading out of west coast ports.
<P>
	Finally there is a combination of legislation, regulations and 
purely economic considerations that has made it uneconomical 
or impractical for farmers to ship grain to export markets via 
such alternate routes as Thunder Bay, Churchill and American 
west coast ports.
<P>
	On average the federal government has had to legislate grain 
handlers and longshoremen back to work, as I have said, about 
once every two years. Each time it happens grain farmers lose 
control over their livelihoods and their lives. Why should we not 
settle the issue once and for all instead of waiting for the next 
time it becomes necessary to rush through emergency back to 
work legislation? There is no need to have next times because 
with Bill C-262 we can resolve the problem once and for all.
<P>
	One question asked is: Does Bill C-262 not violate the right to 
bargain collectively? I want to say very clearly that Reform is 
not anti-labour. That is not the intent of the bill. It is not a bill 
about union busting. We fully support the principle of collective 
bargaining. As a member of the legislature in the province of 
Alberta I have spoken a number of times in support of the 
process. However we also support the right of farmers to earn a 
living. We believe that governments have a responsibility to 
protect western grain farmers from ever again having to incur 
the costs they incurred during past strikes and lockouts.
<P>
	In the sectors affected by the bill, that is the grain industry 
itself, the right to bargain collectively and to strike or to lock out 
employees is presently somewhat of a fiction. All the parties 
involved realize this very fact. Why do I say that? It is fiction 
because the federal government is always compelled-and the 
history is there-to intervene to end such work stoppages within 
a matter of days. The proof for this statement, as I have said 
more than once already in my remarks, is that the federal 
government has had to legislate the workers back to work some 
13 times since 1966.
<P>
<B>(1740) </B>
<P>
	In a properly functioning labour environment with employers 
and employees they both have to take into account costs in the 
form of lost wages or in the form of sales. Then the question 
about strike action becomes something different. Normally this 
is a powerful incentive for both sides to reach an agreement at 
the bargaining table.
<P>
	However this normal safeguard does not apply in the case of 
longshoring and grain handling. The knowledge that any work 
stoppage in these areas will not be permitted to last for any 
length of time has been factored into the negotiation process for 
the parties. They do not fear a strike nor a lockout knowing it 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8272"> 8272 </A></B>
<P>
will not last too long. They know the victims in the process will 
not be the  employers or the employees but western Canadian 
grain farmers because in the end they pay the bills.
<P>
	When I look at legislation such as this I wonder whether or not 
it should be permanent legislation. I do not believe it should be 
permanent. We in the Reform Party hope that at some point we 
could take the legislation off the books. Such legislation is 
presently necessary due to a number factors. Western grain 
farmers have no choice but to export their grain via one 
transportation route. If they had the option of shipping their 
grain via route <I>a</I> or via route <I>b</I> when there is work stoppage there 
would be no need for Bill C-262.
<P>
	This is one reason a Reform government would work to create 
a more flexible and efficient transportation network. 
Transportation reform is one of a series of measures which 
Reformers believe would empower farmers by giving them 
greater flexibility and control over their own livelihood. When 
such reforms are put in place there would be no need for 
legislation such as the private member's bill before us today. At 
such a time the legislation could be repealed with no harm to 
grain farmers. Until such reforms are made Reformers believe 
the government's priority should be to protect the western grain 
farmer.
<P>
	If in the future after Bill C-262 has been repealed and there is 
some combination of events that threatens western grain 
farmers again, we would not hesitate to bring back into effect 
that kind of legislation.
<P>
	I look at Bill C-262 as a private member and as a farmer from 
western Canada. I was involved in each work stoppage that 
occurred over the past 13 years either as a member of the 
legislature or as a farmer who wanted to ship grain to meet my 
expenses and commitments as a farmer. I was always frustrated.
<P>
	I remember in the legislature moving resolutions that the 
provincial government should go to the federal government and 
get the work stoppage stopped so that farmers could start 
shipping their grain and getting out of some of the financial 
stress they were facing. The provincial government said it was a 
federal matter. Often it stayed that type of thing even though 
members of the legislature in Alberta agreed that something 
should be done.
<P>
	I remember as a farmer saying: ``I know I am paying the bill 
but I cannot sit at the table. I have no place at the table as a 
farmer even though I am paying the bill in order to make my 
case. There is no one at the table representing me''. The grain 
companies did not have the vested interest of the farmer. We 
could not say anything to the grain companies. We could not say 
anything to the longshoremen. They were not responsible to the 
farmer. It had been and still is a very frustrating and difficult 
problem.
<P>
	I always said that if I had the opportunity something should be 
done where the farmer is represented at the table. The bill 
empowers the federal government to be at the table and to say to 
the 23 or 25 unions between the farm gate and the hold of the 
boat that if they move to a point where they can negotiate no 
further at the table they must move to arbitration. You present 
your case at the table the best you can. If you win you get that 
settlement; if the employer or the shipping companies win then 
that is the settlement. That is the way it is. We would be a little 
more involved as a farmer in an indirect sense, the federal 
government would represent us there.
<P>
<B>(1745) </B>
<P>
	What happens now under the circumstances? What happened 
in January and February 1994? Again we had work stoppage. 
Farmers were in difficulty. The government was being pressured 
to bring in a bill to put these people back to work.
<P>
	Then it becomes a political item. Should we force labour back 
to work or not? Should we get involved or not? What are the 
politics of it? Are the farmers stressed or are they not? Do we 
want to represent the union? We do not want to lose their vote 
out there.
<P>
	All of a sudden here is the farmer of western Canada in terms 
of his financial circumstances and his marketing capabilities 
being involved in a political process. He should not be involved 
in this type of circumstance. As far as I am concerned, that is 
wrong and it should stop.
<P>
	It is incumbent upon this government to look seriously at this 
proposal and take some action. I know that western farmers 
would shout hurrah and be excited about it. They would want 
this type of action from the government. They are getting tired 
of being pawns of these few longshoremen who are paid very 
high hourly wages, exorbitant wages, for the jobs they are doing 
out on the coast.
<P>
	I have said this in the Alberta legislature and I have said it 
publicly to the media and in a variety of other places. We as 
farmers were so disgusted with the circumstances out there. I 
said that I could train 25 to 40 of the young farmers from my 
constituency in two weeks or less and move them out there. We 
could take over those jobs and we could continue to get our grain 
on the boats and move it forward.
<P>
	I can tell you a lot of young farmers were so upset because of 
this strike, with people getting paid high wages out there and 
having no consideration. Living on the coast at Vancouver, 
sitting out on the port where the water never freezes over, or 
sitting up at Prince Rupert where there is not any kind of 
agricultural environment, there is no loyalty, no communica-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8273"> 8273 </A></B>
<P>
tion, no concern for that farmer. That farmer is out on the flat 
prairie trying to survive under not only very adverse climatic 
conditions but economic conditions as well.
<P>
	This bill should not be taken lightly by government. The 
normal practice for this kind of thing is that if a private member 
introduces and presents a bill on the floor of the House of 
Commons or in a legislative environment, just because it comes 
from a private member of Parliament from the opposition the 
first knee-jerk reaction is for government members to come up 
with one reason or 10 reasons to reject the bill.
<P>
	Government members do not think about the merits of the bill 
and whether it will it work. They often think about who is going 
to get the credit. Well, I could not care less who gets the credit, 
but we should think about the idea behind the bill and consider it 
sincerely so that we can solve this problem once and for all for 
the farmers of western Canada.
<P>
	That is my case. I leave it with this House of Commons. I am 
certain that western Canadian farmers, the agriculture industry, 
are very interested in these kinds of changes. I urge my 
colleagues to give it their utmost support and consideration.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morris Bodnar (Saskatoon-Dundurn, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, because of time constraints I will give an abbreviated 
version of my speech. The comments of the hon. member are 
interesting especially in light of his saying that we should be 
looking at the idea behind it. Perhaps the idea is most 
commendable. It is a question of whether this legislation meets 
the needs we are looking at.
<P>
	I would like to begin my remarks on Bill C-262 by noting that 
we have been asked to look at what I regard as a very unusual 
piece of legislation. The author of the bill, the hon. member for 
Lethbridge, has titled the bill the grain export protection act. I 
say it is unusual because the House is very seldom asked to pass 
legislation that seeks to protect an economic activity from the 
participants themselves.
<P>
<B>(1750) </B>
<P>
	We have passed legislation that protects people from 
dangerous products or dangerous working conditions and we 
have passed legislation that protects consumers from unfair 
competition. In Bill C-262 in contrast we are being asked to 
pass a piece of legislation that seeks to protect an economic 
process, which is the transportation of grain, from the 
participants who are capable of slowing down or stopping the 
transportation process.
<P>
	The first question I would ask with regard to the stated 
intention of the bill is, who would the bill affect if it were to be 
passed? What companies and trade unions in the grain handling 
and transportation industry would be covered?
<P>
	A shutdown of the national railway system or a shutdown of 
one of the major terminal elevators would certainly affect the 
transportation of grain and would come under the scope of the 
bill. What about a shutdown of one of the transfer elevators on 
the Great Lakes or along the St. Lawrence seaway system? What 
about a shutdown of the Prescott elevators or the Sorel elevators  
near Montreal? Would the legislation apply to the companies or 
unions at these points? They are involved in the transportation 
of grain to the export market.
<P>
	Obviously, the scale of operations of these companies is much 
smaller than the terminal elevators at Thunder Bay or 
Vancouver. Therefore it is questionable as to whether or not they 
should be included. Unfortunately, the bill is unclear on this 
point and we are left to surmise for ourselves as to the 
companies and workers who might be covered by the bill.
<P>
	I should like to emphasize the important role played by grain 
farmers throughout Canada to our national economy as 
indicated by the hon. member. As we examine Bill C-262 we 
will want to keep in mind that we are assessing the relevance of 
this bill to grain farmers principally in the prairie provinces as 
well as the men and women who work in the grain transportation 
system across Canada.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, as I said, this is an abbreviated version of my 
speech. The management of the grain transportation and 
handling system is a complicated matter. There are an untold 
number of factors that contribute to the success in the operation 
of the system and there is an equally wide number of factors that 
can go wrong. The experience of this past year with the 
difficulties in the grain hopper car supply and weather 
conditions illustrates this point very well.
<P>
	When we look at a bill such as C-262 and the drastic measures 
it proposes, we have to keep in perspective the fact that 
industrial relations is only one dimension in the workings of this 
very expensive and complex system.
<P>
	I feel extremely uneasy about one implication of this bill 
which I believe should be highlighted. That is the fact that it 
seeks to ameliorate the conditions of one group in the western 
economy by restricting the rights of others, namely the parties 
involved in the grain handling and transportation system.
<P>
	I would suggest that it would be an extremely questionable act 
for the House to enact such a measure. I say this especially in 
view of the fact that many of the difficulties in the prairie grain 
economy are attributable to the international competitive 
environment and the difficulties we experienced earlier this year 
with the hopper car situation.
<P>
	I seriously doubt that the proposed legislative amendments 
would have the desired effect for the prairie economy and may in 
fact have negative implications for the agricultural sector.
<P>
	There is well founded evidence in those countries that have 
institutionalized the use of arbitration that work stoppages 
albeit illegal in nature continue to occur. In addition the arbitra-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8274"> 8274 </A></B>
<P>
tion process can result in settlements which are not always 
reflective of the mutual interests of the parties.
<P>
	The export of Canada's grain and its delivery to domestic 
markets depend on the vital activities of many companies and 
their workforces. On occasion the reliability of grain 
transportation and handling can be inconvenienced by work 
stoppages involving players in the system.
<P>
	Hon. members will be aware there have been occasions in the 
past where the particular party in power has had to take action in 
the public interest and bring about a resolution of work 
stoppages by legislative intervention. However, these 
infrequent occurrences hardly warrant the passage of proposed 
Bill C-262 before us which would remove collective bargaining 
rights and provide for the drastic measures that are contained 
within it.
<P>
<B>(1755 ) </B>
<P>
	We need only look to the experience of countries in which 
compulsory arbitration is widely practised. That experience is 
instructive. It indicates very clearly that strikes continue to 
occur even with compulsory arbitration and that such a measure 
turns out to be less than the solution or the panacea it is 
purported to be.
<P>
	I have stated that there is a widespread consensus on the 
source of present difficulties in international grain markets and 
in the measures that are being introduced to help augment the 
supply and efficiency of grain hopper cars. In view of this reality 
my feeling is that it would be unfortunate to inflict such a 
weighty and questionable measure as is proposed by Bill C-262 
on the employers and workers in the industry.
<P>
	Therefore, I have to say that Bill C-262 is not an appropriate 
measure for regulating collective bargaining in the Canadian 
grain handling and transportation system. I would urge hon. 
members of this House not to support the proposed legislation.
<P>
	There has been mention made of the needs of Canadian 
farmers and certainly there are losses that occur in strikes. There 
are always losses that occur in strikes, losses that occur not just 
to the grain farmers, but losses that occur to the people who 
work in the industry and to the companies involved. This is part 
of the bargaining process and labour management and it should 
continue. Elimination of such processes causes bitter feelings, 
causes stress and tension. In fact it exacerbates the situation 
rather than improves it.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
bill introduced by the hon. member for Lethbrige deals with 
grain tranportation from the point of production to the point of 
export.
<P>
	If we go back a little, we find that this bill has its origin in a 
work stoppage which occurred last February at the port of 
Vancouver. To better understand the scope and the reasons of 
this bill, we must go back in time.
<P>
	On January 27, in Vancouver, representatives of the 
Longshoremen's Union and management failed to come to an 
agreement. The union decided to go on legal strike at the port of 
Chemainus on Vancouver Island. Two days later, on January 29, 
management reacted by imposing a lock-out. On February 8, 
that is 10 or 11 days later, the Minister of Human Resources 
Development had this House pass Bill C-10 forcing 
longshoremen back to work. That bill imposed a settlement of 
the labour dispute. It provided for the appointment of an 
arbitrator to whom both parties where to submit their final 
offers. He would then choose one of the two which would be the 
new collective agreement.
<P>
	This way of doing things is contrary to the bargaining process 
since it totally rejects one of the two offers. The object of 
bargaining is to find a compromise fair to both parties.
<P>
	At the time, my colleague from Mercier had proposed an 
amendment which would have made the bill more in keeping 
with the spirit of collective bargaining. She was proposing to let 
the arbitrator choose parts of both offers to construct a final 
offer which would contain elements proposed by both parties. 
As I said, the essence of bargaining is finding the right 
compromise.
<P>
	The amendment of my colleague from Mercier was rejected 
by the Liberals opposite who argued that their basic idea was the 
best, and rejected also by Reformers who considered that this 
bill did not go far enough. They will correct me if I am wrong, 
but I believe that the bill before us today espouses the same 
logic. They want to settle once and for all labour disputes 
affecting the export of grain.
<P>
<B>(1800) </B>
<P>
	To this end, the bill proposes two measures. The first one is to 
forbid employees to strike and employers to lock them out, if 
this strike or lock-out would cause cessation of work by any 
employee whose work is essential to any stage of the progress of 
grain from the premises of the producer of the grain to export. 
The second one is to make grain transportation an essential 
service.
<P>
	This is the crux of the matter. Is grain transportation an 
essential service? You will understand that, for our part, we too 
are sticking to the same logic as last winter and spring by 
vigorously opposing this bill.
<P>
	By removing the right to strike and to lock out, bargaining 
powers are reduced to nothing. We recognize that grain export 
constitutes a special case. Last winter, the strike was having 
devastating consequences for western producers: the grain 
shipped to port could not be loaded on the 25 foreign ships 
waiting for their cargo. Some even sailed to an American port to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8275"> 8275 </A></B>
<P>
get their cargo. Obviously, when Canada does not meet its grain 
export  obligations, it has a serious impact on the industry. But 
we believe that this is not the way to solve the problem.
<P>
	Many strikes in this industry have ended in ad hoc legislation 
by the governement. Earlier today, I learned, much to my 
surprise, that since 1966, in 28 years, no less than 13 ad hoc bills 
have been passed in order to settle disputes in the port of 
Vancouver. This is an average of a little more than one ad hoc 
piece of legislation every two years. Serious questions have to 
be asked. What is happening there? What is the matter?
<P>
	Is management taking advantage of those employees? How 
come the federal government has had to intervene 13 times to 
settle directly a labour dispute? Mr. Speaker, this might make 
you smile, but I have a friend who is getting divorced for the 
sixth time. I told him: ``Listen, there is a problem. It is either 
you or the women you choose. Either you do not know how to 
choose your girlfriends or you are the problem''.
<P>
	Thirteen bills in 30 years, that denotes a serious problem. I 
suggest to members of the Reform Party that labour relations 
should probably be looked at. There is probably a problem in 
that famous seaport, if not in all the west coast harbours, 
because it is not normal to have labour strikes every two years.
<P>
	I have been on strike before, and I was proud of it. An 
employee on strike loses his salary. His ultimate goal when 
striking is to put an end to some injustice.
<P>
<B>(1805) </B>
<P>
	If an employee loses money, the employer should also lose 
money. I barely had time to say half of what I had in mind, but I 
will conclude by saying this: unfortunately, the Bloc Quebecois 
will vote with the government and against the Reform Party, 
because this bill does not agree with our policies.
<P>
	In Quebec, we know about essential services, and we 
associate them with hospital workers, firemen, and policemen, 
but not with seaports. If we were to let longshoremen become 
essential services, tomorrow it would be the bulk milk carriers, 
the day after, workers in feed mills, because people would say: 
``Oh, those poor cows, sheep, pigs and hens will have nothing to 
eat!''
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, obviously this does not make sense, members of 
the Bloc Quebecois will simply vote against this legislation and 
support the Liberal Party, in order to defeat the Private 
Members' bill presented by the hon. member for Lethbridge.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to address this bill today from the 
viewpoint of the farmer. I have farmed through all the years that 
we have had disruptions in the grain handling system.
<P>
	My career started in 1957. I farmed through about 10 years of 
fairly decent grain handling activities. We were without strikes 
until 1966. It amazes me when I hear members on the opposite 
side today saying how important it is to support labour and 
management. My colleague from Lethbridge never stressed that 
it was totally labour's fault that these strikes existed. There was 
probably some belligerence from the management side as well. 
The problem in the grain handling system probably lies with 
both management and labour.
<P>
	The first strike in 1966 was at a time when farmers had no 
grain drying facilities. I remember very well how the grain was 
backed up in 1966. We had decent weather to combine but we did 
not dare combine because the grain was tough and damp. We had 
to leave that number one quality wheat out in the field until the 
weather cooled enough so that we could store it. This is what 
happens to the farmer in the grain handling system when we 
have labour and management disagreeing.
<P>
	By 1972 we had had backups on grain. There were good crops. 
I remember very well that in 1971 I bought three bushels of 
barley for $1 because there was no movement in grain. I bought 
numbered wheat at 70 cents a bushel to feed to my cattle 
operation.
<P>
	Grain farmers did not know what to do with their top quality 
grain. That was the first time in my life that I had ever heard of 
farmers going bankrupt. It was not due to the farmers nor to their 
efficiency or work habit. It was due to unions and management 
not agreeing on a set price.
<P>
	In 1971, grain handlers got a 66 per cent increase in wages. 
Farmers were selling their grain for one-third of the price that 
they should have had. If that is treating people fairly, I never 
want to be discriminated against.
<P>
<B>(1810) </B>
<P>
	The hon. member for Saskatoon-Dundurn, who is a lawyer 
by profession, suggested that there is third party liability in this 
situation. If two cars driving by his home were involved in an 
accident, rolled into his house and his house burned, who would 
pay for it? Would the hon. member pay for it? I bet he would not. 
That is what farmers have put up with for 30 years.
<P>
	The Liberals will get no feathers in their hat because they 
have had as many strikes during their reign as the Conservatives.
<P>
	If this country is going to survive, the primary producers of 
our products must be treated fairly. If that does not occur 
something is going to happen. Hon. members should remember 
that in 1995 GATT will come into effect. The western Canadian 
grain farmer will have the opportunity to move his grain through 
the transportation system in the U.S.
<P>
	As the hon. Minister of Transport pointed out in his speech in 
Winnipeg in October, the United States transportation system is 
66 per cent more efficient than the Canadian system. The United 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8276"> 8276 </A></B>
<P>
States primary elevator  system and terminal system is less than 
half as costly as the Canadian system.
<P>
	If farmers do not get a decent deal through this bill, in 1995 
farmers are definitely going to move their grain through a 
system outside this country. At that moment the people in the 
east can start floating their toy boats down the St. Lawrence 
seaway because that is all they will have. Farmers will not put up 
with that any longer.
<P>
	It is important that members opposite and members of the 
Bloc realize that if we do not give fair treatment to the people on 
the land who are being discriminated against, those people will 
no longer support them.
<P>
	Any political system that allows its primary food producers to 
go down the drain will itself follow quickly. The slightest blip in 
the economy will force grain prices down. The 20 per cent of 
farmers who produce 80 per cent of the food today will be gone. 
I want to see hon. members on the other side at that time try to 
import food with a dollar that is worthless.
<P>
	It is time that we as members of Parliament and the 
government start addressing the real issues, not the superficial 
issues. If we do not protect our food industry we will see 
something happen that this Parliament will wish it had never 
seen.
<P>
	Mr. Whelan, the former minister of agriculture, said that we 
have lost 100 food manufacturing plants in the last 10 years. 
That tells me that something is very wrong in our system. If that 
continues another three or four years this country will lose its 
balance of payments to the point that we will not be able to pay 
the interest on the debt that Conservative and Liberal 
governments have put on the backs of our children and 
grandchildren.
<P>
	Today, instead of being partisan we should start agreeing and 
improving the system so that farmers can make a living and 
support the rest of this country.
<P>
<B>(1815 ) </B>
<P>
	The hon. member for Malpeque is a very strong supporter of 
supply management. If the grain producers do not get a fair deal, 
his supply management theory will be out the window.
<P>
	I wish I could impress on Parliament the seriousness of this 
problem. When I look at the Soviet Union today, which I visited 
after the coup in 1991, I see a country that has half the 
agricultural land in Europe, the oil of the Middle East and gold 
of South Africa, starving. It is an example of what happens when 
we allow the primary producer to go down the drain.
<P>
	I hope that Parliament has enough logic and sense to start 
dealing with these issues. When I see statistics that show it takes 
the same amount of time to move a rail car from the prairies to 
Vancouver as it did in 1907 there is something wrong with our 
transportation system. It cannot be put on the backs of the 
farmers.
<P>
	When I see that charges at our elevators are four times as high 
as in the U.S. it is not the farmers' problem. When the taxes on 
our terminals are three and four times as high as they are in the 
U.S. that is not the problem of the farmers.
<P>
	I hope I have impressed on Parliament that there has to be a 
solution found to this inefficient, expensive system of grain 
handling because if we do not find it somebody will do it for us.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Bill C-262, an act to provide for the settlement of 
labour disputes affecting the export of grain is legislation which 
has been needed for many years in the often stormy climate 
affecting Canada's reliable supply of grain to the hungry world.
<P>
	I am pleased to rise in the House today to support this private 
member's bill. Shortly after the newly elected 35th Parliament 
was opened early this year, the people of Canada were asking us 
to do something about the prolonged strike of nine locals of the 
International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union 
known as the ILWU and the accompanying lockout by British 
Columbia Maritime Employers' Association representing 70 
different west coast companies.
<P>
	By the time this matter came before us, the economic impact 
of this major disturbance in the workplace had spread to some 
3,500 west coast grain handlers as well as approximately 200 
employees of railroads while the cycle of rail car movement also 
suffered major disruption.
<P>
	A great many prairie farmers whose grain was not yet being 
moved suffered major financial losses. Included were 
demurrage costs of some $10,000 per day for 26 ships in port 
plus the threat of even more demurrage for 38 ships due to arrive 
during that week and the next.
<P>
	The disrupted labour contract had been the subject of 
prolonged negotiating sessions from July through December 
1993, but rather than prompting a settlement the threat of strike 
erupted into job action at financial costs which were estimated 
as high as $300,000 per day for wheat alone.
<P>
	However, perhaps the greatest loss was to the reputation of the 
Canadian Wheat Board and the port of Vancouver as being 
reliable suppliers of grain.
<P>
	We should be aware that both our Canadian production of 
wheat and world demand for it are increasing. For example, 
according to figures supplied by the Canadian Grain 
Commission in its publication, ``Grain Statistics Weekly'', at 
the close of business January 9, 1994 farmers delivered 20,900 
tonnes of durum wheat; 95,700 tonnes of other wheat; 10,200 
tonnes of oats; 85,900 tonnes of barley; 71,100 tonnes of canola; 
6,400 
<P>

<B><A NAME="8277"> 8277 </A></B>
<P>
tonnes of flaxseed and over a tonne of rye for a total of 291,400 
tonnes, all for export.
<P>
<B>(1820) </B>
<P>
	But the previous week the totals were nearly three times as 
high; 912,900 tonnes, the vast majority also headed for export. 
International demand for wheat, especially among customers 
living around the Pacific rim is growing.
<P>
	According to a letter from the Canadian Wheat Board called 
``Grain Matters'': ``The Far East and Oceania, home to 3.2 
billion consumers, could account for 40 per cent of the world 
wheat trade by the end of the century. Population and income 
growth, increased urbanization and the resulting dietary shift 
away from rice, are expected to lead to greater use of wheat 
based products. Canada could secure as much as 30 per cent of 
this market''.
<P>
	Such growth in both Canadian productivity of wheat and 
growth in Pacific rim demand for that wheat could be good news 
for farmers and for the Canadian economy as a whole. We must 
ask ourselves what happens in corporate board rooms around the 
Pacific rim when chief executive officers and boards of 
directors see shipments expected from Canada being delayed for 
two weeks or more due to a labour dispute?
<P>
	Unlike a current TV commercial for coffee, those ships 
cannot simply be turned around en route. Instead they sit in port 
while we pay penalties called demurrage. According to figures 
supplied from both the department of agriculture and the 
department of human resources the Japanese cancelled some of 
their barley orders for April over the strike in January. 
Unfulfilled or seriously delayed orders cause serious damage to 
the willingness of our customers to buy from us, if they can 
possibly obtain sufficient grain for their needs in either 
Australia or the United States.
<P>
	Nor was the grain handling disruption in January this year a 
one time occurrence. On the contrary. The need to settle grain 
handling disputes has been the most prominent issue requiring 
recent federal back-to-work legislation, starting with the West 
Coast Ports Operation Act, providing for the resumption and 
continuation of longshoring and grain handling operations, 
rushed through Parliament on August 31 and September 1, 1972 
and even earlier on the St. Lawrence in 1966.
<P>
	From then onward until earlier this year the list reads like a 
sad litany to mourn the failure of the labour negotiation process 
as regards this perishable commodity: in 1974, 1975, 1976, 
1982, 1986, 1988, 1991 and again in 1994.
<P>
	In part the blame must lie with the excessive taxes caused by a 
quarter century of excessively high peacetime federal 
government budgets. As proof of these excessive taxes, in 
British Columbia tax freedom day according to the Fraser 
Institute has advanced 49 days during that period of time until in 
1994 the average B.C. worker must put in fully half a year's 
wages to pay his taxes before he can finally draw a full breath 
and start to work for himself and his family on the first day of 
July.
<P>
	Seeing less and less of his pay cheque being left to spend on 
the necessities of life for himself and his family, at the same 
time as the prices of goods have been relentlessly driven 
upwards by the same causes, the average employee wants a 
bigger pay cheque when it comes time to negotiate a new 
contract.
<P>
	Likewise, British Columbia employers continue to be saddled 
not only with the highest personal income taxes in Canada on the 
profits, but also as business people with high levels of taxes not 
related to profits, including business licences and insurance, 
plus premiums paid for things like unemployment insurance and 
workers' compensation.
<P>
	These factors, influencing both sides of labour negotiations, 
make it harder and harder for all employers and all employees to 
readily reach new terms once an existing contract expires.
<P>
<B>(1825 ) </B>
<P>
	Given the size of our federal debt, now in excess of $530 
billion, it is clear that high taxes are not going to go away in the 
near future. It must also be clear that we need a new method for 
settling disputes such as the one involving west coast grain 
handlers whose economic consequences are so widespread. 
Indeed many members of Parliament, including myself, have 
received representations from the elevator operators asking that 
some long term resolution of their dispute be legislated as it has 
become apparent that the present system simply does not work.
<P>
	My fellow members of Parliament in the Reform Party caucus 
and I voted in favour of the government's back to work 
legislation last February with the understanding that a long term 
solution must be found so that the federal government need not 
continue to interfere on a case by case basis in the collective 
bargaining process.
<P>
	It was therefore with a great sense of relief that I first read this 
private member's bill, C-262. It lays down a simple method of 
settling future disputes precisely along the lines employed in the 
government's back to work legislation earlier this year as 
embodied in Bill C-10 passed on February 8. The only 
difference I can see between the actual dispute settlement 
mechanisms outlined in private member's bill C-262 and the 
government's Bill C-10 is that C-262 asked an appointed 
arbitrator to make his recommendations within 60 days, but 
allows the arbitrator to appeal to the minister for a longer time if 
needed, whereas Bill C-10 starts with 90 days instead of 60.
<P>
	Both of these bills use the last best offer method of dispute 
settlement whereby either the final offer of the union or the final 
offer of the employer's association must be accepted in its 
entirety for matters on which the two have not previously been 
able to agree. However, nothing in the legislation would prevent 
the two parties from negotiating peacefully together and possi-
<P>

<B><A NAME="8278"> 8278 </A></B>
<P>
bly never needing to use the new legislation at all. It would be in 
place if it were needed rather than requiring Parliament  to once 
again rush to interfere if the two parties should again find 
themselves unable to sign a collective agreement and the 
shipment of grain again become jeopardized.
<P>
	In view of the widespread and long term economic 
consequences of possible future disruptions in handling 
Canadian grain, I hope that all members of this House who 
joined together in support of government Bill C-10 will once 
again be able to join together to support Bill C-262.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Malpeque, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
listened with interest to the remarks by members opposite on 
Bill C-262, especially the remarks by the member for 
Lisgar-Marquette. I recognize full well the impact that labour 
and management problems, whether in the railway system or on 
the west coast, have on the farm community. In fact I have been 
involved in a lot of those disputes over the years.
<P>
	I think there are ways of resolving those issues through better 
labour management negotiations other than what this bill 
proposes. I believe this bill puts too much of the burden on the 
labour side of the equation rather than on equality between the 
two. I think it is possible to have labour and management come 
together. I know as a member on the government side that I will 
certainly be encouraging the Minister of Human Resources 
Development to look at ways of resolving disputes before they 
get to the stage where the system shuts down.
<P>
	I remember one time I was involved in a dispute where we as a 
farm organization met with labour. We knew they were going to 
go on strike in July. The end of the crop year is July 31. We were 
able to talk to them and prevent them from taking that kind of 
action prior to the end of the crop year because prices were going 
down at the end of the crop year.
<P>
	It is possible to find other ways to resolve labour disputes and 
we will be working at that as a government in coming years.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The time provided for the 
consideration of Private Members' Business has now expired. 
Pursuant to Standing Order 93 the order is dropped to the bottom 
of the order of precedence on the Order Paper.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It being 6.30 p.m. and since there are no members to take part 
in the proceedings on the adjournment motion, this House stands 
adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 
24.
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 6.30 p.m.)
