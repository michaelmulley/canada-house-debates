</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise 
to present a petition from people in Peterborough who are 
concerned about the people of Iraq. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whereas ongoing UN sanctions against Iraq regarded as the most 
stringent ever imposed by the United Nations have devastated the 
Iraq economy and resulted in the deaths of over one million 
civilians, many of them children, and whereas article 2 of the 
United Nations charter states that “all member states shall 
settle their international disputes by peaceful means in such a 
manner that international peace, security, and justice, are not 
endangered”, the petitioners call upon the Parliament of Canada 
to strongly appeal to the United Nations, to the United States 
and to Britain for a rejection of any further military action 
against Iraq. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They call for a serious attempt at peace negotiation with Iraq 
and its neighbours.  Further, in order to build a stable and 
sustainable society in Iraq, excluding an embargo on military 
materials, they request that all other sanctions be lifted.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to present under Standing Order 36 a petition signed 
by a number of Canadians including some from my own riding of 
Mississauga South on the subject of human rights.  The 
petitioners would like to draw to the attention of the House that 
human rights abuses continue around the world in countries such 
as Indonesia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners also point out that Canada continues to enjoy 
the recognition internationally as being the champion of 
internationally recognized human rights.  They therefore call 
upon parliament and indeed the Government of Canada to continue 
to condemn those who perpetrate human rights abuses and to seek 
to bring to justice those responsible for such abuses.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, 
NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is my honour to present a petition 
pursuant to Standing Order 36 on behalf of a number of 
constituents from the great city of Kamloops. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They point out a number of concerns they have with the fact that 
the Government of Canada signs international trade agreements 
which lock the hands of future governments in terms of making 
decisions on behalf of a variety of issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not elaborate but the petition goes on at some length in 
terms of what these concerns are.  Essentially they are asking 
parliament to look into the matter.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>QUESTIONS ON THE ORDER PAPER

<P><A NAME="LINK27"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we will 
respond today to Questions Nos. 170 and 172. 
.[Text] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Question No. 170—<B>Mr. Guy St-Julien:</B> 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Concerning children who have contracted the hepatitis C virus 
from blood transfusions at birth, what provisions does the 
federal government intend to make in order to: (<I>a</I>) ensure a 
decent future for these children; (<I>b</I>) ensure that required 
medical services can be obtained in a province other than the 
child's province of residence; and (<I>c</I>) reimburse travel 
expenditures incurred to obtain these medical services since the 
blood transfusion? 
</UL>
<P><A NAME="LINK28"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Canada's health 
system provides high quality health care services in every 
jurisdiction to adults and children alike. Children who were 
infected with hepatitis C through the blood system will continue 
to have access to these services no matter where they live in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On September 18, 1998, the federal Minister of Health proposed 
to provinces and territories, a comprehensive set of hepatitis C 
initiatives. Recognizing that the provision of health care, 
including travel arrangements, falls within the jusrisdiction of 
provinces and territories, this proposal included an offer of up 
to $300 million in transfers over 20 years to help provinces and 
territories pay for needed medical care so that people who were 
infected with hepatitis C through the blood system are ensured 
access to the treatments they need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Question No. 172—<B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom:</B> 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the Canadian Lama and Alpaca Association, which 
has been incorporated under the Animal Pedigree Act in respect of 
a distinct breed, entitling it to issue certificates of 
registration:  what actions, if any, has the Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food taken to ensure that the association is 
not issuing, and has not issued, certificates of identification, 
which can only be issued by an association incorporated in 
respect of an evolving breed? 
</UL>
<P><A NAME="LINK29"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, 
Lib.):</B>  The Canadian Lama and Alpaca Association, CLAA, was 
incorporated in 1989 under the Animal Pedigree Act in respect of 
lama and alpaca as distinct breeds.  The act establishes that a 
certificate of registration is the correct document to be issued 
for distinct breeds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of questions raised by a member of the CLAA, the 
animal registration officer looked into which types of 
certificates were being issued.  The association was notified in 
writing on December 17, 1997 that they should be issuing 
certificates of registration on all future animals registered 
with the association. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The department was informed in a letter dated April 6, 1998 that 
the CLAA board of directors had agreed to change the certificates 
and was proceeding with redesigning them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The animal registration officer met with the CLAA president and 
general manager in Calgary on June 30, 1998 to discuss this and 
related matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The animal registration officer obtained a draft version of the 
new certificate on December 9, 1998.  The registration officer 
has noted that changes to the draft are required and is following 
up the association.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>GRAIN HANDLING 
</H4><P align=left>

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The Chair has an application for an 
emergency debate from the hon. member for Selkirk—Interlake. 
<P><A NAME="LINK32"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is the responsibility and the duty of all elected MPs 
in this great country of Canada to debate and discuss issues of 
national importance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is particularly important that we debate and discuss issues 
where serious financial harm is happening and where that 
financial harm leads to dysfunctional families, to harm to 
children going to school, and these sorts of things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The emergency debate I am asking for today involves the stoppage 
of the grain movements out of the port of Vancouver due to strike 
action and the unwillingness of other employees on the docks to 
cross those picket lines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The seriousness of the situation is compounded due to the 
serious financial situation that many farmers find themselves in 
due to no fault of their own.  I speak here of foreign subsidies 
that drive commodity prices down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result, it is of paramount importance that members of the 
House express what is happening in their ridings and give the 
government an opportunity to speak to the situation and reassure 
Canadians and farmers that in fact we in this elected House are 
doing our job and taking care of their well-being. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask under Standing Order 52 that I be granted permission 
to have this emergency debate tonight immediately following the 
normal business of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to speak 
to the application for an emergency debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  No.  I am afraid that the rules 
provide that the member who has asked for the emergency debate is 
entitled to say a few words and that is it.  The Chair then is 
expected to rule on whether or not there will be an emergency 
debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the circumstances the Chair 
has considered the hon. member's request.  While the hon. member 
raises certain points that are valid, in the Chair's opinion the 
request does not meet the exigencies of the standing order at 
this time and accordingly the request is denied.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast, Ref.)</B> 
moved: 
<A NAME="LINK37">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of 
this House, the government has failed to deliver criminal justice 
programs and laws that reflect the will and concerns of the 
majority of Canadians, including issues like child pornography, 
young offenders, impaired driving, conditional sentencing, drug 
trafficking, home invasions, police funding, consecutive 
sentencing, corrections facilities and illegal immigration, and 
as a consequence, have put individual safety, and in some cases 
national security, in jeopardy. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Since today is the final allotted day 
for the supply period ending March 26, 1999, the House will go 
through the usual procedures to consider and dispose of the 
supply bills later this day.  In view of recent practices, do 
hon. members agree that the bills be distributed now? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  With the exception of the mover of the motion, the member 
for West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast, all other members of the 
Reform Party will be dividing their time during today's debate. 
<P><A NAME="LINK38"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to introduce this motion on behalf 
of the Reform Party, Her Majesty's Official Opposition, and to 
lead off debate on an issue that concerns and even scares a lot 
of Canadians, the current state of our criminal justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a recent publication by a University of Ottawa law professor, 
the chief assertion of the work was that Canada's system of 
criminal justice is undergoing a public credibility crisis of 
dangerous proportions.  That was stated by a law professor who is 
well respected in Canada.  It is not the Reform Party saying 
that.  This is a law professor who has spent his life in this 
work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This should not come as a surprise to the government.  Maybe 
today after this debate and the sharing of information which 
should take place we can expect some change.  I say that in all 
sincerity, but after watching this government I really wonder. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today members will have an opportunity to hear from colleagues 
on our side of the House who are involved in the justice area, 
from members of other parties and from the government.  We can 
only hope that the government will have a change of heart and 
start looking seriously at the criminal justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's criminal justice system has become a series of 
technicalities, plea bargains, defence by psychologists, law by 
judges and outright misrepresentation by lawyers and the courts 
of the consequences of a sentence.  We all know by now that a ten 
year sentence really means three years.  Why not say it and quit 
adding to the cynicism that already exits in the Canadian public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each day newspaper headlines scream out another example of a 
criminal justice system out of control.  Headlines like “Legal 
System Getting Away with Murder”, “Child Porn Flooding into 
British Columbia”, “B.C. Justice Strikes Down Law Against Child 
Porn”, “Conditional Sentence Granted in Murder of Husband”, 
“Man Who Killed Mother is Free to Go”, “Canada Fertile Land 
for the Mob”, “RCMP Budget will Undermine Its Work” and 
“Fewer Police Today Per Capita Than 20 Years Ago” are appearing 
in our newspapers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think members get the picture.  It is a litany of articles and 
stories contrary to what we might expect in this country.  We 
have to ask ourselves:  Are we protecting our citizens and meting 
out justice or protecting the guilty and providing injustice? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today the Reform Party motion will identify the concerns and 
fears of many Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today the House will hear about the legality of child 
pornography in British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will hear about the release of pedophiles into the community 
because of the insensitive if not bizarre Shaw ruling.  We will 
hear how these individuals are free to prey on our children with 
the blessing of the court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will hear about the new youth criminal justice bill which 
refuses to acknowledge what is fundamentally wrong with youth 
justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will hear about what are known as conditional sentences; that 
is, where murderers, rapists and other perpetrators of violent 
crime spend their sentences in the community rather than in 
prison.  It is a novel idea.  They put a bullet in the head of 
their sleeping husband and they get to move to British Columbia 
to enjoy the mountains and the scenery.  It is like winning the 
lottery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will also hear about people who live in fear of home invasion 
and hostage taking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will hear about impaired drivers and the carnage they are 
leaving in their wake.  There is no compelling initiative in the 
Criminal Code to deal with them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will hear about cutbacks in RCMP funding, of the closing of 
the training centre and what this means to our personal safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will hear about our borders, the gateway for every crook and 
terrorist who wants a place to ply their trade.  Speakers from 
our side will tell the House how these illegals look upon Canada 
as the promised land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will also hear of the intransigence of the Liberal government 
and its failure to deal with consecutive sentencing, despite a 
private member's bill by one of its own MPs calling for change.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will hear about drug trafficking and the inability to police 
it due to cutbacks in resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will hear about the state of our correctional facilities and 
how, if one pulls the right strings, they can bring their polo 
pony or play a leisurely 18 holes of golf.  I hasten to add that 
one first has to bludgeon and shoot his wife to death for this 
type of royal treatment.  Petty criminals need not apply.  This 
is reserved for the truly heinous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members can see, this is a smorgasbord of crime and supposed 
punishment.  It is a litany of indignity, abuse of the system and 
no retribution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Allow me to begin with the issue of child pornography. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following the B.C. supreme court ruling by Justice Duncan Shaw 
striking down section 163.14 of the Criminal Code, concerning 
child pornography, as unconstitutional because the rights of 
freedom of expression of John Robin Sharpe were violated and, as 
the ruling states “a person's possessions are an expression of a 
person's thoughts and essential self”, I kept asking myself the 
same question, when is infringement of these charter rights— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I need some clarification from you, Mr. Speaker, with regard to 
the issue of speaking on topic.  The motion before the House has 
to do with the defence of provocation.  We are now talking about 
child pornography.  I think we need clarification because it 
could influence the debate for the rest of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I am sorry, but the motion before the 
House today lists a string of matters of legal concern.  The hon. 
member for West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast is discussing matters 
relating to our legal system.  Anyone is going to be hard-pressed 
to call him on a question of relevance given the wording of the 
motion before the House today.  There is a long list of legal 
items in it and I think the hon. member for West 
Vancouver—Sunshine Coast is not straying too far from the topic 
at the moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank you for that.  It 
is amazing that the member opposite would rise on a point of 
order if he had looked at the motion.  Possibly he has not read 
it.  It states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government has failed to 
deliver criminal justice programs and laws that reflect the will 
and concerns of the majority of Canadians, including issues like 
child pornography... 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what I am speaking about right now and it is what I will 
continue to speak about.  It may be very painful for members on 
the other side to listen to these things, but Canadians are 
concerned about them and that is why my party is debating these 
issues today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of Shaw, the justice determined that the essential 
self of John Robin Sharpe was invaded.  Shaw determined that the 
right to privacy is so profound that it is not outweighed by the 
limited beneficial effects of the prohibition of child 
pornography.  Some may argue that the judgment may not always 
mean justice.  This crucible we employ to render determination is 
fallible and sometimes so arcane that any scintilla of common 
sense seems lacking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Justice Shaw spoke of essential self I would take it to 
mean the worth, dignity and intrinsic value we place on our being 
and that of others.  I would take it to mean our right to peace, 
security and self-determination.  I would take it to mean our 
right to live without fear of reprisal and that any harm brought 
upon us, particularly by those in a position to manipulate or 
destroy that vulnerable human spirit that is present in the 
young, would be met with condemnation and swift justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why so many Canadians view the Shaw decision as a 
failure in rendering justice that protects individuals least able 
to protect themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I am not dealing with relevance.  I just want to bring to the 
attention of the House that this House has for many years 
followed closely the provisions of what we call the sub judice 
rule.  The matter that the hon. member is discussing now is a 
matter involving the criminal law, an individual who has been 
charged and the matter is still at process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge upon the House to have regard for the provisions of the 
sub judice convention so that the ability of the courts to deal 
with this matter fairly and properly and the rights of the 
individual involved before the courts are not prejudiced by the 
public debate here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask our Chair to direct his attention to that. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1025"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The Chair cannot know all the cases 
that are before the courts in this country and which ones members 
are commenting on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is clear is that there is a rule which requires that 
members refrain from comment on cases that are before the courts, 
particularly criminal cases, where comments might be ones that 
tend to prejudice the outcome of the legal proceedings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a discussion today in the House on matters of criminal 
law primarily, if I can lump the various items of discussion 
together, and using that word without in any way prejudicing the 
discussion or limiting the terms of the motion that the 
opposition has put before the House today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would urge hon. members to have a look at Beauchesne's, at the 
sub judice rule as stated in that work, and bear it in mind in 
the course of their comments today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that hon. members would not want to prejudice the outcome 
of legal proceedings in our courts.  I know that in their debate 
today they will exercise the usual temperance and prudence as 
befits members of the House.  I thank the hon. member for 
Scarborough—Rouge River for drawing the rule to our attention. 
I know the hon. member will be careful in what he says and I hope 
that we will be able to carry on that way all day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
You just referred to temperance.  I noted that the member for 
Prince George—Peace River, who has since left the house, was 
using intemperate language.  He referred to our country, Canada, 
as this bloody country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask him to withdraw that remark 
and to refrain from using such intemperate language in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  If the hon. member were here, perhaps 
I would be able to do something like that.  He seems to have 
disappeared for the moment.  Here he is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the hon. member would refrain from using such 
intemperate language in the House.  I did not hear the remark, 
but I know that no hon. member would want to speak that way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is quite interesting 
when we get on this topic how sensitive the government is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member knows that what I am talking about is a case that has 
already been before the court.  There is an appeal going on.  I 
am not trying to influence it.  I am talking about a case that 
happened and he knows that.  It is quite legitimate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To hear the other member complain about my colleague saying 
something about Canada when yesterday government members were 
calling us “not Canadians” because of the way we voted is 
shameful.  They have no shame left at all.  They are so arrogant 
and they will probably keep on interrupting me throughout my 
whole speech because of that arrogance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me continue.  Those parents, and for that matter anyone with 
any degree of compassion for the sanctity of the human spirit and 
life, cannot be faulted in concluding that some individuals with 
bizarre lifestyles and values want more acknowledgement by the 
courts as opposed to those who fall within the mainstream of 
values and lifestyles.  Some, it appears, have more right to 
freedom of conscience than others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As in the case of any court decision, let alone a controversial 
one like the Shaw decision, there are ramifications.  Decisions 
are not made to go into a void.  There is a fallout and there are 
long term consequences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In British Columbia there have been two very real consequences. 
Because of the Shaw decision two other individuals charged with 
possession of child pornography have had their cases dismissed. 
Some 36 other cases are pending and the lower courts hearing 
these cases have no alternative but to throw them out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Shaw's decision guarantees the legality of the possession of 
child pornography until the court of appeal rules in late April. 
For now British Columbia is the only province where the 
possession of child pornography is legal, and that is not right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The assertion by the federal Minister of Justice that things are 
under control and prosecutions for possession are continuing is 
simply not true.  For now it is open season for pedophiles in 
British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Five days following the Shaw decision a group of 63 Liberal MPs 
and six Liberal senators began a campaign of protest against the 
Shaw decision.  The 69 signatories to an open letter to their 
leader, the Prime Minister, called child pornography a product of 
crime.  They called it sexual abuse of children and the work of 
pedophiles.  They stated that the federal government has no 
greater responsibility than the protection of children by those 
who prey on their innocence and their inability to protect 
themselves.  They even went so far, in closing a paragraph in 
their missive to the Prime Minister, as to call for new child 
pornography legislation and for the Prime Minister to consider 
using the notwithstanding clause to ensure the charter will never 
again be used to defend the sexual abuse of Canada's children.  A 
very realistic view of the situation and a reasonable request of 
the Prime Minister.  Unfortunately, empty in honour and resolve 
and a cruel hoax on children as events would prove themselves 13 
days later.

</I></B></P><P align=left>On February 2 these same Liberal MPs were asked to stand in the 
House and give a meaning of support to their previous 
protestations.  They were asked to support a Reform Party motion 
calling for the reinstatement of child pornography laws in 
British Columbia, even if it meant using the very clause of the 
Constitution Act which they implored the PM to use two weeks 
before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When push came to shove, 59 of this virtuous group of Liberal 
MPs abandoned any notice of the vulnerability of children and 
their victimization at the hands of pedophiles.  Four had the 
resolve and did what they said they would do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The task assigned our police in the interdiction of child 
pornography is a mess.  That is why the Shaw decision makes it 
even more frustrating for those charged with policing and 
reducing the proliferation of child pornography, particularly its 
dissemination on the Internet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In British Columbia's case police can intercede and confiscate 
child pornography but cannot prosecute.  The unregulated Internet 
has become the vehicle of choice and 20% of all traffic is 
generated by traceable kiddy porn web sites. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a recently released RCMP intelligence report British Columbia 
is identified as the only province where child pornography is a 
serious concern for law enforcement agencies.  Is that not a 
cruel irony in light of the Shaw decision and its concern for 
essential person rights for pedophiles? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those individuals involved in this pernicious behaviour, hiding 
behind the charter of rights, are attempting to systematically 
normalize sexual immorality and the Shaw decision gives them that 
licence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Herbert London, professor of humanities at the University of New 
York, said morality is not subjective but is a prerequisite for 
ordered society.  Those who want the transmogrify of value system 
to which the majority of Canadians subscribe are an anathema to 
decency and respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will turn now to another tragic example of Liberal government 
intransigence and dismissal of public concern.  Last week we were 
treated to the long awaited changes to the Young Offenders Act. 
The new criminal act will be called the youth criminal justice 
act but despite this high sounding phrase it really will not 
change things a lot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some glaring omissions and some glaring shortcomings 
to this act.  I will identify some of those.  First there is the 
limitation of the publication of names for certain offences 
classified as adults. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill limits these to five situations:  murder, attempted 
murder, manslaughter, aggravated sexual assault and repeat 
serious violent offences.  This leaves a lot of violent and 
frightening offences out of the loop. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the Reform Party, and for that matter an all party 
committee recommendation, called for the lowering of the maximum 
age of youth offenders from 17 to 15. We did not get this and I 
am surprised the minister would not address it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, there has been a consistent call from all quarters 
dealing with young offenders to have the minimum age of offenders 
lowered to 10 years from 12.  Again, the committee of this House 
and the minister's own justice department years and years ago 
called for this reduction.  So has a private member's bill from 
one of my colleagues but we have never seen that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opting out provisions are also a concern for us.  Simply 
put, there has to be universality in the provisions of the law, 
period.  We also question the federal government's commitment to 
financial resources to youth justice.  The announcement of $206 
million is over a three year period.  The federal government has 
never met its 50:50 cost sharing in the youth justice area and 
this money will hardly make up for that shortfall. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I go back to the point of the 10 to 12 year olds because I was 
never so shocked, the day that bill was introduced, to see the 
Minister of Justice talking about Reformers wanting to put 10 and 
11 year old children in jail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  That's true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds:</B>  The parliamentary secretary said it is 
true.  I will tell her it is an absolute lie.  Nobody in this 
party has ever said we want to put a 10 or 11 year old in jail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The hon. member will not want to 
start using that word.  I think he knows it tends to disorder in 
the House and I invite him to refrain from such use.  I do not 
think he was accusing any hon. member of lying from what I heard 
but I would prefer he not use the word.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would never impute 
another member with telling a lie but I would tell anyone 
listening that anyone who says the Reform Party wants to put 10 
and 11 year olds in jail is not telling the truth.  This party 
and the justice committee want to see 10 and 11 year olds in the 
system where they can be looked after to make sure they do not 
become young offenders and get involved in the system.  That is 
what everybody wants. We want them in the system.  The provinces 
want them in the system so they can get the funding from the 
federal government which it does not want to put in. That is what 
this system is about in terms of 10 and 11 year olds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government wants to put no money into it.  It does not want 
to help the provinces help these poor 10 and 11 year olds who are 
in this system.  That is what it is all about and that is why the 
Liberals throw out the false claims about who wants to put who in 
jail.  I have never in my life seen anything so low for a justice 
minister.  I hope they will withdraw what they are saying in that 
area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  You want to cane us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we hear someone from 
across yelling that we want to cane them. What a sad day in 
Canada when we have members here talking about caning and putting 
people in jail when we are trying to get a system that works. 
This government, which will not fund the Young Offenders Act 
properly, has not done it properly.  That is why we have problems 
in this country.  It is just like the health program.  It is 
supposed to be funded 50% by this government but it is doing 20% 
and 14%.  It has made a mess of it and it tries to blame it on 
the opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I think my hon. friend has made an error in his comment. He was 
suggesting that funding for health care was 50:50.  Is he 
suggesting that the government is not holding up its end? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I am afraid the hon. member knows 
that is not a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds:</B>  Mr. Speaker, if the member took it 
from me to say that the government was funding at 50:50 I 
apologize to him and to Canadians.  I was saying it should be 
funding at 50:50 and it is not doing it.  In my province it is 
about 14%.  In Ontario it is even less.  It has messed up the 
health care system which gets these 10 and 11 year olds into 
crime, and it cannot stand that.  It cannot take the heat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I thought the hon. member was the critic for justice, not the 
critic for health.  I thought the topic today was justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I am afraid that with these points of 
order that are not points of order we are getting into some 
difficulty.  The hon. member was discussing the motion before we 
started getting some spurious points of order.  The hon. member 
for West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast I know will want to return to 
the topic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I hope they will stop 
making these serious interruptions.  I hope you are not taking 
this out of my time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  It will be added on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds:</B>  Thank you very much, I appreciate it. 
Maybe now that they know that they will not get up as often. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me now tell them about the attorney general in Ontario. They 
love the Ontario government on that side of the House and they 
will love it even less when it wins a re-election in Ontario with 
a big majority.  This is what the attorney general of Ontario has 
to say about the Young Offenders Act: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ontario is concerned that under the new federal bill 16 and 17 
year olds who commit adult crimes are not automatically tried as 
adults. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a serious issue that most Canadians think of. Most 
justice ministers across Canada have asked this government to 
address this issue but it has not addressed it: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even for murder, aggravated sexual assault, manslaughter and 
attempted murder there is no guarantee that youths will be 
sentenced as an adult. Even on the third rape charge, there is no 
guarantee of an adult sentence. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the kind of change we are trying to make in this bill. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most serious violent offences still require the prosecutor to 
prove an adult sentence is necessary; jail sentences have been 
reduced; youths sentenced as adults for murder are still subject 
to more lenient periods of parole ineligibility than adults 
sentenced for murder; mandatory jail time is not required for 
youths convicted of an offence involving a weapon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This could result in a 17 year old who commits first degree 
murder or other violent crimes still being treated as a child. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“Under this new act, a three time rapist could still be treated 
as a child.  Rape, drug trafficking, guns—these are adult crimes 
and have to be treated as such.  In the youth criminal justice 
act, there are no guarantees that serious violent crime will be 
treated as adult crime”, stated Mr. Harnick. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“What the people of Ontario have been asking for is legislation 
that will better protect our children and our communities, that 
will send a message to young people that they will be held 
accountable for their actions and would deter youth crime. 
Instead, the federal Liberal government has released a bill that 
has little regard for public safety and even less regard for 
providing meaningful consequences for criminal behaviour such as 
sexual assault, drug trafficking and use of a weapon”, said 
solicitor general and minister of correctional services, Bob 
Runciman. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“Many police officers and citizens across Ontario are 
frustrated with the Young Offenders Act because it seems 
primarily concerned with the rights of offenders”, explained 
York regional police Chief Julian Fantino. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“It's disappointing that the federal government won't take the 
opportunity to right this wrong and introduce a much tougher law 
to serve as an effective deterrent to youth crime”.

</I></B></P><P align=left>She did not complain about the stooge they had standing up at

should be changed. Hopefully we will do that in committee. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>“This new legislation is not only overdue, but also fails once 
again to protect society from dangerous and violent offenders”, 
said Garry Rosenfeldt, executive director of Victims of Violence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“Criminal behaviour of 16 and 17 year old youth will still 
remain in youth court, irrespective of their crime.  Thus one of 
the most profound and controversial loopholes within the justice 
system remains”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“In the new bill, the definition of serious violent offence is 
so vague that it is also almost useless.  Poll after poll has 
shown that 80% of Canadians have little or no confidence in the 
federal Young Offenders Act.  The new youth criminal justice act 
will do nothing to improve that.  It's a shame Ottawa refused to 
listen”. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the Ontario government.  It sure loves this bill, the 
one this government is bragging about, when it has done very 
little to help Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another issue in our criminal justice system that 
raises Canadian cynicism to new levels, the use of conditional 
sentencing.  I could go on for long.  It seems I have been 
interrupted so many times I am not getting this whole exercise 
in. Conditional sentencing is a serious issue and needs to be 
addressed.  One of my colleagues will talk in more detail about 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole issue in the justice system today is that this 
government is not listening.  It wants to blame the Reform Party, 
the NDP, the Bloc and the Conservatives for all the problems in 
the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals have had two elections since the Tories were 
defeated to straighten things out.  They still have not done it. 
They still do not have health care where it should be. The 
justice system is nowhere near what it should be and this is the 
government that has done that.  It has served its time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do those members do now?  They get arrogant.  If they 
present a bill, we are not good Canadians if we do not like it. 
If we hammer the justice bill, we are against all the good things 
that should happen in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have seven children and seven grandchildren.  I know what is 
happening in this country as much as any Liberal on that side 
with young people.  We need some changes in this law and we need 
them now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the government will listen when we get to committee, 
listen to what is happening in this debate today on the issues 
that are before us and make some serious changes in the areas of 
justice.  We need them and we need them bad. 
<P><A NAME="LINK39"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
member opened by saying he would deal with an issue that scares a 
lot of people.  Then he went on to build a whole case and to fuel 
the very point he was just making by trying to scare people in a 
very systematic and point by point way, painting the worst case 
situation in every possible point of view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the quotes, which I would like the member to add 
substance to, was “put a bullet in the head of your husband and 
you get a reward by moving to beautiful B.C. to enjoy the 
mountains and the oceans”.  I have to ask him, after I am 
finished my remarks, to comment on that and to flesh that out a 
little because it does not make any sense to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole issue of criminal justice and inner city safety is 
something I deal with every day.  I represent a riding in the 
inner city of Winnipeg that is rife with many of the problems 
touched on by the member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What strikes me is how there can be the same set of 
circumstances and two completely different views of how to deal 
with it.  We have heard Reform over the years, even prior to my 
coming here, on caning in Singapore.  That was one of my 
favourites.  Spanky and his gang was the term going around at 
that time.  I understand he is an expert on the subject. He even 
had a book on caning in Singapore.

</I></B></P><P align=left>During the 1997 election campaign when I was walking along the 
streets I could always tell when I was following the Reform 
candidate because people would be asking me about boot camps that 
would be introduced based on the American model. Reform is still 
advocating and promoting the whole idea of boot camps.  This is 
unbelievable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And longer prison sentences.  All conventional wisdom dealing 
with criminal justice has indicated that longer prison sentences 
do not do anything to deter the incidence of crime.  Reform 
members are dealing with an obsolete concept and fueling the 
fearmongering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the United States a whole generation of young black males 
were locked up because they were a nuisance.  Yes, they got them 
off the streets and the Americans are showing a decrease in 
crime.  I would argue that there is no connection between those 
two things. The reason there is a decrease in violent crime in 
many of the inner city communities is that they have the lowest 
unemployment rate since the second world war.  That is a way to 
slow down property crimes.  Crimes of that nature are a 
predictable consequence of poverty and unemployment and all of 
the other things we need to look at. There are two different 
views for the same set of circumstances.  The NDP would rather 
deal with the root causes of crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the member mean by stating that by putting a bullet in 
the head of her husband the woman gets rewarded by moving to 
beautiful British Columbia, which again is a subject of opinion, 
and enjoying the mountains and the ocean? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have lived in Winnipeg 
and it is a wonderful city, but if I had a choice I would rather 
be in British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the question regarding putting a bullet in his head and going 
to British Columbia, I do not have the newspaper clippings here 
but I will make sure they are delivered to the member's office 
very shortly. There was a woman in Ottawa whose husband who 
worked for the RCMP was lying in bed; she put two bullets in his 
head and obviously killed him.  She also killed the dog.  She 
received a conditional sentence and went to British Columbia 
where her children are. That was her sentence.  A conditional 
sentence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why I put the motion before the committee.  I will give 
the minister credit.  I have been asking for this to go to 
committee for quite a while.  The committee has not handled the 
problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Violent crimes of this type should not be given conditional 
sentences.  I think the woman would have received more time in 
jail had she been charged with just killing the dog. The SPCA 
would have created a big furore about it.  But she killed her 
husband and she is now in British Columbia. There are many cases 
like that. I was going to get into this when I talked about 
conditional sentencing but I ran out of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two gentlemen in Montreal were convicted of a brutal rape.  Both 
men were given conditional sentences because the judge felt they 
did not quite understand our justice system because it is not the 
same as the one where they were born.  They both have lived in 
Canada, one for nine years and the other for eleven years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what is wrong with conditional sentencing in this 
country.  The committee knows that.  There has been no movement 
by this government to get it into committee, speed it up and 
start to do something about that.  The parliamentary secretary 
gets very mad when I talk about these things, but that is our 
job. We are the opposition.  We point out the faults.  The system 
is not totally wrong, but there are some serious faults in the 
system and they have to be corrected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend from the NDP talked about boot camps.  I do not know 
if he has been to the one in Ontario but a lot of parents who 
have had kids go to this boot camp have written the government 
saying it was a great idea.  It certainly beats the Liberal idea 
of throwing them in jail.  The Liberals want to throw them all in 
jail.  Why not have a boot camp where they can get some education 
instead of putting people in jail. The Liberals want to put young 
people in jail. We want to put them in a facility where they can 
get an education and learn what it is like in society, not throw 
them in the present jail system which is underfunded and does not 
work properly because of this government and the government 
before it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been two parliamentary reports on penitentiaries in 
this country.  One was done in 1972, chaired by Mark MacGuigan, 
of which I was a member and which made recommendations.  The 
other was done in 1987.  Both the Tory government and the Liberal 
government have done nothing about those reports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We still have a rotten system and it is not working. Boot camps 
might have a place in our system.  I suggest that the member 
visit the one in Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my speech I did not get the chance to talk about prevention. 
There is no prevention.  We want to look at prevention to make 
sure these things do not happen.  That includes looking at 
poverty and unemployment about which the member talks. I agree 
with him.  They are serious issues.  We are not going to solve 
the other justice problems without solving unemployment and 
poverty issues.  We want to look at those issues too.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
noticed that the member focused all his attention on the 10% plus 
of violent offenders and that aspect of the new legislation. We 
know that at the moment, sadly, we incarcerate 25,000 young 
people a year.  Some of those of course are not in for the entire 
year, but putting a young person in some sort of confinement 
certainly is going to mark them for life.  That is four or five 
times the rate at which we incarcerate adults in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member talked about British Columbia and we have heard some 
discussion about Manitoba.  One of the lowest rates of 
incarceration I understand is in the province of New Brunswick. 
It has very successfully involved the community in sentencing, 
with pre-court handling of young offenders and more family 
involvement in dealing with young offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand that the province of New Brunswick has actually 
closed five or six prisons recently. Imagine the financial saving 
on the one hand, but also imagine the improvement in the people 
who are going through the justice system as a result of not 
spending unnecessary time in prison. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the member give some time now to discussing the 85% or 90% 
non-violent offenders who are the main people we are dealing 
with, who are the majority of these 25,000 young people we are 
putting into some sort of confinement every year?  Would he 
comment on the New Brunswick example as a model for the rest of 
the country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would be happy to talk 
about that.  I also suggest to my colleague that he look at 
Alberta, British Columbia and Quebec which have the three best 
records in Canada for young offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also find it very strange that the government side is getting 
up saying that we have 25,000 people in jail.  Who put them 
there?  The Liberals did.  They have had the chance to change the 
rules. They have not done it.  That is the whole point and they 
do not understand. The system we have right now came from the 
Liberals and the Tories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about a system that works with young people in 
the system.  Put some money into prevention.  There is no money 
from the government for prevention. The government is supposed to 
fund the Young Offenders Act 50:50. It is not doing it.  It is 
funding it 30%. There is no money for prevention.  There is no 
money from these Liberals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals will try to have us believe that it was the 
Reformers who put 25,000 people in jail.  The hon. member 
mentions 10%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish the parliamentary secretary would not use the word lie 
but she keeps on using it on that side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Eleni Bakopanos:</B>  I apologize. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds:</B>  She apologizes.  I will accept her 
apology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals are the government.  I have been on the government 
side where we can make laws.  They can make laws.  They are not 
making them.  They are talking about them.  They try to blame 
their faults on the opposition.  In this area it is not the 
opposition's fault.  We have been offering good solutions.  We 
want to offer prevention.  We think the money should be going 
into prevention.  It is not going there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will be bringing that out in the very near future with 
details on how we can prevent a lot of these crimes in Canada. 
Then we will see how serious the Liberals are about spending 
money on the real problems in this country.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Eleni Bakopanos (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
before I begin my formal remarks, I would like to talk about the 
type of visual reality of the justice system that would happen in 
this country if, God forbid, there ever was a Reform government. 
It would be a justice system based on the law of the jungle, an 
eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth, vigilante justice.  Call 
it what you may, Mr. Speaker, but that is exactly what the hon. 
member just indicated to us when he spoke in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion itself is reflective of that.  It does not matter 
what crime is committed in this country, let us get rid of the 
judges, let us get rid of due process of law, let us get rid of 
the lawyers, let us get rid of anything that comes between the 
irresponsible and fearmongering policy makers on the other side 
of the House and a justice system that has shown that it is one 
of the best in the world.  Let us forget of course about the fact 
that they want to criminalize, maybe not throw them in jail, but 
criminalize 10-year olds contrary to what the hon. member said. 
Let us look at what is the worst in society as the rule rather 
than the exception. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what Reform members have been saying in this House for 
the year and a half that I have been parliamentary secretary. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1055"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT11"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They talk about fearmongering and—I will not say 
lies—misinformation where irresponsible policy makers want to 
create a society where everyone has a gun and everyone shoots 
whenever anyone gets in the way.  That is exactly the type of 
society they want to promote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no such thing except the exception to the rule, 
continuously the exception to the rule to what happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe Canadians do not share that vision of our justice 
system.  Canadians do not have a wild west vigilante mentality in 
terms of this country's justice system. I do not believe that the 
type of justice system being promoted by Her Majesty's Official 
Opposition is the type of system Canadians in general want to 
have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe Canadians believe in the due process of law.  They 
believe in an individual having the right to a hearing before a 
judge and jury of his or her peers.  They believe our youth have 
to be given the help they need whenever they need it.  They also 
believe that their money should not be spent in creating more 
jails or incarcerating more people but by investing in 
rehabilitation. I also believe Canadians believe in compassion 
and in the respect of individual rights and freedoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are all the things this side of the House also believes 
in.  The fact that Canadians have given us a second mandate is 
indicative also that most Canadians do not believe the system the 
Reform Party is promoting is the type of justice system they want 
in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I would like to deal with one aspect of the motion.  The 
motion itself was a smorgasbord of whatever Reform has been 
discussing in this House over the last six years that I have been 
a parliamentarian.  I would like to deal with the youth criminal 
justice act which we recently introduced in this House and the 
government's broader strategy to renew the youth justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe the bill responds to the extensive consultations on 
the strategy for the renewal of youth justice which was released 
by the government on May 12, 1998 with concerned citizens, 
governments at all levels and other partners who want 
improvements to the youth justice system.  Canadians want to 
change the youth justice system and they want programs and 
resources to support those changes.  We propose to give them 
exactly that, despite what the hon. member said in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's strategy for the renewal of youth justice 
recognizes that the foremost objective is public protection. It 
distinguishes legislation and programs appropriate to a small 
group of violent young offenders and those appropriate for the 
vast majority of non-violent young offenders.  It takes a much 
broader, more integrated approach than the simplistic approach 
that is emphasized by the members in the opposition.  It also 
emphasizes prevention and rehabilitation. The strategy is based 
on three key directions that work together to better protect the 
public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First is prevention. The best way to protect the public, 
victims, families and youth, is to prevent crime in the first 
place.  I think we all agree on that. On June 2, 1998 the 
government launched a $32 million a year community based crime 
prevention initiative that includes children and youth as 
priorities.  Programs proposed by communities from one end of 
this country to the other are currently being funded to prevent 
youth crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Meaningful consequences is the number two priority.  Youth crime 
will be met with meaningful consequences.  But what is 
meaningful? It depends on the seriousness of the offence and the 
circumstances of the offender, something the opposition would 
like us not to take into account of course. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rehabilitation and reintegration.  A fundamental principle of 
Canada's youth justice system is that young offenders with 
guidance and support are more likely than adults to be 
rehabilitated and become law-abiding citizens. We on this side of 
the House truly believe and some members on the other side of the 
House also believe in programs that help to rehabilitate young 
offenders, protect the public, prevent further crimes and reflect 
society's commitment to youth. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to begin with what we plan to do to prevent youth from 
committing crimes.  This, in our opinion, is the best way to 
protect society, and to help youth at the same time, as we wish 
to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The way to accomplish this is to address the very causes of 
crime.  We must use every means at our disposal to battle 
poverty and child abuse, which are known to frequently lead to 
youth crime.

<A HREF="#LINKT12"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot wage this battle alone, however.  If we are to have a 
long term strategy addressing the causes of youth crime, we are 
aware that many others must be included: individuals, 
organizations, and in particular the provincial governments, 
which are involved in crime prevention, child welfare, mental 
health, education, social services, and employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Families, communities and victims will also have a role to play 
in this battle against youth crime, waged within the framework 
of the national community safety and crime prevention strategy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is spending $32 million a year to help Canadian 
communities set up the necessary programs and crime-prevention 
partnerships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Youth Criminal Justice Act will be the foundation for a 
renewed system of youth justice, but it is only one piece of the 
puzzle.  We all know that legislation, however harsh, will not 
stop young people from committing crimes and innocent people 
from becoming victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why we have included rehabilitation and reintegration 
into society in our bill. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation is an important element of a broader strategy 
for addressing the complex problem of youth crime.  The 
legislation provides an effective and flexible framework for 
youth justice and distinguishes approaches for violent offenders 
and the majority of less serious offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It includes overarching principles and sentencing principles 
which emphasize that the penalty must be proportionate to the 
seriousness of the offence.  It provides for greater protections 
of the rights of young accused while attending flexibility and 
streamlining procedures for the administrators of the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It includes a broader range of sentencing options, many of which 
reinforce important social values like requiring the youth to 
repair the harm caused by the offence.  It addresses flaws in the 
previous system and provides a balanced approach to the complex 
problem of youth crime, not the simplistic approach of the 
Reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know however that legislation alone will not reorient the 
justice system.  It needs to be supported by programs, trained 
professionals and committed partners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The February 16, 1999 budget recognized the need for additional 
resources to support the new legislation and renew the youth 
justice system.  Some $206 million was allocated for the first 
three years and a total of about $400 million in additional 
resources would be available for the six year implementation 
period.  This is a significant addition that will lead to the 
renewal of the youth justice system. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada as a whole continues to incarcerate a higher percentage 
of young offenders than most countries.  This is a concern. 
Although international comparisons continue to be difficult 
because of the differences between systems, Canada apparently 
incarcerates a relatively higher percentage of young people than 
even the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the rates of incarceration vary considerably across 
the country, ranging from 9% to 32% per 10,000 adolescents 
depending on the province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is sad that the great majority of young people in custody are 
there for non-violent offences for which community approaches 
will do a much better job of promoting social values such as 
responsibility and accountability. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Contrary to the assertion of the opposition, the government is 
addressing the youth justice concerns of Canadians with new laws 
and supporting programs that will prevent crime and ensure 
meaningful consequences for those who do commit crimes— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I am sorry but the hon. parliamentary 
secretary's time has expired. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK42"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
usually agree with the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister 
of Justice on issues of criminal justice, particularly very 
important ones such as this one. We usually agree on the major 
thrusts and on the implementation of the Criminal Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in this debate on the motion put forward by the Reform 
Party, which is obviously motivated by the recent amendments 
proposed to the Young Offenders Act by the Department of 
Justice, I have a hard time reconciling the speech made this 
morning by the secretary parliamentary with the new thrust of 
the Young Offenders Act, with the new way of implementing the 
youth justice system in Canada. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1105"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT13"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly, and even with the virtual agreement of two parties, it 
is in response to the pressure exerted by western Canada and the 
Reform Party that the Liberals reviewed the Young Offenders Act 
to strengthen it and to provide for stiffer penalties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can we reconcile the speech of the parliamentary secretary 
on rehabilitation and social reintegration with the possibility 
of having 14 and 15-year old kids being imprisoned and having 
their names published in newspapers, which would mark them for 
life? How can we reconcile these two things with the parents' 
responsibility? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore ask the parliamentary secretary if she thinks that 
her speech is credible with regard to that issue? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Eleni Bakopanos:</B> Yes,  Mr. Speaker, I believe my speech is 
very consistent in this regard. As the hon. member is well 
aware, we have made our bill flexible precisely so that the 
system that is already working in the province of Quebec can 
continue to operate.  We have, however, given attorneys general 
and ministers of justice everywhere in the county the right to 
reflect their communities' values. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It may be that Quebec's view is not one shared by all parts of 
Canada.  It is our hope that the $206 million we have allocated 
to rehabilitation and to social reintegration of youth will help 
to create rehabilitation programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would point out at the same time that we were not pressured in 
any way.  We have made a collective decision, which is how the 
Liberal party operates, and it is one that reflects all views of 
this country. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK43"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster—Coquitlam—Burnaby, 
Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is typical of the government side to 
create a false picture and then rail against it.  It is rather a 
phony, hollow play. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we on this side talk about personal responsibility, 
government members call it fearmongering.  When we talk about 
victim concerns rather than being too offender focused, they call 
it rather simplistic.  Obviously we can hear today how touchy 
they are because there is a big problem out there in the 
community for which the government is responsible.  They are 
accountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just to be reasonable and to deal with facts, not false notions, 
we can do a lot better in the justice system.  When we perform 
our official opposition role of pointing out inadequacies, what 
we ask from the government is simply to fix the problem and not 
get into an esoteric debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a lot of boasting today about the new young offenders 
bill before parliament.  Will the government be prepared to 
accept amendments to the bill based on consultation with the 
community rather than continue to boast about how good the 
proposed bill is? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Eleni Bakopanos:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we on this side of the 
House have never dealt with anything except the facts. 
Unfortunately that is not the case on the other side of the 
House.  Yes, we know there are inadequacies and, yes, we are 
addressing them on this side of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as victims are concerned, I remind the hon. member that 
we have dealt with victims as a priority in the justice system, 
including in the new legislation that we tabled last week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as making any comments on consultation, I do not think 
there has been any piece of legislation which has had as much 
consultation as this piece of legislation that we have introduced 
in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A justice committee did a consultation.  The ministers of 
justice across the country have been consulted.  A number of 
organizations and a number of Canadians have been consulted. 
There has been extensive consultation as far as this piece of 
legislation is concerned.  There will be further consultation 
according to the process we have established as a parliament.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
think it would be a good thing go back to the motion itself, 
which reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government has failed to 
deliver criminal justice programs and laws that reflect the will 
and concerns of the majority of Canadians, including  issues 
like child pornography, young offenders, impaired driving, 
conditional sentencing, drug trafficking, home invasions, police 
funding, consecutive sentencing, corrections facilities and 
illegal immigration, and as a consequence, have put individual 
safety, and in some cases national security, in jeopardy.

<A HREF="#LINKT14"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One is forced to conclude that this motion was prompted, as I 
said earlier, by amendments to the Young Offenders Act, among 
other things, but that it is also a reaction to the shocking 
case in British Columbia relating to child pornography. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have some misgivings about the misconceptions this implies. 
The motion is based solely on perceptions, on emotions, on 
exceptions, and on the misinformation the Reform Party has been 
involved with ever since 1993, as justification for its desire 
to make some extremely significant changes, to the Young 
Offenders Act in particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not saying today that everything is rosy and wonderful and 
that we have the best system in the world.  That is not the 
case.  All systems need to be modernized and improved.  There 
are areas where the government does not perform and should. 
There are vitally important areas where the Liberal government 
does nothing and should do something. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More dollars are laundered in this country than anywhere else in 
the world.  What is the federal government doing about it? 
Absolutely nothing.  We are proud to be the country laundering 
the most dollars.  It would be easy to intervene.  The 
government could simply outlaw the use of $1,000 bills, as the 
Bloc Quebecois member for Charlesbourg has been suggesting for a 
while now.  Nothing is happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Epic battles had to be waged here to get the Liberal government 
to pass minor legislation on gangs. 
It does not go as far as we would like.  It is not right for 
criminal gangs to call the shots as they are doing across the 
country without any intervention and the heads of the gangs 
being caught. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certain laws protecting public security contain weaknesses.  In 
terms of police services funding, the government could certainly 
put more money into prevention.  Then there is the victims 
element. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There must be compliance with the Canadian Constitution as well. 
Odd to hear this from the mouth of a Bloc member, but there is 
a Canadian Constitution, and the people in this House do not 
appear to really know what it is about.  It sets out 
responsibilities. But, as the Bloc member pointed out, not even 
the government complies with the Constitution, intervening in 
provincial areas of jurisdiction. 
Perhaps it should set an example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bottom line is that there is room for improvement in the 
system, but perhaps we should not expect to amend the Criminal 
Code or the Young Offenders Act by debating this kind of motion, 
or by citing specific cases that have made the headlines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Young Offenders Act is something I take a great interest in. 
I am familiar with the Young Offenders Act because a consensus 
was reached in Quebec.  Efforts to address youth crime have been 
going on for 25 or 30 years.  Lawyers, criminologists and 
specialists fought just as hard with the Government of Quebec of 
25 or 30 years ago as they did with the federal government to 
bring about the structure we have today, and all stakeholders 
are proud of their achievement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will surely understand my mistrust with respect to any 
sort of amendment to a bill that could undermine Quebec's 
approach to youth crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I see this sort of à la carte legislation being proposed, 
when I see legislation purporting to be very flexible, according 
to the Minister of Justice and her parliamentary secretary, 
legislation that each province could enforce as it saw fit, I 
wonder.  Why does the federal government want a Young Offenders 
Act then?  Why does it not withdraw completely and leave the 
provinces with full jurisdiction over youth crime?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec would immediately praise such a move on the part of the 
Minister of Justice, if she had the courage to make it.  But I 
am afraid this is not about to happen. The whole thing is a 
smokescreen. It is not true that the new way of doing things 
with regard to criminal justice is as flexible as the government 
would have us believe to get Quebec to shut up, as federalists 
often try to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</B> I hope that the members from Quebec who 
are here are listening and will ask me questions. I will be 
pleased to answer them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Justice, and even Reformers, rely on statistics 
that do not demonstrate any need to make amendments to the Young 
Offenders Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will quote the figures mentioned by the minister herself when 
she introduced her amendments. They are from Statistics Canada, 
which means they should be precise numbers. The crime rate among 
young people has dropped 23%, even for violent crimes. That is 
those crimes targeted by the minister's proposed amendment, 
those that prompted her act and propose changes. There has even 
been a 3.2% drop since 1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Contrary to what a Liberal member said, juvenile crimes do not 
account for 10% of all crimes, but for less than that. One 
should look at the actual figures before saying things that make 
no sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why, given the statistics quoted by the minister, we 
must arrive at the conclusion that she is blindly amending an 
act that is good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I attended the meetings of the Standing Committee on Justice, 
which examined this issue. I heard all the stakeholders, 
including some from western Canada, British Columbia and 
Ontario, and they said the problem was not really the act itself 
but the related funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, people said “It is not the act that presents a 
problem, but the financing. Please do not change the Young 
Offenders Act. Maintain the status quo”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some 25 or 30 years ago, we in Quebec decided to invest in 
rehabilitation and social reintegration instead of in bricks and 
mortar for jails in which to keep young people locked up, so 
that they come out at age 25 or 30 with a fine education in how 
to commit crime, and an inability to do anything else.  What we 
do instead is to invest in the individual, to focus on the heart 
of the problem.  We have excellent success rates for 
rehabilitation and reintegration into society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course it does not make the front page headlines when a young 
person who committed a murder at age 15 and was placed in 
rehabilitation now, 10 or 12 years later, having been 
rehabilitated, becomes an anonymous member of society, marries 
and starts a family, has a job, and is not dependent on society. 
This does not make the front page, of course, but it is a 
situation we see daily as a result of the way we apply the Young 
Offenders Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will understand, therefore, that it is impossible for me 
not to react when I hear inaccurate statistics and information 
given in this House.  I will speak out as strongly as possible 
against any such attempt by either the Reform Party or the 
Liberal Party, who seem to get along very well when a detour to 
the right is necessary.  I will be quick to stand up and defend 
my point of view, which is a point of view shared by all 
Quebeckers, and we know what we are talking about.

speech by member, colleague and friend from Berthier—Montcalm 
sad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is a point of consensus on this bill it is the remarks 
by the head of the Quebec Bar, Jacques Fournier. He said that 
this bill was not only in line with the philosophy of the Quebec 
Bar, but that the government had once again demonstrated that it 
is flexible and that it is following up on the extraordinary 
work done by the legal community on this issue in Quebec.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand that the opposition has to oppose.  It is very 
frustrating for a colleague like the member for 
Berthier—Montcalm, whose voice revealed in a way that he was 
trying to defend the indefensible.  I would ask him, however, 
what he wants exactly, given that we are being flexible and 
especially that we are providing the funding, because I am 
interested in this matter.  The Centre Mariebourg in my riding 
helps prevent crime in its way and works with young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the role of the member for Berthier—Montcalm to defend the 
indefensible and to come up with all sorts of ways to promote his 
own political cause?  Should he not, in any case—and we are all 
familiar with his intellectual honesty in this regard—applaud 
the work of the minister and the flexibility of this government, 
which works?  What wears him out in the end is that the system 
can work within Canada, is it not? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is most unfortunate that 
the member for Bourassa takes this approach, because I have 
tried to avoid petty politics when it comes to the very 
important topic of crime.  If the member had followed the 
proceeedings of  the Standing Committee on Justice and Human 
Rights, he would know that on several occasions I set aside 
partisan politics in order to raise extremely important points 
for the betterment of the law, which I hold very dear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case, I am being told what Quebec's president of the bar 
said.  Quebec's president of the bar represents his peers.  I am 
a member of the bar, and therefore he must represent me. He is 
also supposed to represent his committee, which has examined the 
issue.  Other members of this committee include Ms. Toutan, Me 
Bois and Me Trépanier. Although I have not discussed the issue 
with them, I have heard what they have to say and they are 
squarely against the president of the bar's comments.  They will 
apparently sort this out among themselves. 
Quebec's president of the bar did not inform any of them that he 
would be attending a press conference with the Minister of 
Justice, and, in particular, none of them was aware of his new 
view of the Young Offenders Act in this great land, Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will leave the Quebec bar to sort this out among themselves. 
Things will undoubtedly be said to which we will not be privy, 
but I am certain that there is still a consensus in Quebec and 
that it is opposed to the amendments the minister is proposing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the minister, her parliamentary secretary, or even the 
Liberal member for Bourassa were convinced that the Quebec 
approach is the best one, how can it be that they, as 
federalists who want only the best for Canada, have not been 
successful in selling this idea in English Canada?  How can it 
be that, in order to put Quebec in its place, they are creating 
national standards and then telling Quebec “If you want any 
money, you'd better put up and shut up”.  Yet, when it comes to 
what will be implemented in western Canada, flexibility will be 
allowed, a flexibility that is not part of the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, there are some reflex reactions that did to exist 
previously, and that will eventually have an impact on how young 
offenders will be handled in Quebec, and this I cannot allow. 
If the Liberal members from Quebec can, they will have to bear 
the responsibility for their actions.  I, as a lawyer and an MP 
who is doing a serious and professional job here, cannot accept 
the minister's approach.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, 
NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I look forward to the rest of the day and 
this very scintillating debate.  I am pleased to be participating 
in this debate.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate the fact that my colleagues have brought forward 
this motion to deal with the criminal justice system, to deal 
with the way laws are interpreted by the judiciary and to look 
into issues like child pornography, young offenders, home 
invasions, impaired driving, conditional sentencing, consecutive 
sentencing, correctional facilities, illegal immigration and a 
number of others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think we, and particularly members on the government 
side, should feel defensive.  We will not suggest they are 
responsible for every aspect of our criminal justice system and 
its interpretation.  We also will not suggest any party has the 
corner on truth when it comes to dealing with these issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, it is important to share our points of view in hopes 
that some changes will occur.  I do not expect a single member of 
parliament, if they were honest in terms of representing the 
views of their constituents, would say there not improvements to 
be made to the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has recently introduced changes to the Young 
Offenders Act which, on a personal basis, I believe is a step in 
the right direction as changes are obviously required.  I think 
there are improvements that can be made to the bill.  My friend 
from Quebec who just spoke pointed out some of his concerns.  The 
Liberal member reflected the fact that we are being flexible so 
that communities in different parts of the country can be 
reflected in the way the Young Offenders Act is interpreted and 
used. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps it is a strength to acknowledge that parts of the 
country such as the province of Quebec have had incredible 
successes dealing with the young offender issue provincial 
jurisdictions much more than some other jurisdictions. We can 
therefore learn from them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, we have to be concerned that we will have a 
number of systems dealing with young offenders across the country 
that reflect these realities in parts of the country. Do we 
really want to have a justice system that is different in one 
part of Canada for some Canadians than in another part? There is 
a national standard when it comes to interpreting the Criminal 
Code.  These are issues we have to discuss and consider. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend spent some time talking about the Shaw decision 
surrounding the issue of child pornography.  I think I reflect 
all our views when I say we share a deep concern the moment it is 
legal to have child pornography in one's possession for personal 
use.  One would have to ask what other use there would be. 
Building material?  I doubt that.  It is obviously for personal 
use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In British Columbia a judge has said that it is okay to have 
child pornography in one's possession as long as one is using it 
for one's personal use.  That is a terrible situation.  I think 
MPs from all parties would say that is not right and that we will 
take steps to ensure that is changed. Every time there is an 
individual with child pornography of some sort in their home it 
means that some young people have been abused and taken advantage 
of in a most degrading circumstance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is obviously an issue of concern because we are hearing it 
today.  The parliamentary secretary ought not to take these 
criticisms personally.  We are simply putting them on the table 
and saying these are issues that must be dealt with in whatever 
form it might take.  If it is a change to the Constitution by 
using the notwithstanding clause, so be it.  If it requires new 
legislation, so be it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also the issue of impaired driving.  I think we are all 
concerned when we listen to our local divisions of Mothers 
Against Drunk Driving and others and read their literature about 
the carnage on our highways that is attached to those people who, 
for whatever set of reasons, choose to drink and drive.  Perhaps 
we need to get a little tougher on them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it was the state of New York that announced a change in 
policy where if someone is found to be driving his or her vehicle 
and drinking, the vehicle is impounded and sold.  The driver does 
not get it back under any circumstances.  That will slow people 
down and make people think twice.  It is hard to say whether that 
is a solution but we have to look at all aspects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On a personal basis, there is the issue of illegal immigration. 
This is a huge topic and deserves a full day of debate in the 
House of Commons.  There are a lot of people who work hard to 
enter Canada in legal ways by going through all the proper 
channels in time consuming processes and so on.  We also see 
people who short-circuit the system and then go underground. There 
are thousands of people who abuse our immigration laws in that 
way and therefore wreck it for those who are legitimate 
applicants.  This is something we have to take more seriously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last few days I think we all had visits by police forces 
across the country, the RCMP and others. 
They visited almost every member of parliament, pointing out 
their incredible frustration with working hard to nail some drug 
dealer only to see the drug dealer getting off in court on some 
bloody technicality and being out there hours later selling drugs 
on the street to young people.  There are all kinds of abuses.  I 
do not know how police officers can stand it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  They do not make enough money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  They do not make enough money.  I do not 
think we could pay police officers enough for the work they do on 
our behalf. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They were here the other day pointing out the frustration they 
experience in attempting to uphold the laws.  We are probably not 
short of laws but it is the way the laws are being interpreted, 
the way they are being administered, and the way the judicial 
branch is dealing with the laws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will go back to the Shaw decision in British Columbia.  We 
would be remiss today if we did not mention one of the more 
unfortunate issues relating to our corrections system, that is 
the large number of aboriginal inmates in our jails.  A large 
number of first nations men and women are incarcerated in Canada 
by and large because they often cannot afford a good lawyer to 
argue their case.  As a result of living in conditions that can 
only be akin to poverty and being unable to get the legal advice 
and support they require, they end up serving time in jail, which 
as someone said earlier is really a crime college. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a young offender who is in some difficulty wants to become a 
full time criminal, there is no better place to learn the art of 
crime than in jail.  If a young offender breaks the law in some 
form we have to be very cautious and see jail as a last resort. 
Steps need to be taken in an attempt to break the cycle of crime 
as opposed to sending the young person off to crime college, as I 
call it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are to make our streets and neighbourhoods safe, we cannot 
rely on the police to do it.  We cannot rely on the judicial 
system itself to do it.  We all have to be part of the solution. 
In other words, communities have to buy into the fact that they 
too have to be part of the security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am thinking of the various protection plans which exist in 
neighbourhoods, the neighbourhood watch approach.  People look 
out for one another.  If they see a suspicious character they 
call the police.  If someone is breaking down someone's back 
door, he is probably not an uncle trying to get in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This brings me back to the whole issue of adequate funding for 
our police forces.  I do not think there is a single jurisdiction 
in Canada or a single taxpayer in Canada that would not wilfully 
add a few cents to the tax load if it was going into better 
policing for neighbourhoods and safeguarding streets and 
communities across the country.  I think we all admit that 
government funding when it comes to security, particularly in 
terms of funding our police forces, has not been sufficient.  As 
a result Canada's security has suffered to a certain extent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to send a signal, which I think this debate today will 
help to do, to the judicial aspect of our system in Canada.  Many 
people have suggested that we have a good legal system but there 
is not much justice in it.  Often we see justice being set aside 
for all kinds of spurious reasons.  I hope the judges, 
particularly the ones that have made some terribly goofy 
decisions in the last little while, will take note of our 
discussions today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make an appeal in my closing comments.  While we are 
dealing with crime and how to deal with those who break the law 
or have been alleged to have broken the law, we need to spend 
some time looking at the causes of crime.  Why do people break 
laws?  Why do people decide to do something they know is illegal? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suspect there are two fundamental causes.  One is people do 
goofy things.  I am thinking particularly of many young offenders 
who do something as a result of youthful exuberance or a moment 
of misjudgment.  They are not criminals; they just do something 
stupid.  I suspect an odd one of us in this room has probably 
been in that category at one time or another.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, let us admit that a fundamental cause of crime is 
extremely dysfunctional families that have become dysfunctional 
often because of some element of poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not linking poverty and crime.  I am saying that high 
levels of poverty, excessive levels of poverty, often lead to 
very dysfunctional families and result in dysfunctional behaviour 
in society and consequently to crime.  Let us spend some time on 
the causes of crime, not only on crime itself. 
<P><A NAME="LINK47"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I listened to the member from Kamloops.  I heard him 
make reference to the rate of incarceration of our aboriginal 
peoples. He also made reference to looking at the front end, 
trying to look at prevention and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have often thought about two statistics that are not normally 
linked.  I wonder if the member has some independent thoughts on 
them.  I would like him to share them with the viewers and 
listeners.  They relate to what we all know so sadly as fetal 
alcohol syndrome which affects the aboriginal population in a 
statistically high way.  We also know that victims of fetal 
alcohol syndrome have traditionally and statistically provable 
high rates of incarceration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at those two statistics independently in the broad 
population there is a definite linkage.  If we look at them 
specifically in the aboriginal population, it would be very 
interesting to know what the link is.  We are possibly 
understating the true impact of fetal alcohol syndrome and how it 
is ravaging the population, particularly in terms of the rate of 
incarceration of aboriginal peoples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have never actually seen a study that links those two 
statistics.  Does the member from Kamloops want to make any 
comments in that regard? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the inquiry by 
my friend from Vancouver Island North because he has identified 
one of the very serious issues confronting our society as a whole 
but particularly concentrated in some aboriginal communities, the 
whole issue of fetal alcohol syndrome and the victims of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is fair to say that any individual suffering from the results 
of fetal alcohol syndrome will have a difficulty functioning well 
in society.  People who have difficulty functioning in society 
often tend to be marginalized, tend to get into situations where 
there is very little hope in terms of having a successful future, 
and therefore often turn in desperation to acts of violent crime. 
Particularly they get caught up in substance abuse issues in 
their own communities or homes and violent crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member has done the debate a great deal of service by 
flagging an issue that is not only of concern to us all but 
probably ought to be much more of a concern: the ramifications of 
substance abuse generally in our communities.  I thank my friend 
from Vancouver Island North.  That is a positive aspect of this 
debate.  We are all putting items on the table for consideration 
in the hopes that somebody somewhere is listening.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
noticed that all of those who spoke today referred to child 
pornography in B.C. Anyone involved in child pornography is sick. 
We have to take necessary steps.  We all have to come together, 
fast track and do whatever has to be done to correct this 
situation in B.C., because we do not want anyone else across the 
country doing it. 
We have to think about those little children.

little girls and at that time he was trying to do something to 
straighten it out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What steps does my colleague from the NDP think all of us 
collectively should take to straighten out this matter 
immediately? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, as always I appreciate a 
question from the hon. member for Saint John.  In her emotional 
question she reflects the view on this issue of every member of 
parliament representing every Canadian.  We have to take whatever 
steps are necessary to obliterate any use of child pornography. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Arising from our earlier discussions, if new legislation is 
required to send a very clear signal to our judiciary, so be it. 
We will pass that expeditiously.  I am sure all parties would 
move on that.  If it requires the use of the notwithstanding 
clause of our Constitution, we will suggest that we use that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Essentially this behaviour is unacceptable by any clear thinking 
individual in society.  We as a parliament will take whatever 
step is necessary to obliterate this blight as quickly as 
possible. 
<P><A NAME="LINK49"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure and always an honour to 
rise in the House to debate issues of such substance.  I commend 
the hon. member who brought the multifacted issue before the 
House for debate.  It touches on a number of very important 
subject areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many criminal justice debates that take place in the House are 
done on what one might describe as a visceral level.  It is fair 
to say that issues such as child pornography, sentencing or truth 
in sentencing certainly conjure up very strong emotions for 
individuals throughout the country, particularly those who are 
most affected.  I am speaking of victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is fair to say that significant steps have been made in the 
past number of years to address the inadequacies and the 
injustices that exist with respect to the treatment of victims in 
our criminal justice system.  I would even go so far as to praise 
the justice minister for having recognized this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also take the opportunity to praise the late Shaughnessy 
Cohen for her work on the justice committee as chair and in 
heading up a round table discussion in Ottawa that included many 
stakeholders in our justice system as it pertained to victims 
rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will speak more specifically to some of the elements of the 
motion before the House today.  When we speak to issues such as 
the recent decision out of British Columbia in the case of the 
Queen v Shaw that talks of the ability of a person to possess 
child pornography, it certainly conjures up a statement made by a 
law professor, Victor Goldberg in Nova Scotia, at Dalhousie 
University, when he said that bad facts make for bad law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Often times we tend to get caught up in an individual case and 
hold it out as the standard or as an example of how the law 
should change.  Often times that is a useful exercise, but we 
have to be very careful because proportionality and a measured 
response are implicitly important in the criminal justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not to say that I or members of the Progressive 
Conservative Party in any way, shape or form condone the decision 
that was made with respect to child pornography.  The suggestion 
that we brought forward was that it was an instance where there 
should have been direct intervention from the justice minister. 
There should have been an immediate response. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In cases such as that one the public perception is very 
important.  For justice to be done it must be seen to be done. 
This is an old legal maxim from the myths of antiquity.  Having 
practised law, Mr. Speaker, you would understand the importance 
of responding quickly but proportionately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What should have happened and what we respectfully submit should 
have taken place in this instance was that the justice minister 
had an opportunity to refer it immediately to the top court to 
have the Supreme Court of Canada issue a ruling on the case 
immediately so that there would be clarification for law 
enforcement agents. 
There would be clarification for judges, in particular in the 
province of British Columbia, but right across the land.  There 
would be a renewed sense of confidence in our justice system that 
is so sorely lacking these days.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to touch briefly on the changes that have been brought 
forward through this new legislation, the youth criminal justice 
bill, which was tabled last week in the House.  Again I cannot 
help but feel some sense of regret and a sense that it was a 
missed opportunity by the Minister of Justice to bring forward 
perhaps more meaningful legislation that would resonate across 
the country and restore the sense of justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is fair to say that over the past number of years there has 
been a constant disintegration and erosion of our confidence as 
it pertains in particular to the way our laws apply to young 
people in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The law itself is not all bad.  The philosophy of the Young 
Offenders Act I think is one that we all agree with and one which 
we all embrace, and that is that young people do in fact have to 
be held to a different standard than an adult, a mature person. 
However, this particular legislation, rightly or wrongly, has 
been perceived as something that was set up to protect a young 
person as opposed to protecting society.  At the end of the day, 
what justice in this country is all about is ensuring that those 
who choose to live within the ambit of the laws that have been 
formulated over the years and put in place through precedent and 
legislation are protected.  Those laws are there to protect 
people who choose to live that life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are those who step outside those laws.  They choose to do 
so for a reason.  There are all sorts of philosophies about how 
criminal behaviour stems from poverty and many social ills, 
mental illness and others.  However, at the end of the day the 
public has a right to be protected from those individuals, 
whatever the cause.  They have the right to feel safe in their 
homes.  They have the right to feel safe walking down the streets 
of their communities.  They have the right to feel that when 
their children leave the house in the morning they will return 
home safe and sound. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have to do is ensure that those laws are not only 
properly in place but properly upheld and interpreted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been much to do and much talk in recent days and 
months of judicial activism and the accountability level of our 
judges in this country.  It is a very slippery slope when we 
begin to openly criticize our judiciary.  They are entrusted with 
perhaps one of the most important jobs that can be performed in 
this country.  In fact I would go so far as to say that judges, 
in the day to day carrying out of their duties, the individual 
discretion which they can exercise in a courtroom is perhaps one 
of the most powerful, most compelling employment situations that 
we see, perhaps even more so than an elected official, perhaps 
even more so than the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is vitally important that those judges are given the tools 
and the laws to enforce what they feel is appropriate in the 
circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The young offenders legislation I suggest was a missed 
opportunity to perhaps give those judges greater tools, with 
respect specifically to lowering the age of accountability. 
Members opposite have made a great deal of this situation, saying 
that members of the opposition are advocating a very strict 
hammering approach that would see young people, 10 or 11 years 
old, thrown in jail.  That is not the suggestion and I have not 
heard anyone espouse that position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about a mechanism that would put in place the 
ability to trigger some form of social reaction that would bring 
a young person into the system at the earliest possible instance. 
Early intervention is what it is all about, the pre-emptive 
strike, this approach that has been so vociferously advocated by 
the government and yet it is overlooking an opportunity to do 
this.  It was from its own justice officials that this idea came 
forward.  I believe there is a failing in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the resources that have been allotted to this 
initiative, this legislative change that is to occur for our 
young offenders, it is fair to say that there are scarce 
resources under the existing system of the Young Offenders Act 
and even with the injection of money that has been proposed this 
will not adequately compensate those in the social services, 
those in child welfare, who are going to be utilized even more so 
under this particular legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is once again a very tricky shell game that has been brought 
forward, much like we saw with the budget itself and the 
suggestion that greater resources were going to be put into 
health care.  It does not compensate for the amount of money that 
was taken out.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same can be said of our justice system.  Over the past 
number of years, particularly since 1993, we have seen drastic 
cuts to our policing services and our social welfare services 
that work so closely with law enforcement and our judiciary.  Mr. 
Clark, the leader of our party, has made this a priority.  He 
very recently held a press conference to point out the 
inadequacies with respect to the funding that has been allotted 
in particular to our national police force, the RCMP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are very glad to see that the decision has been made to 
reopen the RCMP cadet college in Regina, but there is the obvious 
question:  Who closed it?  Who made that priority decision to 
stop training police officers in this country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It comes down to political decisions and political will to 
change the law.  There is an ever present opportunity on behalf 
of the government to respond with laws that are not only 
appropriate but which address the problems being brought to light 
by members of the opposition and by members of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we speak, there is a bill at the justice committee to 
increase the discretion of a judge to allow for consecutive 
sentences for the worst of all possible crimes, the most heinous 
crimes perpetrated in today's world, such as sexual assault and 
murder.  This bill came from a government member, yet the 
resources and the effort being made by her own party are 
extremely discouraging when one considers the effect which the 
adoption and imposition of this bill could bring at the end of 
the day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very pleased to have an opportunity to discuss these most 
important issues.  We are in the process of bringing about, 
hopefully, much needed change to impaired driving legislation. 
This has been itemized as something of great priority in this 
country.  The issue of drug trafficking and organized crime has 
also been given a keynote appearance in this debate.  We hope 
there will be further debate on these very important issues.  We 
in the Progressive Conservative Party embrace the opportunity to 
participate in this debate. 
<P><A NAME="LINK50"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I enjoyed listening to my colleague from 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough.  He made some comments about the 
RCMP training centre.  This is a very significant issue that 
sends a very strong signal about where the government is coming 
from when it comes to supporting our police forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My understanding is that the RCMP anticipates that it is going 
to have a 50% attrition rate over the next five-plus years.  That 
is a very high rate of attrition.  The bubble is going through in 
terms of the high percentage of people approaching retirement. In 
order to replace that natural rate of attrition a certain number 
of recruits must be going through the system.  It would be a 
challenge under the very best of circumstances if that training 
centre were open today, but it is not and it has not been.  We do 
not know where the government is going with all this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What on earth can be going on in the mind of the government that 
would allow this to happen?  Sure, it will not affect major 
things in six months or twelve months, but there are downstream 
ramifications for our national police force, which is one of the 
most important symbols of this country and one of the most 
important practical organizations we have, although it is 
receiving no support from over there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the member could elaborate on that and maybe shed 
some new light on the subject. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for the question.  I know he has a personal interest in such 
matters.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The short, flippant answer to what is going on in the 
government's mind would be, not very much.  However, to delve 
into this situation and to put it into perspective, the cadet 
training college has been closed for upwards of four months now. 
Yes, that may be a short term saving for the government in terms 
of its bottom line which, as we know, is what is driving the 
finance minister these days.  However, the bottom line is also 
that the short term gain is going to result in very long term 
pain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the hon. member has pointed out, much like the nursing 
shortage that is going to emerge in this country in years hence, 
the same could be said of policing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The RCMP is a very proud institution with a great deal of 
history, but officers need proper training.  Even with the 
reopening of the facility, there is talk about shortening the 
actual training period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This comes down to a very shocking decision with respect to 
priorities on the part of the current government.  Why it would 
do so is beyond me.  Most individuals with whom I have talked in 
the policing community or in law enforcement find that this is 
simply a staggeringly shortsighted decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend the government for at least having recognized that it 
was a mistake in the first place and for reopening it; however, I 
cannot help but make the analogy with the current budget.  The 
government is basically coming in the back door, taking out the 
furniture and the television, and wheeling an old rocking chair 
in the front door.  It is taking out more than there was in the 
system in the first place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the hon. member for the question.  I hope that greater 
emphasis and greater priority will be placed on criminal justice 
and on the training of officers so that in the years and months 
to come we will have a sufficient police force, a sufficient pool 
of trained officers to draw from so that Canadian communities 
will once again receive and enjoy a level of protection.  There 
is a thin red line of protection—and I use red because we are 
talking about police scarlet letters—that exists between the 
policing community and the community itself, and the protection 
which it has come to respect and deserve from the criminal 
element. 
<P><A NAME="LINK51"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard M. Harris (Prince George—Bulkley Valley, 
Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise today.  Regrettably, 
we have to rise to demand that this government make changes to 
the justice system which reflect the views of the vast majority 
of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regrettably, it is we in the opposition who have to remind the 
government constantly of its responsibility to react to what 
Canadians are saying, rather than reacting to its own 
philosophies when it comes to criminal justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to talk about the criminal justice system as it 
relates to impaired driving today.  Before I do, I want to take 
this opportunity to relate something which was very disturbing to 
me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Thursday, March 4, I read in the paper that a 57 year old 
woman, a grandmother, had just been released from prison after 
spending six months in incarceration.  On Saturday, March 6, I 
read in the paper that another person had been sentenced to six 
months in prison. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second person, on March 6, was sentenced for the act of 
child abuse, sexually molesting a child.  This person, according 
to the report, was unrepentant.  He saw nothing wrong with what 
he did.  He received a sentence of six months, of which he will 
serve probably two and a half months under the Liberal justice 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us return to Thursday, March 4, when this 57 year old lady 
was let out of prison.  She served six months in prison because 
she dared to cross into a bubble zone around an abortion clinic 
to kneel and pray. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1200"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT24"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If anybody in the House, anybody in the Liberal government, 
could show me some sense of justice in the relationship between 
those sentences and crimes I would be very surprised.  Imagine, 
an unrelenting, unrepentant child molester sentenced to six 
months and someone who dares to cross a bubble zone at an 
abortion clinic to kneel to pray receives the same sentence.  It 
is unbelievable how our justice system serves up so much 
injustice. It is so out of whack. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mention that because it shocked me.  Even though there is no 
reaction I am sure it is shocking members of the Liberal 
government to hear that.  If they do not believe what I am saying 
I suggest they dig up those two issues and read them for 
themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Impaired driving is a very serious crime.  It kills in the 
neighbourhood of 1,400 people every single year.  It injures over 
60,000 every year.  As a matter of fact, impaired driving is the 
number one cause of criminal death in this country, more than 
three times higher than homicide. In the last five years it has 
cost our health care system.  The property and causality claims 
are billions of dollars.  In over 10 years nothing substantial 
has been done to arrest this very serious problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the last month and a half we have seen witnesses come 
before the justice committee to present their opinions on how we 
should address this very serious crime of impaired driving and 
how we can cut the senseless deaths.  Now the justice committee 
is charged with reviewing all the testimony, taking into 
consideration all the recommendations and to bring back before 
the House by May 15 a bill that will take some very serious and 
positive steps to cutting the incidence of impaired driving, 
cutting deaths, injuries and cutting the cost to our health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to tell members at this time that I have some very 
serious doubts as to whether these Liberals, who talk the talk 
about wanting to cut the carnage on our highways, cut the 
incidence of death and injuries and the billions of dollars of 
cost, are serious.  I have seen no indication that these Liberal 
members who sit on the justice committee and others who well over 
a year ago unanimously sent to the justice committee a supply day 
motion by the Reform Party that called for action are serious in 
any way about addressing the very serious crime of impaired 
driving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Millions of Canadians have cried out for the federal government 
to take some leadership on this crime and do something that would 
reflect a zero tolerance attitude toward impaired driving. The 
victims of impaired driving deserve no less.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sad to say I am not confident at this time, having been 
involved in the justice committee hearings and the subsequent 
meetings going on right now, the government is serious despite 
what it has said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of steps we can take.  I guess the most 
appropriate one would be to look at the level of blood alcohol 
content in the driver of a vehicle once the reading on the 
breathalyzer is determined.  There is much testimony to support 
the lowering of this level to .05 from .08, which I support. We 
also have a very serious problem with the court system that has 
not been addressed by this or previous governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In cases where people are charged with impaired driving we have 
heard testimony from prosecutors and policing officials that the 
judiciary automatically tends to accept the evidence of the 
person who is charged rather than the evidence of the crown 
prosecutor and the police force that has laid the charge. 
Something is wrong with that picture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Something is wrong when a prosecutor can walk into a court, 
present certificate evidence from very high tech instruments to 
detect the level of BAC, where the margin of error is so small 
that it is almost insignificant, and the judge will tend to 
believe evidence contrary to those proven certificates of 
evidence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I really hope, for the sake of the victims of impaired drivers, 
for the families left behind and for the sake of our health care 
system, that this government for once since 1993, since I have 
been in parliament, will do something positive to take some steps 
in the justice system that will be of benefit to Canadians.  Here 
is an opportunity for it to do that. I hope it does not let 
Canadians down once again.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
listened with great interest to my colleague from Prince George. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the member about the problem of break and 
enter which is becoming quite prevalent in Canada.  In light of 
the fact that the revised Young Offenders Act was presented, I 
would like to have his opinion on why he thinks this was left 
out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard M. Harris:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I certainly will not 
attempt to speak for the members of the Liberal government. Lord 
knows some of the steps they take or do not take are quite 
puzzling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, in British Columbia in particular the incidence of home 
invasions is at a very serious epidemic stage right now.  It is 
incumbent on this Liberal government and members who represent 
British Columbians to respond to the call from residents of 
British Columbia to bring in some very tough and specific 
guidelines on how we treat offenders who do this very serious 
crime of home invasion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us remember that the victims in almost every case are frail 
and elderly people who cannot defend themselves from home 
invasions by these thugs who would take advantage of them. 
Nothing less than serious jail time is appropriate in that case.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I live in a city that a few years ago won the distinction of 
being the highest B and E city in western Canada, Prince George, 
B.C.  It was something we were not very proud of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These were done mainly by young offenders and so many of them 
were repeat offenders because they were receiving nothing but a 
slap on the wrist when they appeared before the judge the first 
time and a slap on the wrist the second time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I like what a judge from New York said about two weeks ago: 
“When a young offender comes before my bench on his first

Because I don't want to see him back here again”.  I 
congratulate that judge.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I listened to my hon. colleague's speech very carefully 
about impaired driving and the problems it is creating on an 
ongoing basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the proactive things I did as an independent member of 
parliament was to put forward a private member's bill dealing 
with the use of interlock devices for repeat offenders of 
impaired driving.  Unfortunately I have not been lucky enough to 
have my name drawn so that we could debate that bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can my hon. colleague talk a bit about the interlock device and 
whether he sees some merit in having that as part of a complete 
package that does adequately address the very serious concern of 
impaired driving in Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard M. Harris:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the testimony and 
evidence we heard before the justice committee by people from 
Guardian Interlock gave us a good insight into what such a 
valuable tool this device would be, particularly in the case of 
people who were repeat offenders or who were stopped with a high 
level of alcohol. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let it be clear that the Guardian Interlock system should not be 
used in place of any serious penalties that should be given to 
people who drive while impaired.  It should be used in addition. 
It is not to take the place of a penalty.  It is an additional 
part of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill:</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I wish I could say it is a pleasure for me to rise to 
address these very serious concerns the Reform Party has brought 
forward today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately like so many Canadians, probably millions across 
the land, I am suffering a little from a cold and it is not very 
pleasurable to try to make a speech. If my voice fails me at some 
point during the speech members will understand why. Over the 
weekend I lost my voice completely. Some people would say that 
would be a good thing, in particular some members across the way 
who do not like to hear what I have to say from time to time in 
this place.  It is bad news for a politician not to have a voice 
because it is the one essential tool of the trade, so to speak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today in the short time I have I will be addressing the issue of 
conditional sentencing.  I should explain for viewers at home and 
those in the gallery what conditional sentencing is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Conditional sentencing should not be confused with parole and 
conditional release.  Conditional sentencing allows judges a tool 
whereby rather than sending a convicted or confessed criminal to 
jail or prison, they can divert that individual to conditional 
sentencing, to serving their time in the community or at home in 
many cases under certain conditions. Thus the term conditional 
sentencing. There are certain conditions imposed on that 
individual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Conditional sentencing was established under legislation of Bill 
C-41 in the first session of the 35th parliament. 
That is the parliament immediately preceding the one that is 
under way at present.  This bill made sweeping changes to 
Canada's sentencing laws, but in each case neglected to reflect 
the interests of Canadians.  The majority of the debate when Bill 
C-41 was before the House was focused on classifying murder.

<A HREF="#LINKT27"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the Liberals, killing only one person is not so bad 
as long as you do not kill more than one, or murder out of hate. 
If either of those cases were prevalent in a particular 
conviction, either a multiple murder or a so-called hate crime, 
then the individual might have to serve their entire lenient 
sentence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But I am digressing from my main point today which is 
conditional sentencing which was also contained in Bill C-41. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far back as March 1995 the Reform Party has been pleading 
with this government to change the law to exclude violent crimes, 
but so far our cries have fallen on deaf ears.  It has been four 
years since we first raised this very serious issue.  It is some 
two and a half years now since this law has been put into force. 
On September 3, 1996 conditional sentencing actually came into 
place and began to be utilized by judges across the land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995 the Reform member for Crowfoot moved several amendments 
to Bill C-41 in committee which would have disqualified violent 
offences from conditional sentencing.  It would have ensured that 
the sentences were to deter the offender and others from 
committing offences and that the sentences were to provide 
compensation to the victims and/or their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Police Association and Victims of Violence echoed 
the concerns expressed by the member for Crowfoot, yet the 
Liberals did not support any of those measures. I find it ironic 
in light of that fact that the Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Justice rose in her place about an hour ago in 
questions and comments following her speech and said that she or 
her government would be willing to look at amendments to the 
newly announced changes to the young offenders legislation. Some 
of us on this side of the House and indeed all Canadians might be 
just a bit sceptical of how sincere she was. We might even have 
some reason to be cynical about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Conditional sentencing was meant to cut costs.  Although it can 
be argued that some financial costs have been cut, the human 
costs of the victims of crime are mounting.  The trauma one feels 
from an unjust sentence is immeasurable.  I am sure one feels 
victimized all over again.  The societal costs of conditional 
sentencing are mounting. Rapists, killers, child and spousal 
abusers and drug dealers are set free without deterrents or 
consequence.  It is my firm belief that without proper punishment 
there is no deterrent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-41 allows convicted criminals to serve their sentences at 
home in the community rather than in jail.  It is my belief and 
the belief of many MPs including the justice minister that it was 
not parliament's intent that conditional sentencing be used in 
the cases of violent or sexual offences. In January 1998 the 
justice minister publicly stated that.  She said, “There have 
been some circumstances in which I believe conditional sentences 
were used when it was not the intention of parliament to have 
them and those should be appealed”.  The minister added that 
conditional sentencing was never intended to apply to violent or 
sexual offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to relate to the viewing public a few of the cases 
where I believe conditional sentencing was applied 
inappropriately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Montreal three men were given 18 month conditional sentences 
after raping a 16 year old pregnant woman and holding her upside 
down from a balcony. The judge thought that this was part of 
their culture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Winnipeg a youth previously convicted of theft and seven 
armed robberies and on temporary leave from a Manitoba youth 
centre received a one year conditional sentence and three year 
probation for the drive-by shooting death of a 13 year old. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Nanaimo a 28 year old man received a one year conditional 
sentence for shooting his girlfriend with a crossbow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Edmonton a 57 year old man who swung a machete at a 21 year 
old male cutting his face and cutting a third of his ear off got 
240 hours of community service and a curfew.

<A HREF="#LINKT28"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I raised this particularly appalling case during question period 
just last week.  In Ottawa, Paul Gervais confessed to sexually 
assaulting nine boys, yet he got two years conditional sentence 
and a curfew.  That is absolutely appalling. I think the general 
public has every reason to be outraged at these types of 
sentences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also in Ottawa, Robert Turcotte strangled his mother to death. 
He received a two year conditional sentence, 100 hours of 
community service and a midnight curfew. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pay close attention to this one.  In Vancouver, a person out on 
conditional sentence for two counts of theft and dangerous 
driving has been accused of killing an 83 year old woman during a 
home invasion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the justice minister prefers to allow the appeal courts to 
address the inappropriate use of conditional sentencing, the 
courts have indicated the opposite.  The issue of conditional 
sentencing continues to become more and more of an ambiguous 
matter within the courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the minister's belief about the intention of conditional 
sentencing, in August 1997 the B.C. Court of Appeal ruled that 
violent offenders are entitled to serve time in the community 
under conditional sentences.  The B.C. appeal court ruling 
stated: “If parliament had intended to exclude certain offences 
from consideration under section 742.1, it could have done so in 
clear language”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my contention that Canadian courts are already bogged 
down.  We should not be using the courts to appeal these types of 
sentences.  Indeed the general public is waking up to this more 
and more and is becoming justifiably outraged at some of these 
sentences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the minister has not responded to this public outcry or to 
her own criticisms of the law, I have submitted two private 
member's motions, Motion No. 383 and Motion No. 577, to rectify 
the situation. Motion No. 577 is currently on the Order Paper and 
reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That in the opinion of this House, the Standing Committee on 
Justice and Human Rights be instructed, in accordance with 
Standing Order 68(4)(b), to prepare and bring in a bill to 
prevent the use of conditional sentencing in cases where someone 
is convicted of a dangerous crime including:  murder, 
manslaughter, armed robbery, kidnapping, drug trafficking, sexual 
assault, and all other classifications of assault including child 
and spousal abuse. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government would act on a motion similar to that and 
bring forward amendments to this section of the Criminal Code, it 
would certainly stand itself well with the general public.  It 
would address a serious inadequacy in our present law.

use that word. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> I realize that the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Harvard:</B>  Mr. Speaker, let me deal with the 
contradictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Prince George—Peace River has found conditional 
sentencing wanting. He is basically saying that judges and all 
the officials of the courts cannot be trusted with this tool of 
flexibility. According to the Reform Party member, since the 
courts cannot be trusted, the judges cannot be trusted, the 
prosecutors cannot be trusted, the defence lawyers cannot be 
trusted, this matter has to be returned to the legislators in 
Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the Reform Party member, it is up to the 
legislators who will have the responsibility of getting it right. 
But, and this is where I get to the contradiction, who is more 
denigrated by the Reform Party? Who is more mistrusted by the 
Reform Party than legislators? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot win with the Reform Party.  The Reform Party does not 
trust the judges.  It does not trust the prosecutors.  It does 
not trust the defence lawyers.  It does not trust the law makers. 
It does not trust the politicians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Harvard:</B>  Why does the hon. member not address 
the question? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill:</B>   Mr. Speaker, now he is intent on heckling 
when I try to address his ridiculous comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, we do not trust certain legislators.  We do not trust this 
Liberal government.  That is obvious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this particular case we do not trust the judges to use 
conditional sentencing properly because they have proven 
themselves time and time again unworthy of that trust.  That is 
part of the reason our justice system is falling into such 
serious disrepute with the general public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the hon. member would care to get out of this hallowed hall 
and go to where he is supposed to be, out west trying to rebuild 
the shattered shreds of his party's support in western Canada, he 
certainly would find out what the general public is thinking 
about the justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Harvard:</B>  Who do you trust? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member keeps 
hollering at the top of his lungs “Who do you trust?”  We trust 
the wisdom of the general public, because they know that the 
justice system is failing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I very calmly tried to bring forward during this debate today 
the very important issue of conditional sentencing and the abuse 
by the courts in the cases of applying it to violent offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One statement the hon. member made which I will agree with, is 
he said that my comments were grating, that comments of Reformers 
were grating on him.  We are the official opposition. I would 
hope that our comments are grating on the Liberal government.  We 
are trying our very best on behalf of the Canadian public to hold 
this bloody government accountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Just before we get 
to the hon. secretary of state, we remind all hon. members to 
keep the tone of the debate respectful to the institution of 
parliament.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ronald J. Duhamel (Secretary of State (Science, Research 
and Development)(Western Economic Diversification), Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will be sharing my time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When this government was re-elected nearly two years ago, we 
pledged as elected officials “to work tirelessly to ensure 
Canada remains a place where Canadians feel secure in their homes 
and on the streets of their communities”. We will protect the 
right of all Canadians to live in healthy, safe communities. We 
have kept this commitment and continue every single day to keep 
it in co-operation with our partners, the provinces, the 
territories and the communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of people have forgotten that the federal government 
enacts laws.  It is the provinces and the territories with their 
communities and the various programs that administer and indeed 
enforce those laws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps during the day there will be a focus on some of the 
exchange that has occurred here.  Are we saying that the laws are 
all wrong, or are we saying that there is a need to improve a 
number of aspects of the system?

<A HREF="#LINKT30"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The focus thus far has been on the federal government.  The 
federal government is not alone.  It has partners.  My colleague 
mentioned the courts, the judges, the prosecutors, the officials 
of the court, the police officers.  Is the Reform Party actually 
saying that the only problem is the laws the Government of Canada 
enacts? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like Reformers to get up from their chairs and confirm 
that. Are they saying other things?  I am not sure they are 
clear.  I think they are trying to frighten people, to suggest 
that all of the malaise for those who commit crimes rests with 
the federal government.  If that is the case, what nonsense.  It 
simplifies the shallow thinking that often goes into these kinds 
of debates.  There is no thinking it through.  It is a little 
more complex than laws. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government fully understands the importance of providing 
Canadians with an environment in which they feel safe.  We have 
taken steps to improve the system and will continue to work 
toward enhancing the quality of life of all Canadians. The 
following are but a few examples of the initiatives we have 
taken to that end. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just yesterday the solicitor general introduced reforms to the 
Criminal Records Act that will make the criminal records of 
pardoned sex offenders available for background checks by 
agencies serving children and other vulnerable groups.  This 
change is about children and we have to be particularly sensitive 
to it. We are committed to protecting them.  I hear heckling on 
that point.  I take it there is disagreement from the Reform 
Party. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week, the Minister of Justice tabled an in-depth review of 
the criminal justice system for youth, the most detailed one in 
15 years, I might add. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Justice introduced a balanced package, a 
comprehensive overhaul of the youth justice system that meets the 
needs of Canadians by clearly distinguishing between violent and 
non-violent crime and by ensuring meaningful consequences for 
both.  As one part of this broad strategy for renewal of youth 
justice in Canada, the new criminal youth justice act will 
replace the Young Offenders Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another initiative to help communities prevent crime in the 
first place is $32 million a year for the national strategy on 
community safety and crime prevention.  To improve the situation 
of Canadians who unfortunately become victims of crime this 
government has taken action. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the ten 10 minutes I have, I could not do justice to all of 
this government's initiatives. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me highlight a few.  The Government of Canada is committed 
to combating organized crime. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Organized crime is not a new phenomenon, but it can take a 
number of forms.  That is why this government has been vigilant 
in changing the tools needed by the forces of order in the fight 
against this scourge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The present government has given those bodies responsible for 
enforcing the law easier access to electronic surveillance in 
order to catch the leaders of organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have seen the scope of the violence caused by 
organized crime, which strikes indiscriminately.  The present 
government has established new offences making involvement in 
criminal organizations a crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the main ways of attacking this type of crime is to 
ensure that the crimes involved do not pay.  While criminal 
organizations cannot be imprisoned, as we all know, they do have 
a character vital to their existence.  This character is 
reflected in their collective wealth.

<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we go after the wealth of an organization, we also go after 
the ties that bind its members to it.  Let us seize the proceeds 
of crime and all organized crime is destabilized. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Experience has demonstrated that co-ordinated enforcement 
efforts are the best way to achieve this goal.  It has expanded 
its integrated proceeds of crime units in the past two years from 
three units to thirteen units in every part of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These units bring together under one roof the talents of all 
those involved in the law enforcement continuum, including the 
RCMP and provincial police, forensic accounting experts, customs 
officers and federal justice lawyers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The efforts made by the government do not stop at our borders 
but include working closely with our foreign partners for the 
purpose of dealing with organized crime in a comprehensive 
fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me now speak about victims of crime.  Since 1999 this 
government has undertaken countless legislative initiatives that 
improve the justice system to benefit victims of crime directly 
and indirectly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These include the enactment of provisions to enhance the 
protection of children victimized by sexual abuse, provisions to 
facilitate the provision of testimony by young victims, 
elimination of the defence of intoxication in crimes of violence 
such as assault and sexual assault, and provisions to restrict 
the production of personal records of sexual offence victims to 
the accused. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know that is not enough.  In its recent report, the 
Commons justice committee confirmed that victims of crime are not 
asking for tough laws, tough penalties, for vengeance or for 
rights to be taken away from the accused. They want a voice, 
respect, information and help to participate in an often 
demanding criminal justice system.  We will give them just that. 
In the next few weeks the Minister of Justice will table a series 
of Criminal Code amendments. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments the minister will introduce in the coming weeks 
will ensure a source of information for victims. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These will ensure that victims receive more information about 
their role in the criminal justice system, services available and 
about the case in which they are involved. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude with these comments. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What have the results been thus far?  The Canadian Centre for 
Justice Statistics reports that in 1997 the rate of police 
reported crime decreased for the sixth year in a row, falling 5%. 
The rate of violent crimes declined for the fifth consecutive 
year, down 1.1% in 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rates decreased for almost all violent offences, including 
sexual assault, robbery and homicide.  The strength of the 
justice system is its ability to constantly evolve and to 
improve. We are looking at measures in which we must do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I simply want to encourage all colleagues to address the issues 
in a comprehensive way.  It is not sufficient to say the laws are 
inadequate. Some are, no doubt.  Some need to be changed, but 
clearly there are other components of the system we need to study 
and where changes are required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To simply say the federal government is responsible for all this 
is an irresponsible statement. 
<P><A NAME="LINK56"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I listened very closely to the remarks of the hon. 
member.  He has quite correctly pointed out that this is not 
about simplistic approaches.  He listed some of the beneficial 
changes that have occurred under this government's 
administration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There should not be the usual sanctimonious tone that we are 
becoming so accustomed to in suggesting this Liberal government 
is the only government that has ever enacted anything positive to 
the Criminal Code or anything that had a beneficial impact on 
Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to one element of his speech concerning 
organized crime, organized crime is becoming a growing problem on 
the streets and in the communities throughout the country, 
particularly in coastal areas in places like Nova Scotia 
where I come from which has a very vulnerable coast line with 
contraband material and drugs coming into the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member is being a bit economical with the truth when he 
suggested this government has somehow done a great deal to combat 
organized crime considering the $74 million that was taken out of 
last year's organized crime budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to hear a little more detail as to what is actually 
being done by this Liberal government to combat increasing 
organized crime in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ronald J. Duhamel:</B>  Mr. Speaker, first of all, there 
is no sanctimony on my part nor have I heard sanctimony on the 
part of my colleagues.  We acknowledge that other governments 
have made contributions.  Clearly what we have today is as a 
result of this government, previous governments and provincial 
and territorial governments.  We have no difficulty in saying 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues and I believe that if people put their minds to 
it, whether they be from my party or another, we can improve a 
law, a process and a number of other initiatives that might be 
undertaken.  I guess my plea was to do exactly that, not to 
simply batter the government for the sake of doing it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate that my colleague from the other side has indicated 
that there have been serious and responsible initiatives 
undertaken by this government that have been implemented.  I 
applaud that because we do not often hear that.  We hear 
selective picking here and there to try to pretend that 
particular incident can be generalized to the whole of Canada. We 
know that is nonsense, that is not accurate and it is not the way 
to conduct oneself. 
<P><A NAME="LINK57"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
contrary to what the member said earlier, I was not heckling.  I 
was just trying to make a point.  The member speaks in such 
glowing terms of the legislation put forward by the solicitor 
general dealing with pedophiles and pardons, which I agree has to 
come forward because we need it. I might remind the House that 
the hon. member for Calgary Centre has private member's Bill 
C-284 in front of a committee right now which is virtually 
identical to what the solicitor general is proposing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was wondering if he would care to give the hon. member for 
Calgary Centre a bit of credit for this. Could he also explain 
why his government does not deal with the private member's bill 
and bring it in rather than bringing in its own legislation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ronald J. Duhamel:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is my point. 
Does it really matter, if a good piece of legislation comes 
forth, who brought it forth?  Is it not intended to benefit 
Canadians?  Should that not be the first goal or is my colleague 
simply asking for an acknowledgement of his colleague?  We will 
bring forth good, strong legislation.  It will respond to the 
needs of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My goal is not to say I did it, you did it.  My goal is to bring 
forth and support legislation that will be useful, significant, 
sensitive and helpful to Canadians. 
<P><A NAME="LINK58"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
coming from the same place as the hon. secretary of state, the 
province of Manitoba, I know he will agree that one of the 
biggest shortcomings that we see in the criminal justice system 
is its treatment of aboriginal people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I read an alarming statistic that in 1969-70 the percentage of 
aboriginal people in the women's penitentiary in Kingston was 
100%.  To this day it is hugely disproportional to the rest of 
the population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having gone through and watched the aboriginal justice inquiry 
in Manitoba and given the recommendations of the royal commission 
on aboriginal people, would the member care to elaborate on how 
the justice system can better serve the aboriginal population, 
especially in the province of Manitoba? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ronald J. Duhamel:</B>  Mr. Speaker, clearly there is a 
disproportionately large number of aboriginal peoples in our 
prisons which begs the question why. Is it because the laws do 
not favour them?  Is it because police officers treat them 
differently?  Is it because the judges or prosecutors treat them 
differently? 
I do not have an answer to that question.  It is a question that 
needs to be studied in a responsible way.  It is not a simple 
answer that is required.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of a number of variables such as poverty, people coming 
to the cities unprepared to make the integration and sometimes 
getting into what one might call slight difficulties, the 
situation has become more serious and more and more people have 
been incarcerated.  There has been a repeat way of approaching 
aboriginal peoples in many instances which does a disservice to 
the aboriginal population.  It does not deal with them well.  In 
fact it deals with them inappropriately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is something we ought to debate in the House.  It is 
something that should be corrected and needs to be corrected.  It 
uses too many resources inappropriately.  Obviously those who 
commit serious crimes need to be treated as any other Canadian 
citizen is.

<P><A NAME="LINK59"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism) (Status of 
Women), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to speak against the 
opposition motion. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First and foremost we have a very broad sweeping motion which 
would have us believe that no initiative has ever been taken in 
the past few years, not only by this government but by 
governments that went before, which has made a difference to many 
initiatives that reflect on the justice system or that deal with 
the issues of justice.  That is what that sweeping motion would 
have us believe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at some facts.  In 1997 Canada's police reported 
crimes dropped 5%.  In fact the police reported crimes dropped 
19% over six years.  In 1997 it was the lowest rate since 1980. 
The rates for all violent crimes were down this year.  There were 
54 fewer homicides than in the previous year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why am putting forward these statistics?  I do not mean to say 
that we have nothing to worry about.  What I am saying is that 
when we cry chicken little we better make sure the sky is indeed 
falling.  I want to be clear that this tendency to create anxiety 
and a sense of fear in the public is what is at the root of this 
kind of opposition motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anyone who understands the issue of justice and the issue of 
creating a safe and secure society knows that creating a safe and 
security society, or creating any kind of society where there is 
social cohesion and where everyone has a sense of belonging, is 
not only done by legislation.  It is not only done by 
enforcement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to look at the root causes of all societal problems.  We 
need preventive measures to deal with those root causes.  We need 
to look at the fact that poverty, alienation, and anger at the 
lack of ability to become a participant in society, to get a 
sense of belonging in society, are at the root of some of the 
reasons persons commit crimes.  That same political party, by not 
recognizing this, has said that if it had its way it would take 
$2.5 billion out of transfers to provinces for social assistance. 
That same opposition party said that if it had the opportunity it 
would cut aboriginal community programs by $800 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to talk about crime and we want to talk about justice, 
and that political party is not even interested in dealing with 
the root causes of crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Prince George—Peace River talked about how 
much he cared about impaired driving and about how concerned he 
was with the carnage that it creates.  In the blue sheets of 1998 
it was the Reform Party that said it would cut funding for all 
special interest groups.  This is a wonderful word that political 
party likes to use.  Community organizations that are seeking to 
partner with government to change society from the very bottom 
level are considered special interest groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we cut funding for all special interest groups, what would 
happen to MADD, a significant organization in helping to deal 
with and bringing forward to governments policy initiatives and 
concerns about drinking and driving?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That party mentioned one of the things it was concerned about 
was drug trafficking.  Let us talk about the fact that 
legislation enforcement is not all that is needed to deal with 
the issue.  That party said that it would cut from fisheries and 
oceans $640 million.  Our coast guard is there to ensure that 
illegal drug shipments are not passed along our coast and into 
the country.  There is an issue of prevention.  There is an issue 
of ensuring that safety and enforcement of our shores is 
carefully taken care of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for St. Albert called it waste in volume 1, issue 4, 
of the blue sheets when the Canadian government decided to fund 
the United Nations fund for drug abuse controls.  Let us not do 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Am I to believe what we are talking about here is that the only 
way to deal with justice is to lock up offenders, throw away the 
key, hang them high and hang them long?  Am I to believe that we 
should simply deal with punishment and enforcement and not look 
at the reality of people's lives? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone who understands societal problems and the way to deal 
with them would be able to look at prevention, which I just spoke 
about; at good legislation; at enforcement of that legislation; 
and at the fact that many criminals can be rehabilitated, 
especially young offenders.  How do we rehabilitate young 
offenders?  How do we assist them to re-enter society so that 
they can contribute as good citizens to societal growth in all 
its social, political, economic and cultural ways? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That does not factor into anything I have heard across the House 
today.  We are talking about isolationist policy here and just 
talking about legislation.  So let us just talk about 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of child pornography was raised by hon. members 
opposite.  That political party would have us use the 
notwithstanding clause to deal with the issue of child 
pornography when there is a process in place.  I think one of my 
colleagues on this side of the House mentioned that the group 
across the way does not trust anyone and anything.  The case is 
being taken by the Attorney General of British Columbia to the 
Supreme Court of Canada.  That is part of the process.  That is 
part of our legal system.  That is how it works. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian government and the Minister of Justice are 
assisting the Attorney General of British Columbia in taking this 
case to the supreme court.  Let us see what the supreme court 
says. If the supreme court says that existing laws dealing with 
possession of child pornography are in contravention of the 
charter then the House, which is a band of legislators, can do 
its job.  It can look at the legislation.  It can find the faults 
and the loopholes.  It can amend it, deal with it, not believe 
that we must ignore the judges of the land and make this 
political place define what judges must do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not what the country is about.  It is not about 
political interference in the courts.  It is about allowing the 
court to do its work and allowing legislators to do what they are 
meant to do if our legislation does not work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On another component of child pornography, it is as if suddenly 
a month ago that political party woke up one day and realized 
there was such a thing called child pornography.  I had never 
heard members of that party speak about it for all the while they 
sat in the House over the last five years.  It was not something 
that concerned them.  It was not something they discussed.  Yet 
all of us know it is an issue that this government and 
governments before have been trying to deal with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1996 we brought a bill to the House in which we increased the 
penalty to a maximum of five years for any pimp who in fact 
commercially exploits children.  The very first world conference 
on the commercial sexual exploitation of children occurred in 
Sweden in September 1996.  Prior to that the government had not 
only brought about a change in the laws to deal with pimps and to 
increase the minimum sentence to five years.  It had also brought 
about some changes that would ensure that Canadians who go abroad 
to indulge in exploiting children in other countries would be 
tried in this country just as if they did it here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time we allowed for young people who were being 
commercially sexually exploited to be able to tell their story in 
court about their pimps and the people who were exploiting them, 
and to do so with the safety of being behind a screen so that 
they could not be identified.

partnership with a special interest group called Kids Friendly 
that is very concerned about the issue of commercial exploitation 
of children and with the tourism industry to start a pilot 
project in British Columbia and to educate Canadians to know that 
commercial sexual exploitation of children occurs in this 
country.  We must be aware of it and do something about it. This 
is what good policy is all about.  This is what a good justice 
system does.  It looks at prevention, public education, 
legislation and enforcement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A great deal of selective caring goes on across the floor of the 
House in the Reform Party.  That party said it cares but it voted 
against gun control legislation, which is one of the major causes 
of violence, especially violence against women.  I guess women 
are also considered to be a special interest group by the members 
across the way, so they would not care about violence against 
women.  Does it really matter who that group trusts? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That group would only trust the laws it makes and those laws 
would not take into consideration justice.  Many of the 
initiatives it voted against in the House were initiatives 
dealing with strengthening the justice system, and that party 
voted no.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
listened with interest to my colleague across the floor.  Before 
I ask her a question I would say that we agree with the concept 
there has to be rehabilitation, and that is where the government 
cut money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also understand that a message has to be sent.  The 
government has had tons of opportunity to bring forward good 
legislation.  Even the Minister of Justice has said that the 
Young Offenders Act was legislation in need of an overhaul, and 
it took a long time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You talk about special interest groups and you talk about 
giving— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Order, please.  The hon. member will 
please address his remarks through the Chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I agree that some of the 
interest groups to which she has been giving money are fine, but 
she has also been wasting money on other interest groups like 
EGALE. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is quite simple.  We agree with her that there has 
to be rehabilitation.  The justice committee said that under the 
new act the age should be reduced to 10.  Why did her government 
ignore that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Hedy Fry:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member would have me 
believe that if there was good legislation they would have voted 
for it.  Bill C-55, an act to amend the Criminal Code, high risk 
offenders, implements new measures to toughen sentencing and— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  Since I was interrupted so many times by the government 
about being in order, Bill C-55 has nothing to do with this bill 
whatsoever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I think the hon. minister was 
referring to Bill C-55 in a previous parliament from the sound of 
the title, but perhaps the minister can clear that matter up when 
she resumes the floor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Hedy Fry:</B>  Mr. Speaker, in a previous parliament. I 
was trying to say that bill was a good bill because it included 
the introduction of indeterminate sentencing for dangerous 
offenders, up to 10 years of community supervision for sex 
offenders following their release from prison, and an extension 
of the earliest date for dangerous offenders initial full parole 
review.  The party across the way voted against it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member further told me that he thought I wasted money 
by funding certain interest groups like EGALE.  I know members 
across the way tend to moralize about the groups they would 
support and not support. EGALE's questionnaire had to do with the 
amount of hate crime against gays in the country, which we know 
is increasing, but I guess violence against gays is not of 
interest to the hon. member across the House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK61"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Sue Barnes (London West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, in 
this debate we have to recognize that there is perception of 
reality and evidence based reality that Canadians will look at. 
Canadians have a great understanding.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look at this motion and the only justice issue that seems to 
be absent from it is gun control.  I would put to the minister 
that maybe this is finally an admission by the Reform Party that 
gun control is supported by the majority of Canadians.  I think 
of the number of lines of print and speeches made in this House 
that centred against this particular piece of legislation when it 
was introduced by the government, even though public opinion 
polls supported it.  Of particular interest would be the issues 
respecting women surrounding the issue, but that is one of the 
areas in this hodgepodge motion that seems to be missing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps I should be applauding this as it may be a recognition 
finally that gun control is supported by members of the 
opposition.  If that is the case, I am certainly very happy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Hedy Fry:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the hon. 
member for her comments.  I think she raises a very important 
point.  We see nothing in the motion from the hon. member across 
the way that deals with the issue of violence against women or 
hate crimes.  Why should it?  In the last session that party 
voted against legislation which would increase sentencing for 
crimes committed because of hate, because of sexual orientation, 
religion and so on, and which would increase sentencing for 
persons who abuse authority or power to commit violence against 
women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to wonder if this is not of interest to that group 
because it is selective about the people it cares about in our 
society. 
<P><A NAME="LINK62"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the minister talks about being selective.  It was 
her party which voted against our motion that would have changed 
the pedophile situation in British Columbia.  If we want to be 
selective, we can do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the bill was originally introduced the government was 
supposed to fund 50% of the Young Offenders Act.  It has never 
funded more than 30%.  It has underfunded the prevention aspect 
of crime ever since it took office.  The Liberals promised to do 
it in the red book and they have never done it.  Prevention is 
underfunded.  Only 30% of the YOA has been funded.  When are 
they— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The hon. Minister of State for the 
Status of Women for a very short response. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Hedy Fry:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would ask the hon. member 
to look at the fact that there has recently been a crime 
prevention initiative which is a partnership initiative that 
works with communities, municipalities and other groups.  There 
will be $32 million per year over five years to deal with the 
issues of crime prevention. 
<P><A NAME="LINK63"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to remind the last speaker that I consider one victim 
of crime just as important as the next victim of crime, 
regardless of who they are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to speak to the Reform Party supply day motion, 
which can be referred to as justice day.  There has been precious 
little in the way of justice coming from the government.  I will 
be speaking primarily in the area of young offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The young offenders legislation is a prime example of misplaced 
priorities by this government.  In June of 1997, almost two years 
ago, the Minister of Justice made amending the Young Offenders 
Act one of her top priorities.  She is on record as acknowledging 
that the Young Offenders Act is easily the most unpopular piece 
of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One would think that recognition of this sort would impress upon 
the government the importance of bringing forth proper 
legislation without delay.  But did this government appreciate 
the demands of Canadians?  No, it did not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all have vivid memories of the minister's continued promises, 
week by week and month by month, that legislation was coming. She 
continued to promise that it would come in a timely manner, that 
she was dealing with it in a timely fashion, that the legislation 
was complicated and should not be brought forward with a 
simplistic answer just to appease the citizens of this country. 
It was painfully obvious that the minister was just making 
excuses for not having the legislation ready. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen how disorganized the government has been with the 
new youth criminal justice legislation.  We have seen how the 
government pretends to listen to Canadians but then proceeds in 
the same manner as it always has.  We have seen how the 
government continues to believe that it knows best about what 
Canadians should have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not be dealing very extensively with the legislation 
introduced last week by the Minister of Justice.  I anticipate 
that we will have sufficient opportunity to debate the failings 
of that legislation, hopefully in the near future.  Today we are 
talking about the failures of this government in a whole host of 
justice issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to provide a little history to the long overdue 
amendments to our young offenders legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1996 the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights 
conducted an extensive review of the Young Offenders Act.  Nearly 
$500,000 was spent.  Meetings were held right across the country. 
The provinces had ample opportunity for input.  The message as 
to what changes were necessary was absolutely clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The standing committee submitted an extensive report with a 
number of recommendations.  The Bloc submitted a dissenting 
report. 
My hon. colleague from Crowfoot attempted to submit an extensive 
report in dissent.  Instead of receiving his report and studying 
it to determine whether there was anything left out or anything 
of value from another perspective, this government played a 
purely political game and refused to accept his report.  It said 
that it was too long. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1305"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT38"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT38"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1305

<A HREF="#LINKT37"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Crowfoot participated in the committee hearings 
as much as anyone.  He handled almost the entire workload on the 
young offenders legislation for the Reform Party.  He took the 
effort to properly critique the legislation and propose practical 
and positive changes for the benefit of all Canadians, but the 
government refused to accept his contribution.  Only in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Crowfoot is a very determined individual. 
He did not give up.  He instead introduced private member's Bill 
C-210 in which he proposed formalizing the power of police 
officers to use discretion in resolving minor incidents without 
laying charges.  He personally knew about this problem in the 
legislation as he is a former police officer.  He listened to 
what the witnesses had to say in this regard.  He proposed that 
the legislation differentiate between non-violent and violent 
crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He understood the value of dealing with first time non-violent 
young offenders in a more informal manner.  He understood that 
there is neither necessity nor practicality in sending these 
minor offenders to court and possibly to jail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was not playing the political game; he was doing what was 
right on behalf of Canadians.  Of course, he had the full support 
of the Reform Party with his initiative.  However, the government 
refused to listen to him.  It refused to even allow him to submit 
his report.  Unfortunately, his private member's bill was never 
drawn for debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my previous comments I mentioned that the minister 
continually promised to bring forth the youth legislation in a 
timely fashion.  She spoke of having to consult with her 
provincial counterparts.  They had ample opportunity to present 
their views and concerns to the justice committee.  They clearly 
indicated their interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One example was in the area of funding.  It was made known that 
the federal government was shortchanging the provinces in the 
area of funding for youth justice.  The funding formula was to be 
on the basis of 50% federal dollars and 50% from the provinces. 
Things were getting so bad that Manitoba was threatening to 
withdraw from the administration of youth justice because its 
costs were too high and because the federal government was not 
holding up its end of the bargain.  Remember, this was back in 
1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did the minister even attempt to restore funding for youth 
justice in the 1998 budget?  No, she did not.  Were funds 
available in that budget?  Of course they were.  We will remember 
that the government spent $2.5 billion on the millennium 
scholarship fund in that budget.  The whole $2.5 billion was 
written off as an expense, even though the funds were not to be 
spent until future years.  It was just a way for the government 
to claim that it had a balanced budget and that there was no 
surplus for other things.  It just shows the misplaced priorities 
of the government.  It just shows how the minister was unable or 
unwilling to deal with youth justice legislation on a priority 
basis.  The wheels of justice were grinding slowly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government was not even on track.  I believe the government 
was hoping the controversy over the Young Offenders Act would go 
away.  It is to the credit of Canadians that they did not let 
this happen.  They kept up the pressure for change, but the 
procrastination continued and the excuses for delays continued. 
The minister kept promising that the legislation would be 
introduced last fall, but then she realized that she did not have 
the necessary funding.  She had to wait until the February 
budget.  She said that her delays were because the legislation 
was so complex, that it would not be a simplistic approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week Canadians finally saw the long awaited legislation. 
What did they get?  They got a new name for the young offenders 
legislation.  It is now to be called the youth criminal justice 
act.  What else did they get?  They got legislation that promises 
to introduce a different system of justice from province to 
province to province.  They got a system whereby very violent 
young offenders will continue to be protected from identification 
in many situations.  They got a system whereby these violent 
young offenders will continue to be returned to our communities, 
where citizens will be unaware of their background and the 
potential danger some of them may pose.  They got a system 
whereby violent and repeat young offenders will be subject to 
what the government calls extra-judicial measures, but what is in 
effect nothing more than conditional sentencing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government continues to believe that it and only it knows 
what is best for Canadians.  The justice committee of the last 
parliament, a committee dominated by Liberals, a committee 
chaired by our late colleague Shaughnessy Cohen, on the testimony 
of its own expert witness, recommended that 10 and 11 year old 
violent offenders be subject to criminal proceedings, and the 
government refused to listen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead, government members portray members on this side of the 
House as being monsters who would jail children.  The minister 
claims that child welfare and mental illness programs will look 
after these unfortunate children.  She refuses to acknowledge 
that those programs are already failing.

accommodated, when in fact they require immediate assistance to 
reform and rehabilitate before they venture into more violent and 
dangerous activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government does these 10 and 11 year olds a serious 
disservice by merely ignoring them and hoping that other less 
practical measures can handle the problem.  It is just more 
offloading on to the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have stated, the government is not to be admired when it 
comes to its handling of the youth justice platform.  It has 
delayed, broken promises and made excuses.  It has refused to 
listen to Canadians and to fellow members of parliament.  It has 
let the provinces down.  It does not have an enviable record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the upcoming debates on the new legislation we will see many 
further instances of the failures of the government in the area 
of youth justice. 
<P><A NAME="LINK64"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I noted with some interest the way in which there were sections 
of legislation that were of some concern to my colleague in the 
Reform Party that were taken by the justice minister when she 
came forward with the new Young Offenders Act.  However, I am 
sure he must have noticed yesterday the solicitor general 
deciding that he was going to come forward with legislation, 
amendments to the Criminal Code, which would red flag people who 
have received pardons for their offences if those pardons related 
to sexual offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would imagine hon. members also probably noted that our Reform 
colleague from Calgary Centre has already had that legislation in 
its basic form go through the House of Commons.  As a matter of 
fact, there is an argument to be made that the legislation by my 
colleague from Calgary Centre, in its own way, in many details is 
superior to the legislation that the solicitor general brought 
forward yesterday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It strikes me as being strange, and I ask him if it also strikes 
him as being strange, that we have legislation that has gone 
through second reading in the House and which will be before the 
justice committee this week.  Any amendments that the government 
wants to make to get it into a form that is more to its 
liking—although the similarities are so close that I can only 
imagine some tinkering around the edges—could be made and this 
bill could be reported back to the House of Commons for third 
reading and passed by the will of the people who represent 
Canadians in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wondered if my colleague has any idea why in the world the 
solicitor general would have simply lifted the Reform Party 
private member's legislation and put it into the situation where 
it will likely be delayed.  The reporting requirement of sexual 
offenders who have received pardons will again be delayed, so 
that Big Brothers, Scouts and other organizations like that will 
not have this legislation.  I wonder if he has any insight into 
why in the world the Liberals would be ripping off Reform 
legislation and, in effect, delaying its ability to be passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Cadman:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague 
for his question.  I was wondering about that myself yesterday 
when I heard the legislation come forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer to my own private member's bill which is before the 
House now and which deals with parental accountability under the 
Young Offenders Act.  The minister saw fit to include my ideas, 
word for word, into the new legislation.  For that I am grateful 
because I firmly believe that if there is a good idea that comes 
from this place, then it deserves to be implemented, regardless 
of where it comes from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I certainly have questions about the issue that the hon. member 
raised.  The member for Calgary Centre has Bill C-284 before the 
committee right now.  It is a lot further along in the system 
than that which was proposed by the solicitor general.  For the 
life of me, I cannot figure out why the government would not just 
go ahead and deal with the bill of the hon. member for Calgary 
Centre and amend it if requires amending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is quite possible that the solicitor general's image needs a 
bit of a boost right now.  Maybe that is why the government is 
doing it.  That could be my only answer. 
<P><A NAME="LINK65"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys,

It provided a number of useful suggestions.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the areas which I believe is currently being pursued by 
members from all parties in this House is the whole issue of 
consecutive sentencing for people who have committed a number of 
multiple crimes like murder, rape and violent assault. Is my 
friend one of the people supporting this initiative?  Does he 
believe this is a step in the right direction in terms of sending 
a signal that there are people which society needs to be 
protected from, that in no way ought we ever to consider people 
who have committed a number of terrible crimes be released into 
the general public again? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Cadman:</B>  Mr. Speaker, yes, I firmly support 
consecutive sentencing, especially in the area of serious violent 
offences and multiple violent offences.  I would remind the hon. 
member that it is available now for judges to use at their 
discretion but it is never used.  It is due time for this place 
to mandate its use in certain cases. 
<P><A NAME="LINK66"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise very proudly as a member of the Reform Party because it 
seems as though we are the one party in Canada that keeps on 
forcing the issue on making streets safe for Canadians and for 
all of the people in Canada who are concerned— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I realize this looks a little funny since I am standing right 
beside the person making the presentation, but it is the only way 
I can make an intervention.  I know my friend did not mean to be 
misrepresentative when he said that the Reform Party is the only 
party in the House of Commons that is concerned about safety in 
the streets.  I wonder if I could ask my friend to clarify that 
for me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  This clearly is not a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I say again that the Reform 
Party is very proud of being at the forefront of bringing these 
issues to the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We start with the police officer on the street.  The RCMP cover 
most areas of Canada, with the exception of Newfoundland, Quebec 
and Ontario.  The RCMP budget is $1.9 billion.  Even in those 
other jurisdictions I just mentioned they have some jurisdiction 
which relates to national policing interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has trimmed $174 million from the budget in which 
there was no fat in the first place.  We believe that spending 
must be prioritized to ensure only those operations proven 
effective in fighting the war on crime continue to receive 
funding. My point was that it had already reached that point when 
the government chose to cut a further $174 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The RCMP fundamentally are handcuffed at a time of fiscal 
restraint.  It had a tremendously devastating effect not only on 
the morale of the RCMP officers in the province of British 
Columbia but also particularly on their ability to get their job 
done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were assignments shut down last fall, assignments where 
there had already been time and resources invested, particularly 
overtime.  Believe it or not, it reached a point where undercover 
operators were told they could not even use their cell phones. 
There were patrol vehicles that did not have tires to get out on 
the highway.  There were other patrol vehicles for which there 
was not even gasoline. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What kind of planning is this?  What kind of priority is it that 
this Liberal government has that it would permit a situation, not 
just in British Columbia but very acutely in British Columbia, 
where even the police on the street are not given the tools to be 
on the street. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform agrees that the RCMP and all governments must be 
accountable.  However, there cannot be this gratuitous cutting 
every time it runs into a situation.  I have been told that in 
many situations the RCMP are no longer able to provide an 
adequate level of service to the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have already released to the public a confidential RCMP 
report. It was originally released by the RCMP.  It calls B.C. a 
major centre for the importation of child porn.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We know as a result of the inaction on the part of this 
government that British Columbia is the only jurisdiction where 
the simple possession of child pornography is a statute that 
currently cannot be enforced.  It is going through a long 
process, as one of the junior ministers said earlier.  It is 
going through a long process but in the meantime the clock is 
ticking for people who are caught in this web.  The clock is 
ticking, their cases are being put off and we are going to reach 
a point where the justice system is going to say their cases have 
been put off for too long. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the RCMP commercial crime unit, in December 1998 a consulting 
firm recommended doubling the economic crime branch's budget to 
$100 million because the RCMP white collar crime branch was 
unable to do its job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the Liberal government which is tying the hands by 
constraining the resources available to the police on the street 
to be able to get their job done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had promises, promises and promises.  Ever since I was 
elected in 1993 I can recall promises about money laundering. 
When there is illegal and illicit activity, particularly as it 
relates to prostitution, drugs or any of those illegal efforts, 
they have to find some way of getting the money they get in from 
that effort back into the system so that they can reclaim it so 
the money is of some value.  The key to organized crime is to 
have effective workable money laundering legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The person who is currently the Deputy Prime Minister was the 
solicitor general. The member for Fredericton was the solicitor 
general.  Now the member from Prince Edward Island is the 
solicitor general.  Again he is promising on behalf of this 
government that we are going to have money laundering 
legislation. Promises, promises, promises. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The head of criminal intelligence at Interpol has said that 
police are losing the fight against criminals in cyberspace and 
will have to take giant strides to catch up on the information 
highway.  He stated:  “Drug traffickers, pedophiles and money 
launderers have found the Internet to be an increasingly 
effective tool as the number of users hits 100 million”.  In my 
office I have an intelligence report to the RCMP about 
information technology and just how far ahead of the RCMP and 
other law enforcement agencies are those who use the system 
illegally and illicitly for their own purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government also saw fit to see the Regina training centre 
for new police officers temporarily closed.  What happened to the 
people who were in the system, to the men and women who had 
decided they were going to join the RCMP and were already in the 
system and then boom they were out the door? That is the end of 
them.  Now there is a fresh start. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Meanwhile a tremendous number of people in the RCMP, because of 
this lack of funding and the lack of ability to get the job done, 
are becoming increasingly frustrated.  They are also reaching a 
voluntary retirement age. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What was the government doing in permitting the Regina training 
centre to be shut down?  Of course it did not permit it; it 
simply squeezed off the resources so that the Regina training 
centre could not be funded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been involved with the APEC inquiry by the public 
complaints commission in Vancouver.  To date it has spent $1.3 
million. That is just the money for the public complaints 
commission, let alone all of the lawyers who are there to protect 
the Prime Minister's interests.  Millions and millions of dollars 
will go into the APEC inquiry. If the Prime Minister would simply 
agree to turn up and tell his version of the story, we would save 
millions of dollars just for that one event alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One other issue of particular interest to me is the Canadian 
Police Information Centre, CPIC.  It is operated through a 
national police service. 
CPIC allows the police forces across the country to have access 
to criminal records. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1325"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT41"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Police Association says “This priceless tool is in 
desperate need of resources to update the system”.  It points 
out that CPIC is a 20 year old technology. The sharing of 
information back and forth across the country by police forces as 
they roll up behind a vehicle or as they accost an individual is 
absolutely invaluable, yet CPIC is on the verge of total 
collapse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>CPIC is completely bulging at the seams with information. It 
needs approximately $200 million to upgrade the system. Where 
have I heard $200 million before?  I remember, $200 million is 
the amount of money the government is spending registering the 
guns of law-abiding gun owners.  The irony in this is that if the 
government in its meagre effort were to put that information into 
CPIC, it would destroy CPIC by overloading it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is better?  Do we spend $200 million to go after 
law-abiding citizens to register their weapons, or do we spend 
$200 million on a system that will track vehicles, track AWOL 
prisoners, track people with criminal records, track all sorts of 
criminal elements?  Where is the best place to spend resources? 
Considering the way in which this government strangles the 
ability of our police forces to do their jobs, I suggest that the 
$200 million could be more intelligently reallocated.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Labour, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I too met with the RCMP and 
the railway police when they were here last week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to note that Reform members do not have a 
monopoly on justice in Canada.  They do not have a monopoly on 
being sympathetic with the police when Reform says the police 
need more money.  Let me also say there is hardly a group that 
does not come here that in their opinion does not need or require 
more money.  It is very difficult as a government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My father-in-law often said to me that it is easy to be in 
opposition.  Opposition members can say anything. They do not 
have to prove anything.  They simply open their mouths and 
anything can come out and when it does, they never have to prove 
it. To a degree and in fairness, the opposition's job is to try 
to poke holes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I sometimes get saddened that we do not talk about the good 
things in Canada.  We do have a low crime rate.  There is no 
doubt about it.  Reform members want Canada to be like the U.S. 
with a gun behind every door.  They want to have health care like 
in the U.S.  The reality is that is not what Canadians want. This 
government has put money into health care and education. Yes, it 
has tried to put money toward tax cuts.  Yes, it has a zero 
deficit.  Yes, it has started to pay down the debt.  We have done 
a lot of good things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I met with the police officers last week, they told me they 
understood and accepted that.  And yes, they said they required 
more money and I believe they probably do. One of the things they 
pointed out was that if they had more money, particularly for 
some of the special projects, and perhaps this is what my hon. 
colleague across the way was referring to, they would be able to 
have those proceeds go into the community.  The Liberals were the 
ones who allowed that to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support more money in that direction also, but in correlation 
and in a rational and responsible way with everything else we 
have to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. colleague did not make any mention of the fact that our 
colleague from Kamloops talked about poverty being a major cause 
of crime.  Could my hon. colleague talk about poverty within the 
nation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would sooner speak about 
the fact that this government has decided one way it can save 
money is to go to a 50:50 release program by Correctional 
Services Canada and the National Parole Board.

in federal institutions. There are 8,000 federal offenders on 
conditional release, 753 of whom are now missing. That is 1 in 
10, not too good a statistic. Forty five convicted rapists remain 
missing. Fifty per cent have been missing for more than a year. 
Now the commissioner of Correctional Service Canada has a quota 
system asking for the elimination of 50% of the inmates who are 
presently incarcerated.  That is a good way to cut down on 
expenses but all the more need for us to have a CPIC system that 
would work and be able to keep track of the people they are 
deciding to shoo out the door presumably to cut down on their 
costs.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I will be sharing my time with the member for Mississauga South. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to enter this debate today on behalf of the people 
of my riding of Waterloo—Wellington who feel strongly about our 
criminal justice system.  Certainly as the former chairman of the 
Waterloo regional police, I too have a strong and keen interest 
in justice matters as they relate to Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I note with great dismay that the opposition motion is proposing 
to criticize the government for, among other things, failing to 
deliver youth justice programs and legislation that reflect the 
concern of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me remind the House that our government launched a strategy 
for the renewal of youth justice on May 12, 1998 that will be 
effective in dealing with the complex problem of youth crime.  I 
point out that it is complex and not a simplistic matter as the 
Reform Party would paint it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, last week this government tabled a bill that is a key 
component of the youth justice strategy, the youth criminal 
justice act.  The recent federal budget included $206 million 
over the next three years to ensure that programs are put in 
place to help achieve the objectives of the legislation.  This is 
but a recent example of a long list of initiatives we as a 
government have undertaken over the years to protect Canadians 
wherever they may live in this great land of ours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's strategy for the renewal of youth justice 
recognizes the foremost objectives of public protection.  It 
distinguishes between legislation and programs appropriate for 
the small group of violent young offenders and those appropriate 
for the vast majority of non-violent young offenders.  It takes a 
much broader, more integrated approach and emphasizes prevention 
and rehabilitation.  This is precisely what Canadians want us to 
do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue facing us and those interested in the youth justice 
system is not whether the system should be tough or lenient but 
whether to be made to deal with crime in a sensible way.  The 
proposals as outlined indicate clearly that youth crime should be 
met with meaningful consequences.  What is meaningful depends in 
large part on what the young offender has done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, most of us believe that youths who commit minor 
thefts or who are found to be in possession of stolen property 
should be held accountable for their actions.  Last year we sent 
4,355 of them into custody where the most serious offence was one 
of minor property offences.  Another 4,332 youths were put in 
custody for the offence of failure to comply with a disposition, 
typically violating a term of probation order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are both offences and those who are found to have 
committed these offences should be held accountable. We know that 
and we think that is appropriate. These two groups of offences 
constitute over one-third of the custodial sentences handed down 
to youth last year.  Being the lead jailer of children in the 
western world is surely not a preferred answer to our problems 
with youth crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The median custodial sentence for youth is 45 days.  This will 
cost us as taxpayers as much as $9,000. Let me be clear here.  No 
one is saying these youths should not be held accountable for 
their actions.  They should and they will.  Their offences should 
result in meaningful consequences. We must ask ourselves whether 
taking these youths to court and sending them to prison is 
invariably the best way to accomplish this.  We need to ask 
ourselves whether it makes more sense to spend $9,000 locking up 
a minor thief or someone who has violated curfew or if there are 
other ways to spend that money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The choice is not one of doing nothing or putting a young person 
in prison.  There are programs in all parts of Canada for holding 
young people accountable for what they have done so they do not 
involve courts and jails but which do involve the victims. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1335"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT43"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The youth criminal justice act recognizes extrajudicial 
non-court measures as being important and the most effective way 
to deal with less serious youth crime.  The act supports the use 
of such measures wherever they would be capable of holding the 
young person accountable, and this we must do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The act clearly provides that these measures should encourage 
the repair of harm caused to the victim and to the community. 
They should also promote the involvement of families, victims and 
the community in ensuring an appropriate meaningful consequence 
for that young person.  In order to encourage the use of creative 
and effective consequences for our young people, the act supports 
the appropriate exercise of discretion by police officers and 
prosecutors.  The act recognizes a range of approaches that can 
provide meaningful consequences, including police warnings, 
formal cautions, referrals to community programs, cautions by 
prosecutors and other sanctions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the formal court process is required many sentences other 
than custody can provide meaningful consequences for youth crime. 
Community based alternatives are often more effective than 
custody and they are encouraged by this new legislation, 
particularly for low risk, non-violent offenders. Alternatives 
that require young people to repay victims and society for the 
harm done teach responsibility and respect for others and 
reinforce our shared social values. When these front end measures 
and non-custodial sentences are used effectively the provinces 
can reinvest the money that is saved into crime prevention 
strategies that will address the legitimate concerns Canadians 
have about crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As part of its strategy for the renewal of youth justice, the 
federal government has committed itself to a wide range of 
prevention programs, which is important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this context I was not surprised to learn recently that 
public opinion polls show that over 85% of Ontario residents 
would prefer money to be invested in crime prevention, which is 
much more than would want additional prisons for youth. This 
reflects the thinking of the residents of Waterloo—Wellington. 
Almost as many people, 79%, would prefer us to invest in 
alternatives to prison for youth rather than in prison 
construction.  That is very telling and underscores the 
commitment of Canadians in this very important area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other side of the coin is that by dealing sensibly with 
minor crime we can refocus the system on the serious crime 
Canadians have legitimate concerns about.  The new act's 
sentencing principles make it very clear that youth sentences 
should reflect the seriousness of the offence and the degree of 
responsibility of the young person.  Custody will be targeted to 
youth who commit violent and serious repeat offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the new legislation judges will be required to impose a 
period of supervision in the community following custody that is 
equal to half the period of the custody.  This will allow 
authorities to closely monitor and control the young person and 
to ensure he or she receives the necessary treatment and programs 
to return successfully to the community.  The period of 
supervision administered by the provinces will include stringent 
mandatory and optional conditions tailored to the individual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a youth's sentence is not adequate to hold the young person 
accountable, the court may impose an adult sentence.  The new 
legislation will make it easier to impose adult sentences for the 
most serious violent offenders.  We are expanding both the list 
of offences and lowering the age at which youth can receive an 
adult sentence. When the legislation is passed, youth 14 and 
older who are convicted of murder, attempted murder, 
manslaughter, aggravated sexual assault, et cetera, will receive 
an adult sentence unless a judge can be persuaded otherwise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are creating a fifth presumptive category for repeat violent 
offenders where young offenders 14 and older who demonstrate a 
pattern of violent behaviour will receive an adult sentence 
unless a judge can be persuaded otherwise.  This repeat offender 
presumption is in addition to the fact that even one serious 
offence can result in an adult sentence if the prosecutor 
requests it and the court is satisfied it is appropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed legislation provides for a new sentencing option 
for the most violent high risk young offenders.  The intensive 
rehabilitative custody and supervision order provides greater 
control and guaranteed treatment to address the causes of the 
young person's violent behaviour.  An individualized plan of 
treatment and intensive supervision must be approved by the 
court.  Additional federal resources have been allocated for the 
costs of this new sentencing option. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Accomplishing the objectives of the new legislation will not be 
easy.  Clearly much of the work needs to be done by the provinces 
which administer Canada's criminal law.  We know that. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1340"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT44"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thus it is important that there be adequate time for discussion 
and implementation planning with the provinces and others 
involved in the administration of our youth justice system in 
order to ensure that we have the best possible youth justice 
system that can respond appropriately to the wide range of 
problems brought to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Youth crime cannot be legislated away.  We can, however, deal 
with it more appropriately than we are doing at the moment.  We 
can set up effective programs outside the youth justice system 
and custodial and non-custodial rehabilitation programs within it 
that will reduce crime. I think it is important that we move in 
that manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has and will continue to deliver on criminal 
justice programs.  The youth criminal justice act is the most 
recent example of our ability to deal effectively and 
compassionately with these kinds of very complex issues.  As a 
result we have enhanced the safety and security of Canadians no 
matter where they live in this great country.  All Canadians are 
well served by the actions of our government when it comes to 
these kinds of matters. 
<P><A NAME="LINK69"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B>   Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my hon. colleague for his speech.  It was a very statesman-like 
speech and he addressed the issues, I thought, in a commendable 
way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He mentioned there are too many young offenders who are 
incarcerated and who ought not to be, non-violent offenders.  It 
is his government that has been here for six years and it is his 
government that has the power to change that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At least a year and a half ago I introduced a private member's 
bill that would address that very issue as well as a number of 
others. The contents of that private member's bill which is still 
sitting to be drawn yet, flow directly from the testimony placed 
before the standing committee as we went about this country on 
the 10 year review of the Young Offenders Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the member has read that private member's bill.  I 
am sure he must have, showing his interest as he has today on 
that topic, as the majority of his speech was based on the young 
offenders situation, which I find commendable. If he has, he can 
see there is support for those principles, certainly within the 
official opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is quite clear the hon. member has no greater power than we 
in moving the government forward in a timely fashion to rectify 
some of the weaknesses within the justice system that he has 
recognized place young people in custody who ought not to be 
there.  There are better ways of dealing with them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the hon. member would comment as to whether he is 
aware of the expression of support for those very principles by 
the official opposition as contained within my private member's 
bill still sitting to be drawn.  I wonder if he recognizes that 
awareness, that there is support for these kinds of initiatives. 
Yet it is his government that has taken six years and we still 
have not seen the type of legislative initiative that would 
correct these matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an anomaly I would certainly like the hon. member to touch 
on because, as I said earlier, he seems to have a sincere 
interest in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for the 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly in terms of young offenders and the fact that we have 
a number of people in jail right now, there are other ways to 
treat them and deal with them in a more effective manner.  I 
think it is certainly a strong point and one that needs to be 
recognized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am aware of the private member's bill to which the hon. member 
refers.  We as a government with our recent legislation have 
acted in a very meaningful way in this whole area with the youth 
criminal justice act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It underscores the ability of the government to recognize a 
strong movement in this area.  It underscores the commitment of 
the government to move in a way that is consistent with the 
thinking of Canadians in this all important youth justice area. 
It underscores our commitment on this side of the House to do 
something that we know is in the best interest of Canadians 
wherever they live.

commend the member on his speech and his thoughtful 
consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a short question on the presumptive transfer aspects. 
Could the member provide some rationale as to why we have a 
presumptive transfer for murder, manslaughter, aggravated sexual 
assault and attempted murder, and yet nowhere do we see anything 
on the presumptive transfer side for sexual assault with a weapon 
or any firearms related offences which are very serious crimes? 
Would the member care to comment on the rationale for not 
including those more serious offences? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is fair to say that we on 
the government side gave careful consideration to all those 
factors.   At the end of the day it was determined that we should 
proceed in the manner that has been outlined, knowing that it is 
the best way in which to proceed in the interest of safety and 
security for all Canadians. 
<P><A NAME="LINK71"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
today the House is considering an opposition motion to the effect 
that the government has failed to deliver criminal justice 
programs and laws which reflect the will and concerns of the 
majority of Canadians and as a consequence has put individual 
safety and in some case cases national security in jeopardy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a useful and constructive motion to put before the 
House.  It provides an opportunity for all sides to comment on 
various aspects of the criminal justice system.  Some referred to 
specific cases where they felt the laws had allowed certain 
judgments to occur which were not in the best interest of 
Canadians, and others highlighted some of the initiatives taken 
on behalf of the Government of Canada and on behalf of the 
Parliament of Canada to continue to be vigilant with regard to 
issues related to criminal justice and to strengthening it over 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many issues have been raised by members.  I want to concentrate 
my comments on the issue of child pornography which seized the 
House not so long ago with regard to a B.C. court decision.  The 
case against the defendant involving the possession of child 
pornography was not successful and the judge ruled in favour of 
the defendant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That issue is one of the reasons we continue to hear statements 
or phrases like judge-made law.  Members will know that decision 
affected the laws of Canada as they apply in B.C.  It is a 
decision, however, that the House unanimously concurs was a bad 
decision.  The possession of child pornography and child 
pornography in its essence are wrong because they must involve 
child abuse to exist.  There was no disagreement in this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debate had to do with how the Government of Canada 
approaches situations like this one.  The opposition put forth a 
motion in which it suggested that the government should initiate 
legislation which would reinstate the law.  In essence that is 
what Canadians want.  They wanted that decision to be reversed 
and for the law to be in place and unaffected by that decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One critical issue has to do with the mechanisms or the means by 
which reinstating the law would be effected.  The opposition 
motion suggested a legislative process including enacting section 
33(1) of the charter, the so-called notwithstanding clause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not a lawyer.  I am not on the justice committee. Therefore 
I have to rely on others for briefings on information relevant to 
issues before the House. 
I had a specific question with regard to the notwithstanding 
clause which was very important to me in terms of the way I dealt 
with the issue with my constituents and how I voted in the House. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1350"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT46"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The media had spun the story that the government basically voted 
not to do anything.  It was alarming to Canadians that somehow 
the government would not take action when in fact the government 
did do something. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The options available to the government certainly were to invoke 
the notwithstanding clause, and there is a debate on when it 
should be invoked.  There was also the option of appealing it 
directly to the Supreme Court of Canada.  Another option was that 
the government could appeal it to the appeal court of B.C. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I asked about some of these options it became very clear to 
me that the notwithstanding clause was not available to be 
applied retroactively.  That was very important for me.  If we 
invoked the notwithstanding clause it would mean that the case 
which gave rise to the debate in the first place would be 
unaffected by the decision of parliament.  I was concerned that 
we had this powerful tool but it would not deal with that case, 
and I assume other cases that were before the courts, and 
therefore people would slip through the cracks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of going to the Supreme Court of Canada was another 
option, which is generally the approach that the Government of 
Canada through the Parliament of Canada would take. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From discussions I had with the Minister of Justice I understood 
the supreme court docket had been filled up for some six months 
and that it would take more than six months at a minimum before 
the matter could even be considered by that court.  To me that 
would not be swift and strong action on the part of the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing I asked about, which ultimately came to pass, was the 
Attorney General of B.C. appealing that decision.  The Government 
of Canada, in a very rare show of support and I guess action, 
actually announced that it would join in that appeal. Not only 
was it to join in that appeal in B.C.  It was to co-operate in 
terms of seeking adjournments of any other cases before the 
courts.  It was to continue to support the police in terms of 
continuing their investigations and the laying of charges as if 
that decision had not taken place.  It was also to support the 
request that the appeal with regard to the Sharpe case would be 
heard on a very timely basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians should know, if they have not read about it, that the 
appeal is being heard on April 26 and April 27.  It is my view 
that because of the swiftness in the judicial system it will be 
dealt with in an appropriate fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the decision that was made, it concerned me a bit 
that the defendant went before the trial division and represented 
himself without a lawyer and won the case against the Attorney 
General of B.C.  I inquired of the people who were in a position 
to know about how such a thing could happen how the force of the 
laws of Canada and the strength of our laws with regard to 
protecting the rights of children could fail when someone is 
simply defending his right to possess child pornography.  It just 
did not make sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was quite clear to me that somehow or other the case provided 
on behalf of the office of the attorney general was clearly 
flawed in some way.  The judgment of the court has to be based on 
the evidence provided to the judge.  Although there was some 
latitude, it would appear that the case was not well argued.  For 
that reason alone it is extremely important to go right back to 
the appeal of that original case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of this process I believe the outcome will be that 
the ruling will be overturned, that Sharpe will be found guilty 
of possession of child pornography, and that not one case will 
have slipped through the cracks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wanted to raise that case because from the information I got 
from my constituents and the media reports on what actually 
happened in the House of Commons in the debate and in the 
government actions did not fairly reflect the reality that the 
notwithstanding clause is not retroactively applied and could not 
have dealt with the situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to touch very briefly on two other issues.  The 
first issue concerning impaired driving has been raised by many 
members. 
I have long worked with Mothers Against Drunk Driving.  It has 
done an excellent job on behalf of Canadians in terms of raising 
awareness of this very serious situation in Canada.  I fully 
support its changes with regard to initiatives such as lowering 
the blood alcohol threshold.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other issue concerns consecutive sentencing.  My colleague 
and neighbour in Mississauga, the member for Mississauga East, 
has worked very diligently on a file to do with consecutive 
sentencing.  It is a very controversial issue for some, but when 
looking at the cases and the circumstances it becomes very clear 
that the issue about whether or not Canada should be considering 
something like consecutive sentencing as opposed to concurrent 
sentencing becomes a very relevant and valid debate for this 
place.  I hope this place will have the opportunity to fully deal 
with the issue.  It is an issue Canadians would like to see dealt 
with in this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have had many conversations with constituents on the Young 
Offenders Act.  I am very pleased that the justice minister 
brought forward, after extensive consultation with Canadians, 
more information and proposals for this place to consider.  It is 
an important area for us to deal with.  I am very confident that 
parliament through the House and its committees, et cetera, will 
ensure that we make the necessary changes to that law to ensure 
it is an appropriate law for all Canadians.

voice to 17 million frustrated Canadian taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the parties in the House put forward their competing 
visions and arm themselves with reams of stats, a curious 
phenomenon appeared.  It seems that no one can be completely 
wrong on this issue.  The fact is that the tax system has become 
so convoluted, archaic, out of touch and incomprehensible that it 
has become the Liberal government's model for its new firearms 
registry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be clear.  The best tax system for the country is one 
that seeks to lighten the burden of all citizens and businesses. 
That system must be understandable, accountable and neutral, 
allowing Canadians to make their own choices by keeping the 
greater part of their earnings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time to reject the Liberal obsession with growing revenues

the Canadian Police Information Centre, CPIC, is operated through

identification numbers to track stolen vehicles, escaped convicts 
and parolees gone AWOL. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week the Canadian Police Association estimated the cost to 
upgrade CPIC would be about $200 million. This government can 
easily find those dollars with one stroke of a pen.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

policies of this government.  The Canadian people are very happy 
that we have taken unemployment from 11.4% to 7.8%.  The Canadian 
public is quite happy about the fact that we have reduced the 
Conservative's deficit from $42 billion to zero and we are still 
going.  The Canadian people are pretty happy to see that the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker,

</I></B></P><P align=left>Who else spoke at that conference today?  Dr. Sherry Cooper of 
Nesbitt Burns.  She blasted the Prime Minister for the fact that 
Canada has the worst record of productivity among industrialized

Our low dollar.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, 1.6 million more Canadians are working since we took 
power.  A study mentioned yesterday that Canada ranks number one 
among G-7 countries in terms of business costs.  It stated that 
Canada has the third lowest corporate income tax rate for 
manufacturing among the G-7, lower than the United States.  It 
stated that we have the lowest labour costs of the G-7. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This long list tells everybody that if they want to do good

<P><A NAME="LINK115"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
cannot believe that the Prime Minister just stood in this place 
to defend the fact that Canadians are willing to work for 
peanuts.  That is the Liberals' whole argument.  They somehow 
think it is a good thing that Canadians have lower wages than 
those in other countries around the world.  Recipients of those 
low wages can tell the Prime Minister that it is no fun. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When is the Prime Minister going to wake up and understand that

only G-7 country to see a reduction in its productivity between 
1979 and 1997.  It said that Canada's productivity performance 
used to place it among the top performers, but now it has fallen 
significantly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are going down while other countries are going up.  Our 
dollar is at 65 cents, giving Canadians a lower standard of

premiums from volunteer firefighters who receive honorariums.

there are two main reasons.  The first is that the government

to pursue a court case.  A legal decision would not be in favour

that the employer can decide on the disposition of the surplus.

<P><A NAME="LINK221"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, when the member for Mississauga South was talking about 
the Reform opposition day motion he spoke at some length about 
Justice Shaw's pornography decision in British Columbia on the 
Sharpe case.  I would like to make a few comments about that 
because I have some information and then I will have a question 
for the member for Mississauga South. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member talked about media reports from that trial and he 
also talked about the fact that Mr. Sharpe was not represented by 
legal counsel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was only one member of the media at the trial, who is a 
radio reporter from my community.  There were several UBC law 
students at court that day.  There were other media who popped 
in, heard what they thought was a poorly presented case and left 
because they thought there was no way this individual could win. 
Why did the law students stay?  Because they knew he was going to 
win.  The radio reporter from my community talked to those 
students and therefore decided to stay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Mississauga South indicated that he is of the 
opinion that the case was not well argued.  I beg to differ.  It 
was not well presented, but it was well argued. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe that Justice Shaw made an error in judgment. 
His judgment was the culmination of a series of earlier decisions 
by judges because of the way in which our laws are written and 
earlier jurisprudence on the child pornography issue related to 
the Constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will make the same admission as the member for Mississauga 
South:  I am not a lawyer, but this is my belief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The message that I think I am hearing out of those court 
proceedings is that under the current legislative framework it 
does not matter what happens with the appeal.  In the short run 
that may work, but in the long run the current legislative 
framework will be found lacking and will require a legislative 
solution or a notwithstanding solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the member so quick to sign a letter to the Prime 
Minister and so slow to stand in the House of Commons to vote for 
a motion to support the very same issue? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo:</B>  Mr. Speaker, very quickly, the media 
reports I was referring to were not the media reports on the 
hearing.  They were, in fact, media reports on the opposition day 
motion which we voted on in the House.  The media reports 
indicated that government members had decided they were voting to 
do nothing, and that is not the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am glad the member raised the issue about why I signed a 
letter to the Prime Minister on behalf of a number of caucus 
colleagues asking for attention.  The reason I signed the letter 
was because at the time the letter was written—and the case had 
happened a week earlier—the position of the government was that 
we would defend the laws of Canada before the Supreme Court of 
Canada.  The letter that I signed, together with a large number 
of my caucus colleagues, was to ask the Prime Minister and the 
justice minister to consider stronger, more direct action because 
of the importance of the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, to the credit of the caucus members who spoke up in 
caucus and who signed that letter, the justice minister did 
announce that the federal government was going to participate in 
the B.C. appeal hearing along with the attorney general of B.C. 
to deal with it right then and there, the swiftest, most 
effective way to deal with a very bad court decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the member for his question.  I wrote the letter because 
it was the right thing to do. 
<P><A NAME="LINK222"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to direct my comments in this debate today on our supply day 
motion to the whole issue of the proliferation of drugs, what it 
means to organized crime and what it means to our young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I attended a conference last weekend in Montreal.  The 
conference title was “Injection Drug Use and Societal Changes”. 
The primary focus of this convention was on implementing more 
effective measures to reduce the harm associated with injection 
drug use, in particular the spread of HIV and AIDS. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1510"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT62"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of speakers recommended the continuation of the needle 
exchange program.  Some recommended allowing for and establishing 
safe injection houses or sites.  Some recommended the medically 
controlled injection of heroine addicts and some even recommended 
legalization of drugs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The conference focused primarily on harm reduction.  Therefore, 
presentations did not provide recommendations or solutions to 
prevent our youth from becoming addicts in the first place. 
There were absolutely no statistics based on comparative studies 
or experiences such as those in Switzerland demonstrating how, if 
at all, harm reduction ultimately results in fewer drug addicts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did not recognize any other members of this House in 
attendance at this very worthwhile conference which gathered 
together many experts in the field of harm reduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most important revelation that emerged from this conference 
was that we need a balanced approach or what the RCMP 
spokesperson termed “a whole meal deal in dealing with illegal 
drugs in this country”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To date, the war on drugs by this government and previous 
governments has not been successful as evidenced by the growing 
number of drug addicts living and using drugs on Canadian 
streets, particularly in downtown east side Vancouver. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Inspector Richard Barszczewski, the RCMP officer in charge of 
operations of the drug section and the drug awareness program, 
began his address at the conference by stating “Canada has no 
war on drugs”.  There is no war on drugs because successive 
governments have failed to introduce a balanced approach to deal 
with the issue of illicit drugs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Inspector Barszczewski revealed that the illicit drug trade 
remains the principal source of revenue for most organized crime 
groups.  The combined annual supply estimates for all drug types 
has the potential to generate criminal proceeds in excess of $4 
billion at the wholesale level and $18 billion at the street 
level.  It is estimated that 15 tonnes of cocaine are smuggled 
into Canada each year.  Additionally, one to two tonnes of 
heroine are required annually to meet the needs of Canadian 
heroine users. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One presenter at the conference, Eric Single, a professor with 
the University of Toronto, estimated that the total cost for 
illicit drug use for 1992 was $1.4 billion.  This cost included 
but is not limited to police, courts, corrections, customs and 
excise and health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The RCMP revealed that in B.C. alone there were 310 drug 
overdose deaths in 1996 and again in 1997.  Eighty per cent of 
all property crimes committed by individuals were directly or 
indirectly related to substance abuse.  I am referring to the 
province of Alberta now.  Fifty per cent of those accused of 
homicide and thirty-eight per cent of homicide victims were 
intoxicated or under the influence of illegal drugs or both. 
Forty per cent of all motor vehicle accident victims were under 
the influence of drugs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are we to do?  What would be the ingredients of a balanced 
approach to the problem we have within Canadian society?  There 
are a number of points I would like to touch on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, we should strengthen social policies and programs as a 
means of prevention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, there should be more education and drug awareness in 
schools.  My province of Alberta has the DARE program, a very 
effective program administered by the police forces which 
operates with schoolchildren.  I have been privileged to attend 
some of the graduation exercises of those groups of young people. 
It is heartening and hopeful to see this occurring and what it 
means for the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need stricter law enforcement of trafficking charges and 
penalties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to extend such programs as the Toronto drug court to 
divert addicts and street level drug traffickers away from the 
traditional judicial system, allowing for treatment rather than 
imprisonment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to increase penalties for high level drug trafficking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need better organized crime legislation, including proceeds 
of crime legislation which would allow the authorities in this 
country to seize the proceeds of drug crimes and turn them over 
to the state. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to increase substantially the RCMP's budget to allow for 
the hiring of additional officers to be utilized both 
domestically and abroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a need to stop the flow or supply of drugs through 
better interdiction. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1515"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT63"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last, effectively implement means to stop the flow of drugs in 
prisons in Canada.  The hon. Justice William Vancise of the court 
of appeal for Saskatchewan stated during his presentation at the 
Montreal conference: “It is easier to get drugs in prison than 
on the streets.  They are only more expensive within prison”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are numerous flaws in the federal prison service program 
and for detecting illegal drugs. An 80 page report released by 
the Quebec provincial ombudsman estimated that between $40 
million and $60 million in drugs flow through the prisons of that 
province annually.  There is a commercial enterprise of drug 
dealing within our prisons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Justice Vancise revealed an appalling fact that many offenders 
go into prison without a drug problem and come out as drug 
addicts.  That is unacceptable.  The government has failed 
dismally to introduce the whole meal deal or a balanced approach 
to dealing with illicit drugs and it is our children and 
grandchildren who will pay the price. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will touch on the whole business of the government's attitude 
toward the use of illegal drugs, particularly hard drugs within 
our prisons and society.  If we want to determine the attitude of 
the government over the last six years toward the drug problem in 
Canada, that attitude is best displayed when we examine what is 
happening within our prisons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is any place that we should be able to reduce if not 
eliminate the use of drugs, it ought to be within our prisons and 
yet, as Judge Vancise told us at the Montreal conference, it is 
as easy to get drugs inside our prisons as it is on the streets. 
The only difference is that it costs more in our prisons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada's attitude toward this whole problem is 
reflected in what is happening within our prisons.  It is in 
complete control of who and what goes into the prison and yet we 
have this type of unacceptable, reprehensible situation within 
our prisons where people who are arrested and sent into prison 
without any type of drug habit are coming out as drug addicts, as 
the judge said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen where inmates of our correctional centres have sued 
the government for various reasons.  I predict the day when we 
will see some inmate suing the government for placing them in an 
environment that is unsafe because of the uncontrolled 
trafficking of drugs that occurs within the prison system.  It is 
unacceptable and the government's attitude toward not just the 
drug situation but crime in general is most vividly reflected in 
what is happening within our prisons today. It is unacceptable. 
<P><A NAME="LINK223"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague, a former RCMP officer, for 
his very eloquent dissertation.  I have four points to make and I 
would like my hon. colleague to answer them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A person convicted for an offence can be eligible for parole 
after serving only one-sixth of their sentence.  This appalled me 
when I was in jail as a correctional officer and as a physician. 
I thought it was ridiculous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member feel that people caught trafficking or 
using illicit drugs while in jail should actually have more of 
their sentence to be served in jail rather than being eligible 
for parole after one-sixth, have that pushed to two-thirds of 
their sentence which would have a very clear punitive action 
against those who are wilfully using drugs while in jail? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Persons caught trafficking drugs outside have to pay the price. 
Does he feel our judicial system right now is enforcing the 
penalties that are there?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of dealing with hard core drug addicts, the Geneva 
post-needle park experiment is perhaps the best in the world. 
Half these drug addicts have become integrated and productive 
members of society.  It is the best model in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two ways of dealing with the use of drugs in society. 
The first is management of the problem and the second is 
prevention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know how my hon. colleague feels about calling 
for a national head start program that deals with children in the 
first eight years of life to make sure they have those basic 
needs met.  It has been proven that it has a profound impact on 
decreasing child abuse and ensuring that children are in school 
longer, commit less crime and become integrated members of 
society.  This motion passed in the House last year.  I would 
like to know the member's opinion on those points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jack Ramsay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I hope I have time to get 
to all the member's questions because each one requires an 
indepth analysis.  I do not know if I will have the time to do 
justice to these questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as serving one-sixth of a sentence, I simply go back to 
what we have been crying out for, truth in sentencing.  We do not 
have it in this country.  I think my hon. colleague has brought 
this very important matter up and it is on the record.  We 
emphasize again that we do not have truth in sentencing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hear some criticism even from our party about the way judges 
handle things. How in the world can judges do their job when 
their sentencing is overruled by a parole system that puts the 
lie to their original assessment of the seriousness of the 
offence by way of the sentence they imposed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question that our government should take a serious 
look at increasing the penalty for the top flight traffickers in 
this country.  They should pay a very serious price.  What we 
heard over and over again at the Montreal forum was that these 
people do not care what they do to the young people, to the 
addicts, to the people who get hooked on drugs.  They are only 
worried about profits.  That is what we should be looking at. 
That is what the RCMP was talking about when it said a full meal 
deal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take a full, broad, balanced approach to this where we go 
after the traffickers and start to treat those who have 
addictions as they are being treated through the drug court in 
Toronto where there are options for them to receive the treatment 
and care they need.  We must also put in the effort required in 
order to rehabilitate them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question the head start program, this kind of 
education at the earliest age, is extremely important in 
preventing our young people from getting involved in drugs. There 
are drugs within the schools throughout the country.  What we 
must do is encourage the government, which we are doing in this 
debate today, to take a serious look at this and help those young 
people through a broad and balanced approach to this drug 
situation in Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as I 
listened to the speech I noted that the member mentioned some 
inmates had sued the government because of their exposure to 
drugs in the prison system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure the member is familiar with the fact that in downtown 
Vancouver and on the Vancouver east side the government is also, 
by its actions, exposing its own citizens to this sort of thing 
through allowing these criminal drug dealing refugees to come 
into the country.  I am sure everyone in the House has heard 
about the Honduran drug dealing problem in Vancouver.  We have it 
with Iranian and Chinese refugee claimants as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is frustration among the police trying to deal with up to 
half of the people arrested every night in Vancouver being 
illegals trafficking drugs.  It is a major problem and certainly 
places the citizens of Canada at risk.

Montreal forum expressed their dismay over the lack of funding. 
Their budgets are being cut, particularly in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have to do is focus on this very broad question.  What 
my hon. colleague has brought up with regard to the drug issue 
and immigration is there.  It has to be looked at.  It has to be 
dealt with.  Otherwise the east side situation in Vancouver will 
get worse and will spread to other parts of the country.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to rise in debate on a criminal justice motion 
placed before the House by the official opposition.  It raises 
the need for greater focus on reform of our criminal justice laws 
to make Canadians feel safer in their homes and in their 
neighbourhoods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the outset let me say how very disappointed I was to hear the 
shrill and extreme remarks of the parliamentary secretary to the 
attorney general.  This morning she suggested that if the 
official opposition had its way Canada would be a country 
governed by vigilante justice where every individual would own a 
firearm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand partisan differences and differences of opinions 
between members of this place.  That is what serious democratic 
deliberation is all about.  I find that kind of shrill, extreme 
demagogic rhetoric from a member beyond the pale of reasonable 
debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member cackles across.  She does herself a gross disservice 
by engaging in that kind of over the top, demagogic rhetoric by 
grossly mischaracterizing the legitimate and heartfelt concern of 
the members of the official opposition and the millions of 
Canadians we represent when it comes to the need for criminal 
justice reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can have a disagreement with the parliamentary secretary and 
members of her party about how to weigh victims rights versus the 
rights of criminals, due process, sentencing and so forth.  We 
can have legitimate arguments about these matters.  That is what 
this parliament is for.  I will not ascribe motives to that 
member and suggest she does not care about criminal justice.  I 
know she does.  I will not castigate this government as not 
caring about victims.  I know it does.  We have different 
approaches about how to defend the rights of victims.  I will not 
countenance any member from any side of the House using that kind 
of extremist and shrill rhetoric we heard from that member this 
morning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Eleni Bakopanos:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order. I do believe using the word shrill is unparliamentary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is 
not a point of order.  That is a point of debate depending on 
your perspective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I guess she resembles that 
comment. I rise because, unlike the noisy and gutter raking, 
guttersniping parliamentary secretary opposite— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Shrill was not but 
guttersniping is. I ask the hon. member for Calgary Southeast to 
withdraw those words. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I withdraw any 
unparliamentary remarks.  I hope members across will try to 
engage in a more serious and substantive debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recall, running in the last election in my constituency, that 
one of the most obvious concerns of my constituents, as I went 
door to door to thousands of homes in the southeast part of 
Calgary, was crime, particularly violent crime by young 
offenders.  One issue raised with me frequently was the growing 
trend in home invasions.  It is something I would like to 
address. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I look at the overall statistics that Statistics Canada 
reported in 1995, 27% of urban residents of Canada had been 
victims of crime.  About one quarter of Canadians were afraid to 
walk alone after hours in their neighbourhoods. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1530"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT66"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a shame that in what we often regard as such a peaceful 
country, so many of our fellow citizens should feel afraid to 
walk in their own neighbourhoods at night.  We cannot rest as 
legislators as long as the kind of fear founded on crime disturbs 
the normal and peaceable lives of Canadian citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look at the situation in an otherwise stable and peaceful 
suburb of my constituency, the Sundance community.  There was a 
gang fight in September 1997.  A 17 year old whose name has been 
withheld by virtue of the Young Offenders Act stabbed and 
assaulted three 16 year olds. One of them had lost 10 litres of 
blood.  He was stabbed in the heart, coronary artery and liver. 
An autopsy was scheduled for one of the three victims of the 
young offender's crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 17 year old, who was nicknamed Baby Gangster, was sentenced 
to one year.  His name was not released. The judge in that case 
said “he has a propensity for violence but it is more attitude 
than anger”.  The judge cited a psychological report urging 
social and anger managing counselling. With all due respect, 
attitude was not the problem. The lack of social management 
counselling was not the problem. The problem was that there was a 
violent thug who nearly took a child's life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We as legislators need to take more seriously the justice part 
of the justice system when it comes to imposing appropriate 
sanctions on individuals like this young so-called gangster. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also raise the tragic case of young Clayton McGloan of the 
northeast part of Calgary.  Later this month I will be hosting a 
town hall meeting with his parents.  Clayton McGloan was a 17 year 
old who was viciously attacked by a gang of youths in the Coral 
Springs community of Calgary on October 31, 1998. He was hit over 
the head with a bottle, knocked unconscious and stabbed 12 times 
in the back.  This was not an attitude problem on the part of the 
person who attacked him.  It was a vicious murder, attempted and 
executed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clayton fought hard to stay alive.  However life support was 
removed two days later after he was declared clinically brain 
dead.  Close to 2,000 people attended his funeral. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two juveniles, 15 and 17 years old, were charged but again they 
cannot be identified under the Young Offenders Act.  They will 
not be identifiable under the bill recently introduced by the 
Minister of Justice.  Both these juveniles stand a good chance of 
re-entering society in a couple of years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the backdrop we see as members of parliament in 
representing our constituents.  I find it unfortunate that after 
years and years of advocacy and hard work on the part of victims 
and their families to establish more meaningful sanctions for 
violent crime, particularly violent youth crime, that Bill C-68 
placed before this House by the Minister of Justice does not come 
anywhere close to addressing the very real concerns of Canadians 
on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I now turn to a growing trend which really is very disturbing, 
the trend of home invasions.  This is a situation where criminals 
invade a home as a random act if they know the occupants are 
there.  This is not just a simple break and enter for the purpose 
of robbery.  This is an aggravated form of assault on the 
property and home of residents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Kitchener—Waterloo a 71 year old woman was terrorized. 
Teenage thugs broke into her home, bound her, blindfolded her and 
threatened her with assault. I read of a case on Saltspring 
Island, British Columbia where residents were dismayed after 
their home had been invaded twice in five weeks by separate 
groups of young offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my own riding I recall going door to door in the election.  I 
knocked on a door and an elderly lady came to the door after 
several minutes. 
She was petrified to open the door.  She kept the chain on.  She 
asked me what I wanted.  I said I was running for parliament. She 
said she would not open the door because two young teenagers had 
tried to break down her door the previous week while she was 
there. She broke down in tears.  She could not sleep at night. 
She was concerned that they were going to come back.  The police 
were called but the boys ran off.  The police said that even if 
they had been arrested they would be back out on the street in a 
day or so.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have seen the very real faces of people concerned by this.  It 
is not just the Reform Party who are concerned about this.  I 
read the comments of the Attorney General of British Columbia 
from the New Democratic Party who says that home invasion is a 
serious problem across the country and the federal government 
needs to take some leadership on it.  He proposes, as do we, that 
there be a minimum Criminal Code offence for home invasion above 
and beyond the offence for breaking and entering, and that this 
be considered an aggravating factor in sentencing.  There would 
be a higher sentence if this kind of home invasion is a factor in 
a crime that is committed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call on the government to listen to Canadians who are 
suffering from the growing number of home invasions. I urge 
government members to listen to the official opposition, listen 
to the provincial attorneys general. Bring in the kind of 
sentencing guidelines which would more seriously punish those who 
violate the privacy of innocent law-abiding Canadian citizens in 
their homes. 
<P><A NAME="LINK226"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my first 
choice would have been for a Liberal member to get up and ask a 
question and get into the debate.  Let us talk about what can be 
done to solve these problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciated the examples my hon. colleague used. I guess we 
all have stories and anecdotes which underline the need to 
improve our justice system and our dealings with people who so 
blatantly walk over the rights of other people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most serious one that has happened in the Edmonton area in 
the last little while involved three young people whose names 
could not be released.  They invaded a house one night looking 
for money.  The lady of the house went down to see about the 
noise thinking it was her dog.  It was the three young people who 
stabbed her to death.  A young mother's life was taken. Under the 
protection of the law, their names cannot be released. How can we 
justify having this lack of accountability for people and their 
actions? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Beyond publicizing their names thereby holding them accountable 
for what they have done, has the member given any thought to what 
kind of sentences and how long those sentences should be for 
things such as home invasions especially if weapons are used? Has 
the member given any thought as to how we treat these youths in 
terms of giving justice to the people whose rights are seriously 
violated? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not pretend to be an 
expert on sentencing guidelines, but I do know that the current 
Criminal Code does not have a minimum sentence provision for 
simple robbery as an example.  I am proposing that home invasion 
be treated along the same lines as committing a crime with a 
firearm, which I gather carries a minimum sentence of four years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member is absolutely right when he says that this is a 
serious problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I read a story of a different home invasion which occurred in 
Edmonton this year.  Two young people invaded a home, attacked 
the occupants and ran off when the police appeared.  A reporter 
who covered the story interviewed some neighbours who said that 
these types of invasions had been going on for some time. These 
young people will check mailboxes, look in windows and when 
chased away say what are the cops going to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is comments like that which reflect the growing lack of 
confidence Canadians have in our criminal justice system. I think 
it is atrocious that ordinary law-abiding lay people feel that 
the police do not have the criminal sanctions they need to ensure 
these kinds of violent invasions of people's homes do not occur. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not propose a particular guideline, but I do think there 
should be some kind of minimum sentence for cases which involve 
this aggravating factor of home invasion.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, will the 
member tell the House, when he looks at all the countries in the 
world and all the criminal justice systems, which country does he 
think should be the model that Canada might look at? Which 
country's model is closest in its thinking and philosophy? I 
would like to hear that from the member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am no expert on the 
criminal laws of other jurisdictions, so I would not propose any 
single model.  I suggest that a made in Canada solution is 
probably the best. We have different conditions, different 
circumstances which we should consider in framing our own 
criminal justice laws.  I think that question probably is not 
relevant. 
<P><A NAME="LINK228"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will be 
speaking to different parts of the motion, but I am first going 
to make some general comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member said that he does not know much about criminal 
justice models around the world.  I suggest that the member is 
correct.  I suggest that the Reform Party knows little about 
criminal justice models around the world and if Reform members 
do, we would like to have them stand in the House and tell us 
which system they would like to see us model our system on. Would 
it be Europe?  Would it be the United States?  Would it be South 
Africa?  Would it be Texas?  Which? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the problems when we enter into this type of debate is 
that members of the official opposition ends up trafficking in a 
lot of fiction.  By saying that I mean they would misrepresent a 
situation of crime and the number of victims in this country as 
to how we compare to other countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party would have us believe that our Young Offenders 
Act is the most lenient act around.  For the record, our Young 
Offenders Act incarcerates 15 times as many young people as 
similar acts in New Zealand and Australia, 10 times as many young 
people as in western Europe and even twice as many young people 
as in the United States. Our Young Offenders Act is more punitive 
to young people than an adult charged with the same kind of 
crime.  Young offenders spend more time in jail for a crime than 
adults do in the adult system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I say that the official opposition is trafficking in 
fiction, that is exactly what I mean. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is nice for the Reform Party to go around and say there is a 
fear of crime in this country and that people should not be 
afraid.  Every one of us in the House would agree that one victim 
is one victim too many, that one crime is one crime too many. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that the crime rate has been dropping over the 
years.  It has been progressively going down. Compared to the 
United States, our crime rate is much lower. Canadians feel much 
safer in this country than they do in the United States.  Every 
example calling for tougher sentencing and dealing more toughly 
with law breakers always points to the American model. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the biggest fears people have of crime involves the use 
of guns.  That is why the government put in place gun 
registration, which I must say is being ignored and was not 
supported by the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to touch on immigration.  Immigration has certainly been 
a greatly exploited topic by the folks on the other side. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1545"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The safety and security of Canadians are a concern of the 
government.  Through the immigration program numerous measures 
have been undertaken to ensure that criminals do not enter and 
that those who have entered have no right to remain and are 
removed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This undesirable group, however, represents a small fraction of 
the total number of visitors and immigrants that come to Canada. 
Citizenship and Immigration Canada strives to ensure public 
safety while facilitating the entry of legitimate travellers.  It 
is difficult to balance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year alone 110 million people crossed our borders to enter 
Canada.  Many of them were Canadian citizens returning home, as 
well as visitors, immigrants, foreign students and refugees. 
Security screening is used for all those who are entering Canada. 
Toward the goal of public safety there are three screens in place 
to guard against illegal entry and to identify those who should 
not be here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I continue, I will be splitting my time with the member 
for Erie—Lincoln and I look forward to his contribution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the international level a screening occurs.  Those wishing to 
come to Canada as visitors or immigrants are scrutinized when 
they apply for a visa.  Immigration control officers working in 
Canadian embassies and missions abroad ensure that security and 
health checks are done.  It is at the international level that we 
have formed partnerships with foreign governments to help confirm 
the identities of foreign criminals and to prevent them from 
coming to Canada.  The problem of illegal migration is a global 
one with crime rings operating beyond national borders.  It is 
therefore necessary to work toward solutions at the international 
level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A second screen is conducted at the Canadian border where 
Citizenship and Immigration Canada officials and those of Revenue 
Canada deal with incoming travellers.  The use of computer 
databases has helped greatly in establishing identification, 
ensuring that those seeking to enter Canada have not been 
previously arrested or removed.  The work at these border 
crossings and airports is a key element in our defence against 
illegal entry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third type of screening goes on within Canada with the 
co-operative work of Citizenship and Immigration Canada, the 
RCMP, and all Canadian police forces.  This inland screening is 
an ongoing process that makes use of shared databases and 
immigration warrants.  Often something as routine as a traffic 
stop allows an officer to determine immigrant status and possibly 
the existence of warrants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is this information sharing with police forces across the 
country that has allowed Citizenship and Immigration Canada to 
identify and remove criminals and those without status in Canada. 
I remind members opposite that the removal of foreign criminals 
and failed refugee claimants has increased steadily over the last 
four years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1998, 8,012 people were removed from Canada.  This represents 
an increase of 67% from 1995 when citizenship and immigration 
effected 4,798 removals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While there is much to commend in the current Immigration Act 
there are avenues for improvement.  Changes are now being 
considered.  On January 6 this year the minister proposed new 
directions for immigration legislation and policy.  Under these 
proposals the system would be improved by clearly defining who is 
admissible to Canada, by creating new inadmissible classes, and 
by enhancing the capacity of government to remove people who have 
no right to establish themselves in Canada.  Also among the 
proposals is the removal of a level of appeal for serious 
criminals as well as those people who obtain permanent resident 
status through misrepresentation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we advance with these proposed changes I look forward to the 
contributions of members opposite so that we might recognize the 
efficiencies and improve the Immigration Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question that we have problems in enforcement in 
terms of having people who come to the country that commit 
offences.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at our immigration policies over the years we have 
to recognize that we have a country with a population of 30 
million.  Something like six million people were not born here. 
We have a generous acceptance of refugees which is both humane 
and generous.  Beyond that, the number of people who involve 
themselves in criminal activity compared to the whole is very 
small. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People look at Canada overall as being a nation of immigrants. I 
can look around the House and say there are 47 members who were 
born outside Canada.  A number of people were refugees and are 
represented pretty well in all parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is a nation that was built on immigration.  If we look at 
the status we occupy in the world because of this reality, we 
have to say that our policies overall, which will get some 
improvement, have served the country very well. 
<P><A NAME="LINK229"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
member talked about crime decreasing, but youth violent crime has 
been rising, as I am sure the member knows, particularly among 
young women.  If he doubts that, he can get on the Internet and 
look up the website for <I>North Shore News</I>.  He will find an 
article within the last two weeks with plenty of statistics for 
the Vancouver area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the member talked about how Citizenship and 
Immigration Canada strives to protect Canada's borders and to do 
screening during entry.  Yesterday afternoon on Vancouver's top 
radio station, CKNW, a Mr. Johnston from Citizenship and 
Immigration Canada was on the line for an hour.  I invite the 
member to call in and get a transcript of the program.  He will 
find out that it is just not so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly fingerprints of refugee claimants are taken at the 
port of entry.  What happens is that those fingerprints are sent 
to Ottawa where they are hardly ever checked.  During a recent 
drug arrest in downtown Vancouver when 80 Honduran refugee 
claimants were arrested for drug trafficking, a local policeman 
from the Vancouver area took it upon himself to check the 
criminal records of these claimants.  He found that 20% of them 
had criminal records in the United States.  Yet here they were 
coming into Canada.  It is absolute bunkum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member would have us believe that things are getting better 
by talking about how the number of deportations has risen 67%.  I 
am not the least bit surprised.  Probably the number of criminals 
getting into Canada has gone up by at least 67%.  If the member 
doubts it, he needs only to come out west, take a little visit to 
the Vancouver area and find a dose of reality, what is really 
happening out there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I say to the member 
opposite that I go out west twice a year.  I stay for about a 
week at a time.  When we first came to Canada we lived in 
Vancouver, including North Vancouver.  I have returned there on 
many occasions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the member does not believe that the crime rates are 
dropping, there is not a whole lot I can do about it.  I can only 
suggest to him that he read the facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People abusing our immigration system is a problem at times. The 
member continually refers to the Honduran claimants.  Whether or 
not those people are kept in custody when they are apprehended or 
charged is a decision made by the local courts.  It is important 
for the member to understand that.  If the local courts believe 
that the person will commit another offence or not show up for 
the next hearing, the person will be kept in custody. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I implore the member to read the statistics so that he 
understands that the crime rate has been dropping not just in 
Canada but in the United States and in western Europe as well. 
<P><A NAME="LINK230"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, 
NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, with all due respect, my hon. friend from 
the Reform Party was suggesting that while overall crime has 
certainly decreased in Canada—thank goodness for that—violent 
crime involving young people appears not to have decreased. 
As a matter of fact it appears to have been somewhat on the 
increase.  I think that is the point my friend was making about

policies.  He reminded us how generous Canada is.  Indeed we are 
possibly the most generous country in the world in terms of 
welcoming folks into our country, in particular refugees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am concerned about two issues.  One is about the number of 
people who come to Canada allegedly on a temporary visa and are 
guaranteed by a sponsor, or someone sponsors them, and then 
decide to go underground or abandon that process.  We are left 
holding the tab and the sponsor is left not knowing where his 
colleague or relative is.  Also there are people who sponsor 
people to come into the country and then essentially abandon that 
sponsorship.

individual is coming for a wedding, for a visit or whatever, has 
the hon. member given any thought to their posting a bond so that

terms of bonds, in terms of sponsoring visitors, is certainly one 
area that will be discussed and actually has been discussed by 
some people.  That is working in the criminal justice system as 
far as sureties and posting of bonds are concerned, which will be 
worthwhile looking at when we review the act.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Maloney (Erie—Lincoln, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise to speak to what I would call an omnibus 
resolution which certainly covers a plethora of criminal items. 
However I would like to concentrate my remarks on the subject of 
correctional facilities.  It is after all perhaps the most high 
profile, most expensive and in many ways most important feature 
of our correctional system today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As hon. members know, we have a great variety of correctional 
facilities operated by both levels of government, the provinces 
and the federal government, and in some cases by the voluntary 
sector.  At the federal level we have institutions varied by 
security level:  maximum, medium and minimum security levels.  In 
addition Correctional Service Canada operates halfway houses 
called community correctional centres and contracts with the 
voluntary sector to operate other halfway houses called community 
residential facilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was not always the case.  Until about 1960 the system 
consisted of nine Gothic maximum security institutions built 
decades ago.  Some of those structures are still with us today. 
However it was realized that the vast array of individual 
differences among offenders required an array of correctional 
approaches if the system was to achieve its fundamental principal 
purpose, that of protecting the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Public protection requires safe and secure custody which I can 
assure hon. members is well achieved by today's system of 
institutions and inmate classifications.  It also requires 
programming that prepares offenders for their eventual release 
back into society and conducts that release in a careful and 
gradual manner.  This too is achieved very successfully today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The variety of institutional styles that exist allow for 
placement of offenders at the security level and with access to 
the correctional programs they require.  By providing programs 
such as anger management, substance abuse reduction, psychiatric 
treatment and counselling, offenders can be helped to overcome 
the factors that caused them to adapt criminal patterns in the 
first place.  They can be tested and observed to ensure that they 
are overcoming these factors.  They can be carefully supervised 
as they move from prison back into the community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We often hear about initiatives in other countries to privatize 
correctional institutions.  This is not a course of action that 
has been adopted by the federal government.  Nor does available 
evidence about the experience in other countries justify doing 
so. However it is often not realized to what extent we already 
have partnerships with the private voluntary sector.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through arrangements with organizations such as the Salvation 
Army, the John Howard Society, the St. Leonard's Society and many 
others a network of halfway houses is operated to supervise and 
assist offenders as they make their first important steps back 
into the community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some may say we should not be releasing offenders into the 
community as freely as they allege we do.  I ask them if it would 
be better to hold those offenders until the very last day of 
their sentences and then thrust them back on the community 
anonymously, without supervision, support or controls. I submit 
that we in Canada have chosen a better way, gradual release with 
conditions, supervision and assistance after a careful assessment 
of risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Almost all offenders will return to the community.  Our system 
of justice demands it.  After serving prescribed sentences most 
offenders must be returned to the community.  We have little 
choice about that.  The choice we have is how that release will 
take place and how it can be made as safe as possible, not just 
for the immediate future but for the long term.  Treatment, risk 
assessment, careful release planning and graduated movement 
through several security levels and then into the community is 
the way to achieve the goal of public safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The record demonstrates the validity of this approach. Of all 
the 5,000 offenders released each year on some form of 
conditional release, 90% complete the balance of the sentence 
without committing a new offence.  This record of a successful 
completion of conditional release has improved steadily during 
recent years.  This is strong support for the approach we have 
adopted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are those who would measure the criminal justice system by 
only one test, how much punishment it dispenses and whether it is 
constantly being made tougher on offenders. Obviously those who 
break the law can and should expect to pay a price and to receive 
an appropriate sanction.  If the purpose of the criminal justice 
system is to uphold society's values it must be seen to give 
appropriate weight to the offender's transgression. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is our penal system perfect?  No.  Can it be improved?  Surely 
it can.  The government is responding.  As we speak here today an 
all-party subcommittee of the Standing Committee on Justice and 
Human Rights is studying this issue.  It is reviewing the 
Corrections and Conditional Release Act.  It is inspecting 
custodial facilities across this land.  It is hearing from all 
the stakeholders, the prison population, the frontline 
corrections officers, the guards, prison administration, victims 
groups, prosecutors and members of the general public, among 
others. It is seeking the opinion and the advice of these people. 
It is drawing on the experience of these individuals who deal on 
a daily basis with Correctional Service Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After the subcommittee completes its investigation and studies 
it will prepare a report for the House and the solicitor general. 
If necessary, legislative change will be proposed and debated in 
the House.  I am confident this nationwide consultation on the 
Corrections and Conditional Release Act will improve the overall 
effectiveness of Canada's correctional system. 
<P><A NAME="LINK232"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
member spent a lot of time telling us about how the government is 
consulting with this group, that group and the other group.  All 
I can say from my observation of almost six years here in the 
House is that the Liberal government for all the consultation it 
has ever done has never taken the slightest bit of notice of the 
input it receives from ordinary Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Maloney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would strongly disagree 
with that suggestion.  I was a member of the justice committee, 
as was the member for Crowfoot.  We did a comprehensive study of 
the Young Offenders Act.  As a result of that a report was 
prepared, filed in the House and given to the Minister of Justice 
who responded to it.  We have recently seen a new youth justice 
criminal act which has considered many of the points we put 
forward in that report. 
<P><A NAME="LINK233"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, has the 
government looked at the reasons we have such a problem these 
days with our young people?  I get really worried when I hear 
there is to be a debate on whether we might legalize marijuana if 
only for health care use. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1605"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT73"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once we do that we also send a message to young people that 
marijuana is all right for them to use as well.  We have to look 
at the drug situation which is terrible.  It is the worst I have 
ever seen in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When they took out the port police in my riding of Saint John, 
New Brunswick I told them we would have cocaine like never 
before.  We have cocaine houses all over the city.  They were 
never there before.  Because of the drug situation we have the 
break-up of families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to look at what is causing this problem with youth 
crime.  It comes from drugs and break-up of families.  We have to 
see how we can solidify that family unit.  Have they looked at 
this?  What steps will they take to correct this terrible ailment 
we have in society today? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Maloney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I compliment the member on 
her question as well as on her dress today.  It is very 
appropriate as we lead into St. Patrick's Day.  I think the 
question was what are we doing to prevent these matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year the Minister of Justice announced a crime prevention 
initiative directed toward children whereby we set aside 1% of 
the justice department budget, which would amount to roughly $32 
million, for crime protection initiatives.  These programs are 
now starting to come to fruition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the member that drugs are a horrendous problem with 
our youth.  Something must be done about it.  There must be 
stricter enforcement.  We must get to the suppliers of these 
illicit items.  That is not only within Canada but beyond our 
borders.  We must cut off the flow from these countries.  We are 
working together with many of our international partners to cut 
off the flow of drugs to this country.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac—Mégantic, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened with great interest to the speech by my colleague, the 
member for Erie—Lincoln. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He says that 10% of the 5,000 inmates released each year 
reoffend.  There are therefore 500 of them who will commit an 
offence in the months or years following their release. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If our communities are not affected by these 500 individuals, we 
can easily turn a blind eye.  But when we see the terrible 
crimes they commit, we would be entitled to ask the following 
question, which I am going to put to the member for Erie—Lincoln: 
Could he tell us what specifically his government is doing to 
prepare inmates who will be released before serving their full 
sentence? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Maloney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for his question.  Even 1% would be too much.  There is no 
question about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While these inmates are in prison they receive treatment.  There 
is a careful release planning.  They move from maximum security 
to medium security to minimum security, then to a half-way house. 
They are supervised and observed at all stages.  If the 
individual is known to be at risk or thought to be at risk they 
are not released.  That is an important factor to take into 
consideration.  It is a graduated movement through various 
security levels into the community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is eminently better than having them serve their full 
sentence and then bang, out on the street, like a caged animal 
most likely to behave in a much more serious manner than perhaps 
the 10% who do manage to reoffend.  It may be a small offence or 
whatever but they are very strict on them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard from some of these offenders today in our 
committee.  For a very slight offence they are back in.  They may 
have consumed a glass of alcohol and they are back in prison.

</I></B></P><P align=left>What I want to talk about today is the problem we have with 
crime and how it relates to problems in the immigration system. 
When we look at the warnings and the variety of people who have 
commented on the problem, we will see it is quite a wide problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ward Elcock, director of the Canadian Security and Intelligence 
Service, CSIS, and the attorney general for British Columbia have 
made some very strong statements on the problems with criminals 
finding their way into our country through our immigration and 
refugee system.   We also have statements from several previous 
officials from the Department of Citizenship and Immigration.  I 
will use some quotes from some of these people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have statements by law enforcement officers about the 
problems they have in dealing with the crime that is caused by 
bogus refugee claimants who come into our country under less than 
honourable terms.  We even have Liberal members of parliament who 
have made some very strong statements on the weaknesses in our 
immigration system and how that leads to crime.  I will quote 
from one or two Liberal members later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who pays the price for the problems in our immigration system 
and for the crime that comes to our country as a result of a 
broken system?  Canadians pay the price.  It is Canadians who are 
having their lives destroyed due to drug abuse. They can find a 
ready supply of drugs from, for example, bogus Honduran refugee 
claimants on the streets of Vancouver. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many times it is new Canadians who are intimidated and forced to 
pay protection from the criminal element that finds its way into 
their communities from their country of origin.  These are the 
very people from whom new Canadians have escaped by leaving 
their homelands. 
These people are now here in our country and the same type 
of organized crime has followed them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>New immigrant communities pay a price in another way.  We have 
all read story after story about problems with our immigration 
and refugee system which allow criminals to get into our country 
so easily.  As we hear, read and see those stories on television, 
we know that it reflects negatively on the new immigrant 
population as a whole.  I think that is sad.  The new immigrant 
population is tarnished because of a small percentage of 
criminals who find their way into our country so easily through 
our immigration system. Canadians right across this country are 
victims of this problem and it must be dealt with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned the problem with the drug trade in Vancouver, in 
particular the problem with Honduran people who come to Canada 
claiming refugee status which are bogus claims.  That they are in 
our country is a problem in itself.  How did they get to our 
country?  We do not have proper resources up front to 
screen and so on, but I will talk a bit about some of the 
solutions at the end of my presentation.  However, there is no 
doubt this is a problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I quote the member for Port Moody—Coquitlam who stated recently 
that refugee claimants convicted of dealing drugs should be 
deported immediately with no review or appeal allowed to drag 
things out. 
That is from a Liberal member who has recognized the problem. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1615"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT75"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not have the proper resources upfront.  Therefore, people 
are finding their way into our country who should not be here. 
They should be screened by the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our process is lenient and dragged out, and we allow so 
many appeals that we cannot get people who have been targeted and 
named as undesirables by the immigration department out of the 
country.  That is what led the Liberal member to make the 
statement that they should be deported immediately, with no 
review or appeal allowed to drag things out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The attorney general for British Columbia has stated “If you 
are abusing the hospitality of Canada by committing crimes, you 
should be deported forthwith”.  He is very frustrated with this 
problem, in particular, but he is also frustrated with other 
problems, some of which I will touch on later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A Vancouver staff sergeant stated recently that people who come 
in, flaunt our refugee system and sell poison to our children 
should be deported immediately.  This again is frustration 
speaking.  He goes on to say “I am disgusted that the system did 
not take action long ago”.  Many of us have heard quotes like 
this.  It is not really a quote that stands alone.  This is a 
problem that we should not ignore. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it is narrowed down, the most visible drug problem is that 
of the Honduran drug dealers in Vancouver.  However, there are 
many others involved in organized crime which I will touch on a 
bit later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members have to be even more concerned when they find that the 
immigration minister and her department came down on a member of 
the Royal Canadian Mounted Police who made statements that are 
completely honest on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened a couple of weeks ago was that RCMP Constable Mark 
Applejohn suggested that refugee claimants be fingerprinted and 
detained until their prints are run through police databases for 
criminal checks.  He stated that immigration laws are lax and 
cumbersome, allowing claimants who have broken the law to stay in 
Canada while their claims continue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does the immigration department respond?  Chris Taylor, who 
is head of western services for the immigration department, said 
“I consider these comments to reflect breaches of the code of 
conduct and the oath of allegiance of the RCMP”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of the department attacking the problem, it attacks RCMP 
officers who are frustrated.  They do not have the tools they 
need to deal with the problem.  The immigration department and 
the immigration minister are too weak to do something about it. 
In five years we have had no legislation whatsoever to deal with 
the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The frustration is bound to show.  This RCMP officer should not 
be criticized and attacked by the head of western services, 
backed up by the minister in the House and in committee.  Instead 
of attacking the police for making statements that are completely 
correct, the government should attack the problem.  I think it is 
sad that has not been done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another issue that has become huge is people smuggling.  The 
former solicitor general spoke at a chiefs of police conference a 
couple of months ago.  He said “This study estimates that 
between 8,000 and 16,000 people arrive in Canada each year with 
the assistance of people smugglers”.  This estimate is probably 
very low.  He said “The human costs are staggering when we 
consider that these people are vulnerable, often exploited, 
socially isolated and sometimes forced to engage in criminal 
activity just to survive”.  This is a problem which not only 
causes severe harm to this country, but also to the people who 
are exploited. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Often people smuggling is done by organized crime groups such as 
the triads and most recently Russian organized crime that has 
found its way to this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some common solutions to the problem.  Some of them 
have been set out by police.  For example, when all refugee 
claimants are fingerprinted, why do we not simply cross-check 
these fingerprints with our internal police forces first and then 
with the police forces from other countries, including the 
country of origin.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac—Mégantic, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
according to the speaker who came before my hon. colleague from 
Lakeland, the member for Erie—Lincoln, 10 out of 100 prisoners 
obtaining early release could commit a repeat offence afterward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, my colleague from Lakeland focussed mainly on 
immigrants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are very few immigrants in my rural riding, in the eastern 
townships, in Beauce, in the area around Quebec City.  Among 
those we have welcomed is Dominico Staniscia, an Italian 
gentleman who has been responsible for creating twenty or so 
jobs, and who is known pretty well all over Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there is Catherine Ballas, who employs more than 30 people. 
In Milan, there is Jacques Benoît, a VIP in that municipality. 
Disraëli owes a number of jobs to Denis Spiratos. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Lac-Mégantic, there are 18 Serbian families helping out their 
community.  They are putting their culture and training to use, 
at minimum wage, to help others and to help themselves adapt to 
life here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of these people have managed to master French, while 
retaining their mother tongue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the hon. member for Lakeland if he is not getting a 
bit carried away.  Is he not laying too much blame at the feet 
of the immigrants, when he refers to the trade in illegal 
immigrants to this country?  He has even suggested a figure of 
16,000.  It is all very fine to bandy numbers about, but there 
is no need for scaremongering. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I really appreciate the 
question because it gives me a chance to clear up what I did say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make it very clear that the problem is not immigrants, 
nor is the problem legitimate refugee claimants. This government 
and this minister have allowed our system to continue to be 
completely ineffective.  In five years there has not been a bit 
of legislation to help solve the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a few.  We do not know how many because no stats are kept, 
or at least they are not allowed to be released to the public. 
The 15,000 or 16,000 that I mentioned are only a small part of 
the problem.  It is not the immigrants or refugees generally; it 
is bogus refugee claimants, the people who abuse our system, who 
come here with less than honourable intentions in mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is that the system is so lax that it allows in too 
many people who come here to commit crimes.  I am not only 
talking about local crime, I am also talking about organized 
crime.  It has become a huge problem.  I am talking about 
terrorism which is growing in this country to the point that the 
head of CSIS says that Canada is a country which harbours more 
terrorists than any other country except the United States.  It 
is a big problem.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
believe one of the biggest shortcomings that I have viewed in our 
justice system is the treatment of aboriginal people or the 
disproportionate representation of aboriginal people within the 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I noted a startling figure recently.  In 1969, in the Kingston

relate to the presentation I gave, but I am all too happy to 
respond to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I would like to say is that the Reform Party for five years 
now has been proposing solutions to this problem.  We are not 
going to solve the problem with more programs which may help to 
deal with the problem after it has developed.  We are going to 
solve the problem by allowing aboriginal people to give 
themselves more control over their own destiny.  Until that 
happens this problem will never be solved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It starts with proper accountability, on the reserves in 
particular; proper accountability by chiefs and councils on the 
reserves, some of whom are abusing the trust given to them by 
people on the reserves.  We have a list of well over 100 reserves 
across the country that have very serious problems with 
accountability.  The money that goes to the aboriginal people is 
not going to the people who desperately need it.  There is very 
little being done to help develop the economy, for example, so 
that these people can dig themselves out of this problem which 
has gotten worse and worse over the last 30 to 40 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Until we deal with the cause of the problem we are not going to 
be able to do anything in an effective way to deal with the 
problem of too many aboriginal people finding their way into our 
prisons.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure today to speak to the Reform supply day 
motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two ways we can deal with crime.  We can manage it or 
we can prevent it.  Inevitably, it is a combination of both 
within the context of our justice system.  However, I would 
submit that what we have done over the past several decades is 
placed our focus on the management of the problem and we have 
utterly failed in our ability to prevent it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at what has been taking place not only within Canada 
but around the world, we see that there have been some innovative 
programs which have been developed to prevent crime.  One of 
those programs is in Moncton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last spring this House passed a private member's motion that I 
put forth calling for a national head start program.  This 
program would take the best from programs found in Moncton, 
Hawaii, Michigan, the United States; programs which have been 
proven to decrease child abuse by 99%, which keep kids in school 
longer, which have dropped youth crime by 50%, which have 
decreased teen pregnancies by 40% and which have saved the 
taxpayer $30,000 per child. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>New scientific data shows very clearly that when a child is 
subjected in the first eight years of life to issues such as drug 
abuse, sexual abuse, violence, or even to more subtle things such 
as improper parenting or the absence of parenting, it has a 
dramatic negative impact upon the development of that child's 
brain.  The neurological development of that child's brain is 
impeded, which has a dramatic negative effect when the child 
becomes a teenager and later an adult. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at prison populations we find that large chunks of 
the prison populations were subjected to violent sexual abuse and 
such in the course of their childhood.  While that does not 
exonerate them from the crimes they committed, therein lies 
perhaps some truths and perhaps some answers as to how we can 
prevent these people from becoming criminals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Work that was done by the minister of labour and her husband in 
Moncton shows very clearly that when we enable children and 
parents to come together, when parents learn how to be good 
parents and ensure that children in the first eight years of life 
have the basic building blocks to enable them to have their basic 
needs met, they have a much greater chance of becoming 
productive, integrated members of society. 
Remove those or destroy the ability of that child to develop and 
we have the problems that I mentioned before such as criminal 
abuse.

<A HREF="#LINKT78"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Moncton head start program was focused on having parents 
involved in children's behaviour, teaching proper nutrition, 
proper discipline and what it means to be a loving, caring 
parent.  One would be surprised to know that in some communities 
parents do not know that because they were never taught it or 
brought up in that environment.  Where that is lacking in a 
child's development the impact can be dramatic and profoundly 
tragic at times.  Not all children who are subjected to that wind 
up with deleterious effects, but it happens all too often. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Perry preschool program in Ypsilanti, Michigan, has been in 
existence for some 30 years.  It shows very carefully that when 
children's basic needs are met we save $30,000 per child.  There 
was also a 50% reduction in teen pregnancies which we know is a 
route to poverty for many young women and their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Hawaii head start program uses a very innovative tool which 
I think we could employ in our country.  It uses trained 
volunteers, primarily women in their fifties who have had 
children. These women were actually integrated with families at 
risk.  They developed a co-operative integrated relationship with 
those families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What was the outcome?  There was a 99% drop in child abuse among 
those children.  We see a dramatic benefit at the level of child 
abuse.  At the level of society now, with a large number of 
babies boomers in the fifties and sixties age groups, maybe there 
is a way of utilizing their valuable experience in parenting to 
help those in our community who are less able to do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are able to integrate that group of people in the way that 
has been done in Hawaii it would be very cheap and the profound, 
dramatic and positive effects on children would be amazing.  We 
would have a paradigm shift in our thinking on social programs 
from one of the management of problems to the prevention of 
problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through the head start motion I am not asking for the feds to 
take on the responsibility of having a national program with lots 
of money being poured into it, but that the ministers merely ask 
their provincial counterparts beforehand to come together at a 
meeting to find out what works in their provinces and what does 
not.  By asking them to come to the table it will force the 
provinces to rationalize their programs, in which case they can 
remove what is not working and keep what is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many programs in provinces that are done in a 
hodgepodge fashion that work very well for families at risk. 
There are also some programs that are not working well.  It 
behoves all of us as legislators to find out what is working well 
and what is not.  It is our responsibility to the taxpayer to do 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By calling their provincial counterparts together the federal 
ministers can sit down at a table, work together and have an 
integrated approach with cost sharing between the feds and the 
provinces.  The amount of money required for this would be 
minimum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At point zero we could use the medical community.  In the middle 
we could use trained volunteers.  At the age of four through 
eight we could use the education system.  By working with the 
provinces and the feds we could have an integrated approach which 
would help not only families at risk but families that are doing 
financially well with children who are not doing well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the more subtle elements that we are not taking into 
consideration in our communities is latch-key children. Those 
children, despite coming from backgrounds that are privileged, 
have subtle psychological changes taking place within them 
because they do not have parenting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Money is not the most important thing in the development of a 
child.  It is good parenting.  Children have their basic needs 
met in a loving, caring and secure environment.  Perhaps the 
proof is in the pudding.  Let us look at the number of immigrant 
families that come to our country with very little from a 
monetary perspective but have strong parenting skills.  Their 
children are privileged to have such parents.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I grew up in environment in which there was very little money. I 
was very lucky to have parents with strong parenting skills. All 
of us who were privileged to have such parents know the value of 
what they gave us.  They may not have given much in terms of 
monetary goods but they gave us a loving and caring environment 
and society in which to live.  For that we are grateful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many colleagues on the other side have a great deal of expertise 
and experience.  Many ministers and members of parliament on the 
other side have worked very hard on this issue.  The Minister of 
Labour has worked very hard and has been a leader with her 
husband in this regard.  The Secretary of State for Children and 
Youth has worked very hard in her aboriginal community to make 
this a reality as many members have done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I challenge us to work together on the issue and make a national 
head start program a reality.  If we were to do this, it would 
probably be the greatest thing we could do for children and for 
Canadian society in the future.  By doing so we would radically 
change the way we think from the management of these problems to 
their prevention.  No longer would we see half the people in jail 
suffering from fetal alcohol syndrome or fetal alcohol effects, 
the leading cause of preventable birth defects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These individuals are suffering from irreversible brain damage. 
Their average IQ is 68.  They cannot integrate and function 
properly.  When they go to school they are at a loss.  They are 
often marginalized, picked on and left in the periphery.  As a 
result their problems are merely compounded as time passes. While 
not all of them will become criminals by any stretch of the 
imagination, a disproportionate number of them have an enormous 
amount of difficulty becoming integrated productive members of 
society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know my time is up.  There is much more to say not only on 
this issue but on the RCMP and truth in sentencing.  I will close 
with a plug for the RCMP.  For Heaven's sake, please fund them. 
They are not getting the resources they need.  The CPIC computer 
is ready to fall apart.  My colleagues have mentioned many 
constructive solutions which the RCMP need to enable them to do 
their job.  If we do not give them the support they require, they 
will not be able to support our community.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Sue Barnes (London West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the hon. member for his eloquent speech.  He puts many of 
these issues back into a realm where reality reigns.  He talks 
about the true nature of many of the problems and the 
predeterminants of some of the situations, especially of young 
people with different disadvantages which lead them to a later 
involvement in a system of justice that perhaps is not the best 
suited to the correction of problems at that stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many members of the official opposition constantly cry out for 
longer sentences and what would appear to be much harsher 
penalties.  Would the hon. member agree that perhaps not only tax 
dollars would be saved but real results could be obtained if 
instead of lengthier sentences some efforts went toward better 
use of money, behaviour modification and wrap-around systems with 
productive results for the child and society as a whole? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I know the member who asks 
the question has had a long interest in this issue.  Many of my 
colleagues are dividing children who commit crimes into two 
sections.  There are those who are violent criminals and have 
been proven to repeat violent offences against innocent 
civilians.  Those people have demonstrated their wilful neglect 
of innocent Canadians.  We want harsher penalties for them 
because we feel the primary role of the justice system is the 
protection of society, not rehabilitation.  We put protection 
first and rehabilitation second. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not to say we are not interested in rehabilitation.  In 
fact we are.  The member for Surrey North introduced a private 
member's bill which the Minister of Justice integrated into her 
young offenders bill. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1640"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT80"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That bill provided for younger children between the ages of 10 
and 11 to be tried under the Young Offenders Act.  The reason was 
not to have punitive measures enacted against individuals.  The 
reason was to ensure that children at 10 and 11 years of age 
would have the benefits of our judicial system in terms of what 
the hon. member mentioned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How do we treat these problems?  The sooner we can treat the 
problems, the better chance we will have of the child not 
becoming a lifetime criminal and prevent a lot of problems in the 
future.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac—Mégantic, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
colleague in the Reform Party would like, and this is legendary 
in this party, extremely harsh and long sentences, which, as my 
colleague in the party opposite so nicely put it, cost society a 
bundle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have two suggestions for my colleague.  Would it not be a good 
idea first to consider full employment?  Having each Canadian 
working?  Work gets the brain going. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, education is a virtue.  Unfortunately, our government is 
hanging on to significant sums that should be going toward 
education. We should start educating people when they are very 
young to get them used to working and living honourably. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would my colleague in the Reform Party not consider these two 
solutions rather than invest huge sums to put people in prison 
for crimes often starting with petty larceny?  Success at it 
leads to greater and greater crimes, and after 10 or 12 years in 
crime, an individual becomes a powerful criminal and heads into 
violent crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my Bloc Quebecois 
colleague for his question. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to correct the hon. member on one pervasive myth about 
the Reform Party.  Many of our members have been in the forefront 
of being advocates for the prevention of criminal activity and 
for using innovative methods of dealing with non-violent crime. 
However, for individuals who have participated in violent 
criminal activity and have proven to be a danger to society, the 
Reform Party says that the primary objective of the justice 
system is to protect innocent civilians.  That is why we believe 
pedophiles should be locked up.  We believe people who are repeat 
violent offenders should be locked up for a long time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also believe that for individuals committing petty crimes we 
should find alternative, non-custodial ways of dealing with them. 
We also feel there should be innovative ways of dealing with drug 
problems.  For example, instead of incarcerating individuals we 
should do what was done in Scandinavia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The post-needle park Geneva experiment is perhaps the most 
effective and successful method of getting hard core drug abusers 
off the street.  In a one year period of time there was at least 
a 50% or 60% success rate in terms of having hard core drug 
abusers out of jail, in society, working, and off drugs.  There 
is no other program like it in the world.  That is what the 
Reform Party is pushing for, along with many other innovative 
ways of dealing with crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We very much support the aboriginal initiatives and some of the 
methods that aboriginal communities use to deal with non-violent 
crime.  It is something that we could all learn from.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jacques Saada (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, before beginning, I wish to point 
out that I will be sharing my time with the member for London 
West. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very pleased to have this opportunity today to debate 
justice issues.  Before solutions can be found to certain 
problems, we must first ensure that the problems are correctly 
identified.  It happens that there are a number of myths about 
justice, and these myths get in the way of solutions. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1645"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT82"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT82"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1645

<A HREF="#LINKT81"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, one of these myths is that parole is a very bad thing 
because of recidivism.  This is a widespread myth, but a myth 
nonetheless, for it is not true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give a very simple example.  The success rate of 
supervised or unsupervised temporary absences is 98%; this is 
not a failure.  The success rate for paroles is 89.2%.  I think 
that one would be relatively satisfied with a mark of 89.2% on a 
school exam. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These myths are detrimental to the entire justice debate.  Over 
the last five years, the number of violent offences committed by 
inmates released on parole dropped by 70%. 
I repeat: the number of violent offences committed by inmates 
released on parole dropped by 70%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of these myths, suggestions are very often made, and 
unfortunately I must point out that they come primarily from 
certain members of the Reform Party and the Progressive 
Conservative Party.  These proposals are very simplistic: lock 
the criminals up for as long as possible and everything will be 
fine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a simplistic solution. If offenders are locked up, they 
are not hurting the public and the public will therefore be 
safe.  With all due respect, this is absolutely not the case, 
and I will explain why. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a person commits a criminal offence and is sentenced to 
jail, if the jail term is used to prepare that person to better 
understand the world and to reintegrate it, when that individual 
will regain his freedom, he will behave like a law-abiding 
citizen. This is the best guarantee for public safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An inmate who is released without any preparation after spending 
10 or 15 years in jail, is not at all prepared to deal with the 
outside world. In these cases, the chance that the individual 
will reoffend is understandably greater, which means the risk is 
also greater. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether the issue is impaired driving, which we are discussing 
right now, whether it is Bill C-251 on cumulative sentences, 
whether it is the bill that we just tabled regarding young 
offenders, the reaction of some people in this House is 
invariably the same, namely that we must take harsher measures, 
provide more penalties, impose stiffer sentences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I submit that these are very primary reactions, which are based 
on myths and perceptions, not on reality. There is no doubt that 
there are some erroneous perceptions among the public, and that 
we have to correct them. However, it would be a fundamental 
mistake to want to use the justice system to correct such 
perceptions. If the perceptions are wrong, then we have to 
change these perceptions, not the justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this connection, I would just like to point out that I have 
had a number of interesting experiences since becoming the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Solicitor General.  In 
particular, I asked to sit in on a parole board hearing.  This 
was at Laval.  As it happened, the person who was entitled to 
apply for eligibility for parole was someone who had been given 
a life sentence for murder. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened to the deliberations, and everything was more or less 
predictable, except for a reference made at one point to an 
event that had occurred several weeks or months before, when the 
inmate in question had made a section 745 request to appear 
before the board.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A member of the victim's family was in attendance.  This person 
turned to the inmate and said “You hurt me very much, but I 
forgive you”.  The 42-year old inmate, a tough and hardened man, 
burst into tears.  He wanted just one thing, to discover how to 
try to begin to make amends for the harm he had done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning, in committee, where we are working on Bill C-251, 
we had a similar experience. 
Someone who had been found guilty of murder and has been on 
parole for 9 years now works with young people in order to 
prevent them from repeating the same serious mistakes.  Is this 
not an initiative with the greatest chance of successfully 
ensuring public safety? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two ways of looking at things: one can take the 
populist approach, and then when public concern starts to build, 
put more people in jail, increase penalties and jail time; or 
one can look at the true nature of things, which is that human 
beings change and evolve, that they are capable of change and 
the more they are helped to make changes, the more they are 
helped to understand the constraints of society, the more they 
will be brought to contribute to changing our society, and the 
more they themselves will be in a position to help contribute to 
public safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is our position as government.  It is not an easy one in 
political terms.  I am well aware that it is easier to say to 
someone “Do not worry, the criminals are behind bars.  There is 
no problem”.  Criminals do indeed have to pay for their crimes, 
and they must serve time in jail, and prisons are necessary 
because there must be retribution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But this is not the only way.  There is a combination of 
approaches.  Prison, detention, is one, reintegration through 
community programs combines with that, as does awareness of 
community needs and the role of victims too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is there anything more instructive for a criminal than to face 
their victim?  When I say face, I do not mean aggressively, but 
face to face. 
Previously, the victim had just been a number, someone they did 
not know.  Suddenly they meet and they talk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The criminal gets a sense of the wrong he caused his victim, a 
wrong in the victim's daily life and sometimes an irreparable 
wrong.  It allows the criminal to become so much more aware and 
to contribute so much more or at least to have the opportunity 
to contribute so much more to public security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are not easy problems.  I would really hope that we do not 
fall into simplistic solutions.  There are no easy solutions. 
But if I have to choose, I believe in human nature.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Sue Barnes (London West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
commence by saying how much I enjoyed the logic of my colleague 
in his remarks just prior to this.  There is logic to be utilized 
when we are talking about a system of justice in Canada which 
really is a pillar of our democracy, the justice system itself 
and the way we deter those people going against the social values 
of our communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is logic to be utilized in the way that our justice system 
relies on a due process of law so that evidence based reality 
will prevail, the way that we have juries, our peer groups, to 
make decisions and the way we have an independent judiciary 
functioning every day across the country in court rooms helping 
to ensure just results occur based on evidence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a very difficult job. Over the last year it has 
disturbed me greatly the number of occasions where more and more 
in the press and in public discussion there has been something I 
will term judge bashing. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1655"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT83"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think this is a serious situation.  It does not help our 
society.  The judiciary is an arm of our system of government 
that is doing what many of us in the House attempt to do by way 
of public service to our communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason I have raised this is that if someone disagrees with 
my views as a politician, be it in my community or during an 
election campaign, it is fair game for them to target me and to 
voice an opposite and sometime very harsh opinion of my views. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, at the end of the day I have the ability to stand up 
and defend myself by voicing my side of the same arguments.  That 
is something that is not available to justices and judges across 
this land.  Occasionally we will have, coming to their defence, 
some of the organizations such as the bar or the attorneys 
general.  Historically it has been the attorneys general who take 
on this role. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That position inside the judiciary to my mind is not a position 
that is there for popularity.  There is a service also to be done 
if a judge points out a piece of legislation that in their view 
is ambiguous or needs redefinition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of us may agree that the view one is getting through a 
newspaper article, which obviously does not have all the facts, 
may be a situation that seems dead wrong. In that case, 
thankfully in this country we have a system of appeal.  It is 
possible, in a very civilized and due process manner, to get a 
further interpretation or, if necessary, our judicial system 
provides us in this Chamber with the opportunity to change the 
laws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately I have not had a chance all day to hear what has 
been going on, but I want to stress that in Canada it is a shared 
jurisdiction in areas that affect justice.  Here in the Chamber 
we can change the Criminal Code.  We can put in a new act 
concerning youth .  We can do many things with respect to the 
detail of the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, when it touches the ground it has to be provincial or 
territorial jurisdictions that take the administration of those 
laws into the courtrooms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard the Minister of Justice addressing the situation of 
divergent groups and divergent positions across this country. I 
believe that in reality the Canadian public in all the 
communities across the land want the best for the safety of their 
children and their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore think we can all agree with the goals.  I do not 
think there is any party in the House that can take ownership of 
feelings for victims as is often done by parties opposite and the 
official opposition.  All of us are concerned about our 
constituents and their lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When one is addressing solutions in a justice situation, it is 
very important to not only look at the back end, the enforcement 
end, which often does not solve situations.  What really has to 
be there in full force and with a lot of resources is the crime 
prevention end, the determinants of situations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know there are colleagues among in all parties who are singing 
from the same songbook on crime prevention.  If we dig a little 
deeper we see situations where talk is cheap. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just heard my hon. colleague across talking about the needs of 
the aboriginal communities.  I know these communities have great 
needs.  There are systemic problems in a system that would place 
so many aboriginal youths in jail.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party taxpayers budget was going to remove $800 
million from the resources going to aboriginal populations. It is 
easy to say we support, we support, but when push comes to shove, 
the support realistically has to be implemented with budgets that 
are real and for a goal that has as its desired outcome a change 
of behaviour or support for existing conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think specifically about fetal alcohol syndrome.  More 
resources need to be directed to the mother of the youth rather 
than directed to the youth.  Some of the contraindications of 
partaking in alcohol affects taxpayers and communities and 
particularly the affected child who pays throughout his or her 
life. This is preventable.  It is not going to be fixed by 
enforcement. Never. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we talk about the difference between a real solution 
and the simplistic sound bite “Well, I am really going to fix 
this because I am going to be tougher”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my city experiments are going on with sentencing circles, 
youth justice circles.  It is a new way of diverting youth from 
the formalized court system especially with minor property 
offences.  It takes the example from the aboriginal community. 
The aboriginal community started sentencing circles. They are 
effectively working in London, Ontario today and they are being 
expanded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The circles involve the victim, community players, volunteers 
from the community and the offender. In our case we are using it 
for youth.  There has to be an admission of a wrongdoing.  There 
has to be some sort of restitution.  The committee itself in less 
than a couple of hours has to come up with some sort of support 
to wrap around the individual to help change his or her behaviour 
or address the deficiencies in his or her life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have talked with many people who have sat on these sentencing 
circles, including youth who are participating in them.  They see 
this as something that will work. They see the possibility of 
rehabilitation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many such examples. We have a crime prevention 
initiative with $32 million ongoing. The resources that are 
available to communities and their groups are not only those 
enforcement resources.  Yes, they are important and they serve a 
function and there is a time and a place for them. Generally 
speaking we want to modify unacceptable behaviour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have personal experience as a member of the Ontario Criminal 
Code review board for six years.  I dealt in a quasi-judicial 
role with people who had very bad behaviour who through no fault 
of their own but because of a mental incapacity were involved in 
horrible acts against society.  They needed to be there to 
address some of the underlying forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that with my colleagues we will start addressing root 
causes. 
<P><A NAME="LINK243"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
the member mentioned how pleased she was that we have an 
independent judiciary.  The fact is that many of our judiciary 
are political patronage appointees, especially at the higher 
levels.  They are clearly setting out to accomplish a social 
engineering agenda and the public does not like it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member mentioned, she can be held accountable by the 
voters.  She has the opportunity to defend her record and to ask 
her constituents to return her to this place.  That is exactly 
why Reform has suggested a more transparent and open process of 
appointing judges. There really should be a system that more 
publicly examines a person who is going to be in a judiciary 
position so the public can have confidence in that person's 
ability to be totally independent.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Frankly I think perhaps a lot of the judges like the rule where 
they cannot defend themselves because they cannot defend 
themselves.  They cannot defend the decisions they make, as being 
completely out of touch with the community standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have sat in the courts in North Vancouver and I have seen 
plenty of decisions made that are completely out of touch with 
the community standards. The people in the court have almost 
booed at what has been done there.  This is a problem that needs 
to be addressed.  It is as if the judges have become desensitized 
over time because they have seen so much crime in their courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer the member to the case of New York which had a zero 
tolerance policy.  Taking care of the small things automatically 
takes care of the big things.  If there is a zero tolerance for 
small crimes, the big crimes do not happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, with respect to the aboriginal affairs situation, 
around 250 Squamish band members have contacted me in relation to 
Bill C-49.  As part of that process a number of them submitted to 
me budgets of the Squamish band.  In one social services part of 
that band budget which is supposed to look after children, the 
budget is $1.5 million and almost $900,000 of it is used on 
administration.  The band members are complaining about it 
because it is not flowing to the people who should be getting the 
help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the point Reform is making. There is plenty of money in 
Indian and northern affairs.  It is just not getting to the right 
places. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Sue Barnes:</B> Mr. Speaker, on those comments I would 
not know where to start. There are so many issues that could be 
addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Suffice it to say that in every situation there are difficult 
decisions for our judiciary. Unlike many people who have spoken 
and the comments I have heard over the last year, I have respect 
for the judiciary.  I am very grateful that in Canada we have due 
process of law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many I would call moves to shortcuts to make life easier. If 
someone was charged in our household we would want full due 
process of law and every opportunity for a proper defence. At the 
end of the system we would want proper sanctioning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Proper sanctioning has nothing to do with length of sentence. It 
has to do with obtaining a result that will be better for the 
safety of the community and which will work toward a 
rehabilitation of the individual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Public safety and security is of utmost importance.  One of the 
ways this is accomplished is through rehabilitation. The reality 
is that most offenders will get out of the system. At the end of 
the day as a society, do we want them better functioning when 
they leave than when they went in, or do we just want them 
hardened and bitter and without hope?  At the end of the day they 
are going to be members of our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Solicitor General commented 
earlier about how useful the parole system is in having some 
limitation on whom people can engage with, where they must report 
to, where they live.  These are safeguards that are in the 
system.  If we checked the recidivism rates, we would actually 
see that where there are no parole systems in place, the small 
percentage of people where there is no parole provision, they are 
the ones who are more likely to reoffend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member has asked something about which I could talk for 
hours addressing all of those situations. Suffice it to say that 
I have a lot of faith in our democratic judicial system, a 
democracy supporting an independent judicial system.  I certainly 
would never want to see elections for judges.  I believe that 
there is not a justice in this country appointed to the bench who 
was not qualified. 
<P><A NAME="LINK244"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
appears that I am lucky enough to be the last speaker for the 
last few minutes on this debate.  It is like being the hammer 
rock in curling; hopefully if one is witty enough maybe one can 
just clear house. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been far too broad and expansive a debate to even try to 
summarize things. I would like to use these last few moments to 
add a couple of points to what has already been put on the table. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1710"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT86"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everybody here will agree that crime, punishment, safety and 
justice are issues we hear about in our ridings all the time.  It 
does not matter what our political stripe is. Canadians are 
talking about them and Canadians want to talk about them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am always amazed at how with the same set of circumstances we 
can come up with two so different sets of conclusions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have heard for most of the day from the majority of the 
Reform Party speakers is an ongoing barrage about tougher 
enforcement, more boot camps, more prisons, lock them up and hang 
them high. It hearkens back to the day when Spanky wanted to go 
to Singapore, buy a stick and learn how to beat children better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We really have not heard anything innovative from the Reform 
Party, with the exception of the member for Esquimalt—Juan de 
Fuca who actually brought a very balanced approach to the whole 
day.  I am glad he spoke toward the end because there are many 
parts of his remarks which I can certainly work with. The Reform 
Party has one view of the world by and large.  The member for 
Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca is clearly in contrast with most of his 
political party.  He smiles in front of it intellectually. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party says one thing.  The NDP would much rather talk 
about victims rights than increased levels of punishment.  We 
have tabled documents in the province of Manitoba.  The NDP was 
very well received in terms of taking care of victims rights but 
also in taking care of the root causes of crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned the aboriginal community when I rose for one of my 
interventions.  There was the shocking, horrifying fact that the 
Kingston women's penitentiary was 100% aboriginal population, 
that every single woman there was aboriginal for a period of time 
in the late 1960s and the early 1970s.  The figure is still 
hugely disproportionate to the population. Three or four per cent 
of the population is aboriginal.  Seventy or eighty or ninety per 
cent of the prison population are aboriginal.  Something is 
clearly wrong when there are figures like that. This needs to be 
addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the province I come from it is a very real issue.  I know 
that if I had been walking home instead of J. J. Harper one 
winter evening, I may have been stopped by the police but I 
probably would not have died that night. I know that if Helen 
Betty Osborne had been a white girl rather than an Indian girl, 
it would not have taken 16 years to solve her murder.  It would 
have been a far more pressing issue.  People would have seized 
themselves of the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously the issue of the aboriginal people and their presence 
in our penal institutions and our justice system needs to be 
addressed first and foremost. I am surprised that was not one of 
the main focuses of the Reform Party's motion today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen the U.S. model.  We heard ideas about boot camps 
and other things that are clearly from the U.S.  We saw what 
happened in the U.S. as it tried to lock up a whole generation of 
young black men.  That was the solution to crime in the United 
States.  The U.S. tried to lock up a whole generation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The U.S. built more prisons and then privatized them, turning 
them into for profit ventures.  Private prisons, what a concept. 
Locking people up for profit.  I am surprised this did not come 
from the camp to my left because it is clearly in keeping with 
its ideology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prisons are big business in Canada too.  The one thing I would 
like to use my last moment to comment on is the privatization of 
the education system within our Canadian prisons. Former 
Correctional Service Canada employees are quitting their jobs and 
contracting out the education of inmates on a for profit basis, 
and they are not the low bidder. In the prairie region, the 
contracting company's bid was millions of dollars higher than 
that of Evergreen School Division which used to deliver the 
service, quality service at a lower cost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It makes one wonder.  If we care about this kind of thing at 
all, why would we pay more money for less service?  When I say 
less service, the contracting company owned by former 
Correctional Service Canada employees is not even licensed to 
give any kind of credit for the high school training given. More 
money is being paid for less service and the graduates do not 
even get any kind of credentials when they leave the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Penal institutions for profit and the privatization of the 
education system within the jails are things I wanted to point 
out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  It being 5.15 p.m.,

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP)</B> moved: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That a legislative committee be established to prepare and bring 
in a bill, in accordance with Standing Order 68(4)(b), to abolish 
the legal defence of provocation contained in section 232 of the 
Criminal Code of Canada. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>She said:  Mr. Speaker, the intent of the motion is to abolish 
the defence of provocation which makes excuses for murder.  If we 
as a country hold murder to be abhorrent, so much so that we do 
not have the death penalty, why on earth would we incorporate 
values that excuse murder on the basis of an insult or a wrongful 
act?  My intention is to get rid of this defence so that we do 
not come out at the end of a trial wondering how on earth someone 
could get less than five years for murdering someone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This happened in my community.  I am still wondering how Ralph 
Klassen could get a five year sentence for murdering his wife. 
How can we say that he did not intend to murder her when he 
strangled her by tying a pillow case around her neck? Because he 
did not intend to murder her, his sentence was reduced to 
manslaughter and he got a very small sentence.  I will again 
state that it clearly comes down to how we value human life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were huge walks in protest against this sentence.  I have 
been presenting petitions in parliament over the last year and a 
half asking for the abolition of the defence of provocation.  Our 
justice minister put out a discussion paper last fall but there 
has been no movement on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will go into more details on this defence.  It is a partial 
defence for murder.  What it does not do is take away the right 
of people to defend their family, themselves or their property. 
There are specific areas of defence in our laws that look after 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This law came out of the 17th century where two men of equal 
class were considered able to fight a duel in effect because 
someone had been insulted.  Since their honour was at stake it 
was considered quite normal that they would fight.  What we call 
that now is a bar room brawl. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that time there was a death penalty for murder.  The idea was 
to provide an understanding of a human frailty.  Yet we do not 
provide a defence for someone who commits a murder out of 
compassion or pity.  We do not excuse the fact they felt so bad 
for the person that they felt it was justified to kill him or 
her, but we are saying that if someone gets angry, furious or 
enraged it is all right for them to act on that rage and murder 
someone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now jump back to Yukon.  Within a period of years we had 
the Klassen murder case in which he got a five year sentence. He 
was a man who had many degrees, studied theology and held himself 
to be morally and intellectually above most of his peers or 
anyone in his community.  He got a very short sentence for the 
murder of a woman he said provoked him, taunted him, drove him to 
murder.

<A HREF="#LINKT95"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was also a young woman who killed her spouse when she came 
upon him having sex with another man.  She stabbed him.  He died. 
She got a maximum sentence.  She was not even eligible for parole 
for a minimum of 10 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not saying that she should have got Mr. Klassen's sentence. 
What I am saying is that the defence is wrong and he should have 
got her sentence.  We should not be excusing murder because of a 
passionate outburst or an angry, rage filled outburst. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The defence of provocation will accept an excuse of something 
that is grossly insulting, an attack upon a friend or a man 
coming upon his wife in adultery.  Those are the foundations of 
the defence.  It is based on the idea that uncontrollable acts of 
anger or passion should be forgiven with a lesser penalty, but 
again not acts of compassion.  It is also based on the premise 
that the victim got what he or she deserved, that somehow he or 
she deserved to be murdered and we should then excuse the person 
who did it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Klassen case torment and taunt were alleged.  We have to 
remember that Susan Klassen was dead at that point.  The husband 
and wife were separated.  He drove thousands of miles out the 
highway, came to the marriage home, expected to sleep in the 
marriage bed, and she said “what is the use?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To defend this supposed statement he had someone say that a few 
years ago she had made an allusion to his low sperm count.  That 
was the provocation.  That was the wrongful act, words, or the 
insult which drove this man to murder his wife.  There is no way 
that we should accept those kinds of excuses within the Criminal 
Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes even further than that because after that sentence was 
rendered people who were in anger management programs felt that 
they would have been better off if they had murdered their 
spouses because then they would not be in anger management 
programs and would have been out of jail without having any 
further obligations to their community or society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Provocation basically went unchanged until the 19th century when 
some criteria were placed on it.  It had to meet the standard of 
a reasonable person, someone who identified with you or I or 
anyone who had reasonable control over his or her emotions.  One 
of the criteria is that the person had to have acted suddenly, 
that the insult or provocation had to have been sudden and 
unexpected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Someone who suffered long term abuse could never use the defence 
of provocation.  If a person had been beaten for years then the 
provocation of having been beaten was not sudden.  Nor was it 
unexpected.  People who have been beaten, whether a child, a 
spouse or an elderly person who sometimes and often sadly are 
abused in society, and react in any way to the defend themselves 
or to kill someone who routinely beat them could not apply for 
the defence of provocation because it was not sudden. They had 
been beaten before so they would expect to be beaten more.  That 
defence is patently not available to those people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even in the Ratushny report prepared by that judge for justice 
minister she said that four of the approximate 100 women's cases 
that she looked at would have been eligible to invoke the defence 
of provocation.  One of them did and it was rejected in the 
court, and the other three refused to do it for very personal 
reasons.  They felt they were making excuses for what they did 
and so they did not invoke that defence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not often used for women because the context of the 
defence does not allow for conditions in which, sadly, women 
murder.  The case in Yukon was a classic case of provocation and 
it was not even considered for that young woman.  She got a 
penalty which I think is accurate and fair for anyone who 
murders, especially in a fit of rage, because we are supposedly 
brought up to control ourselves, not to let words get to us, and 
to act in a manner according to our community's desire for peace 
and harmony. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Using the term a wrongful act or an insult widens how this 
defence can be used.  It has been used over and over.  For 
example, if someone says she is barren she could not kill her 
husband and use that as a justification.  Yet if it is turned 
around it is being justified.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a man makes a sexual advance toward another man, it is used 
in cases where homosexuals are killed.  Is that reason enough to 
kill someone?  Is that considered an insult?  Is that response a 
lethal response? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is killing someone else an acceptable response to a word or an 
insult?  No matter how dreadful one feels about that insult, can 
they retaliate with taking someone's life? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Remember when it comes to using the defence of provocation, 
murder is never in question.  It is established that it was not 
murder.  It is firmly entrenched in our cultural ideas of what an 
insult is, what honour is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a <I>Witness</I> program which documented honour 
killings which we generally associate with the Far East.  Women I 
talked to who had watched that movie were absolutely horrified. 
We have honour killings.  That is what the defence of provocation 
is all about.  It is about justifying honour killing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is legal for a person to want to leave a relationship.  We 
call it divorce.  A person can do that.  The most dangerous time 
for a woman who leaves a relationship is the time period 
immediately thereafter. That is when she is most in danger of 
being murdered. She has stepped outside the boundaries, outside 
of what is considered honourable and outside of the control of 
the person she married.  Therefore her life is in danger, as 
possibly are the lives of her children.  Often her life is taken. 
Such was the case with Susan Klassen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we accept in law is not far from the rule of thumb, where 
it was perfectly all right for a husband to beat his wife as long 
as he did not use anything thicker than the width of his thumb. 
That was the rule of law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This defence still hinges on those kinds of concepts.  They are 
based on gender and class.  They do not have any room in our 
society.  We cannot excuse a man or a woman for acting out in a 
rage or frenzy.  It is not acceptable to say that a person 
deserved to be killed and because that person said something that 
was not liked, the person who did the killing is given a lesser 
sentence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a judge reduces a sentence for murder to manslaughter there 
is no minimum sentence applied. Moving it down to manslaughter 
means that the judge has complete discretion over the sentencing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Violence in the home and violence between intimate partners 
should carry a heavier sentence.  It is a position of trust that 
has been violated.  We should be safe in our home, not in more 
danger.  Of those women who are killed, most are killed within 
the home.  Our chief justice says that our law has traditionally 
insulated accountability for violence in the home, that it has 
made it all right, that we would turn a blind eye to violence in 
the home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It still happens.  It happens at the basic level of law 
enforcement.  RCMP officers and other police officers do not want 
to go into those situations. They turn the other way. It does not 
matter how many times a woman calls, there is no response to 
their situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has been accepted as insults in our law?  These actions are 
unlawful but have been considered insults concerning the defence 
of provocation: articulating one's rights; expressing a 
difference of opinion; taking a job; having a relationship with 
persons other than one's spouse, partner or lover; selecting 
one's friends; maintaining family relationships; striking back 
when being battered.  They are used to justify battering of 
partners and the murder of partners.  The nature of insults is 
troubling because they can provide and do provide a licence to 
kill. 
We have to question, are there any words that we would accept as 
giving a lethal response?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other arguments are that this defence would be better if it was 
broadened and opened up for women to use as well. I argue against 
this because the premise is bad.  The idea of being able to kill 
for one's honour should not be expanded to include another 
gender.  It would be broadened on a basis that is wrong, on 
values that are wrong, on a principle that is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would we expand something that is essentially wrong and 
allow more people access to making excuses?  We do not make 
excuses in other areas of law.  Lesser offences do not have a 
built-in provocation defence to make excuses for people.  Why when 
we hit the most dreadful of crimes in our country, murder, would 
we then be willing to make excuses? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada does not have a death penalty any more.  Nobody is facing 
a death penalty when charged and found guilty of murder.  Why 
would we lessen a sentence to a point where it is almost 
meaningless within our community? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at provocation in terms of principles, we should not 
have it.  It should not exist and we should not be honouring it 
in any terms, let alone by entrenching it in our thoughts and in 
our courts.  If it is looked at in terms of stakeholders and who 
benefits from using the defence of provocation, then there are a 
lot of problems and questions based on value.  We would have a 
defence that as it stands is more accessible for men to use when 
they kill their spouse or when they kill someone they have gotten 
into a fight with. We are making it more accessible in those 
terms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Based on principle and value it is not a defence we should be 
promoting, using or having available for a judge to apply in any 
manner whether it is justified or unjustified.  My point is the 
defence of provocation is never justified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Justice put out a discussion paper.  I travelled 
around the Yukon Territory last year.  In the fall I held a town 
hall so that I could give a response to the minister and be part 
of the discussion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is one of the topics that is more difficult to speak about 
but it does not mean it should not be discussed.  It means we 
have to push hard to move forward and to make changes in our 
justice system that will bring equality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe if we abolish the defence of provocation that 
suddenly we will have a far more peaceful and violence free 
society.  I do not think that will happen but it is a step in 
that direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to address the intent to kill.  We cannot accept that 
someone did not mean to kill the person, even though they put 
their hands around the person's neck and choked the person until 
their thumbs broke, even though they tied a pillowcase around the 
person's neck, even though they stabbed someone 47 times.  We 
cannot accept that they did not somehow intend the action to 
kill. If they do that and do not claim insanity or any altered 
mental state, then they by their actions meant to kill somebody. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, I do not think this will change our society dramatically 
but it will be a step in that direction.  It will be a movement 
toward saying you cannot beat somebody up and blame it on them; 
you cannot murder somebody and blame it on them.  We will not 
give a lesser sentence under those circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will end with a tribute to Susan Klassen's family, to every 
man or woman who has been murdered and their murder excused on 
the basis of this defence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When our country lost a woman like Susan Klassen, it was a 
terrible tragedy that will not go away. 
She was a kind and generous woman, a storyteller of international 
renown.  She was generous with her stories which came out of her 
like a symphony. She shared them with the young and old, 
throughout her day, in her job, in our arts centre.  She was a 
focal point for the northern storytelling festival which 
storytellers from around the world attend.

her. Nobody would hear from this woman again.  She was in the

frightening to everybody in the community. I am really proud that 
our city stood up, men, women and children protested. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot allow this.  We cannot exonerate people for murder. We 
certainly cannot do it based on an archaic sense of honour, that 
someone should be allowed to take another life on the basis of an 
insult. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a votable motion.  I appeal to have the issue sent to a 
committee to be looked at even more closely with the intent to 
hopefully abolish it and move what we need into self-defence.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Eleni Bakopanos (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
Motion No. 265 by the hon. member for Yukon would establish a 
legislative committee to prepare a bill abolishing the defence of 
provocation as contained in section 232 of the Criminal Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member presented quite a case and I commend her for 
paying homage to the reason she brought forth the motion in the 
House. The Minister of Justice knows the case very well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the minister has indicated that reforming the law of 
provocation is one of her priorities, she cannot support this 
motion at this time. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last June, the minister initiated public consultation on the 
subject by publishing a consultation document.  In our opinion, 
it would be premature to strike a legislative committee while 
the Department of Justice is still studying public responses on 
means of defence based on provocation. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The law respecting provocation is complex and admittedly 
controversial.  I think the hon. member referred to that in her 
own remarks.  The defence of provocation is a partial and limited 
defence and I want to stress that.  It applies only to a charge 
of murder. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 232 of the Criminal Code provides that a charge of 
murder may be reduced to manslaughter if the offence was 
committed by a person in the heat of passion caused by sudden 
provocation.  Furthermore, the provocation must be caused by a 
wrongful act or insult that would be sufficient to deprive an 
ordinary person of the power of self-control and it must also be 
shown that the accused acted on it on the sudden and before there 
was time for his passion to cool. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the defence is successful, it does not result in acquittal. 
Instead it results in the accused being convicted of the crime of 
manslaughter which carries a maximum penalty of life 
imprisonment. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Historically, the defence of provocation has been of very 
limited application; it was used by men defending their honour 
during an unpremeditated confrontation, or when their wife had 
committed adultery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nowadays, the defence of provocation is justified by the fact 
that the law must be tolerant toward human frailty, when a 
person is subject to a provocation that exceeds his ability to 
control himself. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some recent cases which received significant media attention 
have given rise to concerns over the application of the defence 
of provocation.  Some have suggested that the criminal law in 
this area condones violent behaviour by men against women and 
excuses extreme violence provoked by insults or injury relating 
to a person's sexuality or masculinity.

<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Justice is well aware of these cases and of the 
growing public criticism of the legal rules that govern 
provocation, and she is taking a very serious look at these 
issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of groups and individuals, including the former Law 
Reform Commission of Canada, have drawn our attention to related 
issues and have asked that we restrict the use of that legal 
defence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The criticism primarily has to do with the fact that the 
historical origins of this defence still form the basis for its 
use before the courts, and that current rules may not reflect 
modern values and ideals. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time it must be stated that support for the 
abolition of provocation is not universal at this time.  Other 
groups have recommended expansion of the defence, such as the 
Canadian Bar Association, on the basis that human frailty should 
be recognized by criminal law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that there is a great deal of disagreement over the 
proper scope of the defence of provocation in modern Canadian 
society.  Any move toward limiting this defence must be done 
carefully and with due consideration of all the options and the 
potential consequences of each of these actions. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned, the Department of Justice is following up on the 
requests for a reform and on the change in the public's 
perception of the law on provocation, and it has conducted a 
careful review of the issues and various options for reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Justice also met with provincial and territorial 
justice ministers to discuss this specific issue, and the 
federal and provincial justice officials are working together to 
determine the feasibility of the various options for reform. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In an effort to better understand how Canadians feel about this 
issue, the Department of Justice released a discussion paper in 
the summer of 1998 which formed the basis of public 
consultations. I am glad to hear that the hon. member also did a 
consultation in her own riding. The department is currently 
reviewing responses submitted by individuals and interested 
groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister is committed to ensuring that the law reflects 
modern values and works fairly for all Canadians.  The law on 
provocation is very complex, as I said earlier, and is also tied 
to other areas of criminal law, in particular to the law of 
self-defence, adding further complexity to the task of reforming 
Criminal Code defences and again highlighting the need for an 
in-depth study before making changes. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion, the hon. member's motion to abolish the legal 
defence of provocation is premature. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reforming the law on provocation is important, as I said 
earlier, to the Minister of Justice.  She has taken the steps 
necessary at this time to ensure that any amendments will reflect 
and respond to the views and values of Canadians. Consultations 
have been done. We have finished the consultations and we are 
reviewing what options we will take. 
<P><A NAME="LINK287"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, while I commend all the members for their work in 
representing their constituents and while I commend all members 
for their efforts to make Canada's laws better, I really cannot 
agree with the motion introduced by the hon. member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She made the point that this is a women's issue and I 
immediately remember reading the paper put out by the justice 
department.  Here is what the justice department's own figures 
show, that this really is not a women's issue.  In fact, it is 
the opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Department of Justice's own research shows that in 64% of 
the cases where a man killed a woman the defence of being 
provoked was rejected.  In the cases where men were killed by 
women 43% of the cases rejected this defence.  Obviously women 
benefit more than men from this law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I too consider carefully what my petitioners are telling me. 
Tens of thousands of petitioners have written to me with their 
concerns about the government's gun registration bill, the 
defunding of abortions, parental rights and property rights.  I 
have introduced private member's bills and motions on these 
issues and I am not as fortunate as the hon. member for Yukon to 
have one of my bills or motions made a votable item.  Perhaps my 
bills and motions are not closely aligned with the agenda of the 
Liberal Party.  I have personally introduced petitions with more 
than 43,000 signatures calling on the government to repeal Bill 
C-68, the Firearms Act, but the government continues to ignore 
these requests by Canadians.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do the Liberals respond to issues from some petitioners and 
not others?  Maybe the government will listen and act if the 
Liberals happen to agree with the petitioners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Putting politics aside, I am pleased to be given the opportunity 
to participate in this debate about the defence of provocation. I 
hope to expand the debate about the need to retain self-defence 
sections of the Criminal Code as they are currently written. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first thing I did when I saw this motion was to reread 
section 232 of the Criminal Code.  The justice department claims 
this section has remained virtually unchanged since 1892. My 
initial reaction is to reject any demands to abolish a law that 
has been serving Canadians for so long.  I do not have a closed 
mind about this but it makes me very wary. The longer the law has 
been in force is directly proportional to the level and 
seriousness of the debate the House should have about the 
abolition of such an old and fundamental defence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the synopsis in the Criminal Code it is clear that the 
interpretation and application of the defence of provocation has 
not remained static.  Many cases before the courts have set legal 
precedents to determine the sufficiency of evidence to raise this 
defence, the nature of the objective test of the term ordinary 
person, the instructions or charging of a jury, the applications 
of this defence to attempted murder, the definition of 
self-induced provocation, and constitutional considerations. This 
section of the Criminal Code has been in a constant state of 
change by the judicial process, as it should be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the hon. member's Motion No. 265.  It is not 
simply a motion to have a legislative committee investigate or 
review the defence of provocation.  If it were, we might be able 
to support it.  If the House approves this motion, it directs the 
committee to prepare and bring a bill to abolish the legal 
defence of provocation contained in section 232 of the Criminal 
Code of Canada.  I cannot accept that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not even the justice department's own consultation paper, 
“Reforming Criminal Code Defences:  Provocation, Self-Defence 
and Defence of Property” released last year goes that far.  The 
justice department's paper asks for public input on a range of 
nine options with respect to the defence of provocation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will list these nine options so they are on the record for 
<I>Hansard</I>: to abolish the defence of provocation; to reform 
the defence of provocation by removing the phrase “in the heat 
of passion”; to replace the term “wrongful act” with 
“unlawful act”; to remove the ordinary person test to reflect 
the mixed subjective-objective test; to reform the defence of 
expanding the “suddenness” requirement; to reform the defence 
so that it is not available in cases of spousal homicides; to 
reform the defence so that it is not available in cases where the 
victim asserts his or her charter protected rights; to reform the 
defence to limit it to situations where excessive force was used 
in self-defence; to leave the Criminal Code provisions on the 
provocation defence exactly as they are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before the House can support this motion, each of these nine 
options has to be seriously considered and debated.  Eight of the 
options proved unworkable beyond any doubt.  That is what has to 
happen and that is why we cannot pass this motion. The justice 
consultation paper even outlined the pros and cons for each of 
these options. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The duty of the House before we approve a motion to abolish the 
defence of provocation would be to look at each of the arguments 
for and against abolition.  It would be reform or no change to 
section 232.  We would have to be convinced that the advantages 
outweigh the disadvantages.  We would have to examine each of the 
arguments against abolition or reform and rule on each. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Look at the justice department's own arguments against abolition 
as stated in the department's consultation paper.  The defence of 
provocation might be useful for women in situations of domestic 
violence who kill in self-defence but with excessive force in 
response to the provocation of physical or verbal abuse.  That is 
a very important point.  There could be an increase in acquittals 
by juries that no longer have the alternative to a murder 
condemnation in cases where they view the accused as morally less 
worthy of blame.  Murder might be considered an inappropriate 
term for killing under provocation. 
The reasons to abolish the provocation defence put forward by my 
hon. colleague from Yukon do not adequately address these 
arguments raised by the Justice Department, let alone the 
arguments that have yet to be raised by the legal community and 
the general public.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I want to comment about the tendency of some to clamour 
for changing or abolishing a law because of the circumstances of 
one case.  For every case the member raises which seems to 
support abolition, I could rebut her position with another court 
case that supports the opposite view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, last year in my home province a 29 year old, James 
Allan Tomlinson, was sentenced to life imprisonment with no 
chance of parole for 10 years for the second degree murder of a 
67 year old farmer, Stacey Clark.  Mr. Tomlinson alleged that Mr. 
Clark grabbed his genitals and that this provoked Mr. Tomlinson 
to stomp Mr. Clark to death, breaking most of the bones in his 
chest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tomlinson claimed that he should be found guilty of the lesser 
charge of manslaughter because he did not intentionally kill Mr. 
Clark.  Justice John Kelbuc shot down the argument, saying the 
defence of provocation was not intended to create an open season 
on homosexuals who act unlawfully. We have an example of a case 
that completely contradicts the examples given by the hon. 
member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I firmly believe the facts of each of these seemingly 
contradictory cases are best left in the hands of judges and 
juries.  If mistakes in the law are made, these individual cases 
are best left in the hands of crown prosecutors and provincial 
attorneys general to appeal all the way to the supreme court if 
necessary. If the supreme court rules contrary to the wishes of 
parliament or the people, then we must amend the law.  So far 
this has not happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Supreme Court of Canada had the opportunity to review a case 
on defence of provocation as recently as 1996.  I quote from an 
article that appeared in the February 19, 1996 issue of 
<I>Western Report</I>: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Chief Justice Cory clarified when it [section 232] can be 
invoked. There is an objective and a subjective test.  The former 
determines whether the insult was severe enough to deprive the 
killer of his self-control.  The latter requires that his 
subsequent response was sudden, before his passion cooled. Prior 
to leaving this defence with a jury, the judge must find some 
evidence of provocation.  It is then up to the jury to determine 
if the defence holds up under the facts. The jury must take into 
consideration the age, sex, and racial origin of the accused, to 
determine whether an “ordinary person” of reasonable 
self-control would, under similar circumstances, be provoked by 
the act or insult in question. The supreme court also endorsed 
for the first time the finding of a lower court that the history 
of the relationship between the victim and perpetrator should 
also be considered. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Justice Cory stated in his judgment: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, events leading to the break-up of the marriage can 
never warrant taking the life of another.  Affairs cannot justify 
murder.  Still any recognition of human frailties must take into 
account that these very situations may lead to insults that could 
give rise to provocation. The good sense of jurors will 
undoubtedly lead them to consider all the facts, including the 
presence of a loaded gun in the car. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This does not sound like a section of the criminal code that has 
outlived its usefulness.  I will vigorously oppose this motion. I 
hope all members of the House will take these arguments into 
consideration that I have presented and make their decisions to 
support or oppose this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I compliment the member for Yukon for raising this issue.  It 
has been very good for me to do the research and to find out the 
background about this.  We really should have legislation before 
the House that can be debated.  Some expert witnesses could then 
be called and we could spend our time debating the legislation. 
As this motion is worded, I cannot support it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK288"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I too am honoured and pleased to take part in this 
debate.  I offer my congratulations to the hon. member for Yukon 
for bringing about this very important matter and giving us in 
the Chamber an opportunity to discuss this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The defence of provocation I would not go so far as to call an 
obscure section of the Criminal Code but it is one that does not 
receive broad application. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1900"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is one that I did come across in my time as a crown 
prosecutor in Nova Scotia.  It is a section that has a fair bit 
of confusion surrounding it.  Much like the defence of 
self-defence, it is extremely difficult for jury members, in 
particular lay persons without legal training.  I would even go 
so far as to say that many in the legal profession have a great 
deal of trouble interpreting sections such as this including 
provocation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motivation behind the hon. member for Yukon in bringing this 
matter forward is certainly laudable.  I am also familiar with 
the very tragic case of Susan Klassen.  I had the pleasure of 
meeting her sister when she attended a justice conference here in 
Ottawa last summer.  Her motivation is beyond question.  I note 
from her remarks that it is something she feels very passionately 
about, and rightly so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, as we progress in the law we must be aware that there 
is a true danger in taking single cases in isolation and using 
that as a motivation to entirely change the law.  I am not 
suggesting that is entirely what is happening here, but there is 
always a danger in holding up one particular case as a means to 
entirely revamp or, in this proposed scenario, withdraw a section 
of the Criminal Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not to say that there is not often a great deal of need 
and in fact a legitimate desire to change a section of the 
Criminal Code to make it operate in a more efficient and just way 
for Canadians at large.  However, to remove section 232 of the 
Criminal Code, I would suggest, would ignore the fact that there 
is a real element of human frailty encompassed in that particular 
section. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Criminal Code is a document that is not immune to change. 
However, there are certain sections of the code that have been in 
place for some period of time.  One would make the strong 
argument that they have been subject to considerable judicial 
interpretation and expression over a long period of time, which 
does have some weight when one considers the desire to remove 
that section completely from the code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to Motion No. 265, I would suggest that there is 
really a need for change, but perhaps not a need to go as far as 
this motion would suggest, which is to withdraw the entire 
section completely because of an unpopular or an unjust 
interpretation of that section. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All sections of the Criminal Code, however old, are written in 
such a way as to allow for judicial interpretation.  Upon first 
glance, sections of the Criminal Code may seem to be outdated, 
yet when subjected to judicial interpretation they are brought up 
to speed in a number of ways which allow a judge to ensure that 
justice does prevail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Detractors may argue that problems arise in judicial 
interpretation and that allows for decisions such as we saw in 
the B.C. court case involving Shaw.  That particular case once 
again highlights the danger in taking one particular instance of 
a judicial interpretation and suggesting that we must then repeal 
an entire section of the Criminal Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a firm believer in change for our system.  I am also 
confident that the judges of the supreme court will correct the 
ruling with respect to child pornography.  With that said, the 
Criminal Code is a written reference by which Canadians conduct 
themselves.  It is intended to provide guidelines for our 
society, for a safe and orderly environment and it is an 
embodiment of a moral standard that is to be upheld by those who 
choose to live or visit Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that the Criminal Code is not perfect.  How could it 
be?  It is made by man.  Yet to allow the dissolution of an 
entire law simply to appease the demands of a special interest 
group would set a very dangerous precedent and would lead to 
constant band-aid solutions to very specific problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The oversimplification of any law would limit judicial 
interpretation of the code when dealing with future cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Being quick to enact a change each time a particular case 
emerges through the courts and is handed down, I suggest, would 
be very dangerous and would lead to an eventual dismantling of 
our Criminal Code or such disarray or uncertainty amongst the 
judiciary, law enforcement agents, lawyers and, most importantly, 
the general public that this type of confusion would further 
undermine an already very sceptical and cynical public.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Department of Justice has been asked for commentary on this 
particular section, among others, such as self-defence and the 
defence of property, but in particular the defence of 
provocation.  This is an extremely useful exercise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to say at the outset that provocation is not a 
complete defence, as has been mentioned.  It mitigates, it brings 
a murder charge into a manslaughter situation and denotes a 
lesser degree of culpability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Concern over the issue of the defence of provocation stems from 
societal progress.  In the early 1990s critics felt that this 
section of the Criminal Code promoted outdated values and was 
used to defeat modern egalitarian principles.  However, it 
affords a degree of protection that is legitimate, perhaps 
limited at times, and as a blanket statement it does not lower or 
lessen the level of accountability in all cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently the Criminal Code allows for the defence of 
provocation.  However, in recent years the nature, the use and 
the existence of this law has become more narrowly defined.  The 
objective and the subjective tests that are incorporated into 
this section provide some degree of protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, the successful use of the defence of provocation in a 
number of well publicized cases raises public concern.  However, 
there is no suggestion here that this law condones violence in 
any way, shape or form.  In a legal sense it takes into 
consideration the deprivation of a person's reason and ability to 
respond rationally and proportionately to a very stressful 
situation.  Where they might have acted otherwise, the defence of 
provocation does particularize and individualize the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe for a moment that the law condones violence. 
In fact the law protects those who find themselves in this 
condition of mental anguish or distress.  This condition could 
stem from an extreme situation, such as mental, physical or 
emotional abuse. Therefore, persons who found themselves reaching 
that point of distress should not be deprived of the ability to 
raise this issue at trial, not for the purposes of completely 
removing responsibility for their actions, but for the purposes 
of putting a particular scenario into a particular circumstantial 
scenario before the trier of fact and the jury. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Criminal Code can protect persons if it remains in its 
current form where non-partisan judges are left to interpret the 
code and hand down a decision that will address the needs and 
concerns of modern society.  Specific interpretations or specific 
factors, such as age, race, sex or religion, are taken into 
account when a judge is faced with weighing the applicability of 
provocation.  A taunt or the provocative action or remark is also 
taken into consideration, so it is very much an individualized 
and tailored piece of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Issues of self-defence and defence of property have also been 
singled out for change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, I commend the member because this is a very timely 
intervention.  It is fair to say that it is an extremely 
complicated and confusing section of the Criminal Code that 
requires greater study and greater definition under the current 
provisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Department of Justice has expressed a desire to look at 
these proposed changes.  As was previously mentioned, it has 
already made certain recommendations as they pertain to the 
defence of provocation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to dealing with this particular motion, the 
Department of Justice has expressed that willingness.  As we have 
seen with other cases, and particularly situations involving 
changes to the Criminal Code, this government does not exactly 
have a great record to stand on in terms of its timeliness of 
response, but hope burns eternal in this regard.  One would hope 
that the non-partisan level of debate that we have heard here 
will also prevail when it comes time to look at this situation at 
the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Issues dealing with the legality involved in the interaction 
between men and women are in a constant state of flux in today's 
society.  Working toward creating a level playing field is a 
constant challenge to our legal drafters, as well as those who 
are left to interpret these laws.  We cannot either change the 
law as frequently as society changes or react in a very 
shortsighted way when occasion occurs.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as 
the seconder of Motion No. 265 I am very pleased to have the 
opportunity to rise and to lend my support to the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Briefly, I would like to comment on the tone and the content of 
the debate in the House of Commons today.  I would compliment all 
of the speakers for taking this issue in a very serious and 
respectful way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice started 
her remarks by saying that this is an issue that the government 
is taking seriously and one in which it is interested.  She 
herself has been seized of the issue for a good number of years, 
as has the current Minister of Justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Yukon is to be doubly complimented for bringing 
this very timely issue forward now.  From the debate we have 
heard in the House, there is a great level of interest.  This is 
not something that came out of the blue or that stemmed out of 
one isolated incident in Yukon, although that is where the hon. 
member for Yukon started her remarks, speaking very passionately 
about the tragic death of a woman at the hands of her husband. 
We heard some of the detail.  I am glad that we were spared some 
of the gruesome detail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Too often in the House of Commons when we are dealing with 
tragic issues members fall into the sensationalism of the 
horrible deaths and other things which people went through. 
Surely the merits of the case can survive without dwelling on the 
gruesome and the gory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member from the Reform Party disappointed me, frankly.  I 
was very surprised to hear the attitude of Reform members toward 
this motion.  He prefaced his remarks by saying that gender 
should not be taken into consideration in this issue.  He gave 
some statistics which indicated that in the tragic situation 
where a man killed a woman, 60% of the applications for taking 
this into consideration were rejected.  Only 40% succeeded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, if it was the case of a woman killing a man and the 
lawyer for the defence wanted to use the defence of provocation, 
the numbers were reversed.  The inverse was true.  Forty per cent 
of the cases were rejected and 60% were accepted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member somehow used this as rationale or justification, 
suggesting that there is an imbalance and that women are treated 
more favourably in the application of the provocation rule than 
are men.  I would like to take a moment to point out that it is 
the member from the Reform Party who fails to see the historic 
imbalance in the power relationship between men and women and who 
fails to recognize how such figures might come about, even given 
the fair application of the provocation rule. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other members have spoken today of what a complex issue we are 
dealing with.  It is true that lay people like me, frankly, have 
a hard time even getting our minds around when this rule should 
be used and when it should not.  I do not envy the judges or 
whoever makes the determination as to whether a particular case 
should qualify under the provocation rule or whether it should be 
self-defence or spousal abuse syndrome arguments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can see this really getting to be a quagmire of minutia when 
someone is trying to determine when this works. 
The fact that it works at all and works even once in a rare blue 
moon is clearly too many.  The member for Yukon made very good 
points indicating that this was an arcane leftover in our 
judicial laws.  We do not need such a reference any more.  It 
hearkens to a darker time when this kind of thing could be 
contemplated.

<A HREF="#LINKT105"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not like the idea that we can justify the use of violence 
in any situation, frankly, because it tends to condone it.  Is it 
okay to lash out in the schoolyard if Joey pushes you down?  We 
spend a long time teaching our children that is not okay. There 
are other ways of conflict resolution other than striking out.  A 
black eye in the schoolyard was sort of a common incident when I 
was growing up certainly, but now hopefully we have moved beyond 
that and have matured. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the same light and by the same token, why then do we accept 
that any level of violence is acceptable if one is insulted or 
provoked mercilessly to the point where one could not stand it 
any more?  Really one is saying “I can't take it any more” and 
lashes out.  This law deals with lashing out in the ultimate way, 
murder, killing someone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In one of the cases cited by the member for Yukon, the B.C. case 
involving a man named Burt Stone, he stabbed his wife 47 times, 
put her body in a toolbox and then went to Mexico for a month. 
For this he got a sentence of four years in jail.  He was able to 
prove that his wife had provoked his violent behaviour by verbal 
insults delivered over a four hour road trip.  He had to suffer 
nagging, abuse or insults for a four hour period and the result 
was he stabbed her 47 times and stuffed her into a toolbox.  The 
defence of provocation was allowed in this incident. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That one incident alone would motivate me to rise up and speak 
against ever allowing the defence of provocation to be used. I do 
not need other incidents, although, as I say, the reason the 
member for Yukon originally rose on this issue was to deal with 
the Klassen murder in Yukon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One member spoke of the folly of letting special interest groups 
drive our legislative agenda when it comes to justice issues, as 
if to say that we cannot be so loose with our changing of laws 
that if we get 50,000 signatures and lobby the government 
aggressively it will have no choice but to chuck that section of 
the code.  No one is advocating that.  I do not think we could 
accuse the member for Yukon of acting in a frivolous way or 
asking government to act in a way that is not prudent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a great history of the lobbying and studying that has 
gone on about this issue.  The member walked us through some of 
the review and study by groups and by the Department of Justice, 
knowing full well that this set of rules and laws should be 
changed.  It was reviewed by the Law Reform Commission of Canada 
in 1989.  We had the report of the federal-provincial working 
group on homicide in 1991, the report of the bar association in 
1992, a House of Commons subcommittee on the recodification of 
the Criminal Code in 1993, and on and on it has been reviewed. It 
is only fitting and only proper that we now have it where it 
should be, being debated in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A member mentioned special interest groups.  He tried to imply 
that this was somehow the women's movement or something.  I do 
not know if that is what he was getting at, but to even say that 
is to trivialize the issue and not to show respect for the member 
for Yukon who clearly is following through on a progressive 
movement that has been going on for over a decade to try to have 
this aspect of the code altered and changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One murder which results in a charge of manslaughter as a result 
of the use of the provocation defence is too much.  I take issue 
with one member who said earlier that one does not get acquitted, 
that one is reduced from murder to manslaughter and manslaughter 
can have a penalty of life.

</I></B></P><P align=left>That member failed to point out that manslaughter can also have 
no minimum sentence whatsoever.  The person could in fact walk 
with a probation, without serving any jail time.  It is a huge 
advantage if the lawyer manages to successful argue the 
provocation defence.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or—Cape Breton, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the government has misled Canadians about Cape Breton 
Island. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since Liberals decided to close the door on my home two months 
ago they have spread convoluted and inaccurate information.  Let 
us look at the facts and not at Liberal rhetoric.  Just over $1 
billion have gone into Devco and $5 billion has come out, which 
is a five to one return on the public's investment.  No 
stockbroker would sneeze at that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The men who worked hard and paid taxes will not receive 
benefits.  Our tax dollars will go in and nothing will come out. 
It is Liberal financial planning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For every job lost at Devco another three will disappear from 
the private sector.  Picture the impact in towns where 
unemployment is already over 40%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This economic vandalism is all the more upsetting when looking 
at the reality of Cape Breton coal.  The government has tried to 
say that $1 billion was wasted on Devco.  It conjures up images 
of lazy workers and inefficient operations.  What it does not say 
is that most of the money spent on Devco went on cleaning up 
sites the government inherited from the private mining companies 
which ran Cape Breton like a private empire for 200 years. When 
they bailed out they left the taxpayers the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has nothing to do with inefficient workers but everything to 
do with a government that did not have the spine to stand up to 
foreign companies and the big banks that backed them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The truth is that Devco's coal mining operations, stripped of 
the clean-up costs and the numberless failed economic development 
schemes hatched by the government, actually made money.  That is 
right.  Do we hear about that from the government's spin doctors? 
Do we hear how Devco miners are known to be the best in the world 
or how Devco's employees have provided power for Nova Scotia and 
cash for their communities?  No, of course not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All we hear are more derogatory stereotypes, more contempt. Now, 
to add insult to injury, the government has announced its latest 
plan to revitalize our economy.  There is $40 million for the 
social research and demonstration corporation, $40 million for a 
corporation based in Ottawa hiring Ontarians to study Cape 
Bretoners.  What an insult. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to be on the record opposing yet another Liberal 
patronage gift.  I want to be on the record condemning money for 
Cape Breton being spent in Ottawa.  Just as the books were fudged 
with Devco and whole communities demeaned by slander and innuendo 
from the government, so now we see the future: more money for 
friends of the government, more money for Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the government will have the courage to admit the obvious 
truth, that it thinks of Atlantic Canada as nothing more than a 
convenient way to channel money from the taxpayers to its 
friends.  The government should stop studying Cape Bretoners and 
start listening to us.  We want honesty.  We want accountability 
and we want to control our own destiny.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stan Dromisky (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of

House, meetings have already been held between Devco's management 
and union representatives to review the human resources package 
and they continue to meet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to say that co-operation between management and the 
union is strong at the present time.  Before the roof fall at 
Phalen colliery, production was very good. 
Since the roof fall, unions and management have been working 
together to clean up the coal face and assess the damage.  To 
this end, both the unions and management have hired independent 
experts to assess 8 east wall with Devco management agreeing to 
pay half of the union's independent expert.

</I></B></P><P align=left>To reiterate, the criteria to determine eligibility for the 
early retirement incentive program have not been pulled out of a 
hat.  They are the criteria that were negotiated between Devco 
and its unions through a joint planning committee in 1996.  They 
are the criteria that Devco's collective agreements indicate 
shall apply to the early retirement incentive program for any 
further workforce reductions.  The $111 million in funding that 
has been approved by the government for workforce adjustment 
measures includes $60 million for an early retirement incentive 
program, $46 million for severance packages and $5 million for 
training for employees who receive severance packages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make it clear that the early retirement incentive 
program has absolutely no relationship to the pension benefits 
that Devco's employees have earned through participation in one 
of the corporation's pension plans.  Workers will continue to be 
eligible for any earned pension benefits.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I rise to pursue a question I first asked prior to the 
federal budget regarding funding for the RCMP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The RCMP cadet training academy, better known as the depot, is 
located in my riding of Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre.  We are 
also home to F Division of the RCMP which serves as our 
provincial police force.  Its head office is in my riding. Regina 
is very proud to be associated with the RCMP and many of the 
workers there are constituents of mine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the past six months a number of them have approached me 
concerned about the future of the depot and the future of the 
force.  NDP caucus colleagues from rural, northern and remote 
communities have also been raising concerns about a shortage of 
RCMP constables in their districts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last October training was suspended at the depot.  RCMP budgets 
across the country were frozen, $10 million was redirected to 
B.C. and a $1 million study of management problems was ordered by 
the Treasury Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a former life I worked as a management consultant advising 
businesses on various aspects of their operations.  It is not a 
bad idea for an organization facing or coping with significant 
change and outside pressure to step back and analyse what it is 
doing and how it could be done better. Evaluation, auditing and 
medium to long term planning are vital for an organization that 
spends $1.1 billion annually with such a critically important 
mandate as the RCMP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The RCMP staffing shortage is an urgent problem, one that is 
already documented and that management and the Liberal government 
need to fix now.  We do not need to wait for an organizational 
audit to see that.  I am told that fully one half of the 16,000 
member force will be eligible for retirement in seven years. We 
already have a shortage of 400 constables in western Canada. Why 
have we not been spending every single day training their 
replacements? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The depot knows there is a problem.  Chief Superintendent Harper 
Boucher said just last week in the newspaper: “Right now, right 
across the country, there's a demand for new members, so we're 
not meeting that need”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week it was announced that the depot could resume training 
using shorter length courses starting in April.  That is a start 
but it will not begin to fill the backlog if half the force is 
retired by 2006.  I see the government has restored about a 
quarter of the funds it cut to the RCMP's budget.  They had 
better invest some of it in training new constables as soon as 
possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to mention the persisting worries of the 
depot's civilian workers who are being scapegoated for RCMP 
management's overspending in B.C. and Alberta divisions and 
headquarters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have been told that RCMP management wants to bring in 
alternate service delivery, ASD, which is a new word for 
privatization as a so-called cost saving measure.  Everyone knows 
that in Saskatchewan privatization means fewer jobs, lower pay, 
reduced services and higher costs to taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The civilian workers asked to meet with the solicitor general 
when he was scheduled to attend the graduation ceremonies last 
week.  The solicitor general later cancelled his plans to attend 
and referred them to his deputy.  The deputy then cancelled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the solicitor general and his deputy are not afraid to 
meet with those workers.  They have important information for him 
about why privatizing those services will not save the money 
management claims.  I have met with those workers.  They provide 
a professional, loyal and dedicated service to the depot and the 
force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fundamental decisions such as privatizing civilian services at 
the depot should not be made until after the KPMG management 
audit has been completed and after the employees have had their 
input.  The solicitor general should put the drive to privatize 
on pause and consider the impact on the workers, their families 
and on the city of Regina. I wrote to him and to the President of 
the Treasury Board over a month ago asking them to do so.  I look 
forward, as do my constituents, to a reply which hopefully will 
be coming shortly.  It has been over a month now.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jacques Saada (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the member for Regina—Lumsden—Lake 
Centre has asked what the government is doing to ensure that the 
RCMP has the resources and qualified personnel necessary to 
carry out its policing mandate, given that training was 
suspended at the Regina depot in October 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As is well known, the government takes its financial 
responsibilities towards Canadian taxpayers very seriously. 
In order to be able to implement the plans necessary to be able 
to operate within its 1998-99 budget, the RCMP imposed a 
temporary freeze on discretionary spending earlier in the 
current fiscal year.  Another temporary measure consisted in 
suspending any new training activities at the Regina depot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before resuming its activities, the RCMP decided to carry out a 
detailed review with respect to the alternative service delivery 
of all programs provided by its training centre in this 
division.  This review enabled the RCMP to identify whether 
internal resources or non-members were more qualified to deliver 
the services now being provided at the training centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to say that the commissioner recently announced 
that training at the depot will resume effective April 6, 1999. 
The RCMP will implement a more efficient cadet training program. 
This modified approach will allow the RCMP to attain its 
program objectives more effectively, while ensuring the high 
quality of training for which the RCMP is known the world over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I myself can testify to this reputation.  Whether at Interpol

</I></B></P><P align=left>A long time ago, on November 17 to be exact, I asked the 
Minister of Transport about the nominating process for directors 
of the Halifax Port Authority.  At the time I correctly predicted 
that the board would be purely Liberal and would include Merv 
Russell who is back in the saddle again as chairman. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister then and more recently invoked the principle that 
all advisory groups are represented.  Of course there are board 
members from various walks of life.  It would be pretty hard to 
avoid that.  But they all share one common important 
qualification, which is that they have their common loyalty to 
the Liberal Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This problem is not just restricted to Halifax.  In Vancouver, 
only two out of five stakeholder nominees were appointed as 
directors to the new port authority.  I guess this conforms to 
the Liberal definition of devolution of power to the local level.

swing into action on about May 1.  I fearlessly predict that one 
Rhoda Witherly, twice defeated Liberal candidate and current

harbour. I will not even be surprised if her campaign manager, a 
Ms. Denton, makes it into the dock as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is well known and clearly understood that in the Liberal 
lexicon privatization is a synonym for patronage and the creation

the letter but also the spirit of the marine act?  It is not too 
much to ask.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the parliamentary secretary, will the government change 
its longstanding policy and attach some importance to the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stan Dromisky (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to address 
the concerns that have been raised with respect to the port 
advisory committee process in Halifax.  I might indicate that the 
process is also applicable in all other port authority 
compositions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The role of the port advisory committee was to develop a user 
nomination process in response to the requirement in the Canada 
Marine Act to consult with users on certain board appointments. 
This nomination process has been reflected in the letters patent. 
The purpose of this process was to solicit names for user 
representatives of Canada port authority boards and to forward 
nominations to the Minister of Transport for consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Port advisory committee members will not be appointing directors 
to the Halifax Port Authority.  The authority is an agent of the 
crown and the majority of directors are appointed by governor in 
council.  In addition, the province and municipality each appoint 
a board member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To ensure that the process was inclusive, port managers were 
asked to contact users and invite them to attend a nomination 
meeting.  In addition, an advertisement was placed in the local 
newspaper advising of the port advisory committee nomination 
meeting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the composition of the port advisory committee, 
a broad cross-section of port users was represented, including 
members of the Halifax Chamber of Commerce and the Halifax 
Shipping Association.  The list provided by the port advisory 
committee was used by the minister in making his recommendations 
to the governor in council. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As with the provincial and municipal appointees to the Halifax 
Port Authority, each user representative will serve the board 
with a view to the needs of the Halifax Port Authority as a 
whole.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, a 
report was published in January 1999 of the Toronto mayor's 
homelessness action task force, better known as the Golden 
report.  It revealed that in Toronto alone about 3,000 
individuals stay in shelters, about 37,000 people are on waiting 
lists for subsidized social housing and an additional 40,000 are 
spending more than half of their income on rent or are living in 
extremely precarious housing conditions. The situation in other 
Canadian cities is also serious and has been described by 
municipal leaders as a national disaster. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some weeks ago I asked the Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services whether the government would be prepared to 
launch a housing program to meet the needs of the homeless. This 
issue requires urgent and special attention.  There is a great 
need for federal and provincial funds for the construction of 
social housing units. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the Golden report was released, the picture has not 
improved.  Homeless people in many Canadian cities are a reality. 
More people have died as a result of cold and exposure, including 
highly publicized deaths such as the one a short distance from 
Queen's Park in Toronto. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has announced some measures.  For example, on 
December 18 the Minister of Public Works and Government Services 
announced $50 million in addition to the $50 million already 
committed to the residential rehabilitation assistance program, 
RRAP, for the fiscal year ending this March.  Only $11.6 million 
of this money is for the most needy homeless.  This is not 
adequate to meet the need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1996 a decision was made to transfer social housing to the 
provinces.  In some provinces, for example in Saskatchewan, the 
arrangement has worked.  In others, such as Ontario, the 
situation is bad because of the unwillingness of the Ontario 
government to build social housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must be noted that Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation 
can and has played a strong leadership role in the past. 
Examples are Woodgreen Red Door in Toronto, Metropole Hotel in 
Vancouver and the Interlodge centre in Montreal.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge the federal government tonight to inject new funds into a 
program for the construction of new social housing units in those 
provinces that are not taking such initiative themselves, 
particularly in providing for the homeless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know that in addition to providing shelter, the 
construction of social housing stimulates the economy, creates 
jobs and maintains social stability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore I ask the parliamentary secretary tonight if she can 
indicate to us whether the government will provide additional 
funds for the construction of social housing, in particular for 
the homeless.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Carolyn Parrish (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to respond to the hon. member who has a very long 
history of deep concern for the less fortunate in society. As a 
stay at home mom many years ago I followed his career as minister 
of the environment and was always a big fan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister responsible for Canada Mortgage and Housing 
Corporation shares this member's concern, particularly about the 
homeless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government recognizes the importance of affordable, adequate 
and suitable housing in promoting the health and well-being of 
all Canadians.  We are working to improve the economic climate in 
Canada to help promote housing, affordability and accessibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also recognize the value of partnerships among governments, 
community organizations and the private sector in addressing the 
problems faced by the homeless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of the complexity of this issue many players must be 
involved in finding a solution.  However, there is currently a 
lack of understanding and consensus on the best methods to 
address the needs of Canada's homeless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Governments and service agencies have asked for better 
documentation and information sharing on best practices for 
addressing homelessness.  In response, CMHC has undertaken two 
initiatives.  First, it has identified a range of best practices 
in addressing homelessness from across the country and is 
currently documenting and evaluating ten of the better ones. 
Selected projects include a variety of project types, population 
served and regions of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, CMHC is investing in the most effective means of passing 
on information on these and other best practices to those who 
need it most. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>CMHC undertook consultations with shelter agencies and 
stakeholders across the country in 1998.  As a result the 
corporation is now planning a series of small focused regional 
round table discussions to take place in April 1999, followed by 
a national round table in June.  These round tables organized in 
partnership with local networks for service organizations have 
the following goals: to bring together key people involved 
directly with the homeless population; to explore the transfer 
ability of successful approaches; to provide regional and 
national round tables for the exchange of information and 
experience among decision makers; to facilitate new links for the 
partnership opportunities in the development of solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am afraid I am out of time. I would be pleased to share the 
rest of that with the hon. member for Davenport.

House is now deemed to have been adopted. Accordingly, this 
House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m., pursuant to 
Standing Order 24(1).
