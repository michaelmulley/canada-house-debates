</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George—Bulkley Valley, Ref.)</B> 
moved: 
<A NAME="LINK26">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House call on the government to bring forward a 
motion, pursuant to Standing Order 68(4)(a), to instruct a 
legislative committee to prepare and bring in a bill to amend 
those sections of the Criminal Code which deal with impaired 
driving in order to (a) enhance deterrence; and (b) ensure that 
the penalties reflect the seriousness of the offence. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, I am of course pleased to lead off this 
debate today during which we will be discussing something that 
can rightly be considered a national tragedy and also can be 
considered an epidemic in our country.  I am talking about the 
crime of impaired driving, the senseless act of impaired driving 
and the consequences and shattered lives that follow when people, 
after drinking, choose to get in their automobiles and drive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I am going to talk about the senseless and tragic crime 
that impaired driving really is.  There is a state of mind within 
governments that tends to regard impaired driving as simply 
another social ill.  We have to stop thinking about impaired 
driving in these terms.  It is a crime.  It is a 100% preventable 
crime.  If only the government would recognize it as such and 
take leadership to prevent it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also going to talk about how impaired driving has in fact 
reached epidemic proportions and how it has not been addressed in 
the way that it deserves by government at the federal level. 
Although changes and progress are being made at the provincial 
level, there is a still a long way to go in fighting this crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through this motion we are going to call on the current federal 
government to take a real leadership role on the issue of 
impaired driving by instructing a committee to bring in a bill 
recommending changes in the Criminal Code.  This will first serve 
to enhance deterrence against people who drink and then drive and 
second will ensure that the penalties for impaired driving truly 
reflect the seriousness of this crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me start out by clearly showing to this House the level that 
impaired driving has reached in this country because nothing 
substantive has been done to address it. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1015"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT3"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT3"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1015

<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did you know that statistically four and a half Canadians are 
killed by impaired drivers every day, seven days a week?  As we 
debate this today, statistically two Canadians will be killed by 
impaired drivers and hundreds will be injured.  Over 1,700 are 
people killed by impaired drivers in Canada every year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a matter of fact, the chances of being killed by an impaired 
driver are over three times greater than being murdered.  As 
well, every day over 300 Canadians are injured in alcohol related 
crashes.  This works out to 13 Canadians being injured every hour 
or about one every five minutes.  In the time of my speech more 
than four Canadians will be injured in an alcohol related car 
crash.   Well over 100,000 Canadians are injured every year 
because people drink and then choose to drive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tragedy of impaired driving extends far beyond the direct 
impact on its victims.  It extends to all society.  Let me quote 
some direct costs to our health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to 1992 data, alcohol related costs accounted for more 
than 40% of Canada's nearly $19 billion annual substance abuse 
funding.  This includes $4.1 billion in lost productivity, $1.3 
billion in law enforcement costs and over $1.3 billion in direct 
health care costs simply because of alcohol related incidents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our courts are already backed up yet they deal with more 
impaired driving cases than any other kind of cases they handle. 
There is an incredible backlog in our courts caused by impaired 
drivers. There does not need to be.  People do not have to get in 
their cars after they drink.  It is a choice they make to break 
the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unless the government does something about it, those choices 
will continue to be made. People will continue to drive and be 
convicted of impaired driving.  People will continue to injure 
innocent victims while in that state behind the wheel.  People 
will continue to kill innocent victims while in that state behind 
the wheel. That does not have to happen.  We have to address it 
starting today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The impact on the families and friends of victims killed by 
drunk drivers never stops.  These people have to live the rest of 
their lives knowing their loved ones have been senselessly killed 
by a drunk driver.  While it may be a private choice among 
individuals to consume alcohol, once that person gets behind the 
steering wheel of a motor vehicle it now becomes a very public 
matter affecting all of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It becomes a very personal matter to the family and friends of 
the victims who have to relive the tragedy that results every day 
of their lives when their loved ones have been killed or injured 
by a drunk driver. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Impaired driving must cross every party line.  There can be no 
partisanship when we are talking about the impact of impaired 
driving.  I hope the members of the House recognize this today as 
we debate it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Impaired driving is not a political issue but an issue of crime, 
the most severe of all crimes when it involves the loss of human 
life. 
Unfortunately, looking at the past records of previous 
governments, it is clear that while they have attempted to make 
some small changes to try and address the problem of impaired 
driving, the problem remains and whatever changes that have been 
made are not enough. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1020"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT4"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT4"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1020

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the Tories introduced Criminal Code amendments in 
1985 to include charges of impaired driving causing bodily harm 
and impaired driving causing death.  But in the subsequent nine 
years of Tory rule the problem of impaired driving continued to 
escalate, so those changes were not enough. More needed to be 
done. But it was not done and the toll climbs still today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another one of the tragedies that the government has not 
addressed is how the new Criminal Code amendment on conditional 
sentencing applies to impaired driving. With conditional 
sentences if a person drinks and drives and kills someone and can 
afford a sharp lawyer, that person can walk out of the court 
without serving one single day for that deed, for the choice that 
was made to get behind the wheel after consuming alcohol and 
choosing to drive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give an example.  Last month in Victoria, B.C., an 
impaired driver left a single mother a paraplegic.  She will stay 
that way for the rest of her life.  The impaired driver was given 
a conditional sentence because it was his first offence. This 
impaired driver may well have been driving impaired before. He 
just did not happen to get caught and did not happen to get into 
an accident. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the judge determined that because it was a first time 
offence that he would walk free with no penalty, just some 
community service. While it may have been a first time offence 
for the driver, the fact is that a young mother's life has been 
shattered by this incident.  While the drunk driver who hit her 
gets a second chance, the woman will be paralysed for her entire 
life. She gets no second chance, and we should remember that and 
judges should remember that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk now about three areas where past governments 
could have made some positive change to reduce impaired driving, 
but unfortunately they did not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the Criminal Code set a two hour time limit on obtaining 
a blood or breath sample from an impaired driving suspect. This 
short time span has resulted in thousands of legitimate impaired 
driving charges being dropped because breath samples or blood 
samples were taken only minutes after the two hour time period 
ran out. Imagine that.  Because the time period was missed, a 
person cannot be found guilty whether that person was guilty or 
not. This is not only a stupid law, but greatly impedes the job 
of police officers in obtaining evidence that would make a charge 
stick. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should be more concerned about the victims of crime than we 
are about the people who commit those crimes.  I would think that 
would be a logical conclusion. But the two hour time limit on 
breath and blood samples does not allow that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A second area of impaired driving concerns some changes 
regarding the blood alcohol concentration level. Currently the 
Criminal Code sets that level at .08%, which means that the 
percentage of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood must exceed .08%. 
However, extensive research, and I can back this up, in 
the past 30 years has found out that this limit is too high. In 
fact, studies show that most drivers with BAC levels at .05% are 
impaired. These statistics come from scientific studies that have 
been conducted all over the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By lowering the BAC limit the government will be sending a clear 
message to the public that there is a zero tolerance policy 
toward people who choose to drive after they have been drinking. 
It has to do this.  The government has an obligation to take 
leadership in this matter.

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third area in which changes can be made concerns the 
sentencing for drunk drivers.  This is where that mindset of a 
social ill comes into play.  The government does not have it yet 
and the judges do not have it yet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently, the sentencing latitude for impaired driving causing 
death is anywhere from zero to fourteen years.  Historically, the 
sentences have been in the zero to three and a half year range 
usually.  That is a fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been some sentences in the six, seven, eight year 
range, but they make up less than 1% of the total sentences over 
the last 10 years.  We are not really making some big leaps and 
bounds in that sentencing area. These slap on the wrist sentences 
are simply not acceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an example, and this is where it gets personal, in my 
hometown of Prince George, British Columbia, less than a block 
away from my house, a drunk driver killed three members of the 
Ciccone family in 1995.  The impaired driver had had numerous 
impaired convictions prior to that, and had been in numerous 
accidents.  The judge gave him a sentence of three and a half 
years for taking the lives of a father and two young children. 
Three and a half years for a person who, in a drunken state, in 
an instant, took three lives, after this person had a record of 
alcohol problems and related charges.  No one can agree that the 
sentence reflected the severity of the crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently the average sentences for impaired driving are 
equivalent to sentences for defamatory libel, possessing a forged 
passport or dealing in counterfeit money.  How in earth can we 
begin to justify the sentences given out for those offences with 
the offence of impaired driving causing death?  It is beyond 
comprehension. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I introduced Bill C-201 in the last Parliament.  That bill would 
have set a seven-year minimum sentence and up to a maximum of 14 
years for impaired driving causing death.  The bill was voted 
down by the Liberal government, most of the Bloc members, along 
with the help of the NDP.  Somehow they could justify these slap 
on the wrist sentences for drunk drivers who kill.  I do not know 
how, but they do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The huge majority of Canadians are in favour of those 
recommendations, but the Liberal government, the Bloc and the NDP 
said: “No.  We cannot justify that.  Slap them on the wrist and 
turn them loose.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A national organization with more than 2.5 million supporters, 
Mothers Against Drunk Driving, MADD Canada, has just released a 
survey on Canadians' attitudes toward impaired driving.  What is 
more important, the philosophy of some Liberal government members 
who cannot comprehend the seriousness of this crime, or the 
attitude of some Bloc members, or the attitude of the NDP 
members?  What is more important, their philosophy toward this or 
the profound feeling of the Canadian people?  The people come 
first. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More than 85% of Canadians surveyed by MADD Canada would either 
strongly support or support changes to the Criminal Code which 
would include minimum sentences for drunk drivers.  That did not 
matter when Bill C-201 was voted down by the Liberal government. 
I want to thank the backbench Liberals who had the courage to 
support that bill.  I also want to thank the two Bloc members who 
had the courage to support that bill.  The government could not 
support it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me mention some other MADD Canada survey results.  Nearly 
95% of Canadians believe anyone involved in a crash resulting in 
death or serious injury should be obligated by law to provide a 
blood sample at the request of a police officer.  95% of 
Canadians believe that, but the former justice minister did not 
believe that. 
This shows the average Canadian wants the two hour time limit 
extended or eliminated.  We should tell that to the former 
justice minister.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, three out of four Canadians support lowering the blood 
alcohol content level to .05%, as has been done in other 
countries with huge success.  Of those surveyed, 93.4% feel that 
lowering the BAC to this amount will make our roads safer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Considering the survey results we can clearly see how the 
government is in a position to take some real leadership today. 
Everything is there for the government to do it.  It could 
introduce changes which have been recommended by MADD Canada and 
by the Reform Party.  Today is the day we can take that first 
step. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support lowering the BAC to .05%.  We support tougher 
sentences for those convicted of impaired driving.  We are in 
favour of establishing minimum sentences and longer driving 
prohibitions for those convicted of impaired driving offences 
where injury or death result. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform also supports that hard core drinkers charged with 
offences be obligated by law to undergo mandatory rehabilitation 
treatment.  If there is a jail sentence involved, any 
consideration of parole should be absolutely dependent on the 
convicted person successfully being rehabilitated through 
treatment.  That is not too much to ask when we are considering 
the safety of our families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly it is time to stop talking about the tragic consequences 
of impaired driving.  Clearly it is time to take action.  The 
government can do it today.  It is time to put aside all 
partisanship in the House and unite in one common fight against 
the crime of impaired driving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is an NDP member laughing? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Yes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Harris:</B>  It is time for us, including NDP members 
who find this funny, to clearly demonstrate a zero tolerance 
policy toward drunk drivers.  Yes, we can do this if we want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time to recognize the devastation caused by drunk drivers 
and demand through legislation that it come to an end.  Yes, we 
can do that.  It is time for the killing to stop. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask all members of the House, including NDP members who find 
the subject quite amusing, to recognize their responsibility, 
join in the fight against impaired driving and support the motion 
today.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Hec Clouthier (Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the hon. member for Prince 
George—Bulkley Valley.  It is a very contentious issue.  I 
wholeheartedly support what he has said this morning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Besides being a member of Parliament, in one of my other lives I 
am also a professional harness horse driver.  It is interesting 
to note that we cannot get on a sulky and race a horse if our 
blood level count is over .04.  I disagree that it should be 
lowered to .05.  It should be lowered to at least .04. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rationale behind the horse racing community is that we have 
to be careful and have a great concern for the equine flesh.  I 
have far more concern for humans and believe .04 should be the 
threshold. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member spoke about lawyers getting involved.  There is 
such a thing as democracy.  If a person is charged with impaired 
driving they can go to court.  It is their democratic right. They 
can have a very sharp lawyer, a Philadelphia lawyer. How would 
the hon. member ameliorate the situation with respect to lawyers? 
Would he be agreeable to some kind of mandatory sentencing?

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very difficult because we are getting into the area of 
human rights.  I agree with the thrust.  I am just wondering if 
there is a certain component in the hon. member's motion to deal 
with the aspect of the lawyers getting involved and getting 
someone off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Harris:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
his support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The .05 is a recommendation by MADD Canada.  If the government 
will take the initiative, show leadership and instruct the 
committee to go forward with the hearings, the recommendation 
of .05, .03 or whatever could come forward.  The rationale behind it 
would certainly be related to the committee and may show up in 
the report as .04 being the recommendation.  I understand what he 
was saying, and I certainly agree with him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To address the second question, the problem we have in the 
courts today is that there is a profound initiative to try to 
keep people out of jail.  The courts are backed up.  The prisons 
are full.  The philosophy of provincial governments, under 
direction from the Minister of Justice, is not to put people in 
jail.  Therefore we find that the judges are more open to hearing 
suggestions of lower sentences to qualify for the conditional 
sentencing provisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We find the judges more concerned with getting into the flow of 
what the attorney general of the province or what the justice 
minister of the country is thinking about keeping people out of 
jail.  They seem to be more open to lenient sentences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One way to fix it is to tighten up the latitude the judges have. 
They have a latitude now from 0 to 14 years.  That is a huge 
range.  We find people walking out of courts every day who have 
been charged with serious impaired driving offences, because the 
judges have simply said that they will be given two years less a 
day with no rationale.  Immediately they qualify for conditional 
sentencing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a case in my area the judge erred in his decision.  When the 
decision came down at 3.5 years I got on to the media saying the 
judge was out to lunch on his sentence.  I stated all the reasons 
why. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also encouraged the crown to appeal the sentence and the 
crown did so successfully.  Lo and behold all arguments the crown 
put forward in the appeal were the things I had said were wrong 
with the sentence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result the court of appeal added two more years to the 
sentence.  The fact is judges have the option of choosing to 
accept whatever precedent the defence lawyers are putting 
forward.  In a majority of the cases they are choosing the 
precedents on the low end of the scale.  We have to tighten them 
up and we can do it through minimum sentencing.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the purpose of 
examining a problem such as this one is to ensure that fewer people 
will be victims of accidents caused by impaired drivers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A study of the statistics would, I think, show that the 
problem does not lie with the need to lower the allowable blood 
alcohol limit. How many accidents would be avoided if the level 
were dropped from 0.08 to 0.07, 0.06 or 0.05? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that, as a general rule, the people who cause most of 
the automobile accidents when driving impaired are those who are 
way above the limit. 
Whether we put it at 0.05 or 0.08, generally speaking, the drivers 
who are killing people while impaired are those with blood alcohol 
levels of 0.20, 0.30 or 0.35. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So making a change of a few tenths of a point is not going to 
solve the problem.  I do not know what my Reform colleague is 
thinking, but is he contemplating changes in the penalties for 
impaired driving?  This reminds me of the problem of children 
playing with matches.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Matches are not banned because they are dangerous, but they 
are kept out of the way of children, as is poison in the medicine 
chest.  And the chest should be locked to keep children out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the same reasoning not be applied to a person incapable 
of driving a car, who does not know whether or not he should drive 
because he is not sober?  It might be possible to attach a boot to 
a car for one, two or three months, because the individual drove 
while under the influence, even though it was only at a blood 
alcohol level of .08 or .07. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This deals with the immediate cause.  An individual who is not 
sober and cannot get his hands on a wheel will harm no one. 
You cannot allow such a person to decide whether he should use his 
car, as he is incapable of making a decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know whether the hon. member has given this 
any thought.  I would like him to comment on whether we should 
change the approach and act on the cause of the accident instead of 
tightening legislation and creating more criminals without 
resolving the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Too many people have lost their licence two, three, four or 
five times and have not been dissuaded from using their car when 
they have been drinking.  So, perhaps the solution does not lie 
here. 
We could discourage them by using a Denver boot, for example.  A 
man with his car in the driveway wearing a Denver boot can get as 
drunk as he likes, but he will not be able to use the car because 
of the boot, or some other similar device.  Some way has to be 
found to stop him using his car.  I would like my colleague's 
comments on that. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Harris:</B>  Mr. Speaker, with regard to my 
colleague's questions about lowering the blood alcohol content 
limit, he is not correct.  Many countries including Norway, 
France, Denmark, other European countries and some states of the 
U.S., have lowered it to .05 and there has been a marked decrease 
in the instance of impaired driving.  It does work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What causes an accident or what causes someone to be convicted 
of impaired driving is when they make the choice to get in a car. 
If ever there was a case for deterrence it is impaired driving, 
stronger deterrence.  As a matter of fact studies have shown that 
the number one reason people who do not drink or do not drive 
when when they have been drinking is that they are afraid of 
getting stopped by the police and being found in that state. That 
is the number one reason. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In answer to the member's question, stronger deterrence overall 
should include first offence impaired driving, second offence 
licence suspensions, lifetime licence suspension and automobile 
confiscation.  We have to send a message that it will not be 
tolerated, and the government can do it.

NDP takes this as funny. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I am sorry that there was not time to

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Eleni Bakopanos (Ahuntsic, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to begin by congratulating MADD on the excellent work they are 
doing to draw the Canadian public's attention to the problem of 
drunk driving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to repeat what the Minister of Justice said recently 
when she met with representatives from MADD.  She said that she was 
going to raise the issue in the near future, in December, at her 
meeting in Montreal with all provincial justice ministers. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliament has the constitutional legislative authority to 
create criminal laws.  Despite the opposition member's assertion 
that this government has not shown a leadership role by making 
changes to the Criminal Code, most recently, in the spring of 
this year the last Parliament passed amendments to certain 
drinking and driving provisions of the Criminal Code which have 
been introduced by this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On several occasions we made amendments, changes which clarified 
that the driving prohibition penalty starts to run only upon an 
offender's release from imprisonment.  In my opinion that is an 
important change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliament has also clarified that the defence can only 
introduce evidence of the accused's actual blood alcohol 
concentration that is different from his or her breath test where 
the evidence shows a BAC reading at or below 80. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliament also, despite the member's assertion, extended the 
period for a police officer to apply for a warrant to obtain 
blood in certain accident situations from two hours to four 
hours.  Get the facts right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, each province has the constitutional legislative 
authority for such matters as highway traffic, driver licensing 
and motor vehicle registration within the province.  The 
provinces have legislated in these areas with regard to drinking 
and driving.  Also in the provinces, the enforcement and 
prosecution of Criminal Code offences has been assigned to the 
attorney general of each province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore in my view there are important intergovernmental 
consultations that should take place in order to come to a full 
understanding of the drinking and driving problem.  There are 
legislative ways to further the progress that has been made to 
date. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Justice, as I said earlier, will be meeting her 
colleagues and will be bringing up her suggestions for amendments 
to the Criminal Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The statistics on drinking and driving in relation to driver 
fatalities and criminal charges suggest that there have been 
important changes since the early 1980s regarding drinking and 
driving which, incidentally, has been almost overwhelmingly a 
male dominated crime apparently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The recently released results of a public opinion survey 
commissioned by the organization Mothers Against Drunk Driving 
which occurred here in Ottawa this week confirmed that progress 
has been made in changing public attitudes about drinking and 
driving behaviour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, notwithstanding the progress on this problem, as many 
members of this House are well aware, the most tragic 
consequences of drinking and driving remain a virulent blight on 
Canadian society.  I agree with assertions of the hon. member 
about this. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Traffic Injury Research Foundation of Canada is 
responsible for recording data for Transport Canada on driver 
deaths as a result of traffic accidents.  The data come from 
information provided by the police and coroners and, since 1987, 
the data base contains data provided by all provinces and 
territories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The good news is that, since 1987, the percentage of drivers 
with blood alcohol levels exceeding 80 milligrams of alcohol per 
100 millilitres of blood is steadily declining.  In 1987, drivers 
with blood alcohol levels over 80 represented 43% of driver deaths 
as a result of traffic accidents.  In 1995, this figure was 35%. 
But this is not really good news, and I want to be clear about 
this.  We do not want to see the level stay at 80. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tragedy of accidents resulting in the death of drivers 
with blood alcohol levels over 80 does not end there.  Some of 
these drivers are also responsible for the death of their 
passengers or other people not even in the car with them.  Some 
drivers with blood alcohol levels over 80 survive the accident, but 
their passengers or other people not in the car are killed.  It is 
tragic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When injuries are taken into account, the human suffering over 
the years reaches staggering proportions, and intelligent people 
naturally feel they have to do something.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the important question is this: What should we do? The causes 
are complex and the solutions to this serious social problem are not 
simple. Drunk drivers come from all walks of life, so we cannot simply 
adopt stiffer penalties and expect that just by doing that people will 
stop drinking and driving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to adopt a whole package of measures, a holistic approach. 
For example, fines or prison terms are enough to prevent most of us from 
drinking and driving, but they seem to have less effect on certain 
persons with an alcohol problem, even if the penalties are heavier. 
So we feel that forcing people to follow a treatment and other measures 
might be more effective. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Traffic Injury Research Foundation has recently released a 
brochure discussing the drinking and driving problem.  It notes 
that for a drinking driver the risk of accident increases 
exponentially with an increase in the BAC level.  I think we will 
all agree on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not surprisingly, drivers with a very high BAC level are 
disproportionately responsible for fatal road crashes where 
alcohol is involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>TIRF lists a number of measures that could be taken to further 
reduce road crash fatalities.  Most of these measures relate to 
provincial governments.  TIRF notes that many provinces have 
begun to implement some of the measures TIRF endorses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One idea is to have graduated penalties that are linked to blood 
alcohol blood concentrations.  TIRF notes that some sentencing 
judges already appear to do this when they render sentences in 
these cases. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Adding several other elements might help to better understand the 
problem of drunk driving. According to the Department of Justice, the 
Department of Transport is preparing a report on a survey done by police 
officers in co-operation with the Canadian Association of Chiefs of 
Police. It should help us identify initiatives to assist police officers 
investigating crimes related to drunk driving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In August 1997, the Department of Transport commissioned another 
study from the Addictions Research Foundation; it will survey the 
literature on the effects of various blood-alcohol levels on the ability 
to drive and deal with the issue of using lower blood-alcohol levels in 
imposing administrative penalties, including suspension of the driver's 
licence, or in the case of criminal penalties in certain countries. This 
information will likely be very useful when the legislative options will 
be reviewed with the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to note that the Department of Transport has been 
involved for several years with the provinces and other partners in 
non-criminal type initiatives implemented under the strategy to reduce 
impaired driving. There is no question that measures outside criminal 
law have a major impact on the problem. 
In fact, it is through the combined efforts of governments, public and 
private sector institutions, families and individuals that we have been 
able to make progress in this area. It is most likely that initiatives 
based on criminal law cannot in themselves ensure further progress. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take offence to the opposition member's allegation that the 
members of this side of the House have not had the courage to 
recognize this great Canadian tragedy or that the government has 
done nothing, as was stated.  We have and will take action.  The 
minister has already reaffirmed the government's commitment to 
the representatives of MADD she met with last week.  I am sure 
all members of the House will continue to encourage the minister 
and the government to take action.

non-partisan solution to this, we have to be non-partisan in our 
rhetoric on this topic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier when I made a remark off the record about what the 
member who introduced the motion had to say, it was in view of 
the fact that he had made a very partisan speech implying that 
Liberals and New Democrats and others did not care about the 
tragedy of drunk driving and the enormous sorrow, injury and the 
enormous costs to Canadian society.  Then at the end of the 
speech, he urged us all to be non-partisan.  I found that to be 
funny, in the tragic sense of the word.  If we want to be 
non-partisan about this, let us admit that even though we may 
disagree with each other, we all care deeply about the victims of 
drunk driving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also counsel the government and everyone else who speaks in 
the debate in this regard. We cannot get up and call for a 
non-partisan debate after we have just finished hammering the 
hell out of the other parties for allegedly not caring about 
something we all obviously care about but may disagree with each 
other about how to deal with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am inclined to be very supportive of what the Reform Party 
member said, but I take objection to the argumentation and the 
rhetoric in his speech in which he suggested that somehow the 
rest of us do not care about this.  That is patently false and 
patently partisan.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo—Chilcotin, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the parliamentary secretary for her remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do have some difficulty with those remarks.  I think there is 
a more general problem that we as Canadians have with the subject 
of drinking and driving.  Candidly, there is an acceptance of it 
and that acceptance is what we pay the price for in the alarming 
and tragic statistics. When we consider that in the statistics I 
have for 1983 to 1991, over a million people were injured and 
nearly 18,000 killed in that eight year period.  These are 
wartime statistics. If people used dangerous substances or have 
dangerous implements or weapons, we would find some way of 
discouraging it.  But culturally we have allowed drinking to 
become quite acceptable, even on the highways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My point is that I disagree with the member that by using 
statistics and the idea that the government is doing something 
about it curbs the edge of concern that is so necessary that we 
must convey not only to our fellow parliamentarians, but to the 
Canadian population as a whole, that drinking on the road is not 
acceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If someone wants to drink themselves to death, that is basically 
their business.  But on the roads they are a threat not only to 
life but of injury, medical costs and the destruction of the 
peace and welfare of our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As leaders of our communities we must insist that this activity 
of drinking and then getting in a car is totally unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to see the speeches of the government members and 
those on this side reflect that unacceptability, rather than 
hauling out statistics to say we are doing everything we can 
about it.  The fundamental problem is the attitude of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Eleni Bakopanos:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not think there was 
anything in my remarks to indicate that the government finds 
statistics acceptable.  Quite the contrary.  I think my remarks 
were made in the sense that we cannot have only one approach to 
this grave problem, that there has to be a holistic approach. 
There is a problem of alcoholism in our society. I do not think 
any member in the House would accept the fact that anyone should 
drink and drive and kill someone. 
I do not think any member would agree with that.  Quite the 
contrary.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the motion 
before us today, which was tabled by the Reform Party, calls on the 
government to bring forward a motion to instruct a legislative committee 
to prepare a bill to amend those sections of the Criminal Code which 
deal with impaired driving in order to enhance deterrence and ensure 
that the penalties reflect the seriousness of the offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois, like all Quebeckers, recognizes the seriousness 
of the issue raised in the motion put forward by my colleague from the 
Reform Party. 
Driving while under the influence is a terrible scourge which must be 
fought efficiently. However, we must be careful not to go for 
sensationalism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois supports the Reform Party's motion. We are 
asking that the motion be referred to a legislative committee, which 
would conduct a more in-depth review of the issue and the offences 
relating to alcohol consumption and impaired driving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois, which is always aware of the serious problems 
caused by this situation, feels such legislative review should be 
comprehensive and not limited to stiffer sentencing. We must not look 
only at the issue of sentencing, but at the whole picture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few questions should be raised at the committee level. First and 
foremost, we have to ask: Is stricter enforcement of the penalties 
provided for in the Criminal Code absolutely necessary to ensure better 
deterrence among the public? This is one question we must ask ourselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second question is the following: Would improving the judicial 
process, which, let us not forget, is a provincial jurisdiction, not be 
a solution? We are talking about the administration of justice here. 
Again, it extends far beyond a simple matter of stiffer penalties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another question: Is drunk driving a high enough priority with the 
police? 
We know that top officials in the police consider cracking down on 
impaired driving a priority. But is it also a high priority for the 
police officer who has to deal with impaired driving on the street? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Police officers receive more calls than they can respond to. Is it 
a priority for the police officer in his or her car to fight drunk 
driving? As I said, for some of them, traffic law enforcement is a 
boring and somewhat cumbersome routine, when they would prefer to see 
some action. In that context, this is a valid question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must bear in mind in dealing with this issue that those involved 
in law enforcement, which, I repeat, is a provincial jurisdiction, 
should have a say. We should also find out how they feel the fight 
against impaired driving could be improved. 
I am not convinced that merely stiffening penalties is what the 
police want.

<A HREF="#LINKT12"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, the following question must be asked: What are the 
reasons fewer people have been charged with impaired driving since 
1986?  To give you some figures, in 1996, police reported 161,805 
cases relating to driving offences under the Criminal Code, which 
represents a decrease of 6.9% compared to 1995.  As well, there 
were 78,894 impaired driving charges, a 6.2% drop from 1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are the reasons for that decrease?  One may well wonder, 
but an examination of the circumstances may offer some suggestions 
for solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, we 
should ask ourselves another question: Are the programs for raising 
public awareness and education adequate?  Is there not some better 
way to make people more aware of the dangers of driving while 
impaired?  Are the advertising techniques being used the right 
ones?  Should a better program be developed for schools, youth 
centres and so on? This must be looked into. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the Bloc is in favour of this motion because it 
will open up debate on the question, which is very important, and 
the debate must go far beyond the matter of penalties.  The 
conclusions drawn must be based on more than just some high-profile 
cases. 
Parliamentarians have a duty to examine this matter coolly and 
calmly.

<P><A NAME="LINK34"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George—Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his presentation today 
and for indicating that he will support this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He asked if we could be doing more other than making penalties 
stronger.  The fact is that we do quite a bit of educational work 
in schools and in the media.  Some very effective advertising is 
being run on a constant basis.  In particular as we approach the 
heaviest drinking season of the year, the ads will pick up 
considerably in an attempt to educate people to not drink and 
drive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In spite of all we are doing now, the number of impaired drivers 
is still rising.  The number of accidents and deaths is still 
rising. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are saying in the motion is that to complement what is 
being done in the education area, we have to consider the effect 
that stronger deterrents will have.  As I stated earlier, if ever 
there was a case for deterrence, impaired driving is the case. 
Surveys have shown that the reason some people stop drinking and 
driving is because they fear being stopped by the police and 
being charged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason some people continue to drink and drive is because 
they do not fear the charges.  The charges are too light.  They 
have no fear of having licence suspensions because they will 
drive anyway and a strong deterrent does not exist when they are 
picked up for driving under suspension. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Deterrence has a huge role to play.  If we are going to examine 
the Criminal Code we must be prepared to examine the effect 
increased deterrence will have, as well as continuing on with the 
educational side of it and the treatment side of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a big advocate of mandatory treatment.  When someone is 
imprisoned for a substance abuse problem whether it be alcohol or 
drugs, the judge must have the authority to impose mandatory 
treatment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope I have answered my colleague's questions.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my colleague for his comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He spoke of mandatory treatment.  It is indeed one of the 
things we should perhaps be looking at.  However, this is very much 
along the same lines as what I was saying, which is that we will 
have to look beyond the penalty.  There is the issue of 
rehabilitation, but, as my colleague so relevantly pointed out, 
there is also the issue of education.  He mentioned advertising, 
etc. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some campaigns have certainly been effective, but is there no 
way to make them more so?  This warrants consideration.  Could 
prevention campaigns in schools and other institutions be made more 
effective? 
We could look at that too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I imagine someone in a bar, having a drink.  Is this person 
going to decide not to have a beer, because the fine has gone from 
$300 to $500?  I do not know.  As I said earlier to my colleague, 
it is worth having a look at.  This is why we support this motion. 
Let us have a look at the problem, but in a broader context, beyond 
the matter of stricter penalties. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK36"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I guess 
I can relate to this issue perhaps a little more than some of the 
others that are here, as my mother and father on their 50th 
wedding anniversary were hit by two young men who were drunk. My 
mother never walked alone again after that.  She had 13 pins put 
in her side.  My dad was hurt as well.  So I can relate to what 
is happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, Mr. Speaker, you will see in the gallery today a 
senator who has also had two of her immediate family killed 
right here in Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say to the hon. member that we support this motion, 
but I want to say that there has to be an educational process. 
There also has to be a legislative change whereby those who sell 
liquor to young people recognize that it is a serious offence. 
We have to change the penalty for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support the member and will work with him.  I can relate to 
this probably more than anyone else, with the exception of the 
senator in the gallery. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Marceau:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would just like to say 
that I sympathize with the member, who was closely affected by 
someone who committed a crime by driving under the influence of 
alcohol.  I sympathize with everyone who is a victim of such a 
crime.  This is why we are saying a debate like this warrants very 
close examination.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I know 
I speak on behalf of my constituents when I stand here today to 
address the issue of drunk driving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to begin by commending the work of one of my 
constituents, Geraldine Dedrick, who is president of Mothers 
Against Drunk Driving for the Halifax region.  Geraldine Dedrick 
herself faced the unimaginable tragedy of losing a son due to an 
accident related to drunk driving.  I am honoured to stand here 
to support her efforts and those of countless others who are 
working today so that people tomorrow are spared this tragedy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an important issue in the province of Nova Scotia.  The 
current president of Mothers Against Drunk Driving is Susan 
MacAskill from Windsor in the Annapolis Valley of our province. I 
commend her on her work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every single day, people living in the riding of Halifax West 
face a very real and possibly fatal threat.  Every day in my 
riding there are people concerned about someone they know 
drinking and driving.  It is the same throughout the province of 
Nova Scotia and throughout the land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the Criminal Code was amended to deal with persons who 
drink and drive, it has been estimated that 20,400 Canadians have 
died at the hands of those who choose to drink and drive. 
At the same time up to 1.5 million Canadians have been injured 
during the timespan over ten years since these laws were enacted. 
The death and casualty numbers read like those of war.  The 
government has to tools at hand to reduce this carnage.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I and my colleagues of the New Democratic Party support the 
review and enactment of legislative measures to enhance 
deterrents and ensure that we use the tool of legislation to do 
what we can to put in place laws to reduce these accidents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not talking about people who have sacrificed their lives 
for our country or for any higher ideal.  We are talking about 
people who have had their lives or their good health ended 
because someone has chosen to drink too much, thus turning their 
vehicle into a terrible weapon out of control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even during this speech it is likely that a Canadian will loose 
his or her life due to drunk driving.  An average of more than 
one Canadian every five minutes is injured due to drunk driving. 
An average of one Canadian is killed every six hours.  This is 
simply obscene. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While clearly the loss of life and limb is paramount, let us not 
ignore the incredible toll this takes on our health care system 
and the ripple effect of other costs to the taxpayer.  This is 
not only an issue of death and injury, it is an issue of 
responsibility in so many ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly the responsibility lies at many levels.  There is the 
level of the individual.  I have chosen not to drink at all.  I 
know several have made this choice.  I know many other 
responsible social drinkers who would never climb into a vehicle 
with anywhere near the .08 alcohol level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there are others who are social drinkers who occasionally 
make the wrong choice about drinking and driving.  This wrong 
choice is estimated to be responsible for a death every single 
day in this country.  Then there are the repeat offenders, many 
with serious drinking problems who cause much of the carnage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there is the responsibility of the community.  More and 
more communities are banding and working together to change the 
laws.  It is largely due to their effort that the backward social 
philosophy of one for the road is increasingly becoming a 
thing of the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mothers Against Drunk Driving and many other organizations have 
become very sophisticated and involved and have done much of our 
homework.  This enables us, as legislators, to help address the 
problems.  There are also many small business owners who serve 
alcohol who are undertaking initiatives in their businesses to 
curb irresponsible drinking and to reduce the incidents of 
drinking and driving.  I commend their efforts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is foolish to think that the entire problem can be legislated 
away.  It is no more than criminal not to make every change we 
can as Parliamentarians to address the loss of life and health 
through drunk driving accidents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should have no fear of addressing this issue if 
it is concerned about the polls.  Nine out of every ten Canadians 
believe this is a problem for the government to address.  Almost 
three of every four Canadians support lowering the blood alcohol 
concentration level from .08 to .05.  We could perhaps go lower, 
as has been suggested by the hon. member opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would not be breaking any new ground.  Many countries are 
ahead of us.  Australia, Belgium, Finland, Greece, Netherlands, 
Norway, Portugal and France all have lowered their legal levels 
to .05.  Some provincial governments have taken the lead on this 
issue.  Newfoundland has implemented a 24 hour license suspension 
with a $100 license reinstatement charge if a person's level is 
over .05. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know there is concern among my constituents of Halifax West 
that there should be the capacity, under provincial legislation 
in Nova Scotia, to confiscate cars involved in these offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us explore in committee the possibility of automatically 
requesting from drivers breath and/or blood samples in a crash 
resulting in serious injury or death.  Let us review the current 
two hour presumption limit to obtain a breath or blood sample. 
Let us review every aspect within our federal jurisdiction to do 
our part to reduce impaired driving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not be afraid to examine the criminal code to expand the 
reasonable or probable grounds for which law enforcement officers 
can investigate crash scenes that involve death or serious 
injury. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know one of the big concerns in my riding of Halifax West 
is the extent to which we are able to determine the role alcohol 
plays in accidents causing death.  Let us look at ways to ensure 
that we know if alcohol has played part in someone's death or 
injury due to a traffic accident. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mothers Against Drunk Driving's statement of beliefs include the 
phrase: “While an individuals decision to consume alcohol is a 
private matter, driving after consuming alcohol or other drugs is 
a public matter”.

mentioned with respect to friends and families, the impact that 
one feels over the loss of a loved one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need not lose someone through drunk driving to realize the 
pain and suffering people go through when they lose a loved one. 
I lost a nephew, age 8, through a serious car accident.  There 
was no alcohol involved but I still remember the pain of that 
accident.  This young fellow knew I was doing karate and he asked 
me to break a board for him one day. He came up with all these 
big boards, 2x4s, and wanted me to break them.  At that time I 
said I would do that for him a little later on.   That later on 
never came because his life was cut short by a serious car 
accident.  Add to that the pain and suffering one feels when the 
car accident is unnecessary because someone has chosen to drink 
and drive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would say in response to the comments by hon. member who 
introduced the bill that the NDP is not serious about this issue, 
we are serious about this issue.  We do take these matters 
seriously. We do not find them funny.  We know the importance of 
having this matter adequately dealt with.  It is for this reason 
that we rise in support of his bill.  Let us take action now to 
resolve this issue.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport—Montmorency—Orléans, BQ):</B> Mr.

colleague. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was particularly struck by one thing he said.  I do not want 
to stir up bad memories, but I think that, in this motion that we 
are supporting as a party, there is a lot of talk about statistics 
and the dead.  Since the member mentioned having lost an 
eight-year-old nephew, I would like to hear what he has to say 
about the victims other than those who are killed by drunk drivers. 
Not that this makes things any better, but I would like to hear his 
views. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this motion is passed in the House and referred to a 
parliamentary committee, I would like the committee to hear from 
the less immediate victims, the families, who survive these 
accidents with major psychological trauma, and those who survive 
with physical injuries.  I would therefore like to know whether the 
member thinks it important that the parliamentary committee hear 
from less immediate victims of accidents caused by drunk drivers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am sorry that my French is 
not good enough to reply to my colleague in that language.  I will 
speak in English if I may. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate the question because it is a very serious question. 
We must remember that not only are the victims the ones who 
experience the loss but there are also victims on the other side, 
the families and friends of those who have caused the accident 
who suffer as well.  They have great concerns about a friend or a 
loved one's having caused such carnage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The best we can do in those situations is to try to band 
together and lend the support that we as human beings can give to 
each other, recognizing that it is too late after the incident 
happens to lament and say if we had only done this or that.  We 
have to move forward from that situation and try to find strength 
from our fellow human beings and try to deal with the problem 
that exists.  We should take every step we can to reduce this 
carnage by taking measures to deal with the issue that brought 
the tragic situation about.

</I></B></P><P align=left>One of things we need to consider and which I do not hear often 
considered in debates like this is to go beyond all the things we 
are talking about here today, all of which are important, and ask 
if we cannot somehow rearrange our world so that people are less 
dependent on automobiles.  We have designed entire cities and 
entire ways of life that raise temptation, and people are to be 
condemned for submitting to this temptation.  We want to do 
everything we can to deter people from acting in certain ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, one of the things we also need to consider is 
the way in which we have organized our entire society around the 
automobile and thereby enhanced the danger.  That is one of the 
things that a comprehensive long term strategy might include.  If 
we were able in the long term to reorganize our cities and 
perhaps even reorganize our laws with respect to how large 
drinking establishments have to be and where they have to be 
located, et cetera, we could in that way also seek to reduce the 
number of people on the highways in a state they should not be 
in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague 
because he has raised a very important issue.  I think it is true 
that we have not only arranged our lives around the automobile 
but we have arranged the automobile so that we try to have more 
and more powerful automobiles, ones that go faster and ones that 
are attractive to young people.  There was a very serious 
accident in the Halifax-Dartmouth area that claimed the lives of 
a couple of young people.  The young person driving had this big 
sports car that almost got out of control because it was so 
powerful.  It was a situation that caused a lot of tragedy to the 
people involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we have to refocus our lives, as my hon. colleague has 
mentioned, in a way that we can minimize those situations and put 
more focus on the true value of trying to live together and work 
together harmoniously. 
<P><A NAME="LINK40"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is with some regret that I rise in this House to 
speak on this issue.  As has been indicated by many members 
already, there are very few Canadians who are not touched in some 
way directly or indirectly by the issue of drunk driving. The 
laws that we as members of Parliament examine and the opportunity 
that we have in this House to affect and to address problems of a 
preventive nature is something that we have to take very 
seriously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been many statistics quoted within this House, 
financial, economic, but the emotional impact I think is 
something that is very difficult to quantity.  This very day we 
know as a result of a survey released last week by Mothers 
Against Drug Driving that between four and five people will die 
somewhere in Canada, and that more than 300 people will be 
injured as a result of alcohol related crashes, and again 
tomorrow and the day after.  These are shocking statistics and 
ones that made an immediate impression on me and I am sure all 
Canadians when this was pointed out so poignantly at the press 
conference held by Mothers Against Drunk Driving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A further statistic to quantify this number is that there were 
over 1,700 Canadians killed last year, and between the years 1983 
and 1991, 1.1 million.  Impaired drivers caused over half of 
Canada's fatalities in 1995, that number being 3,300.  In fact, 
it is very clear that alcohol significantly increases the risk of 
a motor vehicle crash any time a person gets behind the wheel 
regardless of the level of impairment.  It certainly increases 
the severity of an accident when a person is impaired and 
operating a motor vehicle on the highway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians witness far too many tragedies in this country on a 
daily basis.  This is one area where these tragedies can be 
prevented and can at least be lowered in terms of their numbers. 
It would be naive for me or any member of the House to suggest 
that this problem would ever be completely eradicated, 
unfortunately.  However, it is certainly incumbent on members of 
the House, people in the law enforcement society and all 
Canadians to do everything in our power to address this most 
serious problem.

</I></B></P><P align=left>At the news conference which I mentioned earlier in my remarks, 
Mothers Against Drunk Driving indicated in its survey that 80% of 
Canadians support the toughening of the Criminal Code as it 
applies to this issue.  Again, this is an issue that spans all 
partisan comment.  It is clear, simply from the comments today in 
the House, that there is unanimous sentiment that we address this 
and do so quickly.  I certainly hope that the government is 
sincere in its support of this issue. We will soon find out when 
the motion is put to a vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to indicate the support of the Progressive Conservative 
Party of Canada for the motion that has been tabled.  I have 
listened very carefully to the comments of my friends in the 
opposition as well as those of the government.  It would appear 
that there is a unified front. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to refer again briefly to the results of the survey which 
indicated that 94% of Canadians believe that impaired driving is 
a problem that the government should address.  Three of every 
four Canadians believe that the federal and provincial 
governments are not doing enough at the present time to address 
the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In expressing that sentiment, Canadians have said that they have 
a very low tolerance for those who choose to drink and drive. 
With a clear majority of Canadians of that right mind, I would 
suggest that some of the proposals which have been put forward by 
Mothers Against Drunk Driving have to be embraced by the 
government.  Since a clear majority of Canadians indicated that 
they support the lowering of the blood alcohol level as it 
applies to the Criminal Code, it is something the government 
should certainly take action on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Eighty-four per cent of Canadians also support changes to the 
Criminal Code that would include a minimum jail sentence should a 
driver be convicted of an impaired driving offence that caused 
death.  I would go further and include an offence that caused 
injury. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is painfully clear that too many Canadians are losing their 
lives and too many Canadians are being seriously injured because 
the laws in this country, as they exist, have little teeth and do 
not go far enough to act as a deterrent.  However, it goes 
further than that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More can be done, as has been demonstrated by Mothers Against 
Drunk Driving and other groups throughout the country that, 
without adequate resources, have gone forward and tried to 
educate the public. The younger generation will have the 
opportunity to see that these very frightening and staggering 
statistics are lowered. Attitudes are changing and that has to be 
encouraging to all present and to interest groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The impact of impaired driving touches us all in a very 
significant and real way.  The time is here and now to do 
everything within our power to address the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Justice indicated that she is waiting for a 
report to be tabled from the transportation department, as well 
as for a meeting with provincial counterparts.  I would reiterate 
that neither the Ministry of Transport nor the provincial 
counterparts have the ability to amend the Criminal Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was 12 months ago that the Mothers Against Drunk Driving 
first met with the justice department.  Since that time nothing 
has changed other than the fact that the statistics have 
increased and that more people have lost their lives or been 
seriously injured on Canadian highways.  I indict the government. 
It bears responsibility for those numbers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Suggestions have been made that by changing the Criminal Code 
and the justice system that an immediate impact would be felt. I 
concur with that.  The suggestions that have been made will be 
given further discussion at the justice committee level.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the motion that has been tabled, keeping in mind 
my commentary on the fact that this is a non-partisan issue, I 
hope that the Reform Party and other members of the House would 
support any initiative that would see this issue addressed, 
whether it be at the committee level or a simultaneous attempt to 
bring legislation in through the Senate by either the government 
or the opposition party, the Progressive Conservative Party of 
Canada.  I would hope that the Reform Party in particular would 
support us in that effort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been mention by my friend in the New Democratic Party 
that Canadian law is presently out of sync with progressive 
countries such as Australia, Belgium, France, Portugal, Finland 
and others.  This is something that we have to keep in mind.  We 
live in a global community and we must look to other countries to 
see how they address the problem.  They have taken the initiative 
by lowering the blood alcohol concentration to less than 80 
milligrams per 100 millilitres of blood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other specific references to changes that could be made include 
a review of the code with respect to reasonable and probable 
grounds that police officers must follow in the investigation of 
crash sites involving death and serious bodily harm.  Police 
officers on a daily basis encounter this situation and are 
charged with the important task of responding and holding people 
accountable for their actions.  Giving them the ability to deal 
with this in a more effective way with respect to the law's 
interpretation of reasonable and probable grounds I suggest would 
go further. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to attitudes as they apply to impaired driving, 
perhaps a change to the language used in the Criminal Code 
designating it as vehicular homicide would help to emphasize the 
seriousness of a charge.  Creating standards that would enact a 
victim's bill of rights would certainly help to include 
participation of victims at the trial level and would give them 
more support and more input into what was happening in the 
aftermath and the task of trying to deal with the problem and 
putting their lives back together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why we support a fundamental standard for a victim's 
bill of rights that would include not only impaired driving 
matters but all matters. It is high time we recognized the needs 
of victims within our justice system and I would support 
initiatives in that area as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know my time is limited.  I put my support forward on the 
floor.  Members should come together without partisan politics 
and create new legislation that will contribute to the saving of 
lives.  Introducing this issue at various levels will hopefully 
do that.  We owe it to the memories of those killed on the 
highways as well as the safety of all Canadians to ensure that 
when Mothers Against Drunk Driving come to Parliament Hill next 
year, Parliament will have taken meaningful action.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo—Chilcotin, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his comments.  I thought 
some of his suggestions were on the mark, particularly in 
changing some of the language we use in talking about this 
serious offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He quoted some statistics.  I have the same statistics in my 
pile of papers too.  Many Canadians are in favour of the 
government doing something about this yet the sad part is the 
numbers are still rising. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our role in providing leadership it is necessary in using the 
blunt instrument of legislation to demonstrate that this is not 
acceptable.  It may be that this blunt instrument is a little 
difficult to understand by such gentle natured people as 
Canadians.  Until families begin to talk about the seriousness of 
drinking and driving and encouraging their own members not to do 
that, it is going to be the government against somebody else.  It 
is when Canadians themselves are involved in this fight that we 
will begin to win it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I grew up in an era when a few drinks to get you home was a 
standard thing for many people. 
It resulted in three members of my high school graduating class 
being full blown alcoholics by the time they graduated.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not getting into the whole drinking problem but this 
relates to the driving part of it.  Once we become insensitive to 
the drinking, then the driving follows along. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to thank the member for his comments and to encourage 
other members to think of this as a holistic matter in which all 
of us are involved, not just the government passing a law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is probably the blunt instrument that may hold up the sign 
to say “We intend to take this seriously but we expect Canadians 
to understand and begin to take this internally into their own 
lives”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will just respond 
briefly and thank the hon. member for his comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking of blunt instruments, I would suggest that whether it 
is a vehicle or legislation, the person who is driving the 
instrument and their mindset and level of impairment that will 
often affect the result. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the comment that there is a time and a place for 
all of us to put our efforts together and address this most 
serious problem.  I would suggest that the time is here.  It has 
been here for some time.  I encourage all members to support this 
motion and work together at the committee level and throughout 
the country to see that we bring these numbers down and hopefully 
have a significant impact in the very near future.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have 
listened this morning to all members from all parties.  We are 
about to hear again from a member of the Reform Party, but as the 
hon. member from the Progressive Conservative Party has stated, 
we must throw the politics away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am asking that there be something in the educational system to 
assist young people.  They are responsible young people today. 
If they had those stats showing the negative impact of drinking 
and driving I am sure that they would work among themselves to 
change things around. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In today's society the word “cool” is a big thing.  For young 
people in high school it is a cool thing to go to the pub.  It is 
a cool think to be drinking.  No one seems to ask anyone any more 
“Are you 18 years of age?  How old are you?”  I have seen 
young people in the high schools in my own city with cases of 
beer and they are under age. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The penalty for selling liquor to underaged people has to be 
increased.  But these young people have to be educated also. I 
say to our House leader and to all of those who are here, please 
let us do something for them as well and help them out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They do not want to hurt people, like what happened to my 
parents, what happened to other people as well. They do not want 
to do that.  Let us help them. 
<P><A NAME="LINK43"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to address the motion. Surely this goes beyond 
politics. This is something that we all have to do something 
about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been talking about how important it is for us to finally 
do something for generations. We have to make sure that action is 
taken.  I am not here to criticize the government and say that it 
has not done anything over the years because there have been 
changes made. However, we are a long way from making sure that 
this problem is addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Cariboo—Chilcotin earlier said that there 
seems to be an acceptance of drinking and driving these days and 
sad to say that is probably quite true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, yesterday morning when I woke up here in Ottawa to 
early morning news on one of the stations, before, here is what 
the joke of the morning was.  A bar emptied out and everyone came 
out to the parking lots.  This guy staggered toward his car, 
tried half a dozen vehicles on his way over to his own vehicle. 
Of course the police car was sitting there watching all this. 
All the other cars left the parking lot at the bar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The policeman went over to this fellow who was staggering around 
trying to get into his car. The police said to him  “I'd like to 
give you a test right now.  I'm pretty worried about you”.  The 
guy laughed and said “No.  I'm sober.  I am the designated decoy 
tonight at the bar so everyone else could get home”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not funny.  These are the kinds of things that have been 
heard on radio programs within the last 48 hours.  It is as if it 
is some kind of a big joke and all the other guys from the bar 
were allowed to drive home drunk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is absolutely unacceptable.  Until there is a change and 
people do not think this kind of stuff is funny any more we will 
never accomplish anything.  We can certainly set an example here 
in parliament, but when we hear that kind of stuff we wonder what 
is the use.  We get discouraged, yet we need to be vigilant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are asking for changes to the Criminal Code that enhance 
deterrents and ensure that penalties reflect the seriousness of 
the offence.  Surely we are all agreed in the House that this is 
a very serious offence.  We must ensure something is done about 
it and we do not just ream off piles of statistics and say that 
we really are doing well.  Frankly all of us should be ashamed. 
Maybe the problem is better than it was, but it is certainly not 
as good as it ought to be and should be very soon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to realize that for the actions we commit there must be 
consequences.  We teach that to our children when they are young. 
We teach in our classrooms that if one does something there will 
be consequences.  It seems to me for drunk driving the 
consequences many times are just thrown out the window. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to realize that we are personally responsible for our 
behaviour and our actions.  That is a basic tenet with which I 
believe all of us agree.  As I said, we teach it.  However when 
it comes to impaired driving we can be cute and get off in the 
courts or have someone who has a reputation as a hot-shot lawyer 
get the charges dropped.  Do they think they are beating the 
system?  I am not sure.  To me it is pretty sad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many times drunk drivers have not had to live up to the 
principle of real life, the if-then causal effect:  if I do 
something I had better be prepared to pay the price.  I have seen 
all too many times when that simply does not happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mothers Against Drunk Driving, People Against Impaired Driving 
and other excellent groups have done tremendous work.  What is 
the admission to groups like these?  It is sad to say but many of 
them have been victimized.  What a way to get into a particular 
group.  What a tragedy.  The pain is still fresh for these 
people.  They have experienced the loss of a loved one because of 
drunk driving.  What a way to earn one's way into a group.  It is 
tragic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot kill people.  The Criminal Code says we cannot go 
around killing people.  Why is it that people are let off the 
hook or given a conditional sentence when they are behind the 
wheel of a car and in an impaired state?  It seems like they have 
crossed a threshold which makes it okay.  We cannot kill but 
there are times when we can kill with a car and the consequences 
are not quite so painful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I speak from experience.  Groups like Mothers Against Drunk 
Drivers and People Against Impaired Driving are very important. 
Years ago when I was small I lived in a home that was afflicted 
with alcoholism.  I could have started a group when I was six, 
seven or eight called KADD, kids against drunk drivers.  That was 
before many of these groups were organized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know how painful it is to live with alcoholism, how terrified 
you are when in bed at night and the phone rings and you are not 
sure what the phone call will be about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My father has been sober for over 20 years.  I rejoice in that. 
It is exciting to have somebody back who was in the clutches or 
grips of alcoholism.  My heart goes out to people who are 
suffering with their loved ones.  I am grateful for every day 
that my father is sober.  He drives sober and I am pretty excited 
about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember going for car rides when I was a kid with somebody 
who was impaired.  I tried to get out of it but what can you say 
when you are six or seven years old.  You go for the car ride 
because that is what kids are supposed to do.  They are supposed 
to go with their parents when they are told. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will never forget turning left in front of oncoming traffic 
and screaming “That was too close.  Please don't do that”.  He 
would turn around and say “Is that close enough for you?  Let's 
do it again” and go back to the very same corner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was insanity.  Although my father was not exactly sure of 
what he was doing at the time because of the state he was in, it 
was criminal behaviour.  We need to recognize it as such.  People 
in that condition need to pay the consequences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I talked earlier about late night phone calls.  The one I 
remember most clearly was a call that came in the middle of the 
night.  The police said to my mother “Your husband was out 
drinking.  He was going across the Burrard Street Bridge and a 
young woman on her bicycle has been hit”. 
I cannot remember exactly how old I was but we got that call when 
I was in grade 1 or grade 2.  Thank God that somehow her bicycle 
got tangled in the railing of the bridge and she did not go over 
into False Creek.  She lived, and I am grateful for that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>How many people do not live?  One phone call in the middle of 
the night can change one's life forever.  Obviously we have the 
most amount of sympathy for the victims but what about the kids 
of the drunk drivers?  That affected my life forever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am 45 years old.  I have never had a drink because somehow in 
my little six or seven year old mind I realized the potential for 
this was far too terrifying.  I do not want to go on a rant about 
this.  I know there is such a thing as responsible drinking, but 
I am here to talk about not just the economic costs of impaired 
driving but about the real human costs, the emotional costs 
referred to earlier, the incredible pain and the scars left with 
somebody forever.  They do not just get over it, obviously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will lowering the blood alcohol content from .08 to .05 help? 
Sure, it will help, but is it not far better to say the deterrent 
possibility is far more important and maybe I better make the 
choice that I will not drive because I have had too much to 
drink?  Why let ourselves get into the position where we have to 
go for a blood alcohol test?  Is it not far wiser to make a 
difference in people's lives and say not to doing it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are encouraging young people to think ahead all the time. 
That is what we need to encourage them with more than anything 
else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe in zero tolerance.  If you want to call me intolerant, 
I guess you can, but the best and safest way to deal with 
drinking and driving is zero tolerance:  if you blew over, if you 
did this, if you have been charged and if you have been 
convicted, we will not be tolerant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Governments should say they believe in zero tolerance and will 
not let people beat the system.  They should not let them try to 
get away with something or to brag to their friends at the bar or 
tell jokes on the radio station in the morning:  “Ha, I beat 
that charge.  Look at me”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about the victims?  What about the mothers?  What about the 
daughters?  What about the sisters and brothers and all the 
people whose lives are affected?  There is a huge pool of 
people's hearts and lives that are affected by these kinds of 
tragedies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some say if you get caught once maybe that will scare you into 
behaving straight.  I am sad to say the statistics do not agree. 
This speech is not about rhyming off statistics, but let me just 
give one.  Ontario is not a whole lot different than any other 
province in the country.  It is bigger but I am sure the 
percentages are the same.  Some 65% of all driving suspensions 
were given to drivers who had been suspended at least once. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does that say about a deterrent?  What is happening in the 
country right now?  It means sweet nothing.  If I know I can beat 
the system once, hey, I have a chance to do it again.  We need to 
make sure that people are literally scared straight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spent some time on a tour at the Edmonton maximum institution 
a couple of springs ago as a member of Parliament. I will never 
forget the sound of that gate going across and going thunk and 
locking behind me.  If I had any criminal tendencies in me, just 
the sound of that gate shutting behind me would have scared me 
straight.  If I were a teenager or someone involved in petty 
crime that would be deterrent enough for me.  I did not want to 
be in there without the nice guy beside me who had the key to let 
me back out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There should be a deterrent for young people, because they fall 
into the category of those most affected, and for those who are 
older and say they have beat it for 27 years and there is no 
chance they will get caught now.  Let us make sure the deterrent 
is strong enough so that we will not see repeat offenders time 
and time again.  Let us make sure that when we talk about zero 
tolerance we act on zero tolerance and that people really will be 
scared straight.  I think that is what it takes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When people realize the terror of the victims, the little kid 
lying in bed at home wondering when the phone will ring and who 
will be on the other end of it, it will scare the whole nation 
straight.  We had better do something about it and really make a 
difference.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime 
Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the member on 
her presentation.  I support the intent and essence of this 
question.  When the protection of human life is involved we have 
to do everything we can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me just add my observations.  When an issue like this one is 
present in society we have to recognize at all times it is not a 
simple problem.  Failing to understand that could lead us to a 
wrong approach in the total management of the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier I heard the member for Prince George—Bulkley Valley say 
that changes in the past had happened.  Yet we continue to see 
ongoing problems.  I agree with him but to conclude we therefore 
only need changes to the Criminal Code aspect of the approach may 
be seriously flawed.  It may blind our eyes to another approach 
which can be equally as effective, if not more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened to the debate.  The member told us about the tragic 
picture of victims.  We all share the sentiments of that loss or 
tragedy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am raising a question in all sincerity.  Maybe we should 
pursue a public education approach more aggressively.   Painting 
a tragic picture of victims appeals to the hearts of those 
tempted not to drink, seeing the tragedy of the loss of human 
lives rather than Criminal Code amendments alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I raise this issue to say that we should not blind ourselves to 
an integrated approach.  I am pleased the Minister of Justice and 
the government have assured us that the issue has already been 
raised with provincial counterparts.  I would like the Reform 
Party to support the government on this initiative as I support 
the intent of the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I just want to say 
thanks.  I appreciate the commitment from government that 
something will be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think there was anything in my remarks or in anyone 
else's remarks from either side of the House that tossed it off 
as a simple problem.  We understand the complexities of 
alcoholism.  There is nothing simple about it.  I do not believe 
there is anything simply about understanding the effects of 
impaired driving.  I do not think anyone intimated that this 
morning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is certainly not simple, but to dismiss it as complex and say 
there are many things we have to work on is partly true. It is 
very complex, but we should not just have changes to the Criminal 
Code.  It is a heck of a first step.  That is what we are asking 
for today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the member talks about public education I agree with it. 
As a high school teacher I saw some of the gory videos. They do a 
good job but only to a point.  That falls under the category we 
already have here as deterrents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Public education programs have been going on for years including 
the videos that young people see.  People receive licence 
suspensions, have to go through rehab programs and watch the 
videos.  They fall under what is already proposed here in terms 
of deterrents.  We have dealt with that.  There is no way we are 
trying to address it as a simple problem.  There are all kinds of 
deterrents and that is just one of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not just want to make changes to the Criminal Code. This 
is all encompassing.  When the committee has a chance to look at 
it some excellent changes will be made.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I stand in my place today saying that I agree that it certainly 
is not a simple problem.  The public education system is just one 
part of deterrence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing which would be an excellent deterrent is to spend 
a night in jail if there is a problem and if somebody is charged 
or something like that.  Boy, I tell you, if I were 16, 18 or 24 
years old, and I can relate my experience as an MP and having 
gone into a prison and having worked with young people for years. 
I know its effect is very sobering in all senses of that word. 
Some of these deterrents might make someone say “I better think 
about this”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot just slap something into the Criminal Code because, it 
is sad to say, many hot shot lawyers are able to work their way 
around the Criminal Code.  It needs to be deeper than that so 
that many people do not get into this situation. That is what 
deterrents are all about.  They are in our motion to make sure 
that people do not get themselves into the situation in the first 
place.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I lend my voice to the member opposite in 
congratulating her with respect to her passionate and very 
personal account of her experience as it relates to this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She speaks of deterrents both general and specific I assume.  I 
am interested to hear her comments as they relate to the concept 
of having an alternative when a person has gone through the due 
process and has been found guilty in a court of law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to sentencing, what if judges were to have 
discretion to impose an alternative to jail giving that person 
the opportunity to attend a treatment program?  We all know that 
there are problem drinkers, that there are alcoholics who simply 
cannot get off the booze. Unfortunately there are also those in 
the system that have the attitude that they do not want to attend 
a treatment program.  If that discretion were there, would the 
member be supportive of it?  Similarly, would Reformers support an 
initiative aimed at addressing the problem in the same way if it 
were introduced in the Senate of Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, before I get to the 
specifics of the question, I see a pretty frightening pattern. 
The PC members are always talking about things being initiated in 
the Senate.  We have been talking with the government about 
initiating bills in the Senate.  I am not sure if I see some sort 
of pattern developing here in that the PCs have a large 
representation in the Senate and they are going to start trying 
that process as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am in favour of anybody who can do anything to help solve the 
problem.  As the legitimately elected people in the House of 
Commons who have the mandate and authority to be here, it is wise 
that things go through this House.  If senators want to agree 
with that, or if there is something particular they think they 
need to bring in, that is fine.  But let us not politicize the 
Senate any more than it already is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking about sentencing, deterrents and alternatives, they 
already have it in the justice system and they do not seem to be 
working.  Somebody says “Well, I will just do my three hours of 
watching these videos” and stuff like that.  The point is to 
deter them before they are in there. We can look at all kinds of 
alternative sentencing, but do not let them get to that point. 
Once we start wiggling around within the justice system, the 
member knows all the things that can happen and all the 
alternatives that can happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His point is that we already have that and it simply is not 
working.  It needs to go beyond that.  Let us catch them when 
they are younger.  Let us show them that they can be scared 
straight before they even start.  It seems a whole lot wiser to 
me.  I am sure everyone would agree that if we can catch them 
young, we can catch them well.

Mr. Speaker, I too would like to commend the hon. member for 
Edmonton North for her very loquacious remarks.  It is rather 
regrettable that the hon. member had to suffer the trauma when 
she was very young.  I know of what she speaks. 
I do have a great deal of empathy for her.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the hon. member for Edmonton North to 
elucidate on zero tolerance.  I know that it is very difficult 
because when lawyers get involved and if you do have the money so 
to speak you can beat the charges, but I would like her to 
elaborate on the zero tolerance issue please. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, not just technically or 
legally but this Parliament because we are in charge of the 
Criminal Code must make sure that we send out the signal loudly 
and clearly that if someone blows over .08 as it is now, then 
that is the way it is.  It is not a good thing nor is it 
suggestible to try and work through the court system like that. 
We could talk about individual rights and everything else, but it 
seems pretty clear to me that if we break the law, we break the 
law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is about as zero tolerant as you could get.  If you blow 
over whatever the limit is, and the member talked about changing 
it to .04 and I could certainly live with that, but once you go 
over whatever the law is, you break the law.  If you break the 
law, you pay the consequences. We should not be tolerant over and 
above whatever the limit is that we set. 
<P><A NAME="LINK47"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Andy Mitchell (Secretary of State (Parks), Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am very pleased to have an opportunity to rise in 
debate today on what I believe is a very, very important subject 
for all of us in this House and of course for Canadians from 
coast to coast to coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to congratulate the member opposite for proposing 
this motion.  Even in a very small way the fact that we will 
spend the day debating this hopefully being watched by several 
thousands of Canadians, perhaps if that will give somebody the 
opportunity to have a second thought about getting behind the 
wheel of a car tonight, then that in itself is important.  Of 
course the whole subject is important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am the father of a 16 year old who is going through the 
process of learning how to drive.  I am trying to convey the 
reality and the vulnerability of a young person, to convey the 
horror that too many of us have felt when our friends were hurt 
or killed in needless traffic accidents. Trying to convey that to 
our young people so that they understand that is indeed a 
challenge.  As a father I know it is shared by parents right 
across the country to try to convey the importance of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Drinking and driving, the abuse of alcohol is a tragedy that too 
many times is visited upon Canadians and their families.  I 
concur with the intent behind this motion.  It is absolutely 
essential as a Parliament, as a society, and as individual 
Canadians, that we address this issue.  We need to make progress. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know it has been talked about already in this debate and some 
people have agreed with it and others have not put as much 
emphasis on it, but indeed the problem is complex.  It involves 
many things.  We need to understand why generally responsible 
people will sometimes be very irresponsible in their use of 
alcohol and the activities they choose to partake in, like 
driving after they have had too much to drink. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a complex problem and as a complex problem it is going to 
require complex solutions.  There are going to be solutions that 
involve the things that are brought forward in this motion.  It 
is going to involve items like changes to the Criminal Code. It 
is going to involve things like penalties. That is important. 
Deterrents indeed are important.  But the problem, the situation 
and indeed more important, the solutions go beyond just that, 
although that is important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to deal with the whole idea of education, as I opened my 
speech talking about my own personal situation.  We need to talk 
about the whole issue of education.  We need to make sure that 
people understand, particularly our young people as they are 
beginning in life and are having to cope with new pressures and 
new responsibilities.  They must understand exactly what the 
costs are and what the responsibilities are for them.

<A HREF="#LINKT25"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole issue of enforcement is important.  It is not good 
enough simply to have the laws on the books.  If there are no 
means to enforce those laws, then we will not have moved toward a 
solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also the issue of societal attitude.  It is absolutely 
essential that we continue what I believe to be progress over the 
last generation in a change in societal attitude.  It is no 
longer an acceptable social practice to drink an excessive amount 
of alcohol and get behind the wheel of a vehicle. That is simply 
not acceptable. When people have an opportunity to interact with 
each other, society should provide a negative sanction against 
that type of activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recall that I was going to a reception one evening a short 
time ago and my nine year old daughter asked who the designated 
driver was going to be.  That is a sign of how society is 
changing and how our school system is trying to get that type of 
education brought forward so that the upcoming generation will 
understand and will be responsible in their use of alcohol.  That 
is a very, very important part of what we need to do as a society 
in order to address this very difficult problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also very critical as parliamentarians approach this 
subject, that we understand there is a broad range of individuals 
and groups in society that need to come together to work on this 
problem. Obviously, as parliamentarians we have a very specific 
role.  We also need to work with our provincial counterparts who 
have the responsibility for prosecution and enforcement of the 
rules and regulations governing drinking and driving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned, we need to work with the education system to 
make sure it is working in getting the point across.  We need to 
work with organizations like MADD and other groups that have 
worked very diligently to raise the awareness and profile of the 
issue.  We need to work with groups in our individual 
constituencies that have specific roles, such as the boating and 
snowmobile clubs.  These are areas where similar tragedies take 
place because of drinking and driving.  Together we need to move 
toward solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members have mentioned that we as a government as well as 
society have implemented steps in this regard.  It was in the 
1920s when operating a vehicle while impaired became a criminal 
offence. Since that time there have been changes in the Criminal 
Code which have enhanced the prohibition of this activity and 
which have enhanced the penalties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard the Minister of Justice in a reply to a question the 
other day make a very clear commitment to the House that she will 
continue to work along those lines.  We as parliamentarians have 
a role to play in that.  We need to work with the Department of 
Justice and others and move toward improving solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking as the representative for Parry Sound—Muskoka, my 
riding faces a problem similar to many areas, although it has its 
own particular and unique nature. There are approximately 80,000 
residents in that area and in the summer it attracts roughly 
60,000 seasonal residents, people who choose to have summer homes 
there.  On a long weekend in the summer there could be an extra 
100,000 or 150,000 visitors to the area.  The whole issue of 
responsible recreation is critical and important in an area such 
as Parry Sound—Muskoka.

<A HREF="#LINKT26"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned a minute ago the whole issue of boating safety.  It 
is surprising sometimes that an individual driving the 400 km to 
come to my area would never for a moment think of having a drink 
when they got behind the wheel of their car and drove up the 
highway but then would think nothing of having that drink and 
operating a boat.  That is why I say societal attitudes and 
societal changes are so important.  It has to be as inappropriate 
to get behind the wheel of a motorized boat as it is to get 
behind the wheel of a car.  That is something where education 
plays an important role.  I am pleased to note that within my 
riding of Parry Sound—Muskoka there is a wide coalition of 
individuals and groups working on the whole issue of boating 
safety, and obviously a big component of that is to not operate a 
boat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two years ago in this House on a Friday morning with the consent 
of all the parties, the Reform Party, the justice critic whom I 
had an opportunity to work with, and the Bloc and its justice 
critic, we passed amendments to the Contraventions Act in one 
day.  Although it does not deal directly with the issue of 
impaired boating, it dealt with the whole issue of regulations 
and increased enforcement on our waterways to protect boating 
safety.  That is a small example of things that we have been able 
to do in this House and something that has a very direct impact 
on Parry Sound—Muskoka and of course other ridings that have 
large amounts of water.  I was pleased to be able to have a role 
in seeing that take place.  It was something that my predecessor, 
Stan Darling, who had sat in this House for 21 years, had worked 
on before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also on the issue of recreation in an area like mine in the 
winter we have the whole issue of snowmobiling.  Again we have a 
motorized vehicle that requires people to be operating them 
safely and obviously sober.  The Ontario Federation of Snowmobile 
Clubs has worked diligently with snowmobile owners and snowmobile 
clubs over the last several years to educate their membership as 
well as to make it clear that as a society we do not accept 
operating a snowmobile while impaired.  It actually introduced a 
program called sled smart where it works with the clubs and with 
individuals to ensure this does not happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a rural area like mine I must give credit to the Ontario 
Provincial Police and the detachments in my riding and the 
officers of those detachments who work diligently on the issue of 
education and enforcement to ensure that the tragedies we all too 
often hear about are reduced.  I do commend those officers, the 
work they do within the schools and the work they do in terms of 
enforcement.  I know they, who all too often are the first ones 
on the scenes of those tragedies, are trying to do all they can 
to reduce this problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course in my role as the Secretary of State for Parks, we 
have a role in the park system to ensure there is not an abuse of 
alcohol.  Our park wardens work diligently oftentimes with local 
enforcement agencies to ensure that there is responsible 
consumption of alcohol.  There are times during the year when we 
feel it necessary to put bans on alcohol consumption within our 
parks.  I am committed in my role as Secretary of State for Parks 
to ensure that we continue that diligence, that we continue to 
work toward preventing the inappropriate use of alcohol. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a critical issue for all of us in this House.  In 
summarizing, I again thank the member opposite for bringing this 
motion forward because I think it is important to have this 
debate.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to leave the House with one thought.  Although the 
contents of the motion are good and describe part of what we need 
to do in terms of the solution, let us not lose sight of the 
other part of it.  Let us not lose sight of what the boating 
community is doing and needs to do in terms of prevention.  Let 
us not lose sight of what the Ontario Federation of Snowmobile 
Clubs is doing.  Let us not lose sight of what the Ontario 
Provincial Police are doing.  Let us not lose sight of the 
actions that we need to take at Parks Canada to make sure this 
abuse is not allowed.  Let us make sure that we deal with the 
totality of the problem.  That is not to suggest that any part is 
less important than the next, but we must deal with the overall 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I feel strongly about this and I am sure my colleagues feel 
strongly about this.  I look forward to arriving at a solution 
and making progress on this important issue. 
<P><A NAME="LINK48"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo—Chilcotin, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the hon. secretary of state for his remarks and 
for bringing into the discussion the issues of boating and 
snowmobiling.  I can relate very well to those issues. I was out 
in the middle of Howe Sound on a 35-foot sailboat when a high 
powered motor boat played chicken with us to see how close he 
could come to the side of our boat before he had to steer away. 
There is a good deal of threat in that. I am pleased that the 
secretary of state has widened the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was an element of his speech that I would like to draw to 
the attention of the House, the statement that Canadians find it 
unacceptable to drink and drive.  A lot of Canadians do, but far 
too many do not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to depend too much on statistics, but my hon. 
colleague from Edmonton pointed out that over 65% of those who 
have been charged with impaired driving are repeat offenders.  It 
seems to me that there are not enough Canadians who understand 
how serious it is to get behind the wheel of a car or a boat 
after having consumed alcohol. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to test the secretary of state. Is putting yourself 
in the position where you can threaten, injure or kill another 
person acceptable under any circumstance?  That draws it out a 
bit more starkly.  If he agrees with me that it is not acceptable 
under any circumstance, what lengths would he go to to prevent 
that by putting something into legislation for the Canadian 
people? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would it be appropriate, for example, if someone committed a 
crime, homicide, and used their vehicle to commit the crime, to 
confiscate it?  If the vehicle was used in the commission of a 
crime, would that be acceptable? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would it be reasonable to say to someone who has been accused of 
drunk driving that they will never drive again?  They have taken 
the privilege of driving and made it their right.  That is not 
acceptable.  Therefore they will not have that privilege any 
longer.  Would that be within the scope of possibility to prevent 
the mayhem that is taking place? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Andy Mitchell:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for his questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the first point, quite frankly, if there is one person who 
thinks it is acceptable to get behind the wheel and drive while 
impaired, that is one person too many. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our objective as a society and as parliamentarians is to ensure 
that we move as closely as possible to it not being acceptable to 
any Canadian. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1225"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT28"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a realist.  I do not know if we can ever reach that zero 
number.  If there is one person who thinks it is acceptable, that 
is one person too many. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether it is acceptable that somebody places at risk somebody 
else through their inappropriate action, in this case we are 
talking about getting behind the wheel of a boat or a car or 
driving a snowmobile impaired, of course it is not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to deal with two components of that issue.  We are 
trying to do two things. One, as a society we are saying to that 
individual that it is inappropriate and as a society we are going 
to apply a sanction against them for doing that.  We need to do 
that.  I think society at large wants to make that point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also trying to make sure the person does not do it in the 
first place or that the next person does not do it in the first 
place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I talked about the need to have a broad based solution that 
contains various components, that is what I am saying.  As a 
society we have to make clear what we consider to be a penalty in 
the Criminal Code and say that is not acceptable.  That is not 
good enough. It is important but we have to do more than that. We 
have to take measures so that the next person or the person after 
that does not get behind the wheel or does not get into a boat. 
We must do both things. That is the objective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the hon. member for his question and the opportunity to 
make those points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Philip Mayfield:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I agree that whatever 
can be done to prevent this from ever beginning is all good and 
right.  If this were part of the ingredients of one's mother's 
milk, I would be in favour of it, that we grew up with the 
attitude in our communities that people just do not drive after 
they have been drinking.  I think that would be wonderful.  I am 
in favour of that.  I am in favour of the education.  I am in 
favour of family attitudes and fostering everything that will do 
this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to push the member again to the questions I asked. For 
those who insist on breaking the law and putting themselves in a 
position where others can be killed or injured, would he be in 
favour of confiscating the vehicle after the first offence? Would 
he be in favour of saying to that person they have violated their 
privilege and will not drive again, these are the rules we have? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Andy Mitchell:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not disagree with 
what the member is saying.  I have often said in the House that 
one of the important things we need to do as a society is ensure 
people understand there are consequences for messing up.  If you 
get behind the wheel of a vehicle or some other motorised 
apparatus and you operate it in an impaired state, you should 
realize quite clearly that you are going to pay a price for doing 
that.  Society is going to provide a negative sanction, a penalty 
to you. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope we have the opportunity over the next few months to 
discuss the most appropriate way to do that and the most 
appropriate penalty.  We need to analyse that and look at it 
carefully.  Should it be the same in every instance?  Is every 
instance the same?  Perhaps it is.  Perhaps there should be some 
discretion.  I remain with an open mind to look at exactly what 
that should be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I unequivocally agree with the member.  If somebody knowingly 
places somebody at risk by operating a vehicle or some other 
motorised apparatus in an impaired state, I think most members 
would agree society is justified in applying a sanction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member has outlined various options that need to be 
looked at.  We have some on the books now and an examination of 
what can be added is appropriate, something I hope we undertake.

tragic things are happening to individuals and to families right 
across Canada because of criminals who drink and drive.  I call 
them criminals because I want everybody to recognize one thing, 
that making the decision to drink and drive, whether it is a 
boat, a car or an airplane, is like picking up a weapon.  It is a 
life threatening act which could kill or maim the driver, the 
passengers, other drivers and their passengers.  It can ruin the 
lives of their families and friends who must deal with the 
tragedy.  It can possibly affect many innocent bystanders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to get a little personal on this issue.  I was not 
going to.  Normally I like to speak to everybody involved on 
anything that is personal.  I have not had time to speak to my 
wife because I was not going to bring personal happenings into 
this today, but I think I must. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was 23 years of age, my wife then was 18, I was on the 
way to the wedding of my future brother-in-law. My job was to 
pick up the flowers to take to the wedding. Another 
brother-in-law of mine was in the car too.  On the way a vehicle 
turned into our path.  I was the driver of our vehicle. John, my 
brother-in-law, was the passenger. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the time of impact I remember seeing a small child come 
through the window of the vehicle that hit us.  I will always 
remember seeing the impact of that child on the hood of my car. 
That is the last thing I remembered for a long time. I was in the 
hospital for nine months.  My pancreas was ripped and my liver 
was ripped off and my career was changed forever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My wife Cis spent many months, because of under-insurance of the 
other driver involved, picking strawberries and fruit in order to 
be on the coast—because we were from the interior—to stay with 
me through all of this.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I never got a chance to really talk to the other driver. Alcohol 
was involved.  The other driver had been drinking but not enough 
to be charged with impaired driving.  The child involved was his 
grandson.  That child lived but was in a coma for 19 or 21 days. 
The child was left a paraplegic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did this accident have to happen?  No. When the driver, the 
grandfather, was asked about this, he said he could give no 
reason for turning into our vehicle at that time.  It was a 
straight highway.  He did not know why he turned into it.  I have 
often wondered about that.  He had been drinking at a function 
and he had left there to drive home with his grandson. I wondered 
then as I wonder now if different laws had been in place whether 
that child would be better off than he is today.  It is quite 
possible.  Would that grandfather have to go through the pain 
that he probably goes through every day now when he looks at his 
grandson? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One has to take all of that into consideration.  My heart goes 
out to the families of these tragedies.  Last year, just outside 
of Vernon where I am from, three young women from 
Okanagan—Shuswap decided to drive home after an evening's 
entertainment in Kelowna, a neighbouring community.  They had 
gone only a few miles before they turned into the path of a 
logging truck.  All of them were killed.  Now their families, 
friends and loved ones have to deal with that.  It is almost 
impossible to deal with that type of tragedy.  This is all 
because we have a system in the country which allows judges to 
interpret our laws when it comes to impaired driving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This happens in my constituency and I know it happens in other 
constituencies.  It happens every day.  As the hon. member for 
Prince George—Bulkley Valley stated when he spoke to the motion, 
4.5 Canadians are killed every day due to impaired driving and 
many thousands a year are left as paraplegics or have to suffer 
other consequences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was just last week that the Mothers Against Drunk Driving 
visited the Hill.  Its members wanted the public to become aware 
of a random poll which they asked the Canadian people at large. 
It is interesting to find out, in answer to the question:  Should 
a driver be convicted of impaired driving causing death, would 
you strongly support or strongly oppose a minimum jail sentence?, 
that 47.9% answered they would strongly support minimum a jail 
sentence for impaired driving causing death, and another 37.6% 
answered they would support it. This adds up to a total of 85.5% 
who would either support or strongly support a minimum sentence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This should send a message to us here.  These are the people who 
pay our wages. 
These people put their trust in us to make the laws that will 
protect them.  That is our job and our obligation.  I believe 
that if we in the House work together, we can live up to that 
trust.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the member for his comments.  I know the member well and he 
is a sincere and hard working member of Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This opposition motion asks that a committee look at the issue 
of impaired driving.  It asks for two things, enhanced 
deterrence, and to ensure that the penalties reflect the 
seriousness of the offence.  I do not believe that there are very 
many people in the House who do not believe that the deterrent 
elements should be appropriate, given the seriousness of the 
issue.  And I certainly do not think that members in the House 
would disagree that the penalties should reflect that 
seriousness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the member raised the issue, I want to deal with the 
consequences.  We know that something like 45% of automobile 
collisions and injuries are because of the misuse of alcohol.  We 
also know that 65% of snowmobile collisions and injuries are 
caused by the misuse of alcohol. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a drunk driver kills a pedestrian, that pedestrian did not 
die because of alcohol, he or she died because of trauma. 
Statistics in Canada probably understate the seriousness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the member for the comments he made.  I think he should 
elaborate a little bit on the fact that the consequences are not 
simply to the person who misused the alcohol and the victim who 
may be involved, but it affects all of us because we all know 
someone who has been touched by a preventable tragedy caused by 
the misuse of alcohol. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the member would like to comment on this and the ripple 
effect of pain and suffering and loss, tangible and intangible 
that all Canadians feel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for his question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is hardly anyone today who has not been affected in one 
form or another by the misuse of alcohol. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The survivors and some victims have to live with this forever. I 
can speak on that from a personal point of view.  I do not think 
a week or even two days or nights go by that the memory of that 
child does not flash into my mind.  I can never get rid of it.  I 
have to live with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My wife lives with the fact that her career changed at that time 
also. She chose to give up a well paying job and career 
advancements in order to be by my side in the Haney hospital. 
While it affected us to a great extent, I cannot imagine what 
that child's grandparents had to live with for the rest of their 
lives.  My brother-in-law John was another victim of that 
accident.  He sustained head injuries in the accident that he 
still suffers with today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An accident does not just affect the people who are involved, 
there are lot more victims that we hear nothing about. We pay far 
too little attention to them when we make some of the decisions 
in this place.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo—Cowichan, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is a pleasure to rise to speak in support of the motion before 
the House.  In my opinion the motion is long overdue.  Canadians 
have been looking for this for a long time.  It certainly 
deserves the support of members on both sides of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My good friend from Prince George—Bulkley Valley brought this 
motion to the floor of the House in the spring of this year when 
the election came along and intervened.  I respectfully ask that 
we as members of the House of Commons dispense with all our 
partisan beliefs in this regard and pass the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The subject before us transcends all the political differences 
we might have and should unite us in a common cause.  The motion 
is not reflective of any particular political party or party 
ideology.  It is an effort that seeks only to protect Canadians. 
Nothing more and certainly nothing less is being asked for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have all heard the horror stories associated with drinking 
and driving.  Some members have already shared their stories with 
us.  The yearly carnage which is altogether senseless and tragic 
must come to an end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I happened to make a decision a number of years ago to abstain 
from alcohol.  Part of my reasoning was that I did not want to be 
responsible for passing along something to my children which 
perhaps I could handle but which they could not.  I certainly did 
not want to get into the situation where I was responsible for 
taking the life of another person while drinking and driving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Abstinence is still the best preventive.  However we have 
freedom of choice in the use of this legalized drug.  People will 
continue to choose to drink.  Unfortunately some will choose to 
drink and drive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not delude myself into believing that the passage of the 
motion will stop people from dying in these kinds of accidents. 
However it will go a long way toward giving the family and 
friends of victims some semblance of closure and the notion that 
justice was served. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The greatest value of this initiative may be in its deterrent 
value to new drivers.  Indeed they are the ones who need to be 
educated at an early age on the perils of driving while impaired. 
Those who unfortunately are repeat offenders would only likely be 
stopped by some kind of punitive sanction such as a stiffer 
sentence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Organizations such as Mothers Against Drunk Driving and Ontario 
Students Against Impaired Driving tell us that the status quo in 
sentencing can no longer be tolerated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been far too many tragedies.  We have buried too many 
loved ones.  As the father of eight children, every time they go 
out in a vehicle at night I pray to God they will come home 
safely.  It is not because I am worried they will be drinking and 
driving.  It is the other person who is out there that I am 
worried about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1967 my wife's sister, at 21 years of age and newly married, 
was driving down a road in Victoria, British Columbia, with her 
husband.  A drunk driver went through a stop sign and broad sided 
their car.  She was thrown out on to the pavement, hit her head 
and had severe brain damage.  She went into a coma for three 
months. She lost the use of one of her legs and one of her arms. 
Miraculously she has regained a large measure of the use of those 
limbs, but today she still lives with the consequences of that 
accident. 
Her marriage dissolved.  She limps.  She has constant pain. That 
driver got off with a $500 fine and a slap on the wrist in 1967. 
That is not acceptable, not at all.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been said before by the survivors of these kinds of 
accidents, and it deserves to be said again, that victims should 
not be paying the penalty for impaired driving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is some information that shows how much of a problem 
driving while impaired has become.  In 1992 an Ottawa <I>Sun</I> 
editorial pointed out that over 13,000 people that year were 
killed or injured because someone drove while impaired. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1994, 1,414 were killed as a result of impaired driving. This 
is roughly three times the number of people murdered in Canada 
every year, but one could argue that this is essentially the same 
thing.  Does it matter whether one holds a gun to the head of 
someone and shoots it or whether one is out there driving a car 
while drinking? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask my colleagues to think about that number, 1,414.  If this 
Chamber were made four times larger it would not hold all those 
people.  In 1993, 565 of the 1,315 people who died on Ontario 
roads were involved in alcohol related accidents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to share some additional information with colleagues 
as it relates to the cost of drinking while driving, while 
intoxicated.  By cost I refer to the price in lives and suffering 
as well as monetary.  Some 4.5 Canadians are being killed by 
impaired drivers each day.  That is one every six hours according 
to studies by the Traffic Injury Research Foundation of Canada. 
It also found that impaired drivers caused over half of Canada's 
3,300 road fatalities in 1995.  This means the chances of being 
killed by an impaired driver are three times greater in Canada 
than being killed as a result of homicide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fatalities are not the only sad statistic.  In 1993 a Transport 
Canada study revealed that over 300 Canadians each day are being 
injured as a result of an alcohol related crash.  In addition, 
these injuries and fatalities effect not only the victims but 
society as a whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1989 Transport Canada found that the minimum losses to 
society total $390,000 per fatal crash.  That figure represents 
the loss in terms of income, property damage and related cost to 
health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must bring justice to the families of victims and stiffen the 
sentencing of offenders.  Members in the Chamber need not take my 
word that Canadians find the situation intolerable.  In the 
recently released paper prepared by MADD and alluded to by my 
colleague, we have all the reasons Canadians believe the 
penalties should be stiffer.  Canadians have spoken and we as 
parliamentarians who represent them need to act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I close on that note.  Again I urge members to put aside 
partisan politics and vote in support of the motion for the good 
of the country. 
<P><A NAME="LINK52"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cannis (Scarborough Centre, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
let me thank all members who have spoken today in favour of the 
motion.  In the last parliament a similar motion was brought 
forward.  I was very honoured to have seconded it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard some very moving personal tragedies today.  I am 
sure every one of us have some to share.  A resident in my 
riding, a Mr. MacRae who worked in the greater Ottawa area, was 
unfortunately hit on one of the major highways.  It was a head on 
collision with another driver who was intoxicated.  His life was 
suddenly taken away.  He left a young wife and a young child 
whose futures were taken away from them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member just gave one example of an incident.  I believe it 
was a $500 fine and a slap on the hand.  That is ridiculous.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a problem.  We could bring forward all the laws we want, 
and I think we should, but an area of enforcement has to unfold. 
This is where we sometimes lose the game.  Most recently we heard 
of the Stuckless case in the greater Toronto area.  Thirty or 
forty young kids were abused during their early lives.  The 
gentleman was literally given a slap on the hand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Was it because the law was not there?  The law is there.  There 
are rules but the enforcement side is an area we somehow have to 
address as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member have any ideas that could be brought forward to 
enforce these laws, to make sure the penalties are enforced and 
to send a message saying that the laws are there?  We could 
change the law, implement the law and bring forward motions, but 
unless they are enforced the tragedies a previous speaker 
referred to will go on and on.  They are slaps on the hand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to send a signal to the judges out there.  They have a 
job to do.  They have a responsibility.  Unless judges are told 
in black in white that they must enforce the law as stated, we 
could bring in all kinds of the changes and nothing will happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member have any suggestions on how to enforce the 
rules and the laws we are trying to bring forward? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reed Elley:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
his question and comments.  In a great sense he has answered his 
own question.  I agree with him wholeheartedly that we have a 
system of justice.  The laws are in place.  The judges are there 
but unfortunately they very often do not enforce the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have to scream for this to happen.  It will take 
public opinion and pressure by parliamentarians and others to 
make it to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The laws are there.  They are not being enforced.  We cannot 
have these slaps on the wrist any more.  It sends a signal to 
every young person that it is okay to drink and drive.  It is not 
acceptable.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I listened with great interest to the speaker opposite. 
This is a very serious and important problem as it affects 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As former chairman of Waterloo Regional Police we took very 
seriously the whole issue of drunk driving and the results that 
would occur for people in that position.  We ensured we had good 
programs in place, for example RIDE and other methods to ensure 
enforcement was there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member believe additional enforcement on the part 
of police services across Canada would be useful to help 
ameliorate this devastating problem? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reed Elley:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
his question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no doubt in my mind that we have to get behind our 
police forces.  I talked to RCMP officers in my riding.  There 
are disheartened not only by the problems we have with the 
enforcement of drunk driving laws but by the manpower problem. 
There is a problem with the justice system and judges letting 
people off after the police have worked hard to try to bring 
people to justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a very serious problem.  I would wholeheartedly support 
the hon. member's statements.  We have to support our police.

believe the debate we are having today is an important one 
because I do not think there is anyone in the country, certainly 
no one in the riding of Thornhill that I know, who would condone 
anyone driving when drunk.  I do not think they would condone 
them driving an automobile.  I do not think they would condone 
them driving any motorized vehicle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we drive we have an obligation to ensure that we have 
knowledge of the vehicle, are trained and our judgment is 
unimpaired. 
We know that these vehicles can kill.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to begin my remarks by congratulating the Mothers Against 
Drunk Driving, MADD, as its members are referred to, for the 
wonderful work they have done in raising public consciousness 
over the years on this important issue. I also want to 
congratulate all the members of the House in all parties who have 
stated very clearly that this is a non-partisan issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we address this issue of driving while drunk, it is important 
to note that across the country it is not just the Criminal Code 
which is responsible for the deterrence and the punishment for 
those who drive while drunk.  Every province has a 
responsibility. The provinces have the responsibility for 
enforcement of the Criminal Code.  The provinces also have 
responsibility for the highways within their jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member of the Ontario legislature for 12 years I am aware 
of the progress that the province of Ontario has made.  I am also 
very aware on a personal level of the tragedies that have 
occurred. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I sat in the legislature on the day that it was announced that 
the tragic loss of the son of the now Treasurer of Ontario was as a 
result of an alcohol related accident.  While I may have had my 
differences with the hon. member, I want the House to know, that 
I and every member of that legislature felt and empathized not 
only with the tragic loss but with the senselessnes and its 
preventability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More recently we were aware of the news that the son of a 
cabinet minister in Ontario had been charged with driving while 
impaired.  The thought that went through my mind was when will we 
ever learn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come to this House not only as a parliamentarian with 
significant experience in the legislature in the province of 
Ontario after serving on municipal council for six and a half 
years, and I am a mother of four children.  The youngest is now 
25.  I remember how I felt when each of them got a driver's 
licence.  I remember discussing with each and every one of them 
the responsibility they had when they got behind the wheel of a 
car.  I remember discussing with them the responsibility they had 
when they saw a friend of theirs who should not be getting behind 
the wheel of a car. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember discussing with them the support they would receive 
from their family and from their friends, but particularly from 
my husband and I, if they took a taxi home and left the car if 
they had had a drink. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those who say that these tragedies can be prevented and we 
should be doing something about it, I agree.  I think that the 
deterrents in the Criminal Code and the penalties and the 
enforcement of the Criminal Code are only one part of the 
solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly education and treatment for those with alcohol 
problems are all part.  The raising of consciousness of this 
issue over the last many years has resulted in significant 
progress being made.  Certainly progress is being made in public 
consciousness and awareness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was very disappointed when the courts struck down the Ontario 
law brought in by a Conservative government that said that if you 
failed or you refused to take a breathalyser test that you would 
have your licence revoked for 90 days. 
I thought it was a good law and a good deterrent.  I am pleased 
that the government is appealing that decision.  It is my hope 
that law will be found to be constitutional.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to find ways to keep the public informed of the 
importance that legislators, parliamentarians and the public who 
are interested in public safety, hold this important issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to say how very proud I am of the responsiveness of 
the Liberal government.  There has been a firm and clear 
commitment from the Minister of Justice to raise this issue with 
her counterparts, the attorneys general.  We know that the 
solicitors general are also very interested in the whole issue of 
drunk driving.  I am proud to be part of a government with 
ministers who have made that commitment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The importance of that commitment speaks to the nature of this 
country.  It is not just an issue for the federal Criminal Code. 
It is an issue that requires a national strategy, a national 
interest and certainly discussions and action by all of the 
provinces across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the short time that I have been here, I have learned the 
importance of working with the provinces and getting the support 
of the provinces for federal initiatives.  I also believe this is 
in the national interest since this is a federation, but I also 
believe it is in the interest of the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to go on record today as saying that I do not believe 
that a consensus is unanimity.  We do not require unanimity in 
order to take action.  I believe we can move the yardstick 
further if we can achieve a consensus among the provincial 
partners that have responsibility 
enforcement of the Criminal Code.  We know 
that enforcement takes resources.  If they do not dedicate the 
resources we do not get the kind of enforcement that we need. 
Therefore, it is a partnership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also know the public policy which is in the provincial 
jurisdiction.  I only mentioned Ontario but I know other 
provinces have also taken initiatives.  We know how important it 
is for the provinces to be able to share that information and for 
us to be able to target our resources at what is going to be the 
most effective way of achieving our goal which is the reduction 
of impaired driving incidents, accidents and loss of life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that is the goal we all share then it is important to make 
sure that we have the research, the data, the information which 
will allow us to frame our policies in the most effective way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to note that the Traffic Injury Research 
Foundation, TIRF as it is called, is a facility database for 
Transport Canada. That data is very important if we are going to 
not only evaluate our programs but also to see the progress that 
we are making in achieving our goal. The Traffic Injury Research 
Foundation collects data from across this country and that data 
is very important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarly, and I speak again from my perspective of Ontario, we 
know the work of the Addiction Research Foundation.  It is a 
world leader in policy development, research, prevention 
strategies and, yes, treatment.  That is an important part of 
this issue as well.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that a matter such as this brings all of those 
together.  The most appropriate lead is with the Minister of 
Justice. She has expressed interest and made a commitment in the 
House and to MADD, Mothers Against Drunk Driving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also believe there is a role for the parliamentary committee 
on justice to play.  Standing committees can help frame policies 
which will impact and help to achieve our goal of a safer 
society.  I hope we will have an opportunity over the coming 
years to discuss these kinds of issues in a non-partisan way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing I have learned is that while we may all agree on the 
objectives and the goal, because of our philosophical or 
ideological differences, our approach to resolving these issues 
and achieving the goals often differ.  During the debates it is 
important for everyone to remember that we share the same goal, 
that of a safer society, of preventing accidents caused by 
impaired drivers. We must be responsive to those who say this is 
a complex issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recently said to someone that we do not have to say that an 
issue is controversial.  If it is not controversial, it is not an 
issue.  If the solutions were simple, we would not be debating 
them here, they would have been resolved.  The reason we are 
having this debate is because the issue is controversial and the 
solutions are not simple and the public policy implications are 
complex. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I specifically mentioned the legislation in Ontario that was 
struck down by the courts.  It was well-intentioned legislation. 
The provincial government was warned that when it was brought in 
that there would be court challenges.  The court challenge was 
successful and the legislation was struck down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that as legislators we must not grandstand on these 
issues. We must not say that the solutions are simple. These 
issues are so important to the kind of society we build that they 
must be addressed often in this kind of forum.  We must look for 
a solution, listen to the experts, collect the data from across 
the country, look internationally to see what others are doing, 
look at what works and what does not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one wants to see tax increases and everyone wants value for 
their tax dollars.  We must target our resources to those things 
that will work cost effectively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the debate today I want my message to be very clear.  On 
behalf of the people of Thornhill who I have the privilege of 
representing in the House, I believe they would like to see a 
comprehensive strategy, one that includes enhanced education, 
prevention, treatment options and strengthening of the Criminal 
Code in a way that will achieve the goal of reducing drunk 
driving in all motorized vehicles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate the opportunity of speaking in a non-partisan way 
for my constituents in the riding of Thornhill on an issue of 
importance to all of us.  I believe this is an issue that every 
member in the House and every person in the country cares deeply 
about. There have been too many needless tragedies.  I wish the 
solutions were simple.  But I know that every member of the 
House, each in our own way, will further the cause by 
participating in today's debate.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I agree with very much of what was said by the hon. 
member across the way.  Debates like this bother me because they 
hit home personally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For several years in the last session I worked with my 
colleagues, friends and people across the country on a national 
victims bill of rights.  We brought this victims bill of rights 
to the House, and the justice minister at that time agreed with 
the bill.  Millions of people across the country were optimistic 
that we would finally see a national victims bill of rights. That 
bill went to committee and died there and nothing has come of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My concern is very much the same as what we are hearing from 
parties here, two parties in particular who had the opportunity 
over decades to do something about drunk driving. Today on the 
Reform Party's presentation we are very likely to get unanimous 
agreement on such a motion. How confident does the hon. member 
feel about implementing something in this House when the track 
record of past governments is zero? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Elinor Caplan:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I suggest to the member 
that in fact the track record is not zero.  If we are going to 
have a helpful thoughtful debate on important issues like this 
one, it is important to state the facts clearly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know there were amendments to the Criminal Code placed by 
this government and passed by this government last spring in the 
previous Parliament.  We also know that over the course of the 
last Parliament there were numerous justice issues brought 
forward by this government that were simply not supported by the 
Reform Party across the way.  I would like to point out the ones 
they did not support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Talk is cheap.  When we are talking about a non-partisan issue 
such as this one, and we want to have support from all sides of 
the House, I say to my colleague from the Reform Party, who would 
stand and talk about zero, that he should get his facts straight. 
I would ask him, if I can during my response, why it is when it 
came to important initiatives to strengthen the Young Offenders 
Act the Reform Party voted no.  Why is it when it came to gun 
control which was supported across the country, the Reform Party 
said no?  Why is it when it came to strengthening the judicial 
review of parole ineligibility, again the Reform Party said no? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud to stand in my place today in support of an 
initiative which the justice minister and the solicitor general 
of this Liberal government have said is a priority for this 
government.  I believe with goodwill from all sides of the House 
we can make progress, but with an attitude like that and when you 
stand in the House and do not give accurate information to the 
people watching— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The Chair reminds 
hon. members to please address each other through the Chair. 
<P><A NAME="LINK56"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
debate today on the issue of drunk driving is extraordinarily 
important.  I congratulate MADD for its important work 
nationally.  In my own constituency there are very few families 
who have not been affected in some way by a drunk driver.  The 
risk to individuals and to society is great if we let it continue 
to grow unabated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The penalty for someone arrested for drunk driving is 
significantly more lenient than the penalty for someone who while 
behind the wheel of a car kills somebody, yet the actions leading 
up to either of those two conclusions are identical. 
The only difference is that one person was lucky enough to be 
arrested before he killed somebody.  That the two actions are 
identical represents one of the greatest arguments for stricter 
sentencing, for tougher laws and for stronger enforcement of 
those laws.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier I had made a few notes to commend my fellow 
parliamentarians on the non-partisan nature of this debate, but I 
suppose that is no longer valid.  However, I was enjoying the 
debate immensely up to that point, so I would ask that we return 
to the non-partisan spirit of debate on this very important 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Elinor Caplan:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the issues which the 
member opposite raised about the variations within the Criminal 
Code are exactly the types of issues that should be addressed not 
only during debate and discussions perhaps before a legislative 
committee, but also by the justice minister and her colleagues 
across this country because it is the provinces which enforce the 
Criminal Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support a non-partisan debate in this legislature.  I said 
that during my remarks.  However when provoked, if you tease the 
bear, I growl.  I hope hon. members opposite do not take offence 
when I respond in kind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an issue of importance to members of all parties.  I too 
wish we could debate this issue in a non-partisan manner. 
Unfortunately my colleague opposite made that impossible. 
<P><A NAME="LINK57"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, apology accepted.  It is too important an issue to start 
playing petty partisan politics, regardless of the fact of 
whether someone feels they have been provoked. Certainly I could 
respond to the long list the member just rattled through and say 
that I was provoked. However that would detract from the spirit 
of this debate today, which is to address one of the most serious 
criminal actions in our country which is killing thousands and 
thousands of Canadians and unfortunately all too often they are 
very young Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What specifically is the hon. member prepared to do to ensure 
that we bring the issue of drunk driving to its proper 
conclusion?  What concrete action is she prepared to take?  That 
is what my hon. colleague from Langley—Abbotsford was getting 
at. It is fine to support a motion, but what concrete steps will 
the government take and which this particular member will 
support? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Elinor Caplan:</B>  Mr. Speaker, in response to the hon. 
member opposite, I am willing to take the Minister of Justice at 
her word on the commitment which she has just made to Mothers 
Against Drunk Driving, that she will raise this issue when she 
meets with her counterparts across Canada. I am not only prepared 
to take her at her word, but I am willing to give her the 
opportunity to bring forward a report to the House. At that time 
there would be an appropriate opportunity for us to consider this 
matter in an appropriate forum such as the justice committee. 
That is what I said during my remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also point out that we may not all agree on the 
solutions, because they are complex.  However, I believe we all 
agree on the goal. I will make my commitment in this House to do 
what I can to achieve the goal of reducing drunk driving and to 
make changes as necessary to public policy to achieve that goal. 
I consider that to be a priority on behalf of my constituents in 
the riding of Thornhill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would not want the House 
to misunderstand where I come from.  It is not to degrade debate 
in this House to ask very legitimate questions. The question is 
serious.  How do we as members of this House get the government 
to move on issues such as this one and on issues such as the 
victims bill of rights, on victims of other crimes as well as 
drunk driving?

</I></B></P><P align=left>Members in this House should clearly understand that 
questions have to be asked because I do not think the confidence 
is there that these things proceed as they should.  I want the 
hon. member to understand that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK58"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I say at the outset that I will be sharing my time with 
my hon. colleague from Langley—Abbotsford. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the start of my presentation, I want to draw attention to the 
fact that in this debate we want to clearly understand that 
many thousands of victims are killed every year.  I 
think the number is up to 1,700 victims of drunk driving or of 
accidents involving alcohol. 
I noted in my brief remarks a few minutes ago that all too often 
it is the young. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are rapidly approaching one of the 
worst possible times of the year for drunk driving.  As the 
incidents of drunk driving go up, unfortunately so do the 
fatalities and the injuries around Christmastime.  Another time 
of the year is at graduation time with our young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year a poem appeared in the <I>Alaska Highway News</I> 
in my hometown.  I want to read a couple of excerpts from it 
because it quite pointedly cuts to the real problem. 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I went to a party, Mom, I remembered what you said.<BR> 
You told me not to drink, Mom, so I drank soda instead.<BR> 
I really felt proud inside, Mom, the way you said I would.<BR> 
I didn't drink and drive, Mom, even though the others said I 
should. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I started to drive away, Mom, but as I pulled out into the road,<BR> 
the other car didn't see me, Mom, and hit me like a load.<BR> 
As I lay there on the pavement, Mom, I hear the policeman say,<BR> 
the other guy is drunk, Mom, and now I'm the one who will pay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do people drink, Mom?  It can ruin your whole life.<BR> 
I'm feeling sharp pains now.  Pains just like a knife.<BR> 
The guy who hit me is walking, Mom, and I don't think it's 
fair.<BR> 
I'm lying here dying and all he can do is stare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Someone should have told him, Mom, not to drink and drive.<BR> 
If only they had told him, Mom, I would still be alive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My breath is getting shorter, Mom, I'm becoming very scared.<BR> 
Please don't cry for me, Mom.  When I needed you, you were always 
there.<BR> 
I have one last question, Mom, before I say goodbye.<BR> 
I didn't drink and drive, so why am I the one to die? 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That really sums up the issue here.  It is the innocent who are 
being killed by drunk drivers time and time again.  I do not 
think this government or previous governments have even begun to 
adequately address this issue.  It is critical that the House act 
on this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Impaired drivers have been literally getting away with murder, 
with little or no consequence for their deadly habits.  We have 
all heard the statistics echoed time and time again during the 
debate today. Too many families are suffering because the lives 
of loved ones were cut short by drunk drivers.  Too many 
convicted impaired drivers get behind the wheel again and again, 
never changing their drinking and driving behaviour.  For some, 
even killing a child does not stop them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Scott Wilson was only 15 when he was killed by a drunk driver in 
1985.  The driver, Owen Bradshaw, hit a hay wagon loaded with a 
minor hockey team, their friends and families.  Bradshaw fled the 
scene as Scott lay dying and 18 other people lay injured by his 
criminal act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was not the first time he had been caught drinking and 
driving, it was the third.  He had two previous impaired 
convictions. He only received a $175 fine for his first conviction 
and spent 30 days in jail for the second.  For killing Scott, he 
was sentenced to two years imprisonment plus one year for fleeing 
the scene of the accident, but he only served one-third of the 
three year sentence before being paroled in December 1987. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You would think his conscience would not let him continue to 
drive and drink, but he was convicted of drunk driving again in 
1991. 
On his fourth offence he received a six month jail term and was 
prohibited from driving for three years.  Did he change?  No.  On 
his birthday last year Bradshaw backed a van into a police 
cruiser that had pulled in behind him.  When it went to trial the 
crown recommended locking him up for three years but the judge 
gave him only nine months and recommended that he be granted 
immediate temporary passes so he could continue to work during 
the day.  His ex-wife had told the court how important his child 
support payments were to put food on the table for their 
children.  He should have thought about his family before he 
picked up the beer.  He should have thought about Scott's family 
when he picked up the keys. He has been convicted of drunk 
driving five times.  How many times has he driven while impaired? 
I would doubt that even he knows.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bradshaw is just one of many drunk drivers with multiple 
impaired offences still on the road today.  They do not change 
even after fines and prison terms.  Many continue to drive with 
their licences suspended, still drinking and still driving, hoping 
the police will not catch them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bradshaw, unfortunately, is just one but not even the worst 
example.  Sadly there are countless others.  One man killed five 
girls in Winnipeg on his 51st offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are at least two types of impaired drivers, the ones who 
get charged once and never drink and drive again, and the ones 
who get charged but continue to drink and drive with extremely 
high blood alcohol levels.  It is the second type in particular 
that our laws must focus on, the hardcore drinkers.  They will 
drink and drive until they injure or kill themselves or someone 
else.  Yet they refuse to change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to Mothers Against Drunk Driving, 12% of hardcore 
drunk drivers killed around 1,300 Canadians last year alone.  For 
these people we must consider an alternative that will save 
lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other people here today have talked about the need for stiffer 
penalties, and I certainly concur with them.  However, I would 
like to focus on another deterrent for drunk driving, something 
that has been proven effective in both the United States and 
Alberta where it has been available since 1990.  On Monday last I 
introduced Bill C-266, a bill that would empower judges to 
sentence impaired drivers to ignition interlock programs.  I 
believe it is one part of a deterrence package that this House 
should seriously consider. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For members who have not heard of it, an ignition interlock is 
an electronic device with a breath alcohol analyser, a 
micro-computer and an internal memory that interconnects with the 
ignition and other control systems of a vehicle.  It measures the 
blood alcohol level of the driver and prevents the vehicle from 
starting if the alcohol level exceeds a certain level.  In other 
words, it only lets the operator drive if he or she is sober. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been proven that current methods of sanction and 
rehabilitation do not work for most hardcore drinking drivers. 
However, the interlock is an immediate and effective deterrent 
against drunk driving for the participants in the program. People 
in the program have a licence that only allows them to operate 
vehicles with an ignition interlock.  Every 30 to 60 days the 
internal memory of the interlock is read and recorded.  The 
report details every driving event, the results of all tests and 
any attempts to circumvent the system. Where other members of the 
family must have access to the vehicle they too can be taught how 
to use the device. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are currently programs in Alberta, in 30 U.S. 
jurisdictions and Quebec will start a program on December 1. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Michael Weinerath, currently teaching at the University of 
Winnipeg, evaluated the results of the ignition interlock program 
in Alberta.  He concluded that the ignition interlock cases were 
4.4 times less likely to record a new serious driving violation 
and 3.9 times less likely to be involved in an injury collision. 
Clearly the interlock system teaches impaired drivers to modify 
their own behaviour much more effectively than jail or other 
treatment programs.  Not only does the interlock keep impaired 
drivers off the road when they have been drinking but, more 
important, it teaches them to keep themselves off the road when 
they have been drinking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where a person requires their vehicle for work and a judge 
thinks a suspension would be an undue hardship, the ignition 
interlock provides the public with an added measure of safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The police cannot be everywhere but the interlock can be there 
every day and every night, all the time.  In most jurisdictions 
the interlock is installed for a set period of time but I believe 
there is a better alternative. 
We could make the program mandatory until such time as the drunk 
driver changes his or her behaviour.  Some people modify their 
behaviour within a couple of months, but others never learn. Those 
are the ones we need to stop.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>People convicted of impaired driving, particularly those who 
have killed or injured someone, should not be able to start their 
cars let alone drive if they have been drinking, and the 
interlock stops them.  If they cannot start their car, they will 
not be on the road killing people. And if they are caught driving 
a vehicle without the device, then lock them up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not give a lethal weapon to a known sociopath who has been 
convicted of murder.  So why do we let impaired drivers who have 
shown no regard for human life continue to drink and drive?  I 
say let us consider the ignition interlock as part of an overall 
deterrence package. We owe it to Scott Wilson and the hundreds of 
other Canadians who are killed by drunk drivers every year.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I would like to dedicate this speech to Sheena, who was taken 
away from us some years ago by a drunk driver.  The drunk driver 
had his licence suspended for that deed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I start by congratulating MADD Canada. It is a Canadian 
organization of volunteers, people committed to trying to rectify 
a situation in this country that has grown to be very 
unacceptable.  This is an organization in which many of the 
people have experienced the very problems and situations that 
have been raised here today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mission of MADD Canada is to stop impaired driving and 
support victims of this violent crime. What more honourable 
mission could there be? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One has to just do a reality check and talk about some of the 
statistics related to drunk driving.  I know they have been 
mentioned here before, but I want to make yet another point on 
this, that 4.5 Canadians are being killed by impaired drivers 
every 24 hours, every day of the week.  Over 300 people a day are 
being injured in Canada as the result of an alcohol related 
crash, more than one Canadian every five minutes.  Impaired 
drivers killed 17,630 Canadians and injured 1.1 million from 1983 
to 1991. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If those were by the hands of criminals with guns, if they were 
rapes or other types of malicious actions, laws would have been 
put in place long ago in this country to prevent them. One 
wonders why, after all these years of building up to this, we are 
at this time today in 1997 asking the House of Commons yet again 
to take action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A bit before my speech I raised my concern and I want to talk 
about it again.  We in the House must insist on action from 
government, from all members from all parties.  But it is the 
government which is responsible for implementation. We in this 
country cannot wait, beg, hope, appease that something, 
somewhere, somehow will be done.  If not now, then when?  And if 
not here in the House of Commons, then where?

</I></B></P><P align=left>I recall a drunk driver who had a history of drunk driving 
charges.  He was out on yet another binge, on a Sunday, when he 
drove through a chain-link fence at one of our school yards. I 
was the secretary-treasurer at the time.  He killed several young 
people and severely injured others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recall being in the courtroom when his defence lawyer tried 
time and time again to get me to admit that it was a problem with 
the fence. It was the fence, he said, that was not strong enough 
to keep the drunk driver out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He did not win that case.  He served a very short time in jail. 
He is out, probably driving drunk again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wondered at the time why we were looking at the fence as the 
problem.  Why would we sue a school district or any other entity 
for the actions of an irresponsible individual?  Perhaps way back 
then I made my mind up to get involved in politics to change that 
shameless attitude. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am happy to see that members of the House support this motion. 
It well explains how bad the situation is in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am working with a friend right now who lost his step-son.  He 
will be driving across the country in the spring, raising the 
awareness of the public about drunk drivers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to read from a letter which he recently sent to me. 
This individual's step-son was killed by a hit and run driver who 
was suspected of being drunk.  We now know he was actually drunk. 
He says in his letter that court proceedings are in absolute 
shambles.  There is no mention of cause of appearance.  The 
charge appeared for two minutes.  He was allowed to leave the 
courtroom free.  Basically the parents were told nothing about 
it.  This was just another one of those days in court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He had previous convictions for impaired driving, going back to 
1984.  On six occasions his licence was suspended.  My friend 
asks this question “Why is a person such as this allowed to 
drive again, and resulting in eventually killing somebody, my 
step-son?  The law has to be changed.  The law as it stands at 
the moment condones drinking and driving by the fact that a 
coward like this killed my son”.  That is how these people feel. 
I know what those people are going through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is necessary once again to read into the record where Reform 
stands on this matter.  There should be no doubt about what we 
believe in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform supports strengthening the Criminal Code and other 
federal acts to respond to the serious issue of impaired driving. 
Our aim is to enhance deterrence and more suitably punish those 
who choose to drink and drive.  A Reform government would lower 
the current blood alcohol content level from .08 to .05.  We 
would extend or eliminate the two hour sampling time limit.  We 
would toughen sentences for those convicted of impaired driving, 
higher fines, jail times and licence suspensions.  We would 
establish minimum sentences and longer driving prohibitions for 
those convicted of impaired driving offences causing death or 
injury.  We would ensure that parole is dependent on the 
successful completion of an educational or rehabilitative 
program.  We would encourage the provinces to introduce random 
breath tests for deterrence. 
We would encourage the provinces to seize and sell the vehicles 
of those convicted of impaired driving while under suspension, 
with the proceeds going to an anti-drinking and driving fund.

is necessary to emphasize in the House that it is time to act. It 
is not the time to sit back and tell a committee to take the

minor tinkering changes.  We are long past that time.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciated the member's comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion before us today concerns the specific area of 
drinking and driving and asking the government to put forward a 
motion to have a committee draft a bill to deal with deterrents 
and penalties to reflect the seriousness of the offence.  Every 
member of this place should and I hope will support the motion. 
It transcends partisan politics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the member is the House leader of the Reform Party I would 
ask him for his words of wisdom.  I am having difficulty making 
it happen but I think it is important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the issue unfolds the way it should and the justice committee 
deals with deterrents and penalties, it will undoubtedly seek the 
input of expertise from across Canada.  It is undoubtedly the 
case that there will be input with regard to the broader question 
of alcohol misuse in Canada.  This will possibly bring out 
relevant and vital recommendations that should also be dealt 
with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member on behalf of the Reform Party support or move 
an amendment to its motion to the effect that any other important 
recommendations, observations, et cetera, that should come from 
the committee would be referred to the appropriate standing 
committee for detailed review?  In that way we would not lose the 
momentum started by the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have no problem referring 
any motion from the House to the committees for action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Very shortly in the House there will be an amendment to the 
motion, which has been agreed to by all parties, to have some 
action on a bill by a certain deadline. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To answer the question the best I can, it is incumbent upon all 
of us in the House to make sure it is a consolidated, 
comprehensive bill that is not watered down, and that it is 
brought back to the House early in the spring or later this 
winter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that way all of us can be proud of the actions we take, 
notwithstanding any opposition from any individuals in cabinet or 
any other place.

Speaker, I have a short question for my colleague.  I listened to 
his remarks very closely.  I never want to refer to it as the 
justice system because it is viewed across the land as injustice, 
which seems to be inherent in our legal system today.  He was 
driving at the fact that in today's judicial system there is a 
lack of holding people responsible and accountable for their 
actions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could he elaborate a little more on where he was going with that 
reference to drunk driving and to all people who commit 
horrendous crimes when we do not yet have a victims bill of 
rights in place in the country to address the victims of crimes? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, indeed I refer to what was 
once a justice system as a legal industry.  I believe that 
wholeheartedly today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The way to hold the criminal and the legal system responsible is 
by implementing rights for victims.  We have to stop putting the 
rights of criminals before the rights of victims.  Once we get 
into that frame of mind and on that track we will be much better 
off as a country. 
<P><A NAME="LINK62"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Portage—Lisgar, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it has been an interesting morning.  I am also one of 
the hon. members on this side of the House who is supporting the 
motion very strongly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time for an all-party decision and to get the House to 
agree on something.  I do not think that will only enhance the 
bill.  It will also improve the stature of the House of Commons 
throughout the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been involved in a number of legal cases in the last 
while.  I have been astounded by the issues judges do not have to 
address or look at.  If they make a mistake they cannot be held 
accountable.  Maybe that is one of the reasons for the problems 
in our justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We used to look at judges as being almost infallible and as 
making decisions that people could support.  When we look at a 
lot of the judgments being made, we wonder whether criminals 
dictate or influence the courts.  Do they have more rights before 
the courts than victims?  That is what it seems to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some drunk driving charges are almost unbelievable. Neighbours 
in my area through no fault of their own, and not due to alcohol, 
lost a daughter and two grandchildren in an accident about 15 
years to 20 years ago.  The suffering the family is going through 
today is unbelievable.  We as a House sometimes cannot look at 
situations jointly or transparently to see the suffering in 
communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not make my speech too long today because other member 
want to participate. 
I wish the House could support the hon. member's motion so that 
we are addressing it from the point of view that it is affecting 
families.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will be splitting my time with another member, so do not let 
me go beyond the 10 minutes, Mr. Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Often we look at tragedies as something that only happens to 
other people.  In the speeches today I have heard of incidents 
involving families or MPs that I never imagined or had known 
before.  They have probably affected every member of the House in 
some way, even if we do not know it or see it visibly.  When I 
look back at the emotional stress caused in families that lose a 
mother or a father, I am hurt to think of the neighbours I deal 
with on a daily basis whenever I am home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These accidents, these drunk driving incidents or episodes, 
could have been easily avoided.  In the case I am talking about 
the issue was that probably the father who was impaired had some 
problems at home not because of drinking but because of emotions 
and finances he could not handle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Often we are not aware that families or certain people suffer 
before they turn to the bottle, as we say.  When that happens 
they become disillusioned and try more or less to drown their 
problems by taking off in a vehicle to go to see somebody or to 
go to the next bar.  That has bad effects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very sad we only realize the hurt of the tragedy after the 
fact.  We should somehow measure the incidents or the beneficial 
effect prevention would have on the emotional strains faced by 
families and on the financial side at times.  Often when the 
drinking problem becomes prevalent in a home mismanagement 
occurs.  Usually it culminates in some kind of an accident, 
whether it is drunk driving or something else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been a privilege to say a few words on the issue before 
the House.  As I have done before, I urge the House to be 
non-partisan, to look at the motion and support it, and to make 
the country a better place to live.

do.  However, the countdown to Kyoto is on.  There are only 32 
days before the conference starts and Canada is the only country 
in the G-7 that has not released a position yet. Maybe the 
reasons the Liberals will not make the plan public is that then 
we will find out exactly how much Kyoto will cost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the prime minister again will the jump at the pump be

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

couple of cents around every Labour Day weekend.  But, boy, when 
the finance minister or the environment minister or whoever is 
running finance these days wants to raise the price by 30 cents a 
litre forever, they blame it on Rio, or I guess on Kyoto now.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we are speaking with all of the provinces that have problems.  In 
Canada, the problems are not always exactly the same from one 
province to another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that both the Government of Alberta and the people

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Power:</B>  I am sorry, Mr. Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are regulations in the Government of Canada that have 
created unemployment in Atlantic Canada and particularly in 
Newfoundland.  The clawback on earnings in excess of $26,000 from 
fishermen at a rate of 100% puts fishermen in the situation where 
they simply must stop fishing.  The end result of course is 
lay-offs in the fish processing industry.

the minister simply refuses or is unwilling or unable to deal

</I></B></P><P align=left>When skippers stop putting their boats out fishermen stop

the Minister of Health cave in to the tobacco industry.  He says 
he had no choice but he did.  He has a choice to be the minister 
of tobacco or the Minister of Health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We wonder today why he chose to be the minister of tobacco. 
Specifically, would he at least agree to hold off on his 
amendments exempting race cars until December 4 when the European

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member is reacting as though this is some sort of 
surprise.  The position of the government has been obvious for 
many months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First we introduced the hardest hitting anti-tobacco legislation 
in the western world.  We put it before the House and the House 
adopted it.  Then we made it clear in relation to the 
international auto sport in Montreal that we were to provide an 
exemption for sponsorship.  That is the position of the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us move on to implement the Tobacco Act and implement the

</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government is increasing the number of programs 
for young people.  In so doing, it is overlapping by over $120 
million the Government of Quebec's youth programs.  Overlap and 
waste are back with a vengeance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the minister is so concerned about the needs of young 
people, why does he not negotiate the transfer to Quebec of job

young people can benefit from programs tailored to their needs? 
<P><A NAME="LINK197"></A></P>

young people.  I think that what the member should be interested in 
is seeing that young people can enter the job market more easily. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have already transferred all responsibility for manpower 
training and active measures to the Government of Quebec. This 
represents $500 million annually that the Quebec government can use 
for job programs.

binding protection for labour and environment in the MAI, he 
suggested we conscript the social democratic countries in our

</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me make it clear from the minutes of negotiations that the 
U.K. is leading, together with France and other European social

debate, but also question period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I was sitting and thinking of what I was going to say in 
these four minutes, I thought I would give an example of how sad 
some of these drunk driving cases are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My brother, who is a little younger than I, lives on Highway No. 
3.  He had his in-laws visit him during the middle of the day one 
summer to look at the crops.  They left at about five o'clock in 
the afternoon and as they were going down Highway No. 3, his 
mother-in-law saw a cardbox lying in the ditch.  She said “Hey, 
let's stop and pick up that box.  It's junk.  Let's clean it 
up.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Her husband parked on the gravel shoulder of Highway No. 3. She 
was in the middle of the ditch when a drunk driver came along. 
He saw the car sitting on the shoulder of the road and drove on 
the other side of the car, into the ditch, and killed this woman 
instantly.  She was in the middle of the ditch, not on the road. 
This happened half a mile from my brother's place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every time I go by it, I know what it does to me.  How often 
have I stopped on the road somewhere to pick up something or to 
go through the ditch and look at the grain.  That tragedy will 
never be erased from my mind. That family is going to suffer for 
the rest of those people's lives.  The grandmother's life was 
snuffed out.  The grandkids were in their early teens or just 
below. I know it affects my sister-in-law because it happened 
half a mile from their home.  She cannot miss going by that 
place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is one example from hundreds that have happened in this 
country.  It should not have happened.

</I></B></P><P align=left>That accident could have been avoided.  It was not night time, 
it was not dark, it was during broad daylight.  But a man was so 
intoxicated that he did not know the difference between the 
highway and the ditch.  He was not injured, he just instantly 
killed a mother and a grandmother.  I hope people listen to that 
example and try and imagine the sadness and the effect it had on 
that whole family.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to compliment my colleague for his 
outstanding and eloquent speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Drunk driving is an enormous problem, as my colleagues have 
mentioned, and successive governments have failed in bringing 
forward legislation to adequately address it.  As we have heard 
before today, more than three people die every day and over 300 
are injured every day because of drunk drivers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that drunk driving is a problem in his province as it is 
in mine.  I know that he has seen in his riding, as we all have, 
people who have died or have been injured by drunk drivers.  I 
would like my hon. friend to give the House his opinions and his 
views on what the government can do to try to turn the tide in 
this extremely important social problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner:</B>  I thank my hon. colleague for the 
question.  It is a very hard question to answer. When I moved 
into the area where I farmed for 35 years, alcoholism was a real 
problem.  It is not just drunk driving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The education in our schools, in our homes and probably by 
government programs all point out how serious is the issue of 
being drunk, whether in a car or on a snowmobile or on a farm 
implement. A number of accidents have occurred in our community. 
They did not just happen on the road. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember one of my neighbours who had been drinking quite 
heavily during the day was having problems with his baler. 
Luckily the good Lord prevented him from being killed.  He stuck 
his head into the bale chamber when the tractor was running to 
see what was the problem. That is how serious this issue is when 
your senses are not 100% clear and you do not really know what 
you are doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to start really hammering this home to young families. 
Children have to be educated to know that they have to be 
responsible for their actions, whether it is being drunk, whether 
it is being disobedient to law enforcement officers.  Education 
is worth its weight in gold if it can be more or less implemented 
in all our homes and schools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can never imagine what kind of savings this country would 
have emotionally and financially if we did not have the drunk 
driving instances, whether on the road or on the farms or on the 
sports field.  We have seen a number of serious accidents in 
boats where boaters should not have been physically behind the 
wheel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank my hon. colleague for his question.  I hope that adds a 
bit to the debate. 
<P><A NAME="LINK221"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo—Chilcotin, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, this has turned out to be an emotional day as we debate 
these issues and bring to our conscience the sadness and tragedy 
caused to so many individuals and their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the difficulties as we look at this, and it is perhaps 
even more emotional than we are able to discuss here right now, 
is that so many people do drink at one level or another.  One of 
the difficulties I see in looking at the serious consequences of 
this is that those people who do have drink, and who do drive 
home, and have done this for a long time and have never had any 
difficulty with it, may be saying “There but for the grace of 
God go I”, when they see one of these accidents.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at the consequences of what happens, when we look 
at what is needed to prevent these accidents and those 
consequences, it is very difficult to accept responsibility for 
what so many of us do on a day by day basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the hon. member for Portage—Lisgar if he does not see the 
need for toughening up the penalties in our judicial system so 
there is a line drawn in the sand so we can all understand the 
basis that this is built upon.  If you cross the line, you pay 
the penalty.  That may be a sledgehammer but it is at least the 
beginning of dealing with a serious problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. 
member for that quick question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know if he remembers the good old days when discipline 
was exercised at home and also in the schools.  We knew after 
being disciplined by the teacher that it would be worse at home. 
Maybe that was a little harsh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the fines and the sentence are not deterrents, what is? Why 
do we have fines at all? We must have fixed discipline, fixed 
sentences for these accidents.  I cannot call them crimes but I 
guess they are crimes to humanity.  When that happens, I think 
people will start listening and obeying the law. 
<P><A NAME="LINK222"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, officially this is my maiden speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the people in my riding of Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca for 
giving me another opportunity to represent them in this House. 
For all of us it is an enormous responsibility and an enormous 
honour to finally be in this arena where we can fight to make our 
country a better place.  I know all of us here are grateful for 
this.  I am extraordinarily grateful to the people of 
Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca for giving me that opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also thank my colleague from Prince George—Bulkley Valley who 
has done a yeoman's job for years, in the last Parliament and now 
in this one, in fighting for this issue.  It is perhaps one of 
the greatest social issues which extends across boundaries from 
coast to coast. It affects health.  It affects welfare.  It 
affects human beings in so many different areas.  In fact it has 
been somewhat of a silent horror in our midst for many years.  My 
colleague from Prince George—Bulkley Valley has stood out there, 
and not alone as we have been backing him, as the point person in 
fighting for this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Drunk driving is a problem and social ill that costs us over $7 
billion per year.  As I mentioned in the question to my 
colleague, it kills over four people every day and injures over 
300 people every single day.  It has a social cost that goes way 
beyond that because it affects the family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to recite a personal situation.  When I was working 
in the emergency department of a hospital in the the riding of my 
colleague for Prince George—Bulkley Valley, a code blue was 
called which is a major trauma.  An individual was brought in 
with massive head injuries.  He was dying.  We could not save 
this young man. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Shortly thereafter the driver of the car was brought in, 
absolutely drunk.  This individual refused treatment, refused to 
communicate with us, refused to have a blood alcohol sample 
taken.  At the crash site this individual was trying to drag his 
nearly deceased friend into the driver's side so the deceased 
would be the culprit and he would be free. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The difficulties for the police in trying to prosecute this 
individual were massive.  For example they had to observe the 
blood being taken.  It had to be done in a certain fashion. 
It had to be done within two hours of the accident.  If any of 
those are broken, in the words of a defence attorney who said to 
me “I am smart. I can get any of these guys off on a 
technicality”.  What kind of message does this send?  What kind 
of judicial system do we have in this country that allows 
somebody to murder their friend, because that is what it is when 
you drive a car and you are drunk, and then allows them to get 
off on a technicality?  That hole has to be repaired.

<A HREF="#LINKT63"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>And it is not just one hole, there are many.  The justice system 
we have today has numerous little loopholes that enable people 
who are guilty of committing murder through drunk driving to get 
off. This has to change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues in the Reform Party have put forth many 
constructive suggestions to the government.  I will name a few. I 
ask the hon. justice minister to listen to them and adopt these 
suggestions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One, when blood is extracted that it can be done in greater than 
two hours, four hours for example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two, that the blood alcohol level be dropped to 55 milligrams 
per decilitre instead of the 80 milligrams per decilitre which it 
is today, in terms of defining somebody who is impaired. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Three, that when there is a situation where somebody is involved 
in a serious traffic accident, a blood sample can be taken 
automatically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Four, that if somebody refuses to have a blood sample taken, 
they will be levelled with a criminal charge of refusal to 
submit.  If someone is innocent they should not have a problem 
with this.  The only reason they would want to refuse was if they 
were guilty, is it not? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Five, we have to remove the barriers to police officers and 
enable them to do their job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Drunk driving is a little window of insight into the 
difficulties the police have in performing their duties.  For 
example, if an individual is caught driving while drunk, it takes 
about six hours of the police officer's time to engage in the 
paperwork in order to prosecute them.  Six hours off the beat. 
Six hours of not being able to find and prosecute criminals.  Six 
hours of time that could be better spent doing something 
productive and keeping our streets safe.  That has to change. The 
paperwork police officers are mired in today prevents them from 
doing their jobs and keeping our streets safe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Six, we have to have a victims bill of rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our house leader put forward a private members bill, a victims 
bill of rights which the government refused to adopt.  This bill 
of rights is rooted in fairness and sensitivity to the victims. 
For too long the justice department has taken into consideration 
the rights of the criminal and in many cases has ignored the 
rights of the victim.  That is going to change.  It must change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have put forth in two successive Parliaments constructive 
suggestions, two victims bill of rights that would protect 
victims during court proceedings. Many suggestions are very 
constructive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, victims must be kept informed of all proceedings. 
Victims must have the right to be heard at every stage of the 
judicial system.  Victims must be informed of when and what 
charges are going to be laid. Victims must have the right to be 
protected from intimidation. Victims must be able to have time 
off in order to attend court and that they do not have to bear an 
economic penalty during the course of their ordeal.  There must 
be no plea bargaining or charges dropped unless the victim is 
aware of it. Victims must be made aware of the support services 
available to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not complex.  This is rooted in fairness.  Again it is 
the innocent victims who have been violated through no fault of 
their own. 
The least we can do as a caring, sensitive society is afford them 
the same consideration as we afford the criminals.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Lisgar mentioned the aspect of education.  Too 
often we ignore that.  We have to address the children early on 
and the earlier the better. If the education system is involved 
not only on the issue of alcohol, but also drugs and other 
aspects of drunk driving and criminal activity, that will have an 
impact. There are some remarkably effective programs which have 
been created not only in this country but also in the United 
States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Drunk driving is a social ill.  People make mistakes. However we 
must have the legislative framework to enable us to do what we 
can to ensure that this massive social problem decreases.  We 
cannot ignore the problem any longer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last Parliament very little time was spent on this 
problem, yet it walks across the social spectrum.  It waltzes 
across many different ministries. It is something which we must 
be concerned about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One need not look any further than the victims.  It is not only 
the person who is injured in a car accident who pays the price. 
Their families, friends and loved ones pay a price too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that we in this House can take it upon ourselves to 
support the very fine motion presented by the hon. member for 
Prince George—Bulkley Valley.  I am sure there will be unanimous 
support for it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK223"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
have enjoyed the debate today because it has been a very 
different debate for this place.  It has been very emotional.  A 
lot of personal stories have come out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are seeing consensus building not only in the country, where 
I think there has been consensus for quite some time, but also in 
the House of Commons among all parties that this issue needs to 
be dealt with.  I hope that a committee will be struck as a 
result of this Reform motion which will bring forward strong 
legislation to deal with this huge problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member outlined the social costs, both financial and 
personal, of these tragedies to the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to relate a story to the House.  The first tragedy 
that I remember was as a very young boy.  I might have been about 
five years old.  We had to go back to my Dad's hometown of 
Minnedosa for a funeral.  Actually there were two funerals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two of my cousins had graduated from the high school in 
Minnedosa and were heading to Brandon for the evening.  Minnedosa 
is not a big place so they got together with the high school in 
Brandon for their celebration.  There were five people in the 
car.  The road is as straight as an arrow from Minnedosa to 
Brandon but unfortunately a drunk driver swerved over and hit 
their car head on.  Two of my cousins were killed as well as 
others in the car. In the small town of Minnedosa it was a real 
tragedy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As is so often the case, the drunk driver walked away from the 
car.  Five kids were killed, but the drunk driver for some reason 
was not killed.  I do not know if it is because these drivers are 
so drunk or what, but very often they are the only ones who walk 
away from the scene. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The community was in shock.  My aunt, uncle and the extended 
family were in shock.  I always wondered if my aunt, who recently 
passed away, ever recovered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can still remember it.  I was five years old.  I can remember 
all the draped coffins at the front of the church.  There was 
such profound sadness.  I was very young so I did not really 
understand it all, except I knew that everyone I knew and cared 
about was shaken to the core.

<A HREF="#LINKT65"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was one of the instances in my life that somewhere along 
the line I decided as an adult that I would abstain from alcohol. 
I realize it is a personal choice and I do not say it has to be 
the choice of a lot of people.  Part of it was I wanted to send a 
message to those people I cared about.  The deaths, the broken 
homes and the social cost of irresponsible drinking especially is 
just not something I want to participate in.  I made the decision 
a long time ago.  I drank an awful lot of Coca-Colas while others 
around me were doing otherwise, but it has never hurt me.  It was 
triggered really at five years of age when that first tragedy in 
my life happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps if there is a minute left the hon. member may want to 
tell it again, because I think these personal stories are a powerful 
testimony of why change is required.  Perhaps he would like to 
relate other stories from his life as a physician where he has 
had to deal with this horrible social crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. friend, 
our whip, for his heartfelt intervention.  None of us could have 
said it more eloquently, I am sure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Working in the emergency department I have seen a lot of people 
die.  I will have to say this. Of all the people I have seen 
killed none are perhaps more tragic than those individuals, 
particularly the young people who have died in a car accident as 
a result of drunk driving.  I remember when I was an intern I was 
working in the emergency department just before Christmas.  One 
of my colleagues, a fellow emergency room physician, was there. 
He went home.  He was moving to Victoria and he was bringing his 
family.  He was driving to the airport and a drunk driver crossed 
over the line and killed him.  They brought him into the 
emergency department half an hour later while I was still on 
shift, and he was almost dead.  He did die.  You never forget 
something like that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is wise for us to remember that on a cold night, on 
any night, one-fifth of the people who are in their cars driving 
have been drinking and one out of every 25 is drunk.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy Saint-Julien (Abitibi, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to divide my time with the member for Wentworth—Burlington on 
today's opposition motion about impaired driving.  It is true that 
this problem has caused, and will cause, much sadness in our 
families.  This motion is very important for all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the statistics, there were over 37,000 cases of 
impaired driving in Canada in 1995;  over 60 resulted in death and 
over 500 resulted in injury.  These are the sad facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of Quebec, we know that the Société d'assurance 
automobile du Québec is going to crack down on motorists. 
As of December 1, it will be bringing in the toughest measures yet. 
It is known that fear of the police and of reprisals has the most 
calming effect on motorists.  That is why even tougher measures 
will be introduced as of this date for those driving while 
impaired.  Drivers who take the wheel while their licence is 
suspended are also being targeted by the Government of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, everyone wants the slaughter to cease.  The finger 
is always being pointed at young drivers and, effective July 1, 
1997, young Quebec drivers with probationary licences cannot drink 
any alcohol and drive, or their licences will be revoked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As of December 1, the highway safety code will carry much 
tougher penalties. 
Those arrested for the first time for impaired driving will have 
their licence taken away immediately by the police, and revoked for 
one year.  Repeat offenders will be given longer suspensions, from 
24 to 36 months, and their vehicle will be confiscated when they 
are arrested.  They will also be required to go for addiction 
treatment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First time offenders will be required to attend the Alcofrein 
program.  Previously, only those ordered to do so by a judge had to 
attend a three hour information session offered by the Department 
of Public Safety at minimal cost. 
The facilitators for Alcofrein make errant drivers aware of their 
actions and focus their efforts on destroying the myths surrounding 
alcohol:

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have recently become aware of an article by Isabelle Mathieu 
that appeared in <I>Le Soleil</I> on September 13, 1997.  The headline 
says “Wake up before disaster strikes” and I would like to read a 
few excerpts: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine just for one second that your last, slightly 
alcohol-tinged evening with the love of your life ended up in a 
ditch, with her dead.  For the past two years, that is the 
horrible scene that plays out in the head of Francis Laroche. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This young man from Beauport, now aged 22, has not 
forgotten the tragedy, let alone accepted it. He has, 
nevertheless, agreed to talk about it for the shock value to all 
drivers who are still continuing to tempt fate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On October 
2, 1995, at 3:15 in the morning, Francis, his 18-year-old 
girlfriend and three other friends were coming back from partying 
at a bar in Sainte-Foy.  Francis was driving, he had consumed 
three beers over the course of the evening and felt that he was 
in full possession of his faculties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“Before we started 
out, I said to my girlfriend “Look, I'll blow into the 
breathalyser and if I'm over 0.08, I'll hand my keys over to you, 
no problem” recalls Francis.  But the bar's breathalyser was out 
of order that night. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the five friends were on the 
Autoroute de la Capitale near Pierre-Bertrand Boulevard, the 
vehicle in front of them changed lanes abruptly.  Francis lost 
control— 
</UL>
<His girlfriend's life ended. And his nightmare began. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Francis' girlfriend of a year was killed and his three friends 
were injured.  He ended up with a cut on his head, and when he 
took the police breathalyser test, his level was 0.1130 over 
the 0.08 limit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He did not, however, experience any difficulty whatsoever in 
performing the physical tests such as walking a straight line. 
Later, the Crown could not, therefore, prove that the accident 
was directly linked to drinking.  In May 1996, Francis Laroche 
pleaded guilty to the charge of impaired driving.  He got off 
with a $500 fine and a year's suspension.  His description of 
this: “The fine and the rest of it are really secondary 
compared to the much worse punishment of causing the death of 
my girlfriend”. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are stories like this every day. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legal proceedings weighed very heavily on the young man, 
whose record had been clean before the accident. “When I was 
in the cell at the courthouse, I did not believe it.  I could 
not believe I was there”, he recalls.  “When I walked in the 
street, people looked at me.  I felt everybody knew.  I felt 
judged, even by someone who had been drinking and driving for 
20 years”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can this be prevented?  Since the beginning of June, alcohol 
has robbed over a dozen people of their lives on Quebec 
highways. 
In 1996, 412 people were killed, while 1,656 were seriously 
wounded and 6,250 received minor injuries.  The Société de 
l'assurance automobile du Québec has paid out $200 million in 
compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“Delinquent drivers are a minority, but they do so much damage 
that we hear only about them”, points out Yvon Lapointe, head 
of the road safety department of CAA-Québec— 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Statistics indicate that the number of young people driving 
while impaired is decreasing more rapidly than is the case for 
adults.  Conclusion: prevention is really working with young 
people— 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In imposing zero tolerance for impaired driving, the 
government is betting that, after three years of total 
abstinence when driving as part of the sentence, young drivers 
will have learned how to control their own consumption— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is frequent reference to young people. And in the Quebec 
government's bill: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—young people are presented as irresponsible, incapable of 
learning caution.  The message must be repeated loud and 
clear: it is only a small minority of young people who drive 
dangerously and risk causing accidents.  In their case, 
something drastic must be done, I agree.  But not in the case 
of the 97.4 per cent of young drivers who have not been 
involved in injury-causing accidents, whose only crime is 
being born after 1972.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We all have a driver's licence.  The renewal form asks 
clearly: “Do you wear glasses?” It also asks if we suffer from 
any illnesses.  But I want to go further.  This motion introduced 
by the Reform Party member is important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps there would be agreement on 0.03, 0.05, but I still 
say the Government of Canada should require zero tolerance for 
several years after a second offence, as is the case for young 
people in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Drivers of snowmobiles, tractors, motorcycles and boats should 
not be left out.  The police should also be allowed to do their 
job. 
When examining the driver's licence of someone they have stopped, 
they could see the code on it, as they now do for glasses.  There 
would be a code for those with zero tolerance.  This would perhaps 
be a way to reduce the number of accidents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will not go that far.  In September, and there are 
accidents every week, in the municipality of Val d'Or in my riding, 
we lost a young leader, a man by the name of Jean Godbout, who was 
knocked down by someone over the age of 40 driving in the downtown 
area.  This was a married man with two young children.  His mother 
had already lost one son in the Balmoral mine accident in Abitibi. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This brings sorrow to all families.  I understand, and we all 
understand, that you have just lost the people on whom you counted 
the most, those close to you. 
The hardest part about these accidents is saying goodbye to a 
friend.  On behalf of all families, I say that there must be an end 
to this slaughter in Canada.

debate.  I certainly agree with his motion.  As well, I find 
myself largely in support of the original motion as proposed by 
the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I enter the debate cautiously because I am not a great fan of 
prevention arguments when it comes to crime.  I do find, however, 
that the motion proposed by the Reform Party is moderate and 
quite reasonable in its approach to the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come to the crime of drunk driving from a different experience 
than the member for Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca who told how as a 
physician he saw the broken bodies of people who were killed by 
drunk drivers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my earlier days in a former life I was a reporter.  I not 
only saw people who were injured and dying in hospitals but I saw 
the larger consequences beyond the hospitals.  That included not 
just the families of victims.  It also included the families of 
persons who committed the crimes.  That made me realize that when 
dealing with the problem of applying and creating laws we have to 
remember to look at it as broadly as possible.  The human 
condition is very broad and each one of us sometimes only sees a 
part of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a problem with increasing penalties for drunk driving. 
I certainly agree we should have penalties that serve as 
deterrents, but I have a problem when we want to create penalties 
that basically reflect our outrage at the crime.  Then penalties 
become the vengeance of the state rather than penalties of either 
deterrence or rehabilitation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I use an example from my own life in earlier years as a young 
journalist.  The drunk driver, a father of young children, had 
tried very hard over the years to control his habit and had been 
largely successful.  One afternoon coming home from picking up 
his children from a soccer game he had been to the pub, had 
drank, was over the limit, was involved in an accident and one of 
his children was killed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happens then?  As a young reporter I saw the tragedy of a 
dead child.  There is nothing more heart rending than to see a 
child that has been killed in an accident.  I do not know why it 
is that we can tolerate seeing dead adults, but as a reporter I 
could never steel my heart to a dead child. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Later I followed it up and found that the wife and children of 
that drunk driver were absolutely devastated, not just because of 
the tragedy but because of the expected loss of the bread winner 
of the family.  They know that he tried very hard to control his 
weakness, and despite all his efforts it led to this tragedy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That brings me to the idea that when we look at justice we must 
always remember that justice must have compassion.  I would not 
want to see the House pass any law that does not give the judge 
and the courts some discretion in looking at an entire situation, 
not just at the victim, in this case a child, but at the family 
of the accused when it is very clear that whatever sentence is 
coming down is not a question of deterrence.  The individual did 
not want to do it in the first place and nothing would have 
compelled him to do it other than a psychological weakness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand is rehabilitation.  There is no doubt we 
certainly must have penalties but we have to apply the law with 
compassion.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a lot of valid criticism, but I think the weakness is 
when judges pass sentences that we know are inadequate for the 
crime, where there are no mitigating circumstances such as I have 
just described, when looking from the outside we see judges pass 
a sentence that is far too light for the circumstances of the 
crime, be it drunk driving, murder or sexual assault. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We just had a very recent incident in Toronto where a judge 
passed sentence on the most horrendous sexual assault case and 
most of us feel the sentence was far too light. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is not just looking at the law and considering 
whether we should revise the penalties, which is what this motion 
proposes.  Because it is moderate I cannot oppose that in 
principle.  We also have to look at the question of who our 
judges are and how our judges come to be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are experiencing in society some serious reservations about 
the way we appoint judges, the way judges become judges. Our 
whole court system is predicated on the principle that the judge 
should be a person of great experience in life, of great 
integrity and of great professional experience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is widely felt across the country that perhaps the judges 
from the supreme court right down to the provincial court are not 
all they should be.  That may be because of our current method of 
appointing judges.  In many instances judges are political 
appointees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to get into a debate about patronage.  In some 
ways I think patronage is a very good thing, but when it comes to 
judges I have a great deal of reservation about judges being 
appointed by any aspect of the political process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest to my colleagues that if we want better quality judges 
so we can have better decisions in cases, be it drunk driving or 
be it supreme court decisions, we must set up a new regime for 
appointing judges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps we need to look at a mechanism of independent 
appointment coming from perhaps the governor general, where the 
governor general examines the credentials of potential applicants 
and ultimately decides who should sit on the bench.  Perhaps that 
would elevate the quality of judges so decisions made in crimes 
like drunk driving, murder or assault may combine common sense, 
deterrence, rehabilitation and compassion where necessary; not 
foolish compassion, not politically correct compassion, but 
compassion when it is appropriate and right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would not want to see our courts and laws become the laws of 
vengeance.  Our courts and laws are there to make society better, 
to help individual citizens with genuine problems and to protect 
society where necessary.  They are there to help not only the 
victims but the accused. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This may not be a popular position to take, but there you go, 
Mr. Speaker. 
<P><A NAME="LINK227"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George—Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, my hon. friend was quite right.  This is not a 
popular position to take. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure he need not look to the House because he knows where 
most MPs stand on that question.  I suggest he look outside the 
House, out there to real people land where people are seeing 
travesties of justice being committed every day in our courts 
across the country by appointed judges who tend to reflect the 
philosophy of the government of the day, whether it be federal or 
provincial.  That is where we are going wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The former minister of justice of this government clearly said 
in this House, as recorded in <I>Hansard</I>, that the priority of 
the justice system shall be the rehabilitation and reintegration 
into society of people convicted of crimes.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find that philosophy to be absolutely in contrast to what my 
party and I believe.  It is also in profound conflict with what 
the Canadian people think.  The philosophy of the former Minister 
of Justice is being reflected by judges day after day after day. 
Not only that, but current sentencing is reflecting the desire of 
provincial and federal governments to cut costs in the prison 
systems to the detriment of Canadians by not putting people who 
break the law in jail but rather turning them out so they do not 
have to pay the costs of keeping them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a fundamental wrong here.  When a person commits a 
crime there must be consequences.  Life is all about choices.  We 
make some choices that are good and we carry on with our lives. 
Some people make choices that are very bad and they must pay the 
consequences of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I tend to think—and we may get to this in the justice committee 
some time during this Parliament—that if there is a way to 
ensure that judges sitting on the bench have only one goal in 
mind and that is to ensure true justice is given in their 
decisions I hope we find it.  I hope the hon. member will 
contribute to the process of reaching that goal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have now does not work.  I do not believe the appointing 
of judges is the right way to go.  It does not reflect the will 
of the Canadian people.  I do not buy for a moment that the 
Canadian people simply want vengeance or revenge, but they do 
want justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Mr. Speaker, in reply to the member 
opposite, yes, they do want justice, but I think justice is 
always understood as having an element of compassion in it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My concern about a debate on victims rights and so on is that it 
steers into the whole idea of vengeance.  When a crime is 
committed one can actually set a fixed penalty that is absolute. 
We have to give discretion to judges.  We have to give judges the 
opportunity to be compassionate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will leap to the defence of the former justice minister 
because I think he tried very hard to choose judges who were very 
well qualified.  I had discussions along this line with him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In criticizing the system I want to make it very clear that I 
was not criticizing the government or the former justice 
minister.  I was pointing out that there are judges on the bench 
appointed by previous governments who have certainly not 
performed in an adequate fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The system is flawed.  The former justice minister would agree 
that a better way has to be found than relying on the political 
arm of government to choose judges.  I hope that is the kind of 
debate we would have.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to speak to this motion moved by the official 
opposition, a motion which, all in all, needs a very serious 
analysis, given its implications for a society like Canada, and 
Quebec as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To situate the debate properly, the purpose of this motion is 
to require the government to bring forward a motion, pursuant to a 
Standing Order, to strike a legislative committee.  We have seen 
the government bring in an amendment to this, in order to have the 
words “legislative committee” replaced by “the Standing Committee 
on Justice and Human Rights”. 
This, I believe, is an amendment that makes sense, since the 
committee already exists.  Since the Standing Committee on Justice 
and Human Rights is there precisely in order to study motions of 
this sort, it is obvious to me that this amendment needs to be 
made.  We in the Bloc Quebecois approve of this amendment. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1600"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT71"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, in order to limit the time period allowed the 
committee to consider the question, the government is making an 
amendment giving the committee until May 15, 1998 to submit its 
report to the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At first glance, the government appears to be paying careful 
attention to the motion tabled by the opposition in this House 
today for us to study this topical issue carefully. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are we now concerned with this issue, among others?  Last 
week, a lobby group—and I use the word “lobby” not in its 
negative sense, quite the contrary, some lobbies in Canada do good 
work—known as MADD, Mothers Against Drunk Driving, came to the 
House to meet members of Parliament.  They submitted a report, 
which, in short, is very well done.  However, as with any lobby, we 
must examine their report with a critical eye, but in a 
constructive manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a lobby group of this sort submits a public survey, the 
results must be considered and statements in the report have to be 
acknowledged, but we must look at it with a critical eye.  We must 
find out how and why the questions were asked, who paid for the 
survey, and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What catches my attention about this survey is that it points 
out the same things already confirmed by the police, by groups who 
have studied the situation, among others, in the report about the 
national scourge of drinking and driving.  I can immediately tell 
this lobby group and all those listening that the Bloc Quebecois 
also considers drinking and driving to be a scourge both for Canada 
and for Quebec.  As legislators and elected officials, we must give 
very serious thought to this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main figures pointed out in this document, and it is 
important to recall them so that we have a fairly good idea of the 
situation, are that 94.3% of those surveyed think that driving 
while impaired is a problem that the government must eliminate.  I 
am not surprised that the percentage is so high, given the 
seriousness of the problem, as I said earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, 74.7% of those surveyed think that the provincial 
and federal governments are not doing enough to reduce impaired 
driving.  This may or may not be true, but one thing is certain—it 
depends on the question asked, I was not surveyed, you know it is 
sometimes easy to get people to say things over the phone, if the 
questions asked lead the person answering in one direction rather 
than other—there is no doubt that this is a high percentage of 
people who think that governments are not doing enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee that will be created, if the motion is passed by 
the House, will, I think, have to take a very serious look at this 
finding. 
Are the federal and provincial governments, which are responsible 
for the administration of justice, making a serious effort to stamp 
out impaired driving, or are they not?  This is the question we 
will have to answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will know more when we examine the issue, but it is 
interesting that 94.4% feel that Criminal Code amendments must be 
implemented and anyone involved in an accident causing death or 
serious injury obliged to provide a blood sample when requested to 
do so by the officer, as required by law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of those surveyed, 73% support a reduction in the level of 
alcohol from 80 milligrams per 100 millilitres to 50 milligrams per 
100 millilitres, a reduction of 30 milligrams.  This is sizeable. 
It seems, however, that over two-thirds of the population support 
this measure. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1605"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT72"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another important point, one I am also anxious to be able to 
verify, is that 85% of those surveyed are in favour of amending the 
Criminal Code to stiffen the minimum prison sentence for any person 
who has caused death or bodily harm.  In other words, a person who 
has an accident in which another person sustains physical injury or 
death would automatically receive a minimum sentence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the moment, we know that the Criminal Code stipulates a 
prison sentence, but it is a maximum of five years and judges are 
given some discretion. 
I will come back to the judges a little later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one element which raises a big question mark for me, 
because I have read some of the survey questions and am a bit 
puzzled by them.  It may be true, but it would need to be checked 
in committee.  It is said that 90.2% of respondents support 
adoption of a declaration of victims' rights.  What I would like to 
know is, what percentage of those surveyed knew what a declaration 
of victims' rights was, and what it included. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing is certain, the public is currently questioning the 
extremely important issue of drunk driving.  Every week we read 
newspaper reports about accidents resulting in injuries and deaths. 
One need only check with the automobile associations in Quebec, 
Ontario or the other provinces, to see that the statistics are 
damning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the reality really dictate that the legislator must be 
pushed into changing the legislative provisions on impaired 
driving?  Perhaps.  Or perhaps it is something other than the 
legislation that needs changing.  The committee that will be struck 
can cast some light on this and report to the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the questions I have asked myself, particularly when I 
meet with the people from MADD, is what goes on in other countries, 
how do other countries deal with impaired driving. The maximum 
blood alcohol level allowed in the legislation when I was 
practicing law was .08.  That is what it still is today.  But I 
realy wondered about the proposal to reduce it to .05.  I learned, 
however, when I looked into it, when I examined more closely the 
information submitted to us today, that .05 was the level already 
in Australia, Belgium, Finland, Greece, the Netherlands, Norway, 
Portugal, even France. 
So, this is perhaps not as extreme as it appears.  Perhaps it is 
not such an exaggeration to consider a lower blood alcohol level in 
Canada and in Quebec, if that is what people want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have in fact noted a difference in the application of the 
rule of 80 mg per 100 ml in the blood, in Quebec and in other 
Canadian provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, nothing is ever all black or all white.  Those who 
have followed the issue of drinking and driving, lawyers primarily, 
those involved in enforcing the law, know that, since 1985, a 
series of amendments have been made to the Criminal Code in an 
effort to solve the problem, to further discourage people, to focus 
on the target group, those most affected by drinking and driving. 
Since 1985, an attempt has been made to dissuade them in all sorts 
of ways, including through stiffer penalties and simplification of 
the job of the police.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently, it became possible to obtain a blood sample under 
certain circumstances, guidelines were given, the goal being to 
help police officers gather evidence to build cases and to 
discourage the public from drinking and driving.  All this has 
taken place since 1985. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 35th Parliament, I remember the government members 
opposite presenting amendments to increase the maximum sentence in 
the case of people who had had an accident while impaired and who 
had injured or killed somebody in that accident. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The result is that today we must also take into consideration 
the provisions of the Criminal Code, and I think it useful to point 
these out so as to give people an overview of the situation. 
As it now stands, section 255 of the Criminal Code provides for the 
following sentences: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(1) Every one who commits an offence under section 253 or 
254—driving while impaired—is guilty of an indictable 
offence or an offence punishable on summary conviction— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In legal jargon, a “summary offence” is less serious than an 
“indictable offence”.  When someone is charged by way of 
indictment, the offence is much more serious, the person must be 
represented by a lawyer, and so forth, while someone tried by 
summary conviction is not required to be present at the hearing. 
It is a less serious offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It therefore reads: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—is liable, 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(a) whether the offence is prosecuted by indictment or 
punishable on summary conviction, to the following minimum 
punishment, namely, 
</UL></UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(i) for a first offence, to a fine of not less than three 
hundred dollars, 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(ii) for a second offence, to imprisonment for not less than 
fourteen days, and 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(iii) for each subsequent offence, to imprisonment for not 
less than ninety days. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A progression can be seen that no longer exists since these 
rules were passed. These are amendments made by the legislator over 
the years in the wake of certain rulings, certain developments in 
this issue, in order to increase the sentence and try to discourage 
the public. 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(b) where the offence is prosecuted by indictment— 
</UL></UL>
<in other words, if it is even more serious, 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(c) where the offence is punishable on summary conviction, to 
imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months. 
</UL></UL>
<It is already clear that it is less serious when a summary 
conviction is involved. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(2) Every one who commits an offence under paragraph 253 (<I>a</I>) and 
thereby causes bodily harm to any other person is guilty of an 
indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not 
exceeding ten years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(3) Every one who commits an offence under paragraph 253 (<I>a</I>) and 
thereby causes the death of any other person is guilty of an 
indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not 
exceeding fourteen years. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As you can see, the sentence is increased if it is a repeat 
offence, if the damage is greater, if the other party's injuries 
are more serious, or if someone dies as a result of an accident 
caused by an impaired driver. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is being called for, and what we would like to see in the 
Criminal Code, I think, is a minimum.  In other words, an impaired 
driver who has an accident gets, for example, a minimum of one year 
or two years in prison. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see this as dangerous, though perhaps it is necessary, and 
I am not saying that it is not. Personally, I am telling you today 
that it may be dangerous because all discretion is being taken away 
from the court.  We are taking away any way, any manner in which a 
properly informed judge, a judge who hears the evidence, a judge 
who sees the accused, a judge who is familiar with all the facts of 
the accident, could assess the case, as he could not do so if a 
minimum is set. 
Perhaps we will have to come to that, but only a very wise man 
could know the answer to that question today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opposition's motion, if passed by the House, will enable 
us to check whether setting a minimum for such an offence is really 
the right thing to do.  That is one example.  There may be other 
things that need examination.  I heard one of my colleagues on the 
government side talking about the appointment of judges just now. 
Yes, there is that aspect, perhaps, but there may be something 
else, perhaps in terms of heightening the judges' awareness.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These days, I hear all sorts of things about remarks judges 
have made following a decision, remarks that have not always been 
so nice.  I am not noising around the fact that I am in the same 
league, because I am not too proud of the remarks these people may 
have made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps enhanced awareness is needed.  Stiffer penalties in 
the Criminal Code are not necessarily the solution.  All of this 
can be studied in committee.  We can look at what exactly should be 
considered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That said, we in the Bloc Quebecois have three points to make 
with respect to this motion. 
First, we acknowledge the importance of the problem raised by the 
motion presented by the official opposition.  The motion deserves 
our support and very serious consideration in committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the Bloc Quebecois supports the motion as amended by 
the government, which asks to present a motion to set up a standing 
committee to discuss the measures provided in the Criminal Code in 
order to correct and improve where possible the provisions 
pertaining to offences involving the consumption of alcohol and 
impaired driving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, the Bloc Quebecois aware of the problem created by 
drunk driving considers that legislative study will concern the 
matter as a whole and not just the establishment of harsher 
penalties.  We say “What's worth doing is worth doing right”. 
We will do it with assurance, and anyone looking at it afterward 
will have no cause for complaint.  This is what I want to bring to 
the committee.  If a committee is going to look at this, we must 
look not only at increasing the penalty, but at the whole issue 
from A to Z. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would, however, caution this House, because we will be 
dealing with the administration of justice, which is not a federal 
matter but a provincial matter.  We must be very careful in our 
review of these provisions to do a thorough, serious and detailed 
analysis in the area of federal jurisdiction.  We will not stick 
our big mitts in the administration of justice.  It is none of our 
business.  The Bloc will be there to dot the <I>i</I>'s and cross the <I>t</I>'s, 
should the government decided to go a bit further. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude by saying that, in committee, I will have a series 
of questions to put to the people who will come to present their briefs, 
make comments on such violations and the changes that need to be made to 
the Criminal Code. I think we should also hear from police officers. We 
should seek their opinion on this question and on what they would like 
to see in terms of legislation, to get a feel for what their priorities 
are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, because I can see you signalling that I am running out of 
time, we indeed support this motion, as amended by the government. We 
support it because it will allow an informed debate on this question. We 
will then report to this House to enact the most useful legislation 
possible, legislation that may stop this scourge, which is—again, we 
agree on the terminology—a very terrible national scourge.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague of the Bloc.  I do 
not often have occasion to congratulate my Bloc colleague on an 
excellent speech.  This issue is so important that it must cross 
party lines.  We must all try very carefully to avoid trying to 
make political capital out of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague said, it is a case that goes beyond simply 
increased penalties. 
It is not a matter of increased penalties.  It is a matter of 
finding a solution that is more equitable for victims, for 
everyone who is involved in the tragedy of drunk driving.  If it 
is a matter of changing the mechanism by which we appoint judges, 
so be it.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I take it from the remarks of my hon. colleague opposite that he 
agrees with me that in matters of justice, justice must be 
tempered with compassion.  We can only have compassion in the 
courts if we give discretion to judges and we can only give 
discretion to judges if we have good judges. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</B> Mr. Speaker, to hear the hon. member paying 
me compliments like that, I would be tempted to believe there is 
something fishy going on here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Raymonde Folco:</B> He is being generous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</B> He is being generous. Perhaps he is 
generous and more practical than you, Madam. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But seriously, having sat on the justice committee with the hon. 
member who just made these remarks, I know that, on a number of 
occasions, in the interest of advancing certain issues, we have all set 
aside our political affiliations and petty partisan concerns. 
We have done so with various issues, and I am prepared to do so again 
today on this issue, which deserves the full attention of this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before answering his last question, a word about the appointment of 
judges, which he mentioned. Indeed, we in the Bloc Quebecois believe 
that the appointment of all judges should be carried out in a much more 
enlightened, much more transparent fashion, as we requested when a 
justice of the Supreme Court of Canada was appointed, recently. Our call 
was not heard, and I hope the hon. member will pursue the matter on the 
government side so that we can eventually have legislation governing the 
appointment of judges to ensure it is carried out in a much more 
transparent fashion. And this extends beyond the office of the Prime 
Minister, who, with a stroke of the pen, decides who will be a justice 
of the supreme court or superior court. These are, after all, very 
important positions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe they will eventually come around and share our views, as 
they have done regarding many other issues. After all, when it comes to 
certain issues, the Bloc and the province of Quebec seem to be 15, 20 or 
30 years ahead of the government members sitting across from us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last question has to do with the compassion—I guess it is 
the right word—that judges can show when no minimum sentence is set. 
The word “assessment” could also be used. If we set a minimum sentence 
in a legislative provision—and I agree that such a minimum should be 
set in some laws—we remove any possibility for the judge to assess 
the facts before him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would not want to sit on the bench and to hear witnesses, 
including victims, describe a situation. Sometimes, the victims are not 
completely innocent. As I said earlier, things are not always black or 
white. 
I can imagine a judge saying: “Sir, I must sentence you to two years in 
jail, because the act requires me to do so. In the old days, I might 
have given you just six months, with a possibility of treatment in some 
institution, because you have a serious alcohol problem and because you 
have children”.  This is another aspect which should not be overlooked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sometimes, five, six or seven children may depend on the 
individual. Is society better served by sending that person to jail and 
forcing the children to go on welfare? Is this the ultimate purpose of 
these changes? If so, I want no part of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue has to be reviewed very carefully if we want the judges 
to have a good understanding of the situation but also if we want to 
send a clear message to the population saying that no, it is not 
acceptable to drink and drive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, I am with you all the way on this; yes, you will find me by 
your side to further this issue, but I believe we must proceed carefully 
and analyze the situation in detail so that we will have the best 
legislation possible to fight against this scourge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not sure that by having a minimum penalty of one, two, or 
three years, this will help achieve our objective, because I have never 
seen any study nor has any study ever been tabled showing that there is 
a direct link between increasing the penalty and seeing a decrease in 
repeat offences, or in the number of drunk driving cases, of thefts or 
anything else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think I am still part of the generation that is really committed 
to rehabilitation, prevention and education.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise to support the comments made by my hon. colleague from the 
Bloc Quebecois.  It is very important that we not allow the focus 
of this motion to be deterred by looking at the broader issue of 
justices and the appointment of judges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the hon. member on the opposite side has raised some valid 
concerns, that justice must be tempered with mercy, the examples 
that he cited earlier are among the minority of the tragic cases 
that we see resulting from drunk driving. I believe it is 
appropriate that the House agree on this motion and refer it for 
proper study to a committee so that those issues can be dealt 
with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should not get lost in the debate.  By moving it to another 
level and talking about the appointment of judges is a different 
issue.  It is important to keep the focus on what this motion is 
designed to deal with on behalf of the people who suffer the 
tragic results of drunk driving. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</B> Mr. Speaker, I believe that we should not 
steer away from the motion we are examining. But at this stage, 
everything is possible. If we really want to consider seriously this 
issue, we must absolutely not exclude anything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are the judges the ones who need education? Is it the procedure by 
which judges are appointed that can solve the problem? Is it stiffer 
penalties? Is it education? Is it allowing provincial legislation to 
deal more adequately with such or such an area? Personally, at this 
stage, I exclude nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will be up to the committee to carry out its work in a very 
independent and professional manner, and the Committee on Justice and 
Human Rights has shown on several occasions that it can do just that. 
When all the parties worked together and set politics aside, we have 
done wonders. I think we will be able once again to go over this issue 
very effectively and to table a very relevant report in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But in reply to the member, yes, we must maintain a clear 
objective, which is to deal with the Criminal Code, if anything in it 
has to be dealt with, to achieve the ultimate objective which is to put 
an end to the problem of impaired driving. If we have to deal with the 
judges, we will do that. If we have to deal with something else, we will 
do that also. The committee will report to you, Mr. Speaker, and I am 
sure you will agree with us.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West—Nepean, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to advise you and the House that I will be 
sharing my time with the member for Mississauga South. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this motion.  I 
do not think one of us in this House has not been touched by the 
tragedy of someone close to us being killed by a drunk driver. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just to contemplate and hear about a dear friend, somebody who 
is working in the community, who is helping other people, who is 
a source of inspiration to her entire family and to everyone who 
knows her, suddenly vanishing from the face of this earth because 
a drunk driver came out of a side road and on to a main road and 
smashed right into her car. None of us has lived without 
experiencing receiving that kind of news and the senselessness of 
it, the helplessness of it, and the determination that we have to 
do something about it is our first reaction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to congratulate MADD, Mothers Against Drunk Driving. Its 
members have done an absolutely phenomenal job in this past week 
of meeting with members of Parliament, of informing us, of 
putting together what they believe needs to be done to diminish 
this scourge on our population, to diminish the number of people 
of all ages who fall victim to drunk driving.

</I></B></P><P align=left>They have done a tremendous job of educating the public.  They 
have done a tremendous job of surveying public opinion and making 
it clear to members of Parliament that Canadians from coast to 
coast want serious to action be taken on this soon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an issue that I have some history with.  When I was 
president of the Ontario Association of Municipalities I had 
the privilege of working with the attorney general at the time, 
the hon. Roy McMurtry.  We set up a program for municipalities 
across Ontario to develop community action programs on drinking 
and driving.  I set up a program in the city of Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Things have changed a lot since the early eighties.  Attitudes 
have changed a lot.  At that time my children were in their teens 
or their very early twenties.  It was very encouraging for me to 
see young people coming to a party at my home, bringing their 
sleeping bags, just in case they had something to drink and did 
not want to drive home or just in case their friends felt they 
should not drive home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember living through a period of time with a friend who was 
a drinking alcoholic.  This friend was coming to visit us 
regularly.  We were trying to provide him with support. I 
suddenly realized that every night he visited us he was driving 
down my street, endangering my children and other children.  At 
one point I said to my husband “Ron, you drive him home.  You 
disable his car and do not let him drive again”.  I told him 
that I would not ever again have him coming to my home, 
endangering someone else's life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His distributor cap sat on the top of our refrigerator for a 
long time.  I am pleased to say that for the last 20 years he has 
not had a drink. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I tell that story because one of the lessons I learned when I 
was involved with the drinking and driving task force in this 
region was that what we are dealing with is the problem of 
alcoholism.  Fifty per cent of first time driving offences are 
committed by alcoholics.  The end result of their history is 
often tragedy.  Lives are lost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe it is important for us to deal with the front end. 
The first time someone is apprehended, the first time they are 
convicted, that is when we have to take serious action. We have 
to recognize that half the people we are dealing with in those 
first convictions are alcoholics.  If we do not deal with 
alcoholism, there will be a second and third conviction and a 
tragedy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To demonstrate how important this point is, by the time someone 
is convicted a second time of drinking and driving we know there 
is a 90% chance they are an alcoholic.  Ninety per cent of second 
offenders are alcoholics.  Therefore losing a licence or spending 
time in jail is not enough to ensure that person will not get 
behind of the wheel drunk again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to deal with alcoholism.  We have to deal with it 
seriously.  We have to ensure that person, convicted the first 
time, does not drive again until the alcoholism is dealt with. 
That is a very important and crucial step in preventing these 
tragedies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That does not mean that we do not have to look at the other end 
and at what we do when a tragedy occurs and take much stronger 
action.  We do, but we will always be dealing with the situation 
after the fact, after the tragedy, after the death, unless we deal 
with the first offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must deal with the problem before that offence.  That comes 
with the kind of responsibility which my children and their 
friends started taking for each other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must ensure that we do not pass this off as something light, 
unimportant and socially acceptable.  We must each take the 
responsibility of confronting a friend, however difficult that 
may be, to say “I am sorry, but I will not let you get in your 
car.  I will not drive with you if you insist on getting in your 
car”. 
That is the kind of responsibility we all have to take. That is 
why the last discussion was very interesting.  It is not 
something that can be solved simply by tougher laws.  We all want 
to prevent these tragedies, not just to punish after they happen. 
We hope we never have to punish. That is why it takes a 
combination of effort at this level, through the Criminal Code, 
at the provincial level, effort in our own communities and our 
own families.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think there is one of us who does not know someone in 
our family or a friend or someone we work with who is an 
alcoholic.  Every time we turn our backs on that and do not take 
the responsibility of confronting that alcoholism we contribute 
to the tragedies we are talking about today. We also have to take 
responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have to get over a hurdle.  Training judges is a part of 
it.  We used to say we have to educate young people, that if we 
educate young people the problem will go away.  Young people 
learn their drinking habits somewhere.  Young people learn their 
driving habits somewhere.  Educating young people to solve a 
problem we have created is a nice way of getting out of our 
responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One place that I think we have to change attitudes, and I am not 
sure the courts have caught up with public opinion on this yet, 
is maybe a person is not responsible for a decision made while 
drinking but is responsible for the decision to drink.  In my 
view, if that decision is made then automatically the decision is 
made to take responsibility for everything that person does after 
that first drink is taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether it is a case such as we saw in the courts where 
drunkenness was an excuse for raping a 78-year old woman, or 
whether it is a case of saying “I was too drunk to know what I 
was doing when I got into my car and drove”,  I am sorry, but 
that is no longer acceptable. You take that responsibility when 
you take that drink. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a personal responsibility for all of us.  Yes, it is 
changes in the laws and a combined effort of all levels of 
government, continuing and increasing our actions on substance 
and alcohol abuse throughout society, which is the source of most 
of these tragedies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I never thought I would say this, but I am grateful to the 
Reform Party for bringing forward the motion today.  I am anxious 
to see it get into committee where at least the federal 
responsibility can be dealt with and we can also initiate some 
major activity with the provinces, communities and people across 
the country to diminish this tragedy.  I do not think we can ever 
put an end to it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK232"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo—Chilcotin, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the hon. member for the intervention she made 
and the spirit with which she approached this subject. This has 
been a very emotional day for all of us who have been paying 
attention to this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard words such as vengeance, which is not acceptable 
here.  I am inclined to agree with that.  The Bible says 
“Vengeance is mine, says the Lord”. So I do not think we need 
to worry about that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we somehow or other have to draw a line.  I believe 
that in many respects drinking and driving is still acceptable to 
far too many Canadians.  What I am interested in knowing is how 
can we draw the line in such a bold fashion so that people 
realize that drinking and driving is not acceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am aware of a family that lost a young man because his friend 
was driving drunk.  The young man who was driving drunk got 
thrown in jail for manslaughter.  There were two sad families as 
a result of this.  That may be the way has to be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I would like to explore with the hon. member is maybe the 
line in the sand should be that if you drive while drunk you 
loose the privilege to drive forever.  If you drive when drunk 
and kill someone, you have committed a crime like murder.  One of 
the things you loose is your vehicle, which was the weapon used. 
Would the hon. member agree with that as drawing a line in the 
sand?  People may then understand that drinking is not 
acceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Marlene Catterall:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I guess the theme of 
my speech was that the line in sand has to be drawn much sooner 
and much earlier in the process which eventually leads somebody 
to kill on the highway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Somebody knew that the young person the hon. member was talking 
about was drinking and driving and did not do anything about it. 
What we have suggested is that the whole issue be referred to a 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A tremendous amount of research has been done to look at the 
views of the experts as well as people who have been victims, 
people who have been involved in this and people in the justice 
system to find the most effective way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member and I both want the same thing, what is going to work 
most effectively.  I hope he will forgive me if I do not jump to 
conclusions about what I hope will be the excellent results of 
the review by the justice committee on this issue and a very good 
package of recommendations to us. 
<P><A NAME="LINK233"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
member for Ottawa West—Nepean raised some personal experiences 
and I think we all have them.  Every member who has risen in the 
House today has related some tragedy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know she talked about things improving, although I sometimes 
wonder.  In my riding I had a family that had a very tragic 
experience.  It involved a woman by the name of Joanne Perrotta. 
Both her brother and father were severe alcoholics.  Her brother 
after a heavy night of drinking went out and ran into a transport 
truck in 1989 and was killed.  Then Joanne, who was a 
non-drinker, was working late one night.  On her way home she was 
broadsided by a drunk driver and was killed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next year her father was driving drunk, as he had done 
several times, ran over a motorcycle driver and killed him.  This 
tragedy kept going on and on in that family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know there is a public education aspect that is very 
important.  I wonder if the member would agree that a tough 
deterrent for those people who are hardcore is actually a good 
method of trying to solve this problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Marlene Catterall:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member has 
precisely made my point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have to deal with is that alcoholism is the root cause 
of most of these tragedies.  We have to deal with that.  Somebody 
who is an alcoholic is not going to be deterred at that moment by 
knowing that he may spend three or six months in jail or loose 
his license.  This just is not going to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to deal with the alcoholism.  That person should not be 
allowed to drive until they have been sober for a period of time 
where one can say this person is a recovering alcoholic.  The 
point also is that there are probably several hundreds of people 
who knew those drivers, who knew that they regularly drove drunk 
and did nothing about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  It is my duty, 
pursuant to Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the 
question to be raised tonight at the time of adjournment is as 
follows: the hon. member for Waterloo—Wellington, Agriculture.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is a pleasure to speak on this motion which has to do with a much 
broader issue and which I know all members are very sensitive to. 
Indeed the issue of alcohol and its impacts and pervasiveness on 
our society is one of the most serious issues that a Parliament 
could face. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion before the House basically asks parliamentarians to 
request a House committee to review the issues related to 
deterrence and propriety of penalties with regard to impaired 
driving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of drunk driving has been with us for so long.  We 
have heard the statistics over and over again, to the extent that 
I believe the public and parliamentarians have become 
desensitized to the seriousness of the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to share with the House and all hon. members some 
of the statistics to do with the misuse of alcohol.  Over 19,000 
deaths per year; 45% of all motor vehicle collisions; 30% of 
fires; 30% of suicides; 60% of homicides; 50% of family violence; 
65% of snowmobile collisions; one in six family breakdowns; 30% 
of drownings; 5% of birth defects; 65% of child abuse; 40% of 
falls causing injury; 50% of hospital emergencies.  There is over 
$15 billion of additional health care, social programs, criminal 
justice and lost productivity costs that all Canadians must pay 
for.  All of these items are directly or indirectly caused by the 
misuse of alcohol. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to pay tribute to Mothers Against Drunk Driving.  This 
organization has had a long history of advocacy with regard to 
alcohol.  One of the founders of MADD, Mr. John Bates, has been a 
very dear friend and supporter of mine in alcohol related issues. 
They were here recently on the Hill.  They have done an 
excellent job.  I believe they are singularly responsible for 
this issue finally getting the attention in the House that it 
deserves.  I congratulate them and thank them for doing a job 
very well on behalf of all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a simple issue.  One thing is clear and everyone 
should understand that it is impossible to conceive how anyone 
could vote against this motion before the House today.  Canadians 
should always expect their parliamentarians to determine and 
review to make sure that the very best job has been done with 
regard to deterrence against behaviour such as drunk driving. 
Canadians should also expect that the penalties associated with 
criminal offences are updated and appropriately put in place. 
That is what they expect of us.  This motion does nothing more 
than simply ask parliamentarians to ask the justice committee to 
do that review and as appropriate to come back to this House with 
a bill to make any appropriate changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I certainly will be supporting this motion.  I believe it 
transcends politics and the partisanship of politics.  I believe 
and I hope that all parliamentarians will support unanimously 
this motion so that we can commence the process on dealing with a 
broader range of alcohol related problems in Canada.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I went through a list of direct or indirect consequences of 
alcohol misuse. I want to comment a little further on some 
others. In statistics I received from the Canadian Centre on 
Substance Abuse in its 1995 report, there are some 19,000 deaths 
per year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things I found astounding was an incident where a 
person who was impaired while driving a motor vehicle killed an 
innocent pedestrian.  The pedestrian's loss of life was 
attributed to trauma, not to alcohol.  When I see statistics 
dealing with alcohol, we have to ask questions about the 
dimensions:  Are there directs and indirects included these 
numbers?  I believe the numbers are far worse than anybody is 
prepared to publish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Think of things like family violence.  About a year ago there 
was a special conference on Parliament Hill co-sponsored by 
Health Canada, the equivalent agency in the United States and the 
National Action Committee on the Status of Women.  The cost of 
spousal abuse and domestic violence in Canada was estimated to be 
$2.1 billion. Imagine the opportunity and the dimensions here and 
what we could do if we could get a handle on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe domestic violence is in much the same boat as drinking 
and driving in that we have become desensitized.  This is 100% 
preventable.  It is totally irresponsible and totally against the 
family and Canadian values that we hold so dear, yet we do not do 
anything about it.  We tolerate it for who knows what reason, but 
it must stop.  We can do better.  We must do better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One in six family breakdowns are due to alcohol misuse.  Has 
anyone ever considered how pervasive the impacts of family 
breakdowns are?  After the Vanier Institute said that the divorce 
rate was up to 50%, Statistics Canada said no, it is really only 
at 33%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things they all forgot about was the fact that over a 
million relationships in Canada are common law and totally escape 
the statistical analysis.  Seventy-five per cent of common law 
relationships break down within the first five years.  Of all 
those relationships, 60% of them involve children.  The real 
victims of family breakdown are the children. Yet if we look at 
the statistics, one in six of those are directly due to alcohol. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Birth defects.  Fetal alcohol syndrome accounts for about 5% of 
the birth defects.  It costs Canada about $1.2 billion a year to 
deal with the additional health care, special needs and social 
costs associated with fetal alcohol syndrome. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Canadians want a tax break, we could easily fund a tax break 
by dealing with some of these problems.  We cannot have it both 
ways.  We cannot be irresponsible in our actions and be spending 
billions of dollars for our carelessness and our irresponsibility 
and at the same time expect that we can do other things as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have ways of ensuring that good things happen in Canada but 
we have to find new ways.  We have to set a new urgency for all 
Canadians that we will not be desensitized any more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to addressing the issue specifically raised in the 
motion, there were two other items.  One is health warning labels 
on the containers of alcoholic beverages. Alcoholic beverages are 
the only consumer product in Canada that can hurt you if misused 
but which do not warn the consumer of that fact.  Pills warn you 
not to drink when you take the pills, but the drink does not warn 
you not to take pills when you drink.  It makes no sense. 
We have a bill before the House.  Hopefully, we will get support.

friend, family member or acquaintance who is drinking and 
becoming at risk of hurting themselves and others, you should 
intervene in an appropriate fashion to make sure that they do not 
become just another tragic statistic.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, drinking 
and driving is a very serious problem.  It is a problem that 
causes a lot of hardship for families.  It causes financial 
hardships.  It causes hardships for our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to relate a story that was related to me and which 
I think puts this issue very much in perspective.  I was told 
that a young man left home one evening and he had been drinking. 
He was in an accident and two people were killed.  After he came 
out of the coma, the people had to tell him that the two people 
who had been killed that terrible evening were his parents.  When 
I was told this, it really gave me shivers and I sensed what this 
problem was really all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do support Mothers Against Drunk Driving and I support this 
motion.  I thank the member for putting it forth.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, during question period today the health minister in 
reply to a question from the opposition said that Canada has one 
of the toughest anti-tobacco laws in the world.  He also 
mentioned that this government, Health Canada, was planning on 
spending $100 million on tobacco control in the next few years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tobacco never killed people on the highway.  Tobacco never broke 
up families.  Tobacco never led to beatings.  Yet the government, 
and governments traditionally, not just the current Liberal 
government but the government before it, Health Canada, has a 
whole division and countless employees focused on tobacco. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the member for Mississauga South would give his 
feelings with respect to why Health Canada does not invest at 
least an equivalent amount of money on alcohol control.  Why do 
we not have a tough alcohol law? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I cannot speak for the 
Minister of Health or Health Canada, but I do believe that the 
member raises a good point.  It is up to all parliamentarians to 
define the priorities for our government to consider.  This 
motion has raised this issue to the level where it will get the 
attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we need to do is to demonstrate that we are no longer 
desensitized to the problem and that we are prepared to advance 
this as a starting point with regard to impaired driving, and 
also with regard to the broader range of impacts associated with 
the misuse of alcohol because of its pervasiveness and the severe 
impact it has on all Canadians. 
<P><A NAME="LINK237"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo—Chilcotin, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, there is an attitude among Canadians that drinking is 
okay.  Most people do not get caught and when something like this 
happens, well it is too bad it happened to them.  It is always 
thee and thee but never me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the Reform Party have a fairly hard line about 
consequences for drinking and driving.  I would like to have some 
of my Liberal colleagues come out and say what they think it 
would take to stop people from drinking and driving, to change 
the attitude. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can give all the education courses in the world, but if 
somebody wants to drink, he is going to do it.  How are we going 
to deter that person?  I have suggested taking their licence away 
for life if they drink.  What about taking their vehicle away so 
they cannot have a vehicle? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one really wants to have the courage to say this is what 
needs to be done.  The committee needs something on record from 
this debate about some of the alternatives to what is happening 
now to prevent those people from getting behind the wheel and 
driving when they are drunk.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I understand the frustration 
of the member.  We all do, because we have provincial 
jurisdictions that are responsible for the application of the 
laws. But I believe this is the kind of work that the motion is 
asking the committee to do, to explore these things.  I think he 
is quite right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I would ask all members to be open to preventive 
measures as opposed to dealing in a reactive fashion after the 
problem has occurred.  We cannot say enough about the value of 
public education. We cannot say enough about advocacy groups like 
MADD.  There is a good group out in B.C., the Alcohol-Drug 
Education Service, Mr. Art Steinmann and his group.  They are 
excellent.  They have been working tirelessly in the background. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to work with them and support them to make sure that all 
Canadians express their views and give us the support we need to 
make sure that we have done our job to the extent that we can 
influence deterrence, penalties as well as public education. 
<P><A NAME="LINK238"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise in 
support of this motion.  In many ways I am very moved to be 
speaking on it today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Intoxication should not be an excuse for anything.  It should 
not be an excuse for sexual assault, for death or for murder.  We 
should not be accepting any level of blood alcohol content as an 
excuse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think anyone should be allowed to drink and drive. 
Therefore, my hard line is that we do not have any level that 
anyone can say there is room for error.  You cannot drink and 
then drive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As long as we say drinking is all right, we will be facing the 
tragedy that has happened over the last 30 to 40 years. When 
people drink their decision making is impaired.  It is impaired 
as to whether they decide to drive.  It is impaired as to whether 
they decide to have another drink or another 10 drinks and then 
drive. They should not have any discretion in that area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In deterrence, if we are going to look at preventive measures, 
then we have to have it at all levels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Yukon had a Youth Empowerment and Success Program that was 
cut, I learned today, by the federal government. This dealt with 
the very area in Yukon where there is a large percentage of 
drinking and driving: the youth.  Pulling out this strategy to 
prevent drinking and driving or other drinking related abuses is 
now not available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>National statistics show males between the ages of 25 and 35 are 
the drivers behind the wheels of those vehicles. Therefore, we 
should not allow advertising that glamorizes the drinking 
lifestyle, that everybody is happy as long as they have a bottle 
of beer beside them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to our judicial system I think our judges should 
have discretion.  I would like to say “Yes, let us just take 
away their vehicles and that will solve the problem”, except 
that the rest of the family may depend on that vehicle and 
someone's employment may depend on that vehicle.  Therefore, we 
are causing others to suffer who should not suffer because of an 
individual's decision to drink and drive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our judicial system should have a process for appointing judges. 
If we want discretion we need to know whose discretion and how 
they got into those positions of trust. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to enforcement, we have to know that the RCMP are 
not letting their friends go when they stop them for drinking and 
driving.  We have to know that the RCMP are well enough staffed 
so that at the peak hours when people drink and drive, between 6 
p.m. and 3 a.m., they are there to stop them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My city of Whitehorse has two RCMP on duty through the night. 
That is not adequate to deal with drinking and driving, among the 
other responsibilities that they have to take on.  If we are 
serious about deterrence, we need to be prepared to give the 
resources to the RCMP so that they can deal with drinking and 
driving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I grew up in the Yukon, as a teenager it was still legal to 
drink in public.  It was legal to drink and drive. That was just 
over 20 years ago. 
Public attitude has changed dramatically since that time.  You 
can no longer drink in public and you can no longer drink and 
drive.  But the attitude still is prevalent, as it is elsewhere 
in Canada, that it is all right to drive and to drink.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend my colleague across the floor for describing what it 
took for her to make a stand and not let her friend drink and 
drive.  By doing that in our daily lives we will make changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also believe once someone has transgressed, once they have 
driven drunk more than once, we do not need to give leniency any 
further.  At that point we should take away the vehicle or there 
should be a substantial fine and there should not be available 
legal loopholes to avoid the guilt of what someone has done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will finish with my own story on this issue. In Yukon in the 
early seventies it was a different atmosphere.  I was in a boat 
with my father who had been drinking.  The boat tipped.  After I 
watched my father drown, I swam to shore.  That left my mother, 
who had a part-time job, to raise eight children.  Drinking and 
driving is not a statistic for me. I thought after many years you 
come to grips with trauma of that nature.  It is not easy and it 
does stay with us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am honoured to have the opportunity to speak on this debate. 
It is our chance to make a statement to our fellow Canadians that 
this matter will be taken seriously and we will not allow 
drinking and driving.  If you are going to drink and operate any 
motorized vehicle, you are responsible for your actions.  We will 
hold you responsible but we will also show compassion.  I believe 
that is why we are here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those reasons, I support this motion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK239"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, it was with interest that I listened to the discussion 
and to the gentleman on the opposite side when he gave us details 
of what alcohol cost Canadians each year.  It would seem to me 
that if we threw the stuff away we would get our deficit in order 
in a short period of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not doubt the authenticity of the statistics at all.  I 
believe they are true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What bothers me more than anything else in listening to the 
debate are the words “we must use compassion”.  I am a 
compassionate person but I have had experiences in my life of 
picking up dead children at the scene of an accident, of going to 
homes of teenagers who have been killed.  It is very difficult to 
move toward compassion when you see the person who caused the 
crime, who caused the death, go to the courts and within no time 
at all be out on the street with a minimum fine and a minimum 
restriction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What bothers me is listening to a teenager who has been given an 
alcohol charge saying “I wonder who the judge will be.  I would 
sure like to get that one because he is not as hard”.  It 
reminds me of the cowboys lining up to draw a horse.  They want 
to get an easy horse because an easy horse is easier to ride. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must be more conscious of what we are dealing with here.  The 
people who brought this to our attention came as a lobby group. 
They did not come asking the government for money, as most lobby 
groups do.  They did not come asking for anything but that we 
take an honest look at this national disgrace.  They called it a 
national tragedy.  It is a disgrace and Canadians can no longer 
allow it to go on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When you ask people what they think of our courts, our courts 
are going down this way every day because of the decisions being 
handed out. 
On my way driving in to the House of Commons I heard a report 
about a man who had been bludgeoned to death.  The police picked 
up the perpetrator's trail, followed the blood trail to a house 
and arrested him.  However, it has been thrown out of court 
because the proper procedure for the search was not followed. 
That sort of decision is an example of the decisions which are 
ripping the guts out of Canadians.  The decisions brought down in 
alcohol related incidents are doing exactly the same thing.

has ever come up with a defence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When this motion goes to committee we must listen to what our 
constituents are saying.  Do not worry about the legal part of 
it, first of all we should listen to what our constituents are 
saying.  They will support the resolution which is before us with 
an overwhelming majority and with a great deal of enthusiasm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is fine to say that an accident happened and that it really 
was not the driver's fault because he was not in control of 
himself.  He was in control of himself when he started to drink. 
When he started to drink he was cognizant of the fact that he 
could cause harm to himself and other people. I do not think for 
one moment that Canadians are going to continue to listen to our 
courts using that as an excuse, permitting those who perpetrate a 
crime to walk away free. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was driving in Saskatchewan the other day when the news 
reported that two young ladies had been shot in a service station 
at night.  I used to work in that area.  Then the names were 
reported and it shocked me.  The one person involved with that 
double murder is now walking the streets of Saskatchewan.  The 
people of that town are livid because of the decision of the 
court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The court is saying that people were not really responsible. 
They must have been responsible when they started drinking.  They 
must be responsible for the deeds which they have done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope when we go to committee we do not let bleeding hearts 
take over and not honour the commitment of this motion.  I hope 
we do not put anything in the way of the Canadian public 
receiving justice when it comes to this very serious topic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know very well from my experience that we need a victims' bill 
of rights.  Everybody seems to have rights nowadays.  What about 
victims' rights?  Why are we so afraid of victims' rights?  Why 
are we so afraid of the mother who has lost a three-year-old 
child?  Does she not have any rights? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know more than four people are killed needlessly every day. 
Let us suppose that one MP is killed every day for the next 300 
days.  Just think about it.  Are we more important than our 
constituents?  Not one bit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know this much.  If four of us were killed in a traffic 
accident, if we were clobbered by a drunk driver, and the next 
week if four more of us were killed, we would be very quick in 
this House to come up with something which is a lot stronger and 
a lot more punishing than what the MADD organization is 
proposing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should not place ourselves above our constituents.  Sometimes 
I think we do.  My constituents are important to me.  I know what 
they are thinking about this.  Every newspaper in my constituency 
carried my article in support of MADD.  I received very good 
reports from that article.

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, a special committee should be 
established to study the severe unemployment problem in 
Newfoundland and Labrador. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Madam Speaker, it is no with a great sense of pleasure 
that I arise today to present my private member's motion that the 
House establish a committee to study the chronic unemployment 
problem in Newfoundland and Labrador. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The unemployment rate in Newfoundland is one of the most glaring 
failures of Canadian Confederation.  I am under no illusions 
today that by simply introducing this resolution we will solve 
the unemployment problem in Newfoundland and Labrador, but I have 
to start somewhere.  I promised the good people of St. John's 
east, many of whom are unemployed, that I would bring their 
concerns to the floor of the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every poll that has ever been done in the province of 
Newfoundland and Labrador indicates the one pressing problem that 
has always been on the top of the agenda is unemployment.  As we 
talk about the unemployment problem in Newfoundland and Labrador 
today the Canadian economy is rebounding, but in Newfoundland the 
situation seems to be worse than ever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now in Newfoundland we are losing people at the rate of 
approximately 7,500 per year.  That may not seem to be all that 
serious in the Canadian context, but when we consider a small 
province like Newfoundland and Labrador with a population of only 
a half million people losing 7,500 people per year is very 
serious indeed.  It has a devastating effect upon the collective 
well-being of the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only a few weeks ago I had a meeting on a little island off the 
coast in my riding.  It is not too far from St. John's.  It is a 
small place called Bell Island.  It used to be a great mining 
town from the late 1800s up to 1966 when I believe the mining 
operation closed down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Until recently it had a population of about 10,000 or 12,000 
people.  Now the population has gone down to about 3,500 people. 
I had a meeting with the mayor of that island, Gary Gosine, who 
indicated that he could drive around his town almost on a daily 
basis and point to houses that are empty because people are 
leaving to go elsewhere.  They do not have any jobs there and the 
population of that little area has gone down from 5,200 or 5,300 
people down to 3,500 people in a very short period of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are losing people at the rate of 7,500 per year.  For a 
population of a half million that is devastating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Newfoundland unemployment problem has been studied many 
times. 
When I served in the Newfoundland House of Assembly we set up a 
royal commission to look at the problem.  There were no obvious 
or quick solutions at that time.  Our economy is largely a 
resource based economy.  We depend upon fish, minerals and paper 
products.  It is a resource based and export based economy.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new global economy is a knowledge based economy.  While we 
do have somewhat of a high tech industry in Newfoundland it is a 
very small one.  In spite of that we are to a small extent in the 
business of exporting some of our engineering skills in the 
marine area and in the offshore oil and gas sector.  The growth 
we are experiencing in these sectors is not enough to even 
remotely offset the bleeding that is occurring in Newfoundland 
and Labrador. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two areas of our economy that have been hit very hard over the 
last number of years is the fishery and the public sector.  The 
northern cod fishery is in a very bad way.  About 30,000 
fishermen and plant workers are on TAGS in Newfoundland, the 
Atlantic groundfish strategy as it is known. Most TAGS money has 
been used directly by people to keep bread on the table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the auditor general pointed out only recently in his report, 
the millions of dollars spent on training through TAGS was really 
a waste of time, a waste of energy and worst of all a waste of 
money.  Most people were in a holding pattern.  They were waiting 
for cod to come and therefore were not all that interested in 
moving on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many fisher people, especially the older generation of 
fishermen, got involved in the fishery back 25, 30 or 35 years 
ago.  They had limited formal education. When TAGS came out they 
found themselves in the position of probably having to get a high 
school education before they could move on to the various 
technical schools they were expected to become involved in and 
enrolled in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have always said it is bureaucratic insanity to expect people 
with limited education who have been on fishing boats for 25 or 
30 years to suddenly upgrade to a high school education, get into 
a technical institute and sit down in front of a computer.  For 
what purpose?  I do not know.  A lot of the money spent on 
various training programs, we have to agree with the auditor 
general, fishermen and other people, was a waste of money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of these people have been waiting for the fishery to 
rebound but it has not rebounded.  The reality today is that the 
federal TAGS program is about expire.  The vast majority of the 
people on TAGS are at a loss what to do next.  They have hung on 
but it seems now that they will be hung out to dry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Politicians in the House have shouted across the floor that TAGS 
was a mistake and should have ended sooner than later.  I agree 
the TAGS could have been a much better program.  It could have 
encouraged people to leave the industry through licence buyout 
and early retirement programs.  Training money should have been 
directed to people who were either young enough or enthusiastic 
enough to want to go ahead with a career change.  It could have 
encouraged people to leave the industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most of all I keep saying the federal government could have been 
brutally honest with people and not given them an indication that 
their future prospects in the fishery were good. 
Instead, we are faced with thousands and thousands of people 
whose incomes will soon be cut off, who have not returned to the 
fishery, who have not retrained for this new economy that we are 
into, who cannot afford to move away to find work and whose 
immediate prospects happen to be welfare.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I get hundreds of people coming through my constituency office 
in St. John's on a weekly basis.  My mind goes back to the Prime 
Minister at his town hall meeting where he was talking to an 
unemployed woman looking for a job.  The Prime Minister, in a 
cavalier way, said “Well, maybe you can move on to another part 
of our country”.  At the same time, while the Prime Minister was 
making that kind of a submission to that woman, he had terminated 
the mobility assistance program. These people, already facing 
unemployment, are now also faced with having to stay where they 
are because they do not have the money to move on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The public sector plays a very important role in the 
Newfoundland economy, a much bigger role than it should play 
probably.  Federal transfers for equalization in health and 
education make up about half of our provincial budgets.  We do 
have our share of equalization payments.  The unemployment 
insurance system provides income to large numbers of seasonal 
workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the federal government decided a while ago to get its 
fiscal house in order, it was devastating for the Newfoundland 
economy because the federal transfers to the provincial 
government went down hill drastically and, of course, the 
provincial government started to make its cuts to make up for the 
federal government's transfers going down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provincial government then passed the cuts on to the various 
municipalities as well who in turn made all kinds of cuts which 
again had a devastating effect on the economy.  The lay-offs at 
all levels of the public sector not only reduced the services, 
they also flooded the job market with some of the best and most 
well-educated people we had. That is why the Liberal Party is 
doing so poorly in Atlantic Canada.  It has not really got into 
showing the people of Atlantic Canada that it cares about the 
unemployment problems that we have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot impose the kinds of dynamics of a central Canadian 
economy or a western Canadian economy on the people in the 
Atlantic region because it makes no sense at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can talk about the problem all day but what are we going to 
do about it?  I want to make a few suggestions, although I stand 
the chance of running afoul of some of the more right wing 
attitudes that are displayed in the House every now and then. 
First, the TAGS program cannot be cut off cold turkey.  That 
cannot be done without a transitional program.  Thirty thousand 
people cannot be thrown on to the streets with nothing to do and 
nowhere to go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need licence buy-outs.  We need training programs that will 
address the real jobs that are out there.  We need a generous 
retirement program.  If these initiatives happen to go beyond 
what might be considered to be normal, well so be it.  Just as 
Quebec is a distinct society in its own way, then Newfoundland, 
when it comes to the kinds of economic circumstances that we have 
to live with, is distinct as well.  The alternative is to do 
nothing and to run the risk of an awful lot of social unrest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Newfoundland, like the other provinces, needs a better deal in 
the equalization program.  We need a better deal in 
Confederation, in particular in equalization.  It keeps us from 
starving but it also keeps us permanently poor as well.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Much has been said about the Voisey's Bay nickel mine in 
Newfoundland.  I have a great deal of confidence that it will be 
a great mining industry when it is fully developed.  It is worth 
billions of dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must never forget, however, that every dollar Newfoundland 
gets in taxes and royalties is subtracted dollar for dollar from 
our equalization entitlements.  To be one dollar better off, we 
must first raise a billion dollars a year in extra revenues just 
to overcome the loss of the equalization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of Hibernia, we had a special management deal 
whereby we would only loose 70¢ in equalization dollars.  This is 
a good start.  We need a better formula than that if we are ever 
going to catch up and go out on our own.  The formula needs to be 
extended to all major resource developments.  On paper we have a 
lot of resources in Newfoundland and Labrador.  Under the current 
arrangement, we will never break free and close the poverty gap. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I realize I am running out of time.  Maybe later on I will have 
a chance to say a few more words.  I appreciate the opportunity 
to say a few words on this. 
<P><A NAME="LINK246"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Robert D. Nault (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, the motion 
we are debating asks the government to spend resources to study 
the employment problem in Newfoundland and Labrador. I want to 
read it again so the people who are watching understand what the 
motion is intended to do. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, a special committee should 
be established to study the severe unemployment problem in 
Newfoundland and Labrador. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to assure the member that the government is aware 
of this very serious issue and recognizes the need for long term 
structural solutions.  I do not think that anybody on this side 
of the House would contest the fact that we need to pay serious 
attention to regional disparity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Historically my party has been the one to most seriously address 
many of the regional problems that the member would have us 
examine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier studies led us to employment insurance reform, the first 
major reform in 25 years.  We knew that we had to have more in 
the way of active support for work.  We knew that we needed to 
invest in people who have invested in themselves.  We knew that 
helping Canadians back to work was the only solution to problems 
of Atlantic Canada and that is what the employment insurance 
reform sets out to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I am in favour of understanding a problem before leaping 
into it, there is a time for study and a time for action. The 
government believes the time for action is now.  We are doing it 
in a partnership with the provincial government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the last 10 years many studies, both comprehensive and 
specific, have examined the unemployment situation in 
Newfoundland and Labrador.  One example, and the member mentioned 
it, a royal commission of the Government of Newfoundland, known 
as the House Commission, looked at the problem in the late 1980s. 
This led to a comprehensive analysis of the province's economic 
position and became the basis of the province's strategic 
economic plan.  That plan is still being put into practice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I want to talk about some of the things we have done to 
make the problem better.  From everything I have seen the people 
in the member's riding are probably more interested in our 
solutions than our ability to talk more about their problems. 
Rather than revisit the whole issue again we want to better use 
our resources to help the people of Newfoundland and Labrador get 
back to work. That is why in 1997-98 the government will invest 
$89 million in active employment measures for Newfoundland and 
Labrador.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we are talking about targeted earning supplements, targeted 
wage subsidies, job creation partnerships, self-employment 
assistance and skills, loans and grants.  But we have also 
learned that it is more important than ever for us to work even 
more closely with the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thanks to the labour market development agreement we signed with 
the province, both levels of government will co-manage the 
programs that will get Newfoundlanders working again.  The 
agreement means made in Newfoundland solutions that are tailored 
to the particular circumstances that characterize the 
Newfoundland economy.  This kind of partnership recognizes that 
each side has something to offer and that no solution is really 
possible unless both levels of government work together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the components of employment insurance reform is working 
especially well.  We have heard a little bit of it in the House, 
but I want to mention it. The program that we launched, called 
the transitional jobs fund, of some $300 million in July 1996, is 
now starting to have an effect in Newfoundland and Labrador. 
That fund works with the private sector and with the provincial 
and municipal governments, as well as with community groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like the labour market development agreement, the fund works 
because it is based on partnership.  As of October 14, that 
transitional jobs fund had provided $26 million to 70 projects in 
Newfoundland and Labrador.  That money leveraged another $85 
million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question that is always asked in this place is, did all that 
money create jobs? You bet it did.  So far, the transitional jobs 
fund has created some 2,016 new jobs in Newfoundland and 
Labrador. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take just one example so we can put it in people terms 
when we talk about the 2,016 people who have found new 
employment because of the transitional jobs fund.  Let us start 
by talking about the Millennium Diagnostic Services.  We have 
helped create 46 permanent full time jobs there.  Some of those 
people probably live in the member's riding.  Millennium is 
setting up a private sector blood testing facility.  This 
facility will provide services to the Canadian Blood Bank 
Corporation and has big export plans.  Even more jobs will 
probably be created in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not talking about make work either.  We are talking about 
medical personnel, lab technicians and support personnel, exactly 
the sort of people that Newfoundland needs in a high tech world. 
Those are well paying jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on because there are a number of different issues we 
could put together, but I do not want to spend a lot of time on 
the success stories.  I want to talk about where we need to go in 
the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other successful program is the Atlantic Canada 
Opportunities Agency.  As of 1996, the agency reported that it 
had created or saved 82,000 full time long term jobs.  The 
premise of the member's motion suggests that the government of 
Canada does not know which way to turn, but the evidence says 
otherwise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 46 people in St. John's who got the new jobs, or what is 
going on with the other 2,016, or the 82,000 that we have saved, 
tell this House that the problem is no longer just finding data, 
the problem is finding jobs.  We are not interested in waiting 
any more.  We have the information we need and we will only 
conduct new studies on specific issues as they arise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, Mr. Eugene Harrigan, the associate head of human 
resources development's Ontario region, will lead a review of the 
impact of the end of the Atlantic groundfish strategy on program 
clients, their communities and provincial finances.  This will 
help the government and our partners to develop forward looking 
solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have programs that are working and we have results. 
Things are happening.  Now that we are working more closely than 
ever with the province, even better things will start to happen.

examples of how real people at real companies are being put back 
to work.  I want to thank those people in the programs who are 
trying to help depressed areas like Newfoundland and Labrador.  I 
want to emphasize that we are on the right track.  People have to 
be patient and give those programs an opportunity to work.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have 
been in the House a short while and I have heard the term study I 
do not know how many times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to read the motion of the hon. member for St. 
John's East which we are debating today: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, a special committee should 
be established to study the severe unemployment problem in 
Newfoundland and Labrador. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Well there is a new idea.  They are talking about studying the 
problem again. Let us look at the history of studies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all we have a regular standing committee which looks 
into the issues of the fisheries.  The Government of Newfoundland 
has just completed an analysis of the TAGS program and the 
problems in Newfoundland.  We have the government across the way 
which says that studies are not the way to go but indeed it has 
hired Eugene Harrigan to go ahead and study TAGS when the auditor 
general has already put out a study on TAGS.  Those are four 
studies I count so far. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not hear the Tories apologizing for NCARP, the northern 
cod adjustment and recovery program.  They do not apologize for 
that at all.  Indeed they had a little bit of a tag team going. 
They had John Crosbie and they had curly, their current leader, 
doing a tag team on it.  Curly was the environment minister and 
he ignored the scientific studies that came out indicating that 
the fish stocks were depleting and did not do anything about it. 
John Crosbie knew at the time— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I think that certain respect has to be shown to people who are 
being addressed in the House.  I believe that would only be fair 
and I would ask you to rule on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I assume that the hon. member for 
Calgary West in his remarks is referring to the hon. member for 
Sherbrooke.  If so, I think he would want to refer to him as the 
hon. member for Sherbrooke rather than by some other 
nomenclature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders:</B>  Mr. Speaker, as I was saying, the leader 
of the fifth party was in a tag team with John Crosbie to hide 
the fiasco that was the Atlantic fisheries when there was 
overfishing.  The Tories were more than willing to pull the wool 
over their own eyes and over the eyes of Atlantic Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Crosbie at the time knew that if the fishing continued, 
there indeed would be overfishing in the Atlantic fisheries, but 
he knew it would cost him his seat.  It would cost him votes in 
Atlantic Canada so they let it happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The leader of the fifth party—and some call him curly—went 
ahead and ignored that.  They worked in tandem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then the Department of Fisheries and Oceans made recommendations 
which were ignored.  That is another study. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Add it all up.  There has been study after study after study. 
Indeed I will say that both the Tory and Liberal governments know 
how to do studies, of that I am convinced.  I have no problem 
saying that.  However, I believe that the people of Atlantic 
Canada are getting tired of studies.  They have been studied to 
death.  They have had all the studies they need to have.  They 
are looking for a few solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at what some of the retiring politicians of Atlantic 
Canada have had to say with regard to a solution for the problem, 
rather than studying it again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the issue of taxes.  Atlantic Canada, including 
Newfoundland where the Tory member is from, has taxes above and 
beyond that of the rest of the provinces in this country. One has 
to wonder whether or not the taxes are so high because they go to 
pay for the highest salary for a premier in this country. That is 
right.  Brian Tobin draws in $150,000 a year.  He is the highest 
paid premier in the country and the people in Newfoundland pay 
the highest taxes in the country.  One has to wonder whether 
there is a correlation, especially when they are paying him a 
pension of $3.4 million as he sits as the premier of 
Newfoundland. 
Maybe that is where some of the taxes are going.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at what Frank McKenna, a good Liberal, had to say 
about this.  On his retirement from politics he said to cut 
taxes. The federal government has been squandering money in 
Atlantic Canada for years. Why not save the money that it is 
squandering in terms of all these different types of programs 
because they do not seem to be lowering the unemployment rate. It 
has not worked over the last two decades. Why not give Atlantic 
Canadians lower taxes?  That might actually create growth and 
stimulate jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a matter of fact there is another study that can be tossed 
onto the other ones that the Tories would like to initiate.  This 
is one by University of Moncton Professors Donald Savoie and 
Maurice Beaudin who were looking at the Atlantic Canada 
Opportunities Agency.  They concluded that unemployment insurance 
had killed the entrepreneurial spirit in Atlantic Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again I am afraid that I have to point to the previous Tory 
record on this. It was under their government that people could 
work for 10 weeks and collect 42 weeks of benefits in 
Newfoundland.  To have that as a government policy and assume it 
is not going to kill the entrepreneurial drive is foolish. 
However it was the Tory policy that wiped out the entrepreneurial 
spirit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we also saw what happened with the Liberals across the way 
and the Atlantic groundfish strategy.  They assumed that by 
subsidizing people to continue fishing or to take them away from 
fishing when there were too many fishers with the technology that 
was in the marketplace at the time, that it would somehow solve 
the problem.  Well no it did not solve the problem of overfishing 
because a lot of those people still have not had their licenses 
retired.  Now we are back to square one.  It is tweedledum and 
tweedledee.  The Tory or Liberal solution, there is none. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can also look at what the Canadian Federation of Independent 
Business has said about the region.  Peter O'Brien, the Atlantic 
Canada director, along with the premier of New Brunswick, Frank 
McKenna— 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a question of privilege. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the hon. member should stop blaming the past and help 
us find constructive ways for the people of Newfoundland. That is 
the point I wanted to make, Mr. Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am sorry, but I do not believe this is 
a question of privilege or a point of order.  It is a point of 
debate. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is so like the Tories 
to have caused the problem, to have started the fire and when 
they start to feel the heat of it what do they do?  They say that 
it is a point of privilege and not a matter of debate.  Well the 
world's smallest violin gets played for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The premier of New Brunswick, Frank McKenna said the federal 
government should stop giving grants to Atlantic Canadian 
businesses and use the savings to stimulate businesses in the 
region with lower tax rates.  Sounds pretty logical to me. If I 
were operating a business in Atlantic Canada and I was taxed at 
the highest tax rates in the country, I would certainly consider 
moving if I could, because what is the point of keeping a 
business in an area where I would be taxed to death. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Both of those parties are complicit, indeed they are.  Let us 
look at some of the taxes that these two wonderful governments, 
the Tory government and the Liberal government, have brought to 
the people of Atlantic Canada.  Right now the federal government 
and its finance minister are more than happy to brag about the 
overpayment of taxes in terms of employment insurance.  Right now 
there is a surplus of about $15 billion that they have sucked out 
of the Canadian economy and they brag that the budget has been 
balanced. It has been done on the backs of those people who are 
not getting work because of the high employment insurance tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again the Canadian Federation of Independent Business has 
called for a 25% cut in the EI premiums because it would create 
more jobs.  Even Department of Finance studies indicate that high 
payroll taxes cut and restrict the number of jobs.  But no, we do 
not hear those solutions coming from the Tories.  Instead they 
try to say that the hon. member should be quiet and not mention 
their past blemished record.  They did not have solutions then 
and they do not have solutions now.  All they can propose is a 
study. 
Unfortunately a study is not going to cut it.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we look at something else that is coming down the pipe and 
it is payroll taxes once again, the Canada pension plan.  The 
government is going to suck out $11 billion and it is proud to do 
it with a 9.9% roughly 10% tax.  It thinks that somehow that is 
going to create jobs in Atlantic Canada. Surprise, surprise. 
Once again it is a failed government program that is not going to 
create jobs in Atlantic Canada.  More taxes do not create jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of the day when we look through all of this, what do 
we have here?  We have Tories who with their ministers in their 
previous government ignored environmental studies.  We have 
people who kept taxes high. We have people who sucked off 
multimillion dollar pensions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we look across the way hoping for another solution and we 
look to the Liberals. There we have the harmonized sales tax. 
They thought that by raising value added taxes it would be a 
benefit.  They kept EI premiums high by taking out $15 billion 
more than they should have and they thought that would do good. 
Then they raised the Canada pension plan and they are going to be 
taking $11 billion out on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have these two parties both proposing studies and raising 
taxes when they were in power.  The Tories want a special study, 
a special committee to look at it and the Liberals have hired 
Eugene Harrigan to look after the problem that they created with 
the Atlantic groundfish strategy.  Once again both of them are 
proposing more, new and expensive studies, both of them are 
raising and keeping taxes high and they expect that somehow the 
problem is going to be looked after.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les 
Basques, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, congratulations for properly identifying 
my riding, which comprises four regional county municipalities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am happy to rise to speak to the motion of the member for 
St. John's East, which provides: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, a special committee 
should be established to study the severe unemployment problem 
in Newfoundland and Labrador. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we can see what the hon. member is trying to o, which 
is to draw the attention of the House to the unemployment problems 
in his region. This is fully justified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we take a closer look, we might ask ourselves whether the 
unemployment problem in Canada is not much greater than that.  When 
we look at eastern Quebec—particularly the Lower St. Lawrence and the 
Gaspé, which are of concern to me—all of New Brunswick, Nova 
Scotia, and not only issues of areas but of categories, such as 
young people or older workers aged 50 or 55, who are affected by 
technological change in business, we realize it is perhaps not a 
special committee on employment that we need in Canada, but a 
national priority on the part of the Canadian government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard over and over again about the need to reduce the deficit 
for four years, and everyone agreed that this was true. Now, the number 
one problem in Canada is unemployment. We have this situation where 
there are no jobs for unemployed workers, either because they do not 
meet job requirements or because there are simply too few jobs to go 
around because, in our society, productivity gains often end up in the 
pockets of the very wealthy and seldom in the hands of people who could 
use this money to create employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am inclined to say that the good will displayed by the hon. 
member needs to be spread around. The unemployment situation in Canada 
is not the result of natural law. It must be remembered that, in the 
late 19th century, the Atlantic region was an autonomous region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it the result of power struggles then? I think so. 
Just think of how Canada was built. Twenty-five or 30 years ago, there 
was a very clear understanding in Canada. Ontario was to be developed to 
be the home of the manufacturing industry and related jobs. As for the 
people in the maritimes and Quebec, who supplied the natural resources, 
since they could not be given jobs year round for lack of an appropriate 
regional diversification policy, they were given transfer payments. This 
worked pretty well until the tap was turned off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Things are topsy turvey in this country. Instead of diversifying 
economic activities in the regions that depended on natural resources 
and then imposing stricter standards, if necessary, it was decided to 
impose stricter standards and not to diversify the regional economy.

<A HREF="#LINKT95"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This led to the results that we know. We are on the verge of a 
social disaster. There are people in our ridings who do not have the 
proper training for the available jobs, who are looking for work, and 
who are unhappy. They can no longer work enough weeks to qualify for 
employment insurance benefits to last until their next job. They have to 
go through the spring gap, a period of 10 or 15 weeks without any 
income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What can we do to correct this situation? First, there must be a 
clear and specific political commitment on the part of the federal 
government to the effect that it will indeed make the fight against 
unemployment a priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recommendations are being made in that regard. Let us not forget 
that two weeks ago the human resources development committee of this 
House passed a resolution to say to the finance committee and the 
Minister of Finance that employment and employment insurance must be 
given priority in the next budget. A majority of opposition members 
prevailed, so that the human resources development committee will have 
to convey this message to the finance committee. This step must lead to 
concrete measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, the proposal before us today is not a votable item. 
I would like to see many more motions on which members could vote. 
We could have amended it, based on the human resources committee's 
recommendation, and arranged to have Parliament require the federal 
government's priority for the coming year, when it concocts its 
budget, to be the reduction of unemployment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that choice were made, if that were put on the table, it 
would automatically result in the need to develop policies to 
diversify our regional economies.  It would mean that, since 
priority was being given to employment throughout Canada, there 
would be a way of seeing that forestry workers who no longer had 
work in the forests could find jobs in wood processing.  We should 
have programs to help companies develop these new products that can 
be sold on the American and European markets, and elsewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means that, in the dairy sector, we could place greater 
emphasis on exporting our milk, creating new products and 
developing specialty niches. 
It means that, in the tourism sector, we could overhaul the program 
the federal government has just created. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has just created a $500 million fund to help major tourist 
centres compete better internationally.  This is very interesting 
where centres already exist, such as at Mont-Tremblant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member representing a region where the tourism industry 
is still growing, where there are not necessarily any existing 
infrastructures, I can tell you that what we need are more flexible 
programs that will meet these regions' needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the federal government gave priority to jobs, a motion like this 
one today would not be necessary because that is what would be required 
on a government-wide basis. This would mean that when the government's 
procurement policies are developed, there would be an assessment to 
ensure that the impacts are desirable, sufficient and in keeping with 
the taxes paid by each region of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tomorrow morning, if we did a profile on that, if we went around 
the national capital, around Ontario, we would see that they are not 
doing too badly when it comes to having their share of these programs. 
If you come in our area, try to have one of your small or medium size 
firms register with the computerized bidding system and see if it will 
succeed in obtaining a contract from the Department of National Defence. 
It is quite an experience because, often, there are already many 
contracts, many people who have been tendering for two, three, ten, 
twenty or thirty years. It is the person who will get the contract who 
ends up drafting the call for tenders. 
It is much easier, in such cases, to get the contract. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is actions such as these, in all areas, that the government 
should be promoting. For that to happen , there must be a commitment 
from the Prime Minister, from the government, saying that yes, our 
priority will be the fight against unemployment; yes, in ten years, we 
will assess Quebeckers, Canadians, and we will see where we are at that 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must evaluate how we are utilizing our human resources as 
quickly as possible during this mandate. Are we making full use of the 
potential our young people have to offer? Are we making full use of the 
potential of people in their thirties who can only rely on one contract 
at a time? This is another aspect of the unemployment issue. We must 
also look at how other types of income can be provided to people who do 
not now have sufficient annual income from their jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two weeks ago, we learned that the number of self-employed workers 
was increasing dramatically in Quebec and in Canada. More and more 
people are creating their own jobs, they do not have an employer, and 
they are not eligible for employment insurance. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1805"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT96"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why can we not innovate and allow these people to become eligible? 
In this way, they would have a chance to continue working in these 
areas, to develop their entrepreneurial skills and also to benefit a 
little from a social security net that would protect them from a lack of 
jobs or a lack of contracts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion was tabled in a good faith and deals with a problem 
found in the regions that the member mentions. But this is also a 
problem that exists thoughout Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to add that people from western Canada should refrain 
from passing judgment on how people from eastern Canada or elsewhere did 
things. 
What we are doing today could be done to look at all kinds of ways. 
The grain transportation subsidies, which existed for some years in 
the west, could be looked at for instance.  I do not think they 
should judge.  What needs to be looked at instead is how to ensure 
that each government, as long as we are still part of the system, 
has a proper mastery of its tools, how we could have a government 
machine that responds more quickly to requests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude with this point. As long as the federal 
government brings in such things as the youth strategy, which 
parallels similar programs already in place in a province, and 
forces young entrepreneurs to go knocking on two separate doors for 
a solution to their problems, we are not on the right track. The 
right track, and this is perfectly clear, requires areas of 
jurisdiction to be clear, economic markets to be wide open, and we 
must show confidence in the potential of the people in our regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ottawa is not where the solutions to unemployment lie, they 
are in each of the regions of Quebec and of Canada.  People must be 
able to lay these solutions out on the table and have them heard, 
they must be made a priority, and we must be assessed according to 
the way we respond to that priority.  This is the challenge we 
are giving to the present government.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie—Bathurst, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
speaking today in support of Motion No. 177, which states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, a special committee 
should be established to study the severe unemployment problem 
in Newfoundland and Labrador. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, I would add New Brunswick, Quebec, Nova 
Scotia, and, going even further afield, British  Columbia, on the 
Pacific coast, with all its fisheries problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I proceed with my speech, I would like to make a few 
comments to my colleague in the Reform Party.  He spoke about Frank 
McKenna and said we should listen to what Frank McKenna has said. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will say this in his language to make sure he will not have to 
get the translation.  For the 10 years Frank McKenna was in power 
in New Brunswick I never once heard him say that he did not need 
any programs.  However, on the same week that he took his 
resignation he said he did not need those programs and now we 
have to break the tax.  Maybe this was because he wanted the 
support of the Reform Party out west if he were ever to become 
the prime minister of the country.  I can tell the House he never 
said that when he was in power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about the reduction of taxes to health and how much 
the government is spending, the Reform Party is in the wrong 
place.  If Reformers want to save money for the country, they 
should follow what their leader did before the election when he 
said he would not move into Stornoway or use a limousine.  Now 
they are using taxpayers' money to live at Stornoway.  As if 
Stornoway was not good enough, it needed over $100,000 for 
repairs. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly, unemployment rates in Newfoundland and Labrador have 
reached critical levels, despite the government's promises to 
invest in manpower training and economic restructuring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like the Conservatives before them, the Liberals cut social 
services and deregulated industry.  The result?  The rich get 
richer, but the ordinary folks continue to suffer. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals were elected on a promise of hope.  Instead they 
embraced the idea that we could no longer afford the things we 
value as Canadians.  Unemployment and the economic insecurity 
that goes with it are facts of life that we have to accept. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Accepting the insecurity that goes along with unemployment is 
out of the question.  Never will the NDP support the Liberal view, 
which ignores human suffering.  Never will the NDP say that nothing 
more can be done for the workers in this country.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently, in his first speech in the Atlantic region since the 
election that saw the number of Liberal seats there drop from 31 to 
11, the Prime Minister had the nerve to say that cuts were 
inevitable and that people in the Atlantic provinces were going to 
thank him.  For what? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I doubt that the thousands of unemployed are ready to thank 
the Prime Minister for the cuts that have plunged them into 
terrible poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his speech, the Prime Minister also admitted that the 
Atlantic provinces had suffered the most from federal cuts.  He 
said that, because we depended more on the federal government than 
other regions in the country, we had naturally, yes naturally, been 
at a disadvantage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When is this government going to wake up and realize that 
entire communities are suffering because of the Liberals' failure 
to act?  The problems in Newfoundland are problems that can also be 
found in my region of New Brunswick.  People want to work but 
cannot find employment because the region's economy has not 
recovered from the fisheries crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The TAGS program was supposed to eliminate this problem and 
make it possible to reinvest in manpower, to support communities 
financially, in order to diversify the economy and alleviate 
suffering.  But, as with everything the Liberals have undertaken, 
it was just a knee-jerk reaction lacking long term vision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This program was so badly managed that cheques were 
distributed to people who had been dead for some time. 
If a private company had been run like this, it would have gone 
belly up in no time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now the government comes to us and says “Sorry folks, but we 
have run out of money, and we have to close down the program”.  Can 
a government give this kind of answer when these people have paid 
taxes for years and devoted their energy to the economic 
development of their community, particularly when the crisis they 
find themselves in is again due to the government's mismanagement? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Well, enough is enough.  People do not just want to survive. 
All they are asking is to be able to work and earn a decent living. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The TAGS program did nothing to build on Atlantic Canada's 
strengths; on the fishermen's tenacity, determination and 
expertise; on the fishing culture and heritage; or on the 
community's determination to survive. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As elected representatives, we must offer constructive criticism of 
these types of government programs. We have a duty to tell the Prime 
Minister it is not enough to help his friends the bankers; he must also 
think about ordinary people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What people from the Atlantic region need is a proactive approach 
that takes into account the structural problems of regional economies. 
This is why it is so important to establish a parliamentary committee to 
look at the unemployment crisis. It is the first step toward a proactive 
approach that will identify the region's fundamental problems, thus 
making us aware of the communities' real concerns, instead of applying 
a band-aid solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People in Newfoundland also need short term projects to fill the 
void left by the expiry of TAGS. 
They need an early retirement program for older workers who will 
probably not have an opportunity to re-enter the labour market. This is 
also true for people in New Brunswick, in the Gaspe Peninsula and in 
Nova Scotia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP believes we must tackle the serious issue of unemployment 
right now. It is possible to set up long term job creation policies that 
will ensure decent salaries for families. We believe a full employment 
policy must the government's top priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, job creation remains Canadians' first concern. There 
must be a more balanced approach than the ones proposed by the Liberals, 
the Conservatives and the Reformers. 
These are irresponsible approaches, as they never take into account the 
impact of the policy on small Atlantic communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They always come up with proposals that serve Toronto bankers at 
the expense of fishers in Harbour Grace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another way of acknowledging the suffering of people, 
which is to offer solutions to alleviate it. Newfoundland is not an 
isolated case. We must face the real problems that ail the Atlantic 
region. This government must have the courage to put forward proactive 
measures for the short and the long term. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of Newfoundland deserve to have a courageous government 
that is listening to them. Is this government able to fulfil their needs 
and meet their expectations?

</I></B></P><P align=left>Many people in my riding of West Nova are employed in the

to the EI program have caused a serious and devastating impact on

therefore reduce the dependency on the EI program.  That would be 
very positive for our area.

thank all hon. members for their submissions in this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I reiterate that the unemployment problem in Newfoundland is 
devastating.  The official unemployment rate in Newfoundland is 
higher than anywhere else in Canada.  For a number of years it 
has had a 20% or 21% official unemployment rate.  However, the 
fact of the matter is that an awful lot of communities in 
Newfoundland and Labrador have unemployment rates of 60%, 70% and 
75%.  A number of communities are shutting down all along the 
coast of Newfoundland, which is causing a lot of social unrest 
among people.  This is an issue that has been with us and on the 
agenda for many years.  It just does not go away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate the submission of the government member.  I am well 
aware that half the provincial budget of Newfoundland and 
Labrador comes from federal transfer payment.  We are well aware 
of it and very grateful for it.  I have heard much of the 
rhetoric before, but with respect we need creative solutions to 
this devastating problem.  We have to look at the problem in its 
own right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Calgary West stood a few minutes ago in this 
place and talked about this problem as if it were some kind of

thinks that a 20% unemployment problem in Newfoundland is a joke, 
he had better think again because it is no joke.  The member is a 
joke but this is no joke. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Calgary West has nothing to add to the debate. He 
had the nerve to stand in his place today and say to the people 
of Newfoundland that maybe they should move or that maybe the 
people of Atlantic Canada should go away.

him that.

plays for Atlantic Canada.  What a terrible remark to make to the 
people who are moving away from Newfoundland in droves every 
year.  Some 7,500 people per year are moving out of Newfoundland. 
All we hear from the member for Calgary West of the Reform Party 
is that the smallest violin plays for Atlantic Canada.  What a 
shameful remark.  The hon. member has a red face now, but I think 
when he gets back to his office and he gets a call from his 
leader he will have a much redder face.

problem in Atlantic Canada, but we do not hear any creative

not have a lot of time to talk about it, is to change the 
equalization formula for Newfoundland so that we can take

waiting for Voisey's Bay to be developed.  That industry is worth 
billions and billions of dollars.  We have to realize that we 
will have to give away one dollar in equalization payments for 
every dollar we raise in taxes and royalties.

my riding of Waterloo—Wellington is a mix of urban, rural and

to say, farming is very important to the economic well-being of

farmers have come to rely upon the supply management system to 
ensure the viability of the family farm.

throughout Canada and it is a system which has ensured a 
reasonable rate of return for farmers as a result. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are always those who would strip away the supply 
management system, so it is important for the federal government 
to take a lead role in protecting the interests of farmers by 
protecting the supply management system wherever and whenever

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Harvard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate 
the question of the hon. member for Waterloo—Wellington.  I am 
well aware of his support of his constituents who count on a 
strong supply management system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the government took office in 1993 the negotiations of the 
Uruguay round were just coming to a conclusion.  The issue of how 
to protect supply managed industries was front and centre in 
those negotiation.  We moved quickly and decisively to achieve 
very substantial tariff protection for those industries, 
protection that has allowed supply management to continue 
operating effectively in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We defended our rights to impose those tariffs when the U.S. 
challenged us under NAFTA.  We were successful in that case 
because we all worked together, federal and provincial 
governments and industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are seeking the same kind of collaboration as we prepare for 
the next round of WTO agriculture negotiations.  We are working 
closely with all stakeholders to identify Canada's agrifood trade 
interests. 
We will defend those interests in the Canadian position when the 
negotiations begin in 1999.

the kind of position we propose to develop in time for the 1999 
WTO negotiations.
